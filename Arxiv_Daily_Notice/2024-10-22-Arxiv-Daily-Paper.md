 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for evaluating tensor integrals in the large-scale structure. Decomposing a $\Lambda$CDM-like universe into a finite sum of scaling universes using the FFTLog, we can recast loop integrals for biased tracers in the large-scale structure as certain tensor integrals in quantum field theory. While rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the fixed reference frame in which biased tracers are observed, the tensor structures can still be organized to respect the underlying symmetry. Projecting the loop integrands for scaling universes onto spherical harmonics, the problem effectively reduces to the evaluation of one-dimensional radial integrals, which can be solved analytically. Using this method, we derive analytic expressions for the one-loop power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum for arbitrary multipole moments in the basis of scaling universes.

          Spirals, rings, and vortices shaped by shadows in protoplanetary disks: from radiative hydrodynamical simulations to observable signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous protoplanetary disks exhibit shadows in scattered light observations. These shadows are typically cast by misaligned inner disks and are associated with observable structures in the outer disk such as bright arcs and spirals. Investigating the dynamics of the shadowed outer disk is therefore essential in understanding the formation and evolution of these structures. We carry out twodimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative diffusion and dust-gas dynamics to study the formation of substructure in shadowed disks. We find that spiral arms are launched at the edge of each shadow, permeating the entire disk. The local dissipation of these spirals results in an angular momentum flux, opening multiple gaps and leading to a series of concentric, regularly-spaced rings We find that ring formation is favored in weakly turbulent disks where dust growth is taking place. These conditions are met for typical class-II disks, in which bright rings should form well within a fraction of their lifetime (0.1-0.2 Myr). For hotter disks gap opening is more efficient, such that the gap edges quickly collapse into vortices that can appear as bright arcs in continuum emission before decaying into rings or merging into massive, long-lived structures. Synthetic observations show that these structures should be observable in scattered light and millimeter continuum emission, providing a new way to probe the presence of substructure in protoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that the formation of rings and gaps is a common process in shadowed disks, and can explain the rich radial substructure observed in several protoplanetary disks.

          A search for self-lensing binaries with TESS and constraints on their occurrence rate

 - **Abstract**
 Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with Kepler light curves. They contain white dwarfs (WDs) in AU-scale orbits that gravitationally lens solar-type companions. Forming SLBs likely requires common envelope evolution when the WD progenitor is an AGB star and has a weakly bound envelope. No SLBs have yet been discovered with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which observes far more stars than Kepler did. Identifying self-lensing in TESS data is made challenging by the fact that TESS only observes most stars for $\sim$25 days at a time, so only a single lensing event will be observed for typical SLBs. TESS's smaller aperture also makes it sensitive only to SLBs a factor of $\sim$100 brighter than those to which Kepler is sensitive. We demonstrate that TESS has nevertheless likely already observed $\sim$4 times more detectable SLBs than Kepler. We describe a search for non-repeating self-lensing signals in TESS light curves and present preliminary candidates for which spectroscopic follow-up is ongoing. We calculate the sensitivity of our search with injection and recovery tests on TESS and Kepler light curves. Based on the 5 SLBs discovered with Kepler light curves, we estimate that $(1.1 \pm 0.6)\%$ of solar-type stars are orbited by WDs with periods of 100-1000 d. This implies a space density of AU-scale WD + main sequence (MS) binaries a factor of 20-100 larger than that of astrometrically-identified WD + MS binaries with orbits in Gaia DR3. We conclude that the Gaia sample is still quite incomplete, mainly because WD + MS binaries can only be unambiguously identified as such for high mass ratios.

          Orbits and masses in two triple systems

 - **Abstract**
 In an effort to determine accurate orbital and physical properties of a large number of bright stars, a method was developed to fit simultaneously stellar parameters (masses, luminosities, effective temperatures), distance, and orbits to the available data on multiple systems, namely the combined and differential photometry, positional measurements, radial velocities (RVs), accelerations, etc. The method is applied to a peculiar resolved triple system HIP 86286. The masses of its components estimated using observations and standard relations are 1.3, 0.9, and 0.9 Mmsun; the main star is a G8IV subgiant, while its two companions are main-sequence dwarfs. The inner and outer orbital periods are 35 and 287 years, respectively, and the orbits are nearly coplanar. The second system, HIP 117258, is an accelerating star with a resolved companion; its 35.7-yr orbit based on relative astrometry and precise RVs yields the secondary mass of 0.95 Msun, much larger than inferred from the photometry. The apparent paradox is explained by assuming that the secondary is a close pair of M-type dwarfs with yet unknown period.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles

          Quantifying systematic uncertainties in white dwarf cooling age determinations

 - **Abstract**
 Cooling ages of white dwarfs are routinely determined by mapping effective temperatures and masses to ages using evolutionary models. Typically, the reported uncertainties on cooling ages only consider the error propagation of the uncertainties on the spectroscopically or photometrically determined $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. However, cooling models are themselves uncertain, given their dependence on many poorly constrained inputs. This paper estimates these systematic model uncertainties. We use MESA to generate cooling sequences of $0.5-1.0 M_{\odot}$ hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores under different assumptions regarding the chemical stratification of their core, the thickness of their helium envelope, their hydrogen content, and the conductive opacities employed in the calculations. The parameter space explored is constrained by the range of values predicted by a variety of stellar evolution models and inferred from asteroseismological studies. For a $0.6 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf, we find an uncertainty of 0.03 Gyr at 10,000 K (corresponding to a 5% relative uncertainty) and 0.8 Gyr at 4000 K (9%). This uncertainty is significant, as it is comparable to the age uncertainty obtained by propagating the measurement errors on $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass for a typical white dwarf. We also separately consider the potential impact of $^{22}$Ne shell distillation, which plausibly leads to an additional uncertainty of $\sim 1$ Gyr for crystallized white dwarfs. We provide a table of our simulation results that can be used to evaluate the systematic model uncertainty based on a white dwarf's $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. We encourage its use in all future studies where white dwarf cooling ages are measured.

          The red supergiant progenitor luminosity problem

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of pre-explosion imaging has confirmed red supergiants (RSGs) as the progenitors to Type II-P supernovae (SNe). However, extracting the RSG's luminosity requires assumptions regarding the star's temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction, circumstellar extinction, and possible variability. The robustness of these assumptions is difficult to test, since we cannot go back in time and obtain additional pre-explosion imaging. Here, we perform a simple test using the RSGs in M31, which have been well observed from optical to mid-IR. We ask the following: By treating each star as if we only had single-band photometry and making assumptions typically used in SN progenitor studies, what bolometric luminosity would we infer for each star? How close is this to the bolometric luminosity for that same star inferred from the full optical-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED)? We find common assumptions adopted in progenitor studies systematically underestimate the bolometric luminosity by a factor of 2, typically leading to inferred progenitor masses that are systematically too low. Additionally, we find a much larger spread in luminosity derived from single-filter photometry compared to SED-derived luminosities, indicating uncertainties in progenitor luminosities are also underestimated. When these corrections and larger uncertainties are included in the analysis, even the most luminous known RSGs are not ruled out at the 3$\sigma$ level, indicating there is currently no statistically significant evidence that the most luminous RSGs are missing from the observed sample of II-P progenitors. The proposed correction also alleviates the problem of having progenitors with masses below the expected lower-mass bound for core-collapse.

          PKS 2254+074: A Blazar in Likely Association with the Neutrino Event IceCube-190619A

 - **Abstract**
 We report our study of the field of a $\simeq$0.2 PeV neutrino event IC-190619A. This neutrino belongs to Gold events, which more likely have an astrophysical origin. Among the two $\gamma$-ray sources within the neutrino's positional uncertainty region, we find that one of them, the BL-Lac--type blazar PKS~2254+074, had a $\gamma$-ray flare at the arrival time of the neutrino. The flare is determined to have lasted $\sim$2.5 yr in a 180-day binned light curve, constructed from the data collected with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. Accompanying the flare, optical and mid-infrared brightening is also seen. In addition, $\geq$10 GeV high energy photons from the source have been detected, suggesting a hardening of the emission during the flare. Given both the positional and temporal coincidence of PKS~2254+074 with IC-190619A, we suggest that this blazar is likely another member of a few recently identified (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 There are expected to be millions of isolated black holes in the Galaxy resulting from the death of massive stars. Measuring the abundance and properties of this remnant population would shed light on the end stages of stellar evolution and the evolution paths of black hole systems. Detecting isolated black holes is currently only possible via gravitational microlensing which has so far yielded one definitive detection. The difficulty in finding microlensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events based on characteristics of their lightcurves to allocate expensive and scarce follow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens. Current methods either rely on simple cuts in parameter space without using the full distribution information or are only effective on a small subsets of events. In this paper we present a new lens classification method. The classifier takes in posterior constraints on lightcurve parameters and combines them with a Galactic simulation to estimate the lens class probability. This method is flexible and can be used with any set of microlensing lightcurve parameters making it applicable to large samples of events. We make this classification framework available via the popclass python package. We apply the classifier to $\sim10,000$ microlensing events from the OGLE survey and find $23$ high-probability black hole candidates. Our classifier also suggests that the only known isolated black hole is an observational outlier according to current Galactic models and allocation of astrometric follow-up on this event was a high-risk strategy.

          A Comprehensive Analysis of Insight-HXMT Gamma-Ray Burst Data. I. Power Density Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Power Density Spectrum (PDS) is one of the powerful tools to study light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show the average PDS and individual PDS analysis with {\it Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope} (also named \insighthxmt) GRBs data. The values of power-law index of average PDS ($\alpha_{\bar{P}}$) for long GRBs (LGRBs) vary from 1.58-1.29 (for 100-245, 245-600, and 600-2000 keV). The \insighthxmt\ data allow us to extend the energy of the LGRBs up to 2000 keV, and a relation between $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$ and energy $E$, $\alpha_{\bar{P}}\propto E^{-0.09}$ (8-2000 keV) is obtained. We first systematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDS for short GRBs (SGRBs), and obtain $\alpha_{\bar{P}}\propto E^{-0.07}$ (8-1000 keV), where the values of $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$ vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of power-law index of individual PDS ($\alpha$) of SGRB, is consistent with that of LGRB, and the $\alpha$ value for the dominant timescale group (the bent power-law, BPL) is higher than that for the no-dominant timescale group (the single power-law, PL). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar $\alpha$ and $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$, which indicates that they may be the result of similar stochastic processes. The typical value of dominant timescale $\tau$ for LGRBs and SGRBs is 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that the $\tau$ in proportion to the duration of GRBs $T_{90}$, with a relation $\tau \propto T_{90}^{0.86}$. The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of pulses with different timescales. No periodic and quasi-periodical signal above the 3$\sigma$ significance threshold is found in our sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Double helium white dwarfs (He WDs) are one type of gravitational wave source and are greatly important in the studies of binary interaction, particularly in the common envelope (CE) ejection physics. Most double He WDs with mass ratios of q~1 are formed through a particular channel. In this channel, one He WD is initially produced from a red giant (RG) with a degenerate core via stable Roche lobe overflow, and another He WD is formed from an RG with a degenerate core via CE ejection. They may have significant implications for the binary evolution processes yet have not received specific studies, especially for the CE phase. This paper adopts a semi-analytic method and a detailed stellar evolution simulation to model the formation of double He WDs. We find that most double He WDs show mass ratios being slightly greater than 1, and their orbital periods and mass ratios relation are broadly consistent with observations. There is also a relation between the mass ratios and the progenitors' masses of the He WDs produced via CE ejection for double He WDs with determined WD masses. Based on this relation, the mass of the He WD progenitor can be inferred from the mass ratio. Then, the CE ejection efficiency can be constrained with the orbital period. In addition, we constrain the CE ejection efficiency for two double He WDs, J1005-2249 and WD0957-666. The results show that the CE ejection efficiencies increase with the WD progenitor masses.

          HD 28185 Revisited: An Outer Planet, Instead of a Brown Dwarf, On a Saturn-like Orbit

 - **Abstract**
 As exoplanet surveys reach ever-higher sensitivities and durations, planets analogous to the solar system giant planets are increasingly within reach. HD 28185 is a Sun-like star known to host a $m\sin i=6 M_J$ planet on an Earth-like orbit; more recently, a brown dwarf with a more distant orbit has been claimed. In this work we present a comprehensive reanalysis of the HD 28185 system, based on 22 years of radial velocity observations and precision Hipparcos-Gaia astrometry. We confirm the previous characterisation of HD 28185 b as a temperate giant planet, with its $385.92^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ day orbital period giving it an Earth-like incident flux. In contrast, we substantially revise the parameters of HD 28185 c; with a new mass of $m=6.0\pm0.6 M_J$ we reclassify this companion as a super-jovian planet. HD 28185 c has an orbital period of $24.9^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ years, a semi-major axis of $8.50^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$ AU, and a modest eccentricity of $0.15\pm0.04$, resulting in one of the most Saturn-like orbits of any known exoplanet. HD 28185 c lies at the current intersection of detection limits for RVs and direct imaging, and highlights how the discovery of giant planets at $\approx$10 AU separations is becoming increasingly routine.

          Generalized rotation curves of the Milky Way from the GAIA DR3 data-set: constraints on mass models

 - **Abstract**
 The circular velocity curve traced by stars provides a direct means of investigating the potential and mass distribution of the Milky Way. Recent measurements of the Galaxy's rotation curve have revealed a significant decrease in velocity for galactic radii larger than approximately 15 kpc. While these determinations have primarily focused on the Galactic plane, the Gaia DR3 data also offer information about off-plane velocity components. By assuming the Milky Way is in a state of Jeans equilibrium, we derived the generalized rotation curve for radial distances spanning from 8.5 kpc to 25 kpc and vertical heights ranging from -2 kpc to 2 kpc. These measurements were employed to constrain the matter distribution using two distinct mass models. The first is the canonical NFW halo model, while the second, the dark matter disk (DMD) model, posits that dark matter is confined to the Galactic plane and follows the distribution of neutral hydrogen. The best-fitting NFW model yields a virial mass of $M_{\text{vir}} = (6.5 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{11} M_\odot$, whereas the DMD model indicates a total mass of $M_{\text{DMD}} = (1.7 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{11} M_\odot$. Our findings indicate that the DMD model generally shows a better fit to both the on-plane and off-plane behaviors at large radial distances of the generalized rotation curves when compared to the NFW model. We emphasize that studying the generalized rotation curves at different vertical heights has the potential to provide better constraints on the geometrical properties of the dark matter distribution.

          Spectral evolution of hot hybrid white dwarfs I. Spectral analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen-rich white dwarfs (WDs) comprise the majority of the WD population, but are only rarely found at the very hot end of the WD cooling sequence. A small subgroup that exhibits both hydrogen and helium lines in their spectra, the so-called hybrid (or DAO) WDs, represents the majority of hydrogen-rich WDs at effective temperatures $T_{eff}$ $\approx$ 100 kK. We aim to understand the spectral evolution of hot hybrid WDs. Although small in number, they represent an evolutionary phase for most ($\approx$ 75 %) WDs. We conducted a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis with fully metal line blanketed model atmospheres for the ultraviolet (UV) and optical spectra of a sample of 19 DA and 13 DAO WDs with $T_{eff}$ $>$ 60 kK. The UV spectra allow us to precisely measure the temperature through model fits to metal lines in different ionization stages. This enables us to place the WDs accurately on the cooling sequence. In contrast to earlier studies that typically relied on temperature measurements made from hydrogen lines alone, all DAOs in our sample are clearly hotter than the DAs. DAOs transform into DAs when they cool to $T_{eff}$ $\approx$ 75$-$85 kK, depending on their mass. Along the cooling sequence, we witness a gradual decrease in the abundance of helium and the CNO elements in the DAOs due to gravitational settling. Simultaneously, iron and nickel abundances increase up to the transition region because radiative forces act more efficiently on them. This is followed by a steady decline. We discuss the implications of our results on atomic diffusion theory and on the role of weak radiation-driven winds in hot hydrogen-rich WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Radcliffe Wave has only recently been recognised as a about 3 kpc long coherent gas structure encompassing most of the star forming regions in the solar vicinity. Since its discovery, it has been mainly studied from the perspective of dynamics, but a detailed chemical study is necessary to understand its nature and the composition of the natal clouds that gave rise to it. In this paper we used some of the connected young open clusters (age $\lesssim$ 100 Myr) as tracers of the molecular clouds. We performed high-resolution spectroscopy with GIARPS at the TNG of 53 stars that are bona fide members of seven clusters located at different positions along the Radcliffe Wave. We provide radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for all of them. For a subsample consisting of 41 FGK stars we also studied the chromospheric activity and the content of Li, from which we inferred the age of the parent clusters. These values agree with the evolutionary ages reported in the literature. For these FGK stars we determined the chemical abundances for 25 species. Pleiades, ASCC 16 and NGC 7058 exhibit a solar metallicity while Melotte 20, ASCC 19, NGC 2232, and Roslund 6 show a slightly subsolar value ($\approx-$0.1 dex). On average, the clusters show a chemical composition compatible with that of the Sun, especially for $\alpha$- and Fe-peak elements. Neutron-capture elements, on the other hand, present a slight overabundance of about 0.2 dex, specially barium. Finally, considering also ASCC 123, studied by our group in a previous research, we infer a correlation between the chemical composition and the age or position of the clusters along the Wave, demonstrating their physical connection within an inhomogeneous mixing scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 A dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016 with GROND, a seven-channel optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla. In this first of a series of papers, we describe the GRB observing plan, providing first readings of all so far unpublished GRB afterglow measurements and some observing statistics. In total, we observed 514 GRBs with GROND, including 434 Swift-detected GRBs, representing 81\% of the observable Swift sample. For GROND-observations within 30 min of the GRB trigger, the optical/NIR afterglow detection rate is 81\% for long- and 57\% for short-duration GRBs. We report the discovery of ten new GRB afterglows plus one candidate, along with redshift estimates (partly improved) for four GRBs and new host detections for seven GRBs. We identify the (already known) afterglow of GRB 140209A as the sixth GRB exhibiting a 2175 Angstroem dust feature. As a side result, we identified two blazars, with one at a redshift of z=3.8 (in the GRB 131209A field).

 - **Abstract**
 Sputtering by solar wind ions is a key process driving the ejection of high-energy particles into the exospheres of airless bodies like asteroids, Mercury and the Moon. In view of upcoming missions which will deliver new in-situ data on these exospheres like the Artemis program at the Moon and BepiColombo at Mercury, a deeper understanding of sputtering effects is crucial. In this work, we combine sensitive quartz crystal microbalance measurements and numerical simulations to quantify sputter yields of Apollo soil 68501 under solar wind relevant conditions. We find that none of the commonly used simulation codes can reliably predict laboratory sputter yields without experimental benchmarks. All of the employed packages significantly overestimate the sputter yields of flat samples by at least a factor of 2 for the case of hydrogen. When accounting for surface roughness and regolith-like porosity, sputter yields are decreased even further to 7.3E-3 atoms\ion and 7.6E-2 atoms\ion for H and He at solar wind energies of 1 keV\amu, respectively. The reduced yields of porous regolith structures are largely independent of the ion incidence angle, making them applicable across a wide range of lunar latitudes. This study highlights the need for experimental validation of sputtering models to ensure accurate predictions for space weathering and lunar exosphere composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing evidence shows that warped disks are common, challenging the methods used to model their velocity fields. Molecular line emission of these disks is characterized by a twisted pattern, similar to the signal from radial flows, complicating the study of warped disk kinematics. Previous attempts to model these features have encountered difficulties in distinguishing between the underlying kinematics of different disks. This study aims to advance gas kinematics modeling capabilities by extending the Extracting Disk Dynamics ($\texttt{eddy}$) package to include warped geometries and radial flows. We assess the performance of $\texttt{eddy}$ in recovering input parameters for scenarios involving warps, radial flows, and combinations of the two. Additionally, we provide a basis to break the visual degeneracy between warped disks and radial flow, establishing a criterion to distinguish them. We extended the $\texttt{eddy}$ package to handle warped geometries by including a parametric prescription of a warped disk and a ray-casting algorithm to account for the surface self-obscuration arising from the 3D to 2D projection. The effectiveness of the tool was tested using the radiative transfer code $\texttt{RADMC3D}$, generating synthetic models for disks with radial flows, warped disks, and warped disks with radial flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of our tool in accurately recovering the geometrical parameters of systems, particularly in data with sufficient angular resolution. Importantly, we observe minimal impact from thermal noise levels typical in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Furthermore, our findings reveal that fitting an incorrect model type produces characteristic residual signatures, which serve as kinematic criteria for disk classification.

 - **Abstract**
 The O-type long-period binary HD 168112 and triple HD 167971 star systems have been known for several decades for their non-thermal synchrotron radio emission. This emission arises from relativistic electrons accelerated in the hydrodynamic shocks of the wind collisions in these systems. Such wind collisions are expected to produce a strong X-ray emission that varies as a function of orbital phase. In wide eccentric binaries, such as our targets, the X-ray emission arises from an adiabatic plasma and its intensity should scale as the inverse of the orbital separation. We present a set of XMM-Newton observations of these systems which help us gain insight into the properties of their wind interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the existence of hydrostatic equilibrium states for a composite body made of two rigidly rotating, homogeneous layers bounded by spheroidal surfaces, where the core has a prolate shape. These new configurations require an oblate envelope that spins faster than the core. No solution with a prolate envelope is found. For some parameters, the prolate core can even be at rest. Numerical experiments based on the self-consistent field method support this result in the case of heterogeneous layers with polytropic equations of state. The possible cancellation of the first gravitational moment, $J_2$, is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) still poses challenges to theoretical and observational astronomers. Several candidates have been proposed, including the one in the IRS13 cluster in the Galactic centre, where the evidence is based on the velocity dispersion of its members, however, none have been confirmed to date. Aims: We aim to gain insights into the presence of an IMBH in the Galactic centre by a numerical study of the dynamical interplay between an IMBH and star clusters (SCs) in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Methods: We use high-precision N-body models of IRS13-like SCs in the Galactic centre, and of more massive SCs that fall into the centre of the Galaxy from larger distances. Results: We find that at IRS13's physical distance of 0.4 pc, an IRS13-size SC cannot remain gravitationally bound even if it contains an IMBH of thousands $M_\odot$. Thus, IRS13 appears to be an incidental present-day clumping of stars. Furthermore, we show that the velocity dispersion of tidally disrupted SCs (the likely origin of IRS13) can be fully accounted for by the tidal forces of the central SMBH; the IMBH's influence is not essential.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether measurements of the neutron star mass and radius or the tidal deformability can provide information about the presence of hyperons inside a neutron star. This is achieved by considering two inference models, with and without hyperons, based on a field-theoretical approach. While current observations do not distinguish between the two scenarios, we have shown that data simulating expected observations from future large area X-ray timing telescopes could provide some information through Bayes factors. Inference using simulated data generated from an EOS containing hyperons decisively favours the hyperonic model over the nucleonic model. However, a 2\% uncertainty in the mass and radius determination may not be sufficient to constrain the parameters of the model when only six neutron star mass-radius measurements are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 The EDR and eRASS1 data have already revealed a remarkable number of undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations. Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the LMC SN1987A, fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules. The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC, which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the creation of point source catalogues of this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.

          Little time for oscillation: Fast disruption of the Radcliffe Wave by Galactic motions

 - **Abstract**
 The Radcliffe wave \cite{2020Natur.578..237A} is a 2.7 kpc long, 100 pc wide-like structure in the Galactic disk with a wave-like velocity structure \cite{2022MNRAS.517L.102L,2024arXiv240212596K}. A referent Nature paper \cite{2024arXiv240212596K} treated the Wave as a solid body in the disk plane, modeled its oscillation along the vertical direction, and derived the local Galactic mass distribution from the oscillation pattern. In reality, Galactic shear can stretch gas through differential rotation, whereas gas clouds experience epicyclic motions. We simulate the 3D evolution of the local interstellar gas and find shear and encyclic motion stretches the Radcliffe wave to almost twice its current length at the timescale of 45 Myr, within which only half a cycle of the proposed vertical oscillation occurs. The simulation also reveals the formation of new filaments and filament-filament mergers. Treating the Radcliffe wave as a solid body in the Galactic disk and an oscillating structure in the vertical direction is thus an oversimplification. Our data-driven simulation reveals the 3D evolution of the local interstellar gas with several processes at play, strengthening the role of the Solar Neighborhood as a unique test ground for theories of interstellar gas evolution.

          Super-Jeans fragmentation in massive star-forming regions revealed by triangulation analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the fragmentation of the gas cloud and the formation of massive stars remains one of the most challenging questions of modern astrophysical research. Either the gas fragmentation in a Jeans-like fashion, after which the fragments grow through accretion, or the fragmentation length is larger than the Jeans length from the start. Despite significant observational efforts, a consensus has not been reached. The key is to infer the initial density distribution upon which gravitational fragmentation occurs. Since cores are the products of the fragmentation process, the distances between adjacent cores serve as a scale indicator. Based on this observation, we propose a Delaunay triangulation-based approach to infer the density structure before the fragmentation and establish the link between density distribution and gas fragmentation length. We find that at low density, the fragmenting is Jeans-like, and at high densities, the core separations are larger than the prediction of the Jeans fragmentation. This super-Jeans fragmentation, which often occurs in groups, is responsible for the clustered formation of massive stars.

          Inverted EEMD: a robust method to identify narrow absorption features form spectral data and cubes

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting information from complex data is a challenge shared by multiple frontiers of modern astrophysical research. Among those, analyzing spectra cubes, where the emission is mapped in the position-position-velocity space is a difficult task given the vast amount of information contained within. The cubes often contain a superposition of emissions and absorptions, where extracting absorption signatures is often necessary. One example is the extraction of narrow absorption structures in HI 21 cm emission spectra. These HI self-absorption (HISA) clouds trace the cold HI gas in interstellar space. We introduce an automatic and robust method called the \emph{inverted EEMD} method to extract narrow features from spectral cubes. Our method is based on the EEMD method, an established method to decompose 1d signals. The method is robust and parameter-free, making it useful in analyzing spectral cubes containing localized absorption signals of different types. The inverted-EEMD method is suitable for the analysis of spectral cubes where it can produce a cube containing the absorption signal and one containing the unabsorbed signal, where cold clouds can be identified as coherent regions in the absorption map. A Python implementation of the method is available at \url{this https URL}.

          A diverse, overlooked population of Type Ia supernovae exhibiting mid-infrared signatures of delayed circumstellar interaction

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae arise from the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in multiple star systems. A rare sub-class of SNe Ia exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), allowing for direct constraints on companion material. While most known events show evidence for dense nearby CSM identified via peak-light spectroscopy (as SNe Ia-CSM), targeted late-time searches have revealed a handful of cases exhibiting delayed CSM interaction with detached shells. Here, we present the first all-sky search for late CSM interaction in SNe Ia using a new image-subtraction pipeline for mid-infrared data from the NEOWISE space telescope. Analyzing a sample of $\approx 8500$ SNe Ia, we report evidence for late-time mid-infrared brightening in six previously overlooked events spanning sub-types SNe Iax, normal SNe Ia, SNe Ia-91T and super-Chandra SNe Ia. Our systematic search doubles the known sample, and suggests that $\gtrsim 0.1$% of SNe Ia exhibit mid-infrared signatures of delayed CSM interaction. The mid-infrared light curves ubiquitously indicate the presence of multiple (or extended) detached CSM shells located at $\gtrsim 10^{16}-10^{17}$ cm, containing $10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$ of dust, with some sources showing evidence for new dust formation, likely within the cold, dense shell of the ejecta. We do not detect interaction signatures in spectroscopic and radio follow-up; however, the limits are largely consistent with previously confirmed events given the sensitivity and observation phase. Our results highlight that CSM interaction is more prevalent than previously estimated from optical and ultraviolet searches, and that mid-infrared synoptic surveys provide a unique window into this phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 A major challenge in gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of gravitational-wave compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the gravitational-wave events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular gravitational wave localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that has been known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.
