 - **Abstract**
 There is strong observational evidence that convective cores of intermediate-mass and massive main-sequence stars are substantially larger than standard stellar-evolution models predict. However, it is unclear what physical processes cause this phenomenon or how to predict the extent and stratification of stellar convective boundary layers. Convective penetration is a thermal-time-scale process that is likely to be particularly relevant during the slow evolution on the main sequence. We use our low-Mach-number Seven-League Hydro (SLH) code to study this process in 2.5D and 3D geometries. Starting with a chemically homogeneous model of a $15$ M$_\odot$ zero-age main-sequence star, we construct a series of simulations with the luminosity increased and opacity decreased by the same factor ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$. After reaching thermal equilibrium, all of our models show a clear penetration layer. Its thickness becomes statistically constant in time and it is shown to converge upon grid refinement. As the luminosity is decreased, the penetration layer becomes nearly adiabatic with a steep transition to a radiative stratification. This structure corresponds to the adiabatic ,,step overshoot'' model often employed in stellar-evolution calculations. The thickness of the penetration layer slowly decreases with decreasing luminosity. Depending on how we extrapolate our 3D data to the actual luminosity of the initial stellar model, we obtain penetration distances ranging from $0.09$ to $0.44$ pressure scale heights, which are broadly compatible with observations.
#### Analysis of the possible satellite contamination in LAMOST-MRS spectra

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04505
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04505
 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of false positive double-lined spectroscopic binaries candidates (SB2) using medium-resolution survey (MRS) spectra from the one time-domain field of LAMOST data release 10 (DR10). The secondary component in all these binaries has near zero radial velocity and solar-like spectral lines. Highly likely this is light from the semi-transparent clouds illuminated by the full Moon. However we also suspect that partially this contamination can be caused by a solar light reflected from the surface of low-orbital artificial satellites launched in the beginning of 2022. We found several possible contaminant candidates using archival orbital data. We propose measures to reduce risk of such contamination for the future observations and methods to find it in archived ones.
#### Cosmography from well-localized Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration pulses occurring at cosmological distances that have emerged as prominent cosmological probes due to their dispersion measure (DM) evolution with redshift. In this work, we use cosmography, a model-independent approach to describe the evolution of the universe, to introduce the cosmographic expansion of the DM-z relation. By fitting two different models for the intergalactic medium and host contributions to a sample of 23 well-localized FRBs, we estimate the kinematic parameters $q_0=-0.59 \substack{+0.20 \\ -0.17}$, $j_0=1.08 \substack{+0.62 \\ -0.56}$, $s_0=-2.1\pm7.0$, and $H_0=69.4\pm4.7$ achieving a precision of $6\%$ and $7\%$ for the Hubble constant depending on the models used for contributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to address the long-standing "Missing Baryons" problem in astrophysics by estimating that $82\%$ of the baryonic content of the universe resides in the intergalactic medium, within $7\%$ and $8\%$ precision, according to the contribution models considered here. Our findings highlight the potential of FRBs as a valuable tool in cosmological research and underscore the importance of ongoing efforts to improve our understanding of these enigmatic events.
