 - **Abstract**
 A correlation has been reported between the arrival directions of high-energy IceCube events and gamma-ray blazars classified as intermediate- and high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs. Subsequent studies have investigated the optical properties of these sources, analyzed public multiwavelength data, and constrained their individual neutrino emission based on public IceCube data. In this work, we provide a theoretical interpretation of public multiwavelength and neutrino point source data for the 32 BL Lac objects in the sample previously associated with an IceCube alert event. We have performed particle interaction modeling using open-source numerical simulation software. We constrained the model parameters using a novel and unique approach that simultaneously describes the host galaxy contribution, the observed synchrotron peak, the multiwavelength fluxes, and the IceCube point source constraints. We show that a single-zone leptohadronic model can describe the multiwavelength fluxes from the 32 IceCube candidates. In some cases, the model suggests that hadronic emission may contribute a considerable fraction of the gamma-ray flux. The required power in relativistic protons ranges from a few percent to a factor of ten of the Eddington luminosity, which is energetically less demanding compared to other leptohadronic blazar models in recent literature. The model can describe the 68% confidence level IceCube flux for a large fraction of the masquerading BL Lacs in the sample, including TXS 0506+056; whereas, for true BL Lacs, the model predicts a low neutrino flux in the IceCube sensitivity range. The predicted neutrino flux peaks between a few PeV and 100 PeV and scales positively with the flux in the GeV, MeV, X-ray, and optical bands. Based on these results, we provide a list of the brightest neutrino emitters, which can be used for future searches targeting the 10-100 PeV regime.

          Kinematics and Dynamics of the Galactic Bar revealed by Gaia Long Period Variables

 - **Abstract**
 We take low-amplitude, long period variable (LA-LPV) candidates in Gaia DR3 as tracers of the kinematics and dynamics of the Milky Way bar. LA-LPVs, like other LPVs, have high luminosities and follow a tight period-luminosity relation, but unlike e.g. Mira variables, their radial velocity measurements are reliable due to their smaller pulsation amplitudes. We supplement the Gaia astrometric and radial velocity measurements with distance moduli assigned using a period-luminosity relation to acquire full 6D phase space information. The assigned distances are validated by comparing to geometric distances and StarHorse distances, which shows biases less than $\sim5\%$. Our sample provides an unprecedented panoramic picture of the inner Galaxy with minimal selection function effects. We map the kinematics of the inner Milky Way and find a significant kinematic signature corresponding to the Galactic bar. We measure the pattern speed of the Galactic bar using the continuity equation and find $\Omega_{\rm b}=34.1\pm2.4$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. We develop a simple, robust and model-independent method to measure the dynamical length of the bar using only kinematics and find $R_{\rm b}\sim4.0$ kpc. We validate both measurements using N-body simulations. Assuming knowledge of the gravitational potential of the inner Milky Way, we analyse the orbital structure of the Galactic bar using orbital frequency ratios. The $x_1$ orbits are the dominant bar-supporting orbital family in our sample. Amongst the selected bar stars, the $x_1 v_1$ or "banana" orbits constitute a larger fraction ($\sim 15\%$) than other orbital families in the bar, implying that they are the dominant family contributing to the Galactic X-shape, although contributions from other orbital families are present.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are stars distinct by their abundances of light elements. The MPs can be directly separated by measuring abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Mg with spectroscopy or indirectly from photometric sequences created by the impact of different chemistry on band passes of particular filters, such as the HST pseudo-colours in the ultraviolet. An attempt to link HST pseudo-colours maps (PCMs) and spectroscopy was done by Marino et al. (2019), using abundances mostly from our FLAMES survey. However, we uncovered that an incomplete census of stars in common was used in their population tagging. We correct the situation by building our own PCMs and matching them with our abundances in 20 GCs, plus two GCs from other sources, doubling the sample with spectroscopic abundances available. We found that the pseudo-colour (magF275W-2*magF336W+magF438W) does not have a monotonic trend with Na abundances, enhanced by proton-capture reactions in MPs. Moreover, on average about 16% of stars with spectroscopic Na abundances show a discrepant tagging of MPs with respect to the HST photometry. Stars with chemistry of second generation (SG) are mistaken for first generation (FG) objects according to HST photometry and vice versa. In general, photometric indices tend to overestimate the fraction of FG stars, in particular in low mass GCs. We offer a simple explanation for these findings. Finally, we publish all our PCMs, with more than 31,800 stars in 22 GCs, with star ID and coordinates, for easy check and reproduction, as it should be in science papers.

          CombineHarvesterFlow: Joint Probe Analysis Made Easy with Normalizing Flows

 - **Abstract**
 We show how to efficiently sample the joint posterior of two non-covariant experiments with a large set of nuisance parameters. Specifically, we train an ensemble of normalizing flows to learn the the posterior distribution of both experiments. Once trained, we can use the flows to draw $\mathcal{O} (10^9)$ samples from the joint posterior of two independent cosmological measurements in seconds -- saving up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ ton of $\text{CO}_2$ per Monte Carlo run. Using this new technique we find joint constraints between the Dark Energy Survey $3 \times 2$ point measurement, South Pole Telescope and Planck CMB lensing and a BOSS direct fit full shape analyses, for the first time. We find $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.32^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and $S_8 = 0.79 ^ {+0.01}_ {-0.01}$. We release a public package called {\tt CombineHarvesterFlow} (this https URL) which performs these calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of 9 new planet candidates orbiting M dwarfs, identified using an independent search and vetting pipeline applied to TESS Full-Frame Image (FFI) data from Sectors 1 to 63. Our candidates include planets as small as 1.4 $R_{\oplus}$, with orbital periods up to 20 days. Among the 9 new candidates, we identified 5 gas giants, which represent a rare and unexpected outcome of planet formation. Our findings add to the growing sample of giant planets around M dwarfs found by TESS. We discuss their follow-up potential for mass measurements through radial velocity observations and atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy. We highlight TIC 12999193.01 as a particularly unique gas giant candidate in an eccentric orbit and excellent potential for atmospheric characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology, the study of stellar pulsations, offers insights into the internal structures and evolution of stars. Analysing the variations in a star's brightness allows the determination of fundamental properties such as mass, radius, age, and chemical composition. Asteroseismology heavily relies on computational tools, but a significant number of them are closed-source, thus inaccessible to the broader astronomic community. This manuscript presents Foam, a Python package designed to perform forward asteroseismic modelling of stars exhibiting gravity modes. It automates and streamlines a considerable fraction of the modelling process, comparing grids of theoretical stellar models and their oscillation frequencies to observed frequency sets in stars. Foam offers the flexibility to employ diverse modelling approaches, allowing users to choose different methodologies for matching theoretically predicted oscillations to observations. It provides options to utilise various sets of observables for comparison with their theoretical counterparts, employ different merit functions for assessing goodness of fit, and to incorporate nested subgrids in a statistically rigorous manner. For applications of these methodologies in modelling observed gravity modes, refer to Michielsen et al. (2021) and Michielsen et al. (2023).

          NEATH III: a molecular line survey of a simulated star-forming cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present synthetic line observations of a simulated molecular cloud, utilising a self-consistent treatment of the dynamics and time-dependent chemical evolution. We investigate line emission from the three most common CO isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) and six supposed tracers of dense gas (NH$_3$, HCN, N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, CS, HNC). Our simulation produces a range of line intensities consistent with that observed in real molecular clouds. The HCN-to-CO intensity ratio is relatively invariant with column density, making HCN (and chemically-similar species such as CS) a poor tracer of high-density material in the cloud. The ratio of N$_2$H$^+$ to HCN or CO, on the other hand, is highly selective of regions with densities above $10^{22} \, {\rm cm^{-2}}$, and the N$_2$H$^+$ line is a very good tracer of the dynamics of high volume density ($>10^4 \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$) material. Focusing on cores formed within the simulated cloud, we find good agreement with the line intensities of an observational sample of prestellar cores, including reproducing observed CS line intensities with an undepleted elemental abundance of sulphur. However, agreement between cores formed in the simulation, and models of isolated cores which have otherwise-comparable properties, is poor. The formation from and interaction with the large-scale environment has a significant impact on the line emission properties of the cores, making isolated models unsuitable for interpreting observational data.

          The largest metallicity difference in twin systems: high-precision abundance analysis of the benchmark pair Krios & Kronos

 - **Abstract**
 Aims.We conduct a high-precision differential abundance analysis of the remarkable binary system HD 240429/30 (Krios and Kronos, respectively), whose difference in metallicity is one of the highest detected in systems with similar components to date (approximately 0.20 dex). A condensation temperature TC trend study was performed to search for possible chemical signatures of planet formation. In addition, other potential scenarios have been proposed to explain this disparity. Methods. Fundamental atmospheric parameters (Te f f , log g, [Fe/H], vturb) were calculated using the latest version of the FUNDPAR code employing high resolution MAROON-X spectra. We applied a full line-by-line differential technique to measure the abundances of 26 elements in both stars with equivalent widths and spectral synthesis taking advantage of the non-solar scaled opacities. Results.We found a difference in metallicity of approximately 0.230 dex, being Kronos more metal rich than Krios. The analysis encompassed the examination of the diffusion effect and primordial chemical differences, concluding that the observed chemical discrepancies in the binary system cannot be solely attributed to any of these processes. The results also shown a noticeable excess of Li by approximately 0.56 dex in Kronos, and an enhancement of refractories with respect to Krios. A photometric study with TESS data was carried out, without finding any signal of possible transiting planets around the stars. Several potential planet formation scenarios were also explored to account for the observed excess in both metallicity and lithium in Kronos. Planetary engulfment is a plausible explanation, considering the ingestion of an exceptionally large mass, approximately approximately 27.8M_Earth, but no scenario is definitively ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Ser X-1 is a low mass neutron star X-ray binary and has been persistently accreting since its discovery in the 1960s. It has always been observed to be in a soft spectral state and has never showed substantial long-term X-ray variability. Ser X-1 has one previous radio observation in the literature in which radio emission was detected during this soft state, which is contrary to the behavior of black hole X-ray binaries. We have recently obtained 10 randomly sampled radio epochs of Ser X-1 in order to further investigate its anomalous soft state radio emission. Out of 10 epochs, we find 8 non-detections and 2 detections at 10 GHz flux densities of 19.9 +/- 4.2 uJy and 32.2 +/- 3.6 uJy. We do not detect polarization in either epoch, ruling out very high polarization levels (< 63% and 34%). We compare these Ser X-1 results to other X-ray binaries and consider explanations for its long term variable radio behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional dust density maps are crucial for understanding the structure of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way and the processes that shape it. However, constructing these maps requires large datasets and the methods used to analyse them are computationally expensive and difficult to scale up. As a result it is has only recently become possible to map kiloparsec-scale regions of our Galaxy at parsec-scale grid sampling. We present all-sky three-dimensional dust density and extinction maps of the Milky Way out to 2.8~kpc in distance from the Sun using the fast and scalable Gaussian Process algorithm \DustT. The sampling of the three-dimensional map is $l,b,d = 1^{\circ} \times1^{\circ} \times 1.7$~pc. The input extinction and distance catalogue contains 120 million stars with photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR2, 2MASS and AllWISE. This combines the strengths of optical and infrared data to probe deeper into the dusty regions of the Milky Way. We compare our maps with other published 3D dust maps. All maps quantitatively agree at the $0.001$~mag~pc$^{-1}$ scale with many qualitatively similar features, although each map also has its own features. We recover Galactic features previously identified in the literature. Moreover, we also see a large under-density that may correspond to an inter-arm or -spur gap towards the Galactic Centre.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model, which has been pivotal in cosmological studies, has faced significant challenges due to emerging observational and theoretical inconsistencies. This paper explores alternative cosmological models to address these discrepancies, using simulated three years photometric Supernovae Ia data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), supplemented with additional Pantheon+, Union, and the recently released Dark Energy Survey 5 Years (DESY5) supernova compilations and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We assess the constraining power of these datasets on various dynamic dark energy models, including CPL, BA, JBP, SCPL, and GCG. Our analysis demonstrates that the LSST with its high precision data, can provide tighter constraints on dark energy parameters compared to other datasets. Additionally, the inclusion of BAO measurements significantly improves parameter constraints across all models. Except for Pantheon+, we find that across all the cosmological datasets, and the dark energy models considered in this work, there is a consistent deviation from the LCDM model that exceeds a 2-sigma significance level. Our findings underscore the necessity of exploring dynamic dark energy models, which offer more consistent frameworks with fundamental physics and observational data, potentially resolving tensions within the LCDM paradigm. Furthermore, the use of simulated LSST data highlights the survey's potential in offering significant advantages for exploring alternative cosmologies, suggesting that future LSST observations would play a crucial role.

          Simulations predict intermediate-mass black hole formation in globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are those between 100 and 10$^5$ solar masses ($M_{\odot}$); their formation process is debated. One possible origin is the growth of less massive black holes (BHs) via mergers with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs $<500 M_{\odot}$ because the gravitational wave recoil ejects them when they merge with other BHs. We perform star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC's parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs $\gtrsim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.

 The CCAT Collaboration's six-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope is scheduled to begin observing in the Chilean Atacama in 2025, targeting a variety of science goals throughout cosmic history. Prime-Cam is a 1.8-meter diameter cryostat that will host up to seven independent instrument modules designed for simultaneous spectroscopic and broadband, polarimetric surveys at millimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. The first of these instrument modules, the 280 GHz module, will include ${\sim}$10,000 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) across three arrays. While the first array was fabricated out of tri-layer TiN/Ti/TiN, the other two arrays were fabricated out of a single layer of Al. This combination of materials within the same instrument provides a unique opportunity to directly compare the performance and noise properties of two different detector materials that are seeing increasing use within the field. We present preliminary comparisons here based on lab testing, along with a discussion of the potential impacts on operation when observing and translating raw data to science-grade maps.

          Cosmological Stasis from Dynamical Scalars: Tracking Solutions and the Possibility of a Stasis-Induced Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 It has recently been realized that many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model give rise to cosmological histories exhibiting extended epochs of cosmological stasis. During such epochs, the abundances of different energy components such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy each remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. In previous analyses of the stasis phenomenon, these different energy components were modeled as fluids with fixed, unchanging equations of state. In this paper, by contrast, we consider more realistic systems involving dynamical scalars which pass through underdamping transitions as the universe expands. Indeed, such systems might be highly relevant for BSM scenarios involving higher-dimensional bulk moduli and inflatons. Remarkably, we find that stasis emerges even in such situations, despite the appearance of time-varying equations of state. Moreover, this stasis includes several new features which might have important phenomenological implications and applications. For example, in the presence of an additional "background" energy component, we find that the scalars evolve into a "tracking" stasis in which the stasis equation of state automatically tracks that of the background. This phenomenon exists even if the background has only a small initial abundance. We also discuss the intriguing possibility that our results might form the basis of a new "Stasis Inflation" scenario in which no ad-hoc inflaton potential is needed and in which there is no graceful-exit problem. Within such a scenario, the number of e-folds of cosmological expansion produced is directly related to the hierarchies between physical BSM mass scales. Moreover, non-zero matter and radiation abundances can be sustained throughout the inflationary epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 The Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU) camera is an optical narrow band and broad band imaging instrument mounted at the prime focus of the William Herschel Telescope. We describe the image calibration procedure of the PAU Survey data. We rely on an external photometric catalogue to calibrate our narrow band data using stars that have been observed by both datasets. We fit stellar templates to the stellar broad band photometry of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and synthesise narrow band photometry that we compare to the PAUS narrow band data to determine their calibration. Consequently, the PAUS data are in the AB system as inherited from its reference calibrator. We do several tests to check the performance of the calibration. We find it self-consistent when comparing repeated observations of the same objects, with a good overall accuracy to the AB system which we estimate to be at the 2\% precision level and no significant trends as a function of narrow band filter or wavelength. Repeated observations allow us to build a spatial map of the illumination pattern of the system. We also check the wavelength dependence of the calibration comparing to stellar spectra. We find that using only blue stars reduces the effects of variations in the stellar template fitting to broad-band colours, improving the overall precision of the calibration to around 1\% and its wavelength uniformity. The photometric redshift performance obtained with the PAUS data attests to the validity of our calibration to reach the PAUS science goals.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations utilizing the ultraviolet capabilities of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope are of unique value to the astronomy community. Spectroscopy down to 900 A with COS has enabled new science areas. However, contrary to the situation at longer wavelengths, these observations are limited by detector background noise. The background correction currently applied by the standard calibration pipeline (CalCOS) is not optimized for faint targets, limiting the scientific value of low signal-to-noise observations. In this work we investigate a possible dependence of the variations of the dark rate in both segments of the COS far-ultraviolet (FUV) detector on time, detector high voltage (HV), and solar activity. Through our analysis we identified a number of detector states (on a configuration basis, e.g., HV and segment) characterizing the spatial distribution of dark counts, and created superdarks to be used in an optimized 2-dimensional (2D) background correction. We have developed and tested Another COS Dark Correction (ACDC), a dedicated pipeline to perform a 2D background correction based on statistical methods, producing background-corrected and flux-calibrated spectra. While our testing of ACDC showed an average improvement in S/N values of ~10%, in a few cases the improvements in S/N reached 60% across the whole wavelength range of individual segments.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple planets undergoing disk migration may be captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances with the innermost planet parked near the disk's inner edge. Subsequent dynamical evolution may disrupt these resonances, leading to the non-resonant configurations typically observed among {\it Kepler} planets that are Gyrs old. In this scenario, resonant configurations are expected to be more common in younger systems. This prediction can now be tested, thanks to recent discoveries of young planets, particularly those in stellar clusters, by NASA's {\it TESS} mission. We divided the known planetary systems into three age groups: young ($<$100-Myr-old), adolescent (0.1-1-Gyr-old), and mature ($>1$-Gyr-old). The fraction of neighboring planet pairs having period ratios within a few percent of a first-order commensurability (e.g.~4:3, 3:2, or 2:1) is 70$\pm$15\% for young pairs, 24$\pm$8\% for adolescent pairs, and 15$\pm$2\% for mature pairs. The fraction of systems with at least one nearly commensurable pair (either first or second-order) is 86$\pm13$\% among young systems, 38$\pm12$\% for adolescent systems, and 23$\pm3$\% for mature systems. First-order commensurabilities prevail across all age groups, with an admixture of second-order commensurabilities. Commensurabilities are more common in systems with high planet multiplicity and low mutual inclinations. Observed period ratios often deviate from perfect commensurability by $\sim$1\% even among young planets, too large to be explained by resonant repulsion with equilibrium eccentricity tides. We also find that super-Earths in the radius gap ($1.5-1.9R_\oplus$) are less likely to be near-resonant (11.9$\pm2.0\%$) compared to Earth-sized planets ($R_p<1R_\oplus$; 25.3$\pm4.4\%$) or mini-Neptunes ($1.9R_\oplus \leq R_p<2.5R_\oplus$; 14.4$\pm1.8\%$).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second data release for the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey. This data release is an area of 12,892-deg^2 around the South Galactic Pole region covering 20h 40m <= RA <= 6h 40m, -90deg <= Dec <= +30deg. Observations were taken in 2020 using the Phase-II configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and covering a frequency range of 72-231MHz with twenty frequency bands. We produce a wideband source-finding mosaic over 170-231MHz with a median root mean squared noise of 1.5 (+1.5/-0.5) mJy beam^(-1). We present a catalogue of 624,866 components, including 562,302 components which are spectrally fit. This catalogue is 98% complete at 50mJy, and a reliability of 98.7% at a 5sigma level, consistent with expectations for this survey. The catalogue is made available via Vizier and the PASA datastore and accompanying mosaics for this data release are made available via AAO Data Central and SkyView.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a series of 3D special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet in a massive circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. Our simulations reproduce the jet morphology transitioning from a well-collimated state to a thermal pressure-driven state for a range of CSM masses and outer radii. The jet-CSM interaction redistributes the jet energy to materials expanding into a wide solid angle and results in a quasi-spherical ejecta with 4-velocities from $\Gamma\beta\simeq 0.1$ to $\simeq 10$. The mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta with velocities faster than $0.1c$ are typically of the order of $0.1\,M_\odot$ and $10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$ with only a weak dependence on the CSM mass and radius for the explored CSM parameter ranges. We find that the numerically obtained density structure of the mildly relativistic ejecta is remarkably universal. The radial density profile is well approximated as a power-law function of the radial velocity with an index of $-5$, $\rho\propto v^{-5}$, in agreement with our previous simulations and other studies, as well as those suggested from recent studies on early-phase spectra of supernovae associated with GRBs. Such fast ejecta rapidly becomes transparent following its expansion. Gradually releasing the trapped thermal photons, the ejecta gives rise to bright UV--optical emission within $\sim 1$ day. We discuss the potential link of the relativistic ejecta resulting from jet-CSM interaction to GRB-associated supernovae as well as fast and blue optical transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a superflare, releasing $5\times 10^{37}$ erg in 2$-$10 keV, of the RS CVn-type star IM Peg at 10:41 UT on 2023 July 23 with its Gas Slit Camera (GSC; 2$-$30 keV). We conducted X-ray follow-up observations of the superflare with Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV) starting at 16:52 UT on July 23 until 06:00 UT on August 2. NICER X-ray spectra clearly showed emission lines of the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ for $\sim 1.5$ days since the MAXI detection. The Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line was blue-shifted with its maximum Doppler velocity reaching $-2200 \pm 600$ $\mathrm{km \: s^{-1}}$, suggesting an upward-moving plasma during the flare, such as a coronal mass ejection (CME) and/or chromospheric evaporation. This is the first case that the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line is blue-shifted during a stellar flare and its velocity overwhelmingly exceeds the escape velocity of the star ($-230$ $\mathrm{km \: s^{-1}}$). One hour before the most pronounced blueshift detection, a signature of reheating the flare plasma was observed. We discuss the origin of the blueshift, a CME or high-velocity chromospheric evaporation.

 - **Abstract**
 We need to resolve the individual stars for binary fraction determinations of stellar systems. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain the binary fractions for dense or distant stellar systems. % We proposed a method to determine the binary fraction of a dense or distant stellar system. The method is to first determine the binary fraction variation for any two adjacent regions and then add up those binary fraction variations along the radial direction to obtain the binary fraction for a stellar system. Binary fraction variation is derived by using ten binary fraction-sensitive spectral absorption feature indices (SAFIs) and the binary fraction variation calibrations in terms of these SAFIs. Using this method, we first presented the binary fraction variations for twenty-one Galactic globular clusters (GCs). By comparisons, we find that they agree well with the binary fractions based on the main-sequence fiducial line method by previous studies. This verifies that the above mentioned method is feasible. Next, we presented the binary fraction variations of thirteen Galactic GCs. We gave the relationships between binary fraction and various parameters, and found that binary fraction is negatively correlated with NHB and NRR, binary fraction of some studies is not strongly correlated with NBS, and the number of GCs with large binary fraction is greater at extreme blue horizontal branch population ratio. At last, if we want to obtain more accurate binary fraction, we suggest that the spectroscopic and photometric observations are conducted at an appropriate area interval for a stellar system.

          Polar alignment of a dusty circumbinary disc -- I. Dust ring formation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of dust traffic jams in polar-aligning circumbinary discs. We use 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations of both gas and dust to model an initially highly misaligned circumbinary disc around an eccentric binary. As the circumbinary disc evolves to a polar configuration (perpendicular to the binary orbital plane), the difference in the precession between the gas and dust produces dust traffic jams, which become dense dust rings. We find the formation of dust rings exists for different Stokes number, binary eccentricity, and initial disc tilt. Dust rings are only produced while the circumbinary disc is misaligned to the binary orbital plane. When the disc becomes polar aligned, the dust rings are still present and long-lived. Once these dust rings are formed, they drift inward. The drift timescale depends on the Stokes number. The lower the Stokes number, the faster the dust ring drifts near the inner edge of the disc. The dust rings will have an increased midplane dust-to-go ratio, which may be a favourable environment for the steaming instability to operate.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The light element (anti-)correlations shown by globular clusters (GCs) are the main spectroscopic signature of multiple stellar populations. These internal abundance variations provide us with fundamental constraints on the formation mechanism of stellar clusters. Aims: Using Gaia-ESO, the largest and most homogeneous survey of open clusters (OCs), we intend to check whether these stellar aggregates display the same patterns. Based on previous studies of many GCs, several young and massive clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, as well as a few OCs, we do not expect to find any anti-correlation, given the low mass of Milky Way OCs. Methods: We used the results based on UVES spectra of stars in Gaia-ESO to derive the distribution of Na and O abundances and seevwhether they show an unexplained dispersion or whether they are anti-correlated. By selecting only high-probability members with high-precision stellar parameters, we ended up with more than 700 stars in 74 OCs. We examined the O-Na distribution in 28 OCsvwith at least 4 stars available as well as the Na distribution in 24 OCs, with at least 10 stars available. Results: We find that the distribution of Na abundances is compatible with a single-value population, within the errors. The fewvapparent exceptions can be explained by differences in the evolutionary phase (main sequence and giant post first dredge-up episode) or by difficulties in analysing low gravity giants. We did not find any indication of an Na-O anti-correlation in any of the clusters for which O has been derived. Conclusions: Based on the very small spread we find, OCs maintain the status of single stellar populations. However, a definitive answer requires studying more elements and larger samples covering different evolutionary phases. This will be possible with the next generation of large surveys

 - **Abstract**
 The direct observation of cold and temperate planets within 1 to 10 AU would be extremely valuable for uncovering their atmospheric compositions but remains a formidable challenge with current astronomical methods. Ground-based optical interferometry, capable of high angular-resolution imaging, offers a promising avenue for studying these exoplanets, complementing space-based observations. Our objective is to explore the fundamental limits of dual-field interferometry and assess its potential for characterizing exoplanets in reflected light using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as $\tau$ Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1$\,\mu$m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).

 - **Abstract**
 The Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), a proposed consequence of certain quantum gravity (QG) scenarios, could instigate an energy-dependent group velocity for ultra-relativistic particles. This energy dependence, although suppressed by the massive QG energy scale $E_\mathrm{QG}$, expected to be on the level of the Planck energy $1.22 \times 10^{19}$ GeV, is potentially detectable in astrophysical observations. In this scenario, the cosmological distances traversed by photons act as an amplifier for this effect. By leveraging the observation of a remarkable flare from the blazar Mrk\,421, recorded at energies above 100 GeV by the MAGIC telescopes on the night of April 25 to 26, 2014, we look for time delays scaling linearly and quadratically with the photon energies. Using for the first time in LIV studies a binned-likelihood approach we set constraints on the QG energy scale. For the linear scenario, we set $95\%$ lower limits $E_\mathrm{QG}>2.7\times10^{17}$ GeV for the subluminal case and $E_\mathrm{QG}> 3.6 \times10^{17}$ GeV for the superluminal case. For the quadratic scenario, the $95\%$ lower limits for the subluminal and superluminal cases are $E_\mathrm{QG}>2.6 \times10^{10}$ GeV and $E_\mathrm{QG}>2.5\times10^{10}$ GeV, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the results of a search for rotation signature in 250 Gaia DR3 Ultra-Cool Dwarfs (UCDs) with TESS light curves. We identified 71 targets with unambiguous periodicities, of which 61 present rotation signatures and a single source behavior, with periods between 0.133 and 5.81 days. Five UCDs show double-dip features, namely variations with two periods, one approximately double or half the other. The remaining ten UCDs with unambiguous variability present a likely non-single behavior. We also found 20 UCDs showing complex behavior in their light curves, with noticeable fluctuations and irregular structure, with a few exhibiting apparent changes in their temporal structure. The remaining 159 targets show noisy light curves corresponding to low-amplitude signals, whose temporal variation cannot be easily identified. The distribution of the UCDs with rotation signature in the CMD diagram points to a lack of rotating objects within about $11.5<M_{G}<12.5$ and $G-G_{RP}<1.5$ separating them into two regimes, one mainly composed of less massive late-M stars with $P_{rot} \geq 1.0$ d, and another mainly composed of more massive early-M stars with $P_{rot}<1.0$ d. It is important to emphasize that by separating stars into age intervals, one observes that UCDs with $P_{rot} \geq 1.0$ d tend to be located in regions of younger objects, and, in contrast, those with $P_{rot}<1.0$ d are mainly concentrated in regions of older objects. Whether these trends of stars contrasting the sample separation is physical or produced by observational biases is a question to be verified in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 We used near-infrared spectroscopy at medium-high resolution (R=8,000$-$25,000) to perform the first comprehensive chemical study of the intermediate luminosity bulge globular cluster Terzan~6. We derived detailed abundances and abundance patterns of 27 giant stars, likely members of Terzan~6, based on their accurate Hubble Space Telescope proper motions and line-of-sight radial velocities. From the spectral analysis of these stars, we determined an average heliocentric radial velocity of 143.3$\pm$1.0 km s$^{-1}$ with a velocity dispersion of 5.1$\pm$0.7 km s$^{-1}$ and an average [Fe/H]=$-0.65\pm0.01$ and a low 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.03 dex. We also measured some depletion of [Mn/Fe] with respect to the solar-scaled values and enhancement of for [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [O/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Na/Fe], and, to a lower extent, for [K/Fe], consistent with previous measurements of other bulge globular clusters and favoring the scenario of a rapid bulge formation and chemical enrichment. Some spread in the light element abundances suggest the presence of first- and second-generation stars, typical of genuine globulars. Finally, we measured some depletion of carbon and low $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ isotopic ratios, as in previous studies of field and cluster bulge giants, indicating that extra-mixing mechanisms should be at work during the post main sequence evolution in the high metallicity regime as well.

          Accurate estimate of the ESPRESSO fiber-injection losses inferred from integrated field-stabilization images

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based astronomy is unavoidably subject to the adverse effect of atmospheric turbulence, a.k.a. the seeing, which blurs the images and limits the achievable spatial resolution. For spectroscopic observations, it leads to slit or fiber-injection losses, since not all photons distributed over the extended seeing disk can be captured. These losses might have a very substantial impact on the overall efficiency of a spectrograph and are naturally highly variable. Assessing the fiber-injection losses requires accurate information about the image quality (IQ) delivered by the telescope to the instrument over the course of the observations, which, however, is often not directly available. ESPRESSO provides acquisition and field-stabilization images attached to the science data and thus offers the opportunity for a post-processing analysis. Here, we present a novel method to infer the IQ profile and fiber-injection losses from the integrated field-stabilization images, utilizing the spill-over light that does not get injected into the fiber. We validate these measurements against the IQ observed in the acquisition images and determine that our method delivers unbiased estimates with a scatter of 0.11" for the FWHM of the profile and 15% in terms of fiber-injection losses. This compares favorably to the estimates derived from either the differential image motion monitor (DIMM) or the telescope guide probe sensors and therefore represents a valuable tool to characterize the instrument efficiency and to correct raw spectra for fiber-injection losses.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.

 Context. When low and intermediate-mass stars leave the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, and before they reach the Planetary Nebulae stage, they enter a very brief and rather puzzling stellar evolutionary stage named post-AGB. Aims. To provide a reliable catalogue of galactic post-AGB stars together with their physical and evolutionary properties obtained through Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry. Methods. We started by identifying post-AGB stars or possible candidates from the bibliography with their Gaia DR3 counterpart sources. Using the available photometry, interstellar extinction, literature spectroscopically derived temperatures or spectral types and parallax-derived distances from Gaia DR3, we fitted their Spectral Energy Distributions and we estimated their luminosities and circumstellar extinctions. When compared to models, luminosity values allowed us to disclose objects that are likely post-AGB stars from other target types. Their position on the HR diagram allows direct comparison with updated post-AGB evolutionary tracks and an estimation of their masses and evolutionary ages. Results. We obtained a sample of 69 reliable post-AGB candidates that meet our classification criteria, providing their coordinates, distances, effective temperature, total extinction, luminosity, mass, and evolutionary age. In addition, similar data for other stellar objects in our initial compilation, such as supergiant stars or young stellar objects, is provided. Conclusions. We have filtered out the data that have the best precision in parallaxes and distances to obtain more accurate luminosities, which allows us to classify with confidence the objects of the sample among different stellar phases. This allows us to provide a small but reliable sample of post-AGB objects. Derived mean evolutionary time and average mass values are in agreement with theoretical expectations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we describe the set of ``New Worlds Simulations'', three very large cosmology simulations, Qo'noS, Vulcan, and Ferenginar, that were carried out on the Summit supercomputer with the Hardware/Hybrid Cosmology Code, HACC. The gravity-only simulations follow the evolution of structure in the Universe by each employing 12,288^3 particles in (3 Gpc/h)^3 volumes, leading to a mass resolution of m_p~10^9 Msun/h. The simulations cover three different cosmologies, one LambdaCDM model, consistent with measurements from Planck, one simulation with massive neutrinos, and one simulation with a varying dark energy equation of state. All simulations have the same phases to allow a detailed comparison of the results and the investigation of the impact of different cosmological parameters. We present measurements of some basic statistics, such as matter power spectra, correlation function, halo mass function and concentration-mass relation and investigate the differences due to the varying cosmologies. Given the large volume and high resolution, these simulations provide excellent bases for creating synthetic skies. A subset of the data is made publicly available as part of this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse Profile Modeling (PPM), the technique used to infer mass, radius and geometric parameters for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), relies on relativistic ray-tracing of thermal X-ray photons from hot spots on the neutron star surface to the observer. To verify our ray-tracing codes we have in the past conducted cross-tests for simple hot spot geometries, focusing primarily on the implementation of the space-time model. In this paper, we present verification for test problems that explore the more complex hot spot geometries that are now being employed in the NICER PPM analyses. We conclude that the accuracy of our computed waveforms is in general sufficiently high for analyses of current NICER data sets. We have however identified some extreme configurations where extra care may be needed.

 Modern telescope facilities generate data from various sources, including sensors, weather stations, LiDARs, and FRAMs. Sophisticated software architectures using the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data technologies are required to manage this data. This study explores the potential of sensor data for innovative maintenance techniques, such as predictive maintenance (PdM), to prevent downtime that can affect research. We analyzed historical data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope, spanning seven years, examining data patterns and variable correlations. The findings offer insights for triggering predictive maintenance model development in telescope facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.

          Analytical Delta-V Approximation for Nonlinear Programming of Multi-target Rendezvous and Flyby Trajectories

 - **Abstract**
 This study proposes an analytical Delta-V approximation of short-time transfers based on the linear relative motion and a gradient-based nonlinear programming model of multi-target rendezvous and flyby trajectories. In previous studies, the Lambert's solution is commonly used to evaluate Delta-V of short-duration transfers. In this study, to avoid the iteration process for obtaining the Lambert's solution and its gradient, the linear relative motion equations are applied to form an analytical two-point boundary value model for the near-circular orbit rendezvous problems. Although the relative motion equations are usually applicable when the two orbits are close enough, and the position and velocity errors would become more significant as the orbital differences increase, the errors of the velocity increments were proved acceptable in our simulations. Moreover, the analytical formula facilitates the calculation of the gradients to the start epoch and flight time, which are used to establish a nonlinear programming model for sequence optimization that gradient-based algorithms can easily solve. Simulation results demonstrated that the analytical Delta-V approximation requires much less calculation than the Lambert's solution, and the proposed gradient-based nonlinear programming algorithms can obtain similar results in less time than previous methods.

 - **Abstract**
 I critically review some claims in the paper ``Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonations'' (arXiv:2405.19417). The claim of that paper that the community converges on a leading scenario of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the double detonation scenario, is wrong, as hundreds of papers in recent years study five and more different SN Ia scenarios and their channels. Moreover, the finding by that paper that the double detonation scenario with the explosion of the secondary white dwarf (WD; the mass-donor WD) is common, i.e., the triple-detonation channel and the quadruple-detonation sub-channel, implies highly no-spherical explosions. The highly non-spherical explosions contradict the morphologies of many SN Ia remnants. I find that the results of that paper strengthen the claim that the double detonation scenario (with its channels) might account for a non-negligible fraction of peculiar SNe Ia but only for a very small fraction (or non at all) of normal SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Most studies of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares have identified characteristic periods in the 5 - 300s range. Due to observational limitations there have been few attempts to probe the < 5s period regime and understand the prevalence of such short-period quasi-periodic pulsations. However, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has observed approximately 1500 solar flares to date in high cadence 16 Hz burst mode, providing us with an opportunity to study short-period quasi-periodic pulsations at X-ray energies. We systematically analyse every solar flare observed by Fermi/GBM in burst mode, estimating the prevalence of quasi-periodic pulsations in multiple X-ray energy bands. To better understand these results, we complement this with analysis of synthetic solar flare lightcurves, both with and without oscillatory signals present. Using these synthetic lightcurves, we can understand the likely false alarm and true positive rates in the real solar GBM data. We do not find strong evidence for widespread short-period quasi-periodic pulsations, indicating either a low base occurrence rate of such signatures or that their typical signal-to-noise ratios must be low - less than 1 - in Fermi/GBM data. Finally, we present a selection of the most interesting potential quasi-periodic pulsation events that were identified in the GBM solar X-ray data.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and post-merger objects, and fit them to analytic functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of post-mergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as post-mergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets, are expected to be gravitationally unstable in their early phase of evolution. IM Lup, a well-known T-Tauri star, is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms likely caused by gravitational instability. The IM Lup disk has been observed using various methods, but developing a unified explanatory model is challenging. Here we present a physical model of the IM Lup disk that offers a comprehensive explanation for diverse observations spanning from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. Our findings underscore the importance of dust fragility in retaining the observed millimeter emission and reveal the preference for moderately porous dust to explain observed millimeter polarization. We also find that the inner disk region is likely heated by gas accretion, providing a natural explanation for bright millimeter emission within 20 au. The actively heated inner region in the model casts a 100-au-scale shadow, aligning seamlessly with the near-infrared scattered light observation. The presence of accretion heating also supports the fragile dust scenario in which accretion efficiently heat the disk midplane. Due to the fragility of dust, it is unlikely that a potential embedded planet at 100 au formed via pebble accretion in a smooth disk, pointing to local dust enhancement boosting pebble accretion or alternative pathways such as outward migration or gravitational fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory is the most sensitive instrument to detect photons with energies above $10^{17}$ eV. It measures extensive air showers generated by ultra high energy cosmic rays using a hybrid technique that exploits the combination of a fluorescence detector with a ground array of particle detectors. The signatures of a photon-induced air shower are a larger atmospheric depth of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$) and a steeper lateral distribution function, along with a lower number of muons with respect to the bulk of hadron-induced cascades. In this work, a new analysis technique in the energy interval between 1 and 30 EeV (1 EeV = $10^{18}$ eV) has been developed by combining the fluorescence detector-based measurement of $X_{max}$ with the specific features of the surface detector signal through a parameter related to the air shower muon content, derived from the universality of the air shower development. No evidence of a statistically significant signal due to photon primaries was found using data collected in about 12 years of operation. Thus, upper bounds to the integral photon flux have been set using a detailed calculation of the detector exposure, in combination with a data-driven background estimation. The derived 95% confidence level upper limits are 0.0403, 0.01113, 0.0035, 0.0023, and 0.0021 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 EeV, respectively, leading to the most stringent upper limits on the photon flux in the EeV range. Compared with past results, the upper limits were improved by about 40% for the lowest energy threshold and by a factor 3 above 3 EeV, where no candidates were found and the expected background is negligible. The presented limits can be used to probe the assumptions on chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and allow for the constraint of the mass and lifetime phase space of super-heavy dark matter particles.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Because of their extreme densities and consequently, gravitational potential, compact objects such as neutron stars can prove to be excellent captors of dark matter particles. Considering purely gravitational interactions between dark and hadronic matter, we construct dark matter admixed stars composed of two-fluid matter subject to current astrophysical constraints of maximum mass and tidal deformability. We choose a wide range of parameters to construct the dark matter equation of state, and the DDME2 parameterization for the hadronic equation of state. We then examine the effect of dark matter on the stellar structure, tidal deformability and non-radial modes considering the relativistic Cowling approximation. We find the effect on $p$-modes is substantial, with frequencies decreasing up to the typical $f-$mode frequency range for most stars with a dark matter halo. The effects on the $f-$mode frequency are less extreme. Finally, we find the most probable and $1\sigma$ values of the dark matter parameters used in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 The transition of an impulsively excited kink oscillation of a solar coronal loop to an oscillation with a stationary amplitude, i.e., the damping pattern, is determined using the low-dimensional self-oscillation model. In the model, the decayless kink oscillations are sustained by the interaction of the oscillating loop with an external quasi-steady flow. The analytical solution is based on the assumption that the combined effect of the effective dissipation, for example, by resonant absorption, and interaction with an external flow, is weak. The effect is characterised by a dimensionless coupling parameter. The damping pattern is found to depend upon the initial amplitude and the coupling parameter. The approximate expression shows a good agreement with a numerical solution of the self-oscillation equation. The plausibility of the established damping pattern is demonstrated by an observational example. Notably, the damping pattern is not exponential, and the characteristic decay time is different from the time determined by the traditionally used exponential damping fit. Implications of this finding for seismology of the solar coronal plasmas are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that a very rapid, in less than the oscillation period, decay of the oscillation to the stationary level, achieved for larger values of the coupling parameter, can explain the relative rareness of the kink oscillation events.

 - **Abstract**
 In any cosmological model where spacetime is described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, photons propagate along null geodesics, and their number is conserved, upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) observations can be combined with measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) angular scale to provide model-independent estimates of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. By focusing on the accuracy expected from forthcoming surveys such as LISA GW standard sirens and DESI or Euclid angular BAO measurements, we forecast a relative precision of $\sigma_{r_{\rm d}} /r_{\rm d} \sim 1.5\%$ within the redshift range $z \lesssim 1$. This approach will offer a unique model-independent measure of a fundamental scale characterizing the early universe, which is competitive with model-dependent values inferred within specific theoretical frameworks. These measurements can serve as a consistency test for $\Lambda$CDM, potentially clarifying the nature of the Hubble tension and confirming or ruling out new physics prior to recombination with a statistical significance of $\sim 4\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle<4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type-II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and Cosmic Shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z < \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.

 - **Abstract**
 Transiently accreting Low Mass X-Ray Binaries have the potential to probe the core composition of their neutron stars via deep crustal heating caused by nuclear reactions. We statistically assess this deep crustal heating scenario, taking into account the various microphysical and astrophysical uncertainties. We find that despite the sizable uncertainties there is the chance to discriminate different compositional scenarios. Several observed sources statistically challenge a minimal hadronic matter composition, where cooling proceeds exclusively via slow modified Urca reactions. Considering here two exemplary extended uniform compositions, namely ultra-dense hadronic matter with direct Urca emission and ungapped quark matter, we find that they are even within uncertainties distinguishable. We show that although exotic forms of matter are generally only expected in an inner core, which could in principle have any size, sufficiently large astrophysical data sets nonetheless have the potential to statistically discriminate compositional scenarios, in particular when further mass measurements become available.
