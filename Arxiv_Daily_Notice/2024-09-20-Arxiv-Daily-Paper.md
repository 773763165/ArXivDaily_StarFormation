 - **Abstract**
 We present a velocity-resolved reverberation mapping analysis of the hypervariable quasar RM160 (SDSS J141041.25+531849.0) at z = 0.359 with 153 spectroscopic epochs of data representing a ten-year baseline (2013-2023). We split the baseline into two regimes based on the 3x flux increase in the light curve: a 'low state' phase during the years 2013-2019 and a 'high state' phase during the years 2022-2023. The velocity-resolved lag profiles (VRLP) indicate that gas with different kinematics dominates the line emission in different states. The H\b{eta} VRLP begins with a signature of inflow onto the BLR in the 'low state', while in the 'high state' it is flatter with less signature of inflow. The H{\alpha} VRLP begins consistent with a virialized BLR in the 'low state', while in the 'high state' shows a signature of inflow. The differences in the kinematics between the Balmer lines and between the 'low state' and the 'high state' suggests complex BLR dynamics. We find that the BLR radius and velocity (both FWHM and {\sigma}) do not obey a constant virial product throughout the monitoring period. We find that BLR lags and continuum luminosity are correlated, consistent with rapid response of the BLR gas to the illuminating continuum. The BLR kinematic profile changes in unpredictable ways that are not related to continuum changes and reverberation lag. Our observations indicate that non-virial kinematics can significantly contribute to observed line profiles, suggesting caution for black-hole mass estimation in luminous and highly varying quasars like RM160.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying infall motions is crucial for our understanding of accretion processes in regions of star formation. The NH3 (1,1) hyperfine intensity anomaly (HIA) has been proposed to be a readily usable tracer for such infall motions in star-forming regions harboring young stellar objects at very early evolutionary stages. In this paper, we seek to study the HIA toward fifteen infall candidate regions to assess its reliability as an infall tracer. By using deep observations of the NH3 (1,1) transition with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope, HIAs have been identified toward all the targets. Fourteen out of fifteen sources exhibit anomalous intensities either in the inner or outer satellite lines. All the derived HIAs conform to the framework of the existing two models, namely, hyperfine selective trapping (HST) and systematic contraction or expansion motion (CE) models. In our sample of infall candidates, a majority of the HIAs remain consistent with the HST model. Only in three targets, the HIAs are consistent with infall motions under the CE model. Thus HIAs could be used as an infall tracer but seem not highly sensitive to infall motions in our single-dish data. Nevertheless, the emission could be blended with emission from outflow activities. HIAs consistent with the HST model show stronger anomalies with increasing kinetic temperatures (Tk), which is expected by the HST model. On the other hand, HIAs consistent with infall motions show little dependence on Tk. Therefore, HIAs may preferably trace infall of cold gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the orbital motion of stars around Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center provides a unique opportunity to probe the gravitational potential near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Galaxy. Interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) since 2016 has allowed us to achieve unprecedented precision in tracking the orbits of these stars. GRAVITY data have been key to detecting the in-plane, prograde Schwarzschild precession of the orbit of the star S2, as predicted by General Relativity. By combining astrometric and spectroscopic data from multiple stars, including S2, S29, S38, and S55 - for which we have data around their time of pericenter passage with GRAVITY - we can now strengthen the significance of this detection to an approximately $10 \sigma$ confidence level. The prograde precession of S2's orbit provides valuable insights into the potential presence of an extended mass distribution surrounding Sagittarius A*, which could consist of a dynamically relaxed stellar cusp comprised of old stars and stellar remnants, along with a possible dark matter spike. Our analysis, based on two plausible density profiles - a power-law and a Plummer profile - constrains the enclosed mass within the orbit of S2 to be consistent with zero, establishing an upper limit of approximately $1200 \, M_\odot$ with a $1 \sigma$ confidence level. This significantly improves our constraints on the mass distribution in the Galactic Center. Our upper limit is very close to the expected value from numerical simulations for a stellar cusp in the Galactic Center, leaving little room for a significant enhancement of dark matter density near Sagittarius A*.

          On the Gravitational Wave Counterpart to a Gamma-ray Galactic Center Signal from Millisecond Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 The new tools of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy allow for the study of astrophysical phenomenon in new ways and enables light to be shed on some of the longest-enduring mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. Among the latter stands the Galactic center gamma-ray excess, associated with a source whose nature could be annihilating dark matter or a yet-unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). MSPs are most likely asymmetric about their axis of rotation, and are thus thought to also source quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves, that dark matter processes would not emit. Using statistical methods, we simulate realistic MSP population samples with differing morphology and moment of inertia, that could give rise to the gamma-ray excess, and we compute the corresponding gravitational wave signal amplitude and frequency. We find that the gravitational wave signal frequency likely ranges between $\sim$200 and 1400 Hz, and that the collective dimensionless strain from the center of the Galaxy has an amplitude between $10^{-26}$ and $10^{-24}$, thus most likely beyond current and near-term detectors, unless the unresolved MSPs are extraordinarily gamma-ray dim.

          Life in the Bubble: How a nearby supernova left ephemeral footprints on the cosmic-ray spectrum and indelible imprints on life

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth sits inside a 300pc-wide void that was carved by a series of supernova explosions that went off tens of millions of years ago, pushing away interstellar gas and creating a bubble-like structure. The 60Fe peak deposits found in the deep-sea crust have been interpreted by the imprints left by the ejecta of supernova explosions occurring about 2-3 and 5-6 Myr ago. It is likely that the 60Fe peak at about 2-3 Myr originated from a supernova occurring in the Upper Centaurus Lupus association in Scorpius Centaurus (140 pc) or the Tucana Horologium association (70 pc). Whereas, the 5-6 Myr peak is likely attributed to the solar system's entrance into the bubble. In this Letter, we show that the supernova source responsible for synthesizing the 60Fe peak deposits 2-3 Myr ago was also likely a Galactic PeVatron source. We demonstrate that this supernova can consistently explain the "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum and the large-scale anisotropy between 100 TeV and 100 PeV. Matching the intensity and shape of the cosmic-ray spectrum allows us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic-ray energy content from the supernova as well as on the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Making use of such constraints we provide a robust estimate of the temporal variation of terrestrial ionizing cosmic radiation levels and discuss their implications in the development of early life on Earth by plausibly influencing the mutation rate and, as such, conceivably assisting in the evolution of complex organisms.

 - **Abstract**
 With close to three years of observations in hand, the NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) is starting to unearth new astrophysical signals for a curated sample of bright, radial velocity (RV)-quiet stars. We present the discovery of the first NETS exoplanet, HD 86728 b, a $m_p\sin i = 9.16^{+0.55}_{-0.56}\ \rm{M}_\oplus$ planet on a circular, $P=31.1503^{+0.0062}_{-0.0066}$ d orbit, thereby confirming a candidate signal identified by Hirsch et al. (2021). We confirm the planetary origin of the detected signal, which has a semi-amplitude of just $K=1.91^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$ m s$^{-1}$, via careful analysis of the NEID RVs and spectral activity indicators, and we constrain the mass and orbit via fits to NEID and archival RV measurements. The host star is intrinsically quiet at the $\sim1$ m s$^{-1}$ level, with the majority of this variability likely stemming from short-timescale granulation. HD 86728 b is among the small fraction of exoplanets with similar masses and periods that have no known planetary siblings.

 - **Abstract**
 Spitzer 'hidden' observations of the background are used to construct a catalog of 4,090 spectra and examine the signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their connection to extinction by dust. A strong positive correlation is recovered between WISE12, E(B-V), and the 11.2 $\mu$m PAH band. For 0.06 $\leq$ E(B-V) $\leq$ 5.0, correlations of the 6.2, 11.2, and 12.7 $\mu$m PAH band are positive with E(B-V). Three dust temperature regimes are revealed. Correlations with WISE12 are well-constrained and that with 12.7/11.2 is flat. Decomposition with the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database reveals a tentative positive correlation between the 6.2/11.2 and the PAH ionization fraction, while that with 12.7/11.2 is slightly negative, suggesting PAH structural changes. The relation with PAH size and 6.2/11.2 is negative, while that with 12.7/11.2 is positive. Averaging spectra into five E(B-V) and three T$_{\rm dust}$ bins shows an evolution in PAH emission and variations in 12.7/11.2. Database-fits show an increase in $f_{\rm i}$ and the PAH ionization parameter $\gamma$, but a more stable large PAH fraction. While the largest $\gamma$s are associated with the highest T$_{\rm dust}$, there is no one-to-one correlation. The analysis is hampered by low-quality data at short wavelengths. There are indications that PAHs in the more-diffuse backgrounds behave differently from those in the general interstellar medium. However, they are often still associated with larger scale filamentary cloud-like structures. The spectra and auxiliary data have been made available through the Ames Background Interstellar Medium Spectral Catalog and may guide JWST programs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer satellite mission scheduled for launch in 2027 and designed to conduct an all-sky survey in the energy range of 0.2-5 MeV. Its instrument consists of an array of germanium detectors surrounded on four sides and underneath by active shields that work as anticoincidence system (ACS) to reduce the contribution of background events in the detectors. These shields are composed of bismuth germanium oxide (BGO), a scintillator material, coupled with Silicon photomultipliers, aimed to collect optical photons produced from interaction of ionizing particles in the BGO and convert them into an electric signal. The reference simulation framework for COSI is MEGAlib, a set of software tools based on the Geant4 toolkit. The interaction point of the incoming radiation, the design of the ACS modules and the BGO surface treatment change the light collection and the overall shielding accuracy. The use of the Geant4 optical physics library, with the simulation of the scintillation process, is mandatory for a more realistic evaluation of the ACS performances. However, including the optical processes in MEGAlib would dramatically increase the computing time of the COSI simulations. We propose the use of a response function encoding the energy resolution and 3D light yield correction based on a separate Geant4 simulation of the ACS that includes the full optical interaction. We present the verification of the Geant4 optical physics library against analytical computations and available laboratory measurements obtained using PMTs as readout device, as a preparatory phase for the simulation of the COSI ACS response.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance and distribution of metal in asteroid surfaces can be constrained from thermal emission measurements at radio wavelengths, informing our understanding of planetesimal differentiation processes. We observed the M-type asteroid (22) Kalliope and its moon Linus in thermal emission at 1.3, 9, and 20 mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) over most of Kalliope's rotation period. The 1.3 mm data provide ~30 km resolution on the surface of Kalliope, while both the 1.3 and 9 mm data resolve Linus from Kalliope. We find a thermal inertia for Kalliope of 116$^{+326}_{-91}$ J m$^{-2}$ s$^{-0.5}$ K$^{-1}$ and emissivities of 0.65$\pm$0.02 at 1.3 mm, 0.56$\pm$0.03 at 9 mm, and 0.77$\pm$0.02 at 20 mm. Kalliope's millimeter wavelength emission is suppressed compared to its centimeter wavelength emission, and is also depolarized. We measure emissivities for Linus of 0.73$\pm$0.04 and 0.85$\pm$0.17 at 1.3 and 9 mm respectively, indicating a less metal-rich surface composition for Linus. Spatial variability in Kalliope's emissivity reveals a region in the northern hemisphere with a high dielectric constant, suggestive of enhanced metal content. These results are together consistent with a scenario in which Linus formed from reaggregated ejecta from an impact onto a differentiated Kalliope, leaving Kalliope with a higher surface metal content than Linus, which is distributed heterogeneously across its surface. The low emissivity and lack of polarization suggest a reduced regolith composition where iron is in the form of metallic grains and constitutes ~25% of the surface composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars are born in the crowded environments of gradually forming star clusters. Dynamical interactions between close-passing stars and the evolving UV radiation fields from proximate massive stars are expected to sculpt the protoplanetary discs in these clusters, potentially contributing to the diversity of planetary systems that we observe. Here, we investigate the impact of cluster environment on disc demographics by implementing simple protoplanetary disc evolution models within $N$-body simulations of gradual star cluster formation. We consider a range of star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and mass surface density of the natal cloud environment, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, both of which affect the overall duration of cluster formation. We track the interaction history of all stars to estimate the dynamical truncation of the discs around stars involved in close encounters. We also track external photoevaporation of the discs due to the ionizing radiation field of the nearby high- and intermediate-mass ($> 5 M_\odot$) stars. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and the degree of primordial binarity have major influences on the masses and radii of the disc population. In particular, external photo-evaporation has a greater impact than dynamical interactions in determining the fate of discs in our clusters.

          Simulating Self-Lensing and Eclipsing Signals due to Detached Compact Objects in the TESS Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of Galactic stars have compact companions which could be white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs) or stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). In a detached and edge-on binary system including a main-sequence star and a compact object (denoted by WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems), the stellar brightness can change periodically due to self-lensing or eclipsing features. The shape of a self-lensing signals is a degenerate function of stellar radius and compact object's mass because the self-lensing peak strongly depends on the projected source radius normalized to Einstein radius. Increasing the inclination angle $i$ changes the self-lensing shape from a strict top-hat model to one with slow-increasing edges. We simulate stellar light curves due to these binary systems which are observed by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope and evaluate the efficiencies to detect their periodic signatures using two sets of criteria (i)SNR$>3$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}>1$ (Low-Confidence, LC), and (ii) SNR$>5$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}>2$ (High-Confidence, HC). The HC efficiencies for detecting WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems with the inclination angle $i<20^{\circ}$ during different time spans are $5$-$7\%$, $4.5$-$6\%$, and $4$-$5\%$, respectively. Detecting lensing-induced features is possible in only $\lesssim3\%$ and $\lesssim33\%$ of detectable WDMS and NSMS events. The detection efficiencies for closer source stars with higher priorities are higher and drop to zero for $b\gtrsim R_{\star}$, where $b\simeq \tan(i) a$ is the impact parameter($a$ is the semi-major axis). We predict the numbers of WDs, NSs, and SBHs that are discovered from the TESS Candidate Target List stars are $15$-$18$, $6$-$7$, and $<1$.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray Timing Instrument as part of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer has the potential to examine the time-domain properties of compact objects in regimes not explored by previous timing instruments, due to its combination of high effective area and timing resolution. We consider the effects of instrumental deadtime at a range of effective countrates in a series of observations of the X-ray binary GX 339-4 to determine what effect deadtime has on photometric and Fourier frequency-domain products. We find that there are no significant inconsistencies across the functional detectors in the instrument, and that in the regimes where instrumental deadtime is a limiting factor on observations that previous approaches to dealing with deadtime, as applied to RXTE and other detectors, are still appropriate, and that performing deadtime corrections to lightcurves before creating Fourier products are not necessary at the count rates considered in our analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Fast Radio Burst 20180916B is a repeating FRB whose activity window has a 16.34 day periodicity that also shifts and varies in duration with the observing frequency. Recently, arXiv:2205.09221 reported the FRB has started to show secular Rotation Measure (RM) increasing trend after only showing stochastic variability around a constant value of $-114.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ since its discovery. Aims. We aim to further study the RM variability of FRB 20180916B. The data comes from the ongoing campaigns of FRB 20180916B using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The majority of the observations are in Band 4, which is centered at 650 MHz with 200 MHz bandwidth. Methods. We apply a standard single pulse search pipeline to search for bursts. In total, we detect 116 bursts with $\sim$36 hours of on-source time spanning 1200 days, with two bursts detected during simultaneous frequency coverage observations. We develop and apply a polarization calibration strategy suited for our dataset. On the calibrated bursts, we use QU-fitting to measure RM. Lastly, we also measure various other properties such as rate, linear polarization fraction and fluence distribution. Results. Of the 116 detected bursts, we could calibrate 79 of them. From which, we observed in our early observations the RM continued to follow linear trend as modeled by arXiv:2205.09221. However, our later observations suggest the source switch from the linear trend to stochastic variations around a constant value of $-58.75$ rad m$^{-2}$. We also study cumulative rate against fluence and note that rate at higher fluences (> 1.2 Jy ms) scales as $\gamma = -1.09(7)$ whereas that at lower fluences (between 0.2 and 1.2 Jy ms) only scales as $\gamma = -0.51(1)$, meaning rate at higher fluence regime is steeper than at lower fluence regime.

          Bridging the Gap: GRB 230812B -- A Three-Second Supernova-Associated Burst Detected by the GRID Mission

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 230812B, detected by the Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) constellation mission, is an exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration of only 3 seconds. Sitting near the traditional boundary ($\sim$ 2 s) between long and short GRBs, GRB 230812B is notably associated with a supernova (SN), indicating a massive star progenitor. This makes it a rare example of a short-duration GRB resulting from stellar collapse. Our analysis, using a time-evolving synchrotron model, suggests that the burst has an emission radius of approximately $10^{14.5}$~cm. We propose that the short duration of GRB 230812B is due to the combined effects of the central engine's activity time and the time required for the jet to break through the stellar envelope. Our findings provide another case that challenges the conventional view that short-duration GRBs originate exclusively from compact object mergers, demonstrating that a broader range of durations exists for GRBs arising from the collapse of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new results of a numerical study of the pumping of 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz maser of o-Formaldehyde in the presence of a free-free radiation field. It is shown that in the presence of a free-free radiation field inversion of not only the 4.8 GHz transition, but also the 14.5 GHz transition and other doublet state transitions occur. Further results are presented to illustrate how, as a consequence of the pumping scheme, the inversion of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz transitions respond to the free-free radiation fields associated with HII regions with different emission measures and levels of geometric dilution with respect to the masing region. We also discuss the criticism raised in the past by various authors against the pumping of the 4.8 GHz Formaldehyde masers by a free-free radiation field. It is argued that the rarity of the Formaldehyde masers is not to be ascribed to the pumping scheme but to other factors such as, e.g., the evolution of the associated HII region or the chemical evolution of the star forming region which determines the Formaldehyde abundance or a combination of both.

 The anions C$_7$N$^-$ and C$_{10}$H$^-$ are the two longest of the linear (C,N)-bearing and (C,H)-bearing chains which have so far been detected in the Interstellar Medium. In order to glean information on their collision-induced rotational state-changing processes, we analyse the general features of new ab initio potentials describing the interaction of both linear anions with H$_2$, one of the most abundant partners in their ISM environment. We employ an artificial neural network fit of the reduced-dimensionality potential energy surface for C$_7$N$^-$...H$_2$ interaction and discuss in detail the spatial features in terms of multipolar radial coefficients. For the C$_{10}$H$^-$...H$_2$ interaction we use the initial grid of two dimensional raw points to generate by quadrature the Legendre expansion directly, further including the long-range terms as discussed in the main text. Quantum scattering calculations are employed to obtain rotationally inelastic cross sections, for collision energies in the range of 10$^{-4}$ to 400 cm$^{-1}$. From them we generate the corresponding inelastic rate coefficients as a function of temperature covering the range from 10 to 50 K. The results for the rate coefficients for the longest cyanopolyyne are compared with the earlier results obtained for the smaller terms of the same series, also in collision with H$_2$. We obtain that the inelastic rate coefficients for the long linear anions are all fairly large compared with the earlier systems. The consequences of such findings on their non-equilibrium rotational populations in interstellar environments are illustrated in our conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems comprise approximately 15 per cent of the near-Earth asteroid population, yet thermal-infrared data are often interpreted for these bodies as if they are single objects. Thermal-IR light curves of binary asteroids (3905) Doppler and (175706) 1996 FG3 are analysed using an adaptation of the Advanced Thermophysical Model, deriving new constraints on their thermal inertias as $\Gamma = 114 \pm 31 \mathrm{J} \mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{K}^{-1} \mathrm{s}^{-1/2}$ and $\Gamma = 142 \pm 6 \mathrm{J} \mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{K}^{-1} \mathrm{s}^{-1/2}$, respectively. We determine that this adapted model is suitable for binary systems where their primary rotation to secondary orbit period ratios can be approximately characterised by small integers. Objects with more complex orbital states require a model with alternative temperature convergence methodologies. Thermal inertia is shown to have a strong effect on binary thermophysical light curve morphology, introducing significant modulations both inside and outside of mutual event times. The depth of eclipse events are shown to be suppressed at longer wavelengths due to the sensitivity to cooler parts of the surface, meanwhile surface roughness is shown to have little effect on the thermal light curve morphology. A proof of concept model for the (65803) Didymos system is demonstrated, showing how such a binary model could be used to study the system during the European Space Agency's Hera mission, and the applicability of this adapted model to NASA's Lucy mission is also briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 During the core collapse of a massive star just before its supernova explosion, the amplification of asymmetric motions by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) imprints on the neutrino flux and the gravitational waves a frequency signature carrying direct information on the explosion process. The physical interpretation of this multi-messenger signature requires a detailed understanding of the instability mechanism. A perturbative analysis is used to characterize the properties of SASI, and assess the effect of the region of neutronization above the surface of the proto-neutron star. The eigenfrequencies of the most unstable modes are compared to those obtained in an adiabatic approximation where neutrino interactions are neglected above the neutrinosphere. The differential system is solved analytically using a Wronskian method and approximated asymptotically for a large shock radius. The oscillation period of SASI is well fitted with a simple analytic function of the shock radius, the radius of maximum deceleration and the mass of the proto-neutron star. The oscillation period is weakly dependent on the parametrized cooling function which however affects the SASI growth rate. The general properties of SASI eigenmodes are described using an adiabatic model. In this approximation the eigenvalue problem is formulated as a self-forced oscillator. The forcing agent is the radial advection of baroclinic vorticity perturbations and entropy perturbations produced by the shock oscillation. The differential system defining the eigenfrequencies is reduced to a single integral equation. Its analytical approximation sheds light on the radially extended character of the region of advective-acoustic coupling. The simplicity of this adiabatic formalism opens new perspectives to investigate the effect of stellar rotation and non-adiabatic processes on SASI.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying high-energy cosmic-ray air showers through the radio emission produced by their secondary particles is a well-established technique. However, due to the increasing size and density of the radio arrays, analyses are running into computational limits, as these rely on Monte Carlo simulations to model the emission. To address this, we have been developing template synthesis. With this method, we use semi-analytical expressions to describe how the radio emission from an air shower depends on the shower age and the position of the antenna with respect to the shower. These expressions are extracted from a set of microscopic simulations, thus benefiting from their accuracy. Once obtained, we can use these relations to synthesise the emission from an air shower with any longitudinal profile, by using a single Monte Carlo simulation as an input. Previously we have demonstrated that this hybrid approach can synthesise the radio emission from air showers and agrees with results from microscopic simulations within 10%. The method was however limited to a specific geometry. Here we present our first step towards generalising template synthesis across geometries. We found a set of scaling relations which correct for the shower geometry as well as the viewing angle under which the radiation is observed. This allows us to reformulate the semi-analytical relations in a way that does not longer depend on the geometry, significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be fitted. We apply these scaling relations to a simulation library of CORSIKA showers with a zenith angle of 50 degrees. We then extract the semi-analytical expressions required for template synthesis, and use them to synthesise the emission from air showers with lower zenith angles. We investigate the accuracy by comparing both to microscopic simulations as well as the single geometry version of template synthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last few decades, radio detection has become one of the standard techniques to study high-energy cosmic-ray air showers. For the purpose of analysing the data, we heavily rely on Monte Carlo simulations. Upcoming dense radio array experiments such as LOFAR2.0 and SKA will, however, reach the limit of what is computationally feasible with these. Other techniques are available, based on macroscopic quantities, but their accuracy has thus far not been adequate to use them in precision analyses. In this contribution we present the latest update on the template synthesis approach, a hybrid model using both micro- and macroscopic inputs to synthesise the radio emission for an air shower with an arbitrary longitudinal profile. The method starts from the emission of a given shower and employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the atmospheric depth at shower maximum and antenna position in order to transform it. Core to the template synthesis approach is the slicing of the atmosphere. By considering the radio emission from each slice separately, we only need to explicitly account for shower age effects. In previous work it was shown this could be done over a wide range of primary energy and across primary types for vertical air showers, with an accuracy of 10%. Here, we generalise the method to other zenith angles. We investigate the potential to synthesise between different geometries using a data set consisting of several hundreds of CORSIKA showers with primary energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel way to synthesise the radio emission from extensive air showers. It is a hybrid approach which uses a single microscopic Monte-Carlo simulation to generate the radio emission from a shower with a different longitudinal evolution, primary particle type and energy. The method employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the shower parameters to transform the radio signal in the simulated antennas. We apply this method to vertical air showers with energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV and compare the results with CoREAS using two different metrics. In order to gauge the performance over our simulation set, we subsequently use every shower in the set as a template to synthesise the emission from the other showers. Depending on the scoring metric, template synthesis reconstructs the radio emission with an accuracy of 5 to 10%.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac (EHBL) source, 1ES 0229$+$200. Our study utilizes near-simultaneous data collected at various epochs between September 2017 and August 2021 (MJD: 58119$-$59365) from different instruments, including {\em AstroSat}$-$UVIT, SXT, LAXPC, {\em Swift}$-$UVOT, {\em Fermi}-LAT, and MAGIC. We investigate the one-zone synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, employing diverse particle distributions such as the log parabola, broken power law, power law with a maximum electron energy $\gamma$, energy-dependent diffusion (EDD), and energy-dependent acceleration (EDA) models to fit the broadband SED of the source. Our findings indicate that both peaks in the SED are well described by the one-zone SSC model across all particle distribution models. We estimate the jet power for different particle distributions. The estimated jet power for broken power law particle distributions is found to be on the order of $10^{47}$ ($10^{44}$) erg s$^{-1}$ for a minimum electron energy $\gamma_{min}$ $\sim$10 (10$^4$). However, for intrinsically curved particle energy distributions (e.g., log parabola, EDD, and EDA models), the estimated jet power is $\sim$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The SED fitting at five epochs enables us to explore the correlation between the derived spectral parameters of various particle distribution models. Notably, the observed correlations are inconsistent with the predictions in the power-law with a maximum $\gamma$ model, although the EDD and EDA models yield the correlations as expected. Moreover, the estimated physical parameter values are consistent with the model assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) represent a dynamic category of celestial sources that establish a crucial connection between low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit transitions from rotation-powered states to accretion-powered ones and vice versa, highlighting the tight evolutionary link expected by the so-called recycling scenario. In their active phase, these sources manifest two distinct emission modes named high and low, occasionally punctuated by sporadic flares. Here, we present high-time-resolution spectroscopic observations of the binary tMSP J1023+0038, in the sub-luminous disc state. This is the first short-timescale (~ 1 min) optical spectroscopic campaign ever conducted on a tMSP. The campaign was carried out over the night of June 10, 2021 using the Gran Telescopio Canarias. The optical continuum shows erratic variability, without clear evidence of high and low modes or of orbital modulation. Besides, the analysis of these high-temporal-cadence spectroscopic observations reveals, for the first time, evidence for a significant (up to a factor of ~ 2) variability in the emission line properties (equivalent width and full width half maximum) over a timescale of minutes. Intriguingly, the variability episodes observed in the optical continuum and in the emission line properties seem uncorrelated, making their origin unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the final results of the Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) on the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, under NASA's Strategic Astrophysics Technology program. The HiCAT testbed was developed over the past decade to enable a system-level demonstration of coronagraphy for exoplanet direct imaging with the future Habitable Wolds Observatory. HiCAT includes an active, segmented telescope simulator, a coronagraph, and metrology systems (Low-order and Mid-Order Zernike Wavefront Sensors, and Phase Retrieval camera). These results correspond to an off-axis (un-obscured) configuration, as was envisioned in the 2020 Decadal Survey Recommendations. Narrowband and broadband dark holes are generated using two continuous deformable mirrors (DM) to control high order wavefront aberrations, and low-order drifts can be further stabilized using the LOWFS loop. The APLC apodizers, manufactured using carbon nanotubes, were optimized for broadband performance and include the calibrated geometric aperture. HiCAT is, to this date, the only testbed facility able to demonstrate high-contrast coronagraphy with a truly segmented aperture, as is required for the Habitable World Observatory, albeit limited to ambient conditions. Results presented here include $6\times 10^{-8}$ (90% CI) contrast in 9% bandpass in a 360 deg dark hole with inner and outer working angles of $4.4 \lambda/D_{pupil}$ and $11 \lambda/D_{pupil}$ . Narrowband contrast (3% bandpass) reaches $2.4\times 10^{-8}$ (90% confidence interval).

 - **Abstract**
 To improve the performance of full-shape analyses of large-scale structure, we consider using a halo occupation distribution (HOD)-informed prior for the effective field theory (EFT) nuisance parameters. We generate 320 000 mock galaxy catalogs using 10 000 sets of HOD parameters across 32 simulation boxes with different cosmologies. We measure and fit the redshift-space power spectra using a fast emulator of the EFT model, and the resulting best-fit EFT parameter distributions are used to create the prior. This prior effectively constrains the EFT nuisance parameter space, limiting it to the space of HOD-mocks that can be well fit by a EFT model. We have tested the stability of the prior under different configurations, including the effect of varying the HOD sample distribution and the inclusion of the hexadecapole moment. We find that our HOD-informed prior and the cosmological parameter constraints derived using it are robust. While cosmological fits using the standard EFT prior suffer from prior effects, sometimes failing to recover the true cosmology within Bayesian credible intervals, the HOD-informed prior mitigates these issues and significantly improves cosmological parameter recovery for $\Lambda$CDM and beyond. This work lays the foundation for better full-shape large-scale structure analyses in current and upcoming galaxy surveys, making it a valuable tool for addressing key questions in cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We implement a simple, main beam correction in the maximum-likelihood, parametric component separation approach, which allows on accounting for different beamwidths of input maps at different frequencies without any preprocessing. We validate the approach on full-sky and cut-sky simulations and discuss the importance and impact of the assumptions and simplifications. We find that, in the cases when the underlying sky model is indeed parametric, the method successfully recovers component spectral parameters and component maps at the pre-defined resolution. The improvement on the precision of the estimated spectral parameters is found to be minor due to the redness of the foreground angular spectra, however the method is potentially more accurate, in particular if the foreground properties display strong, spatial variability, as it does not assume commutation of the beam smoothing and mixing matrix operators. The method permits a reconstruction of the CMB map with a resolution significantly superior to that of the lowest resolution map used in the analysis and with the nearly optimal noise level, facilitating exploitation of the cosmological information contained on angular scales, which would be otherwise inaccessible. The method preserves all the advantages of a pixel-domain implementation of the parametric approach, and, as it deals with the beams in the harmonic domain, it can also straightforwardly account for spatially stationary map-domain noise correlations.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.
