 - **Abstract**
 A primordial black hole (PBH) with mass $10^{-15}\leq M_{\rm PBH}/M_{\odot}\leq 10^{-10}$ is currently beyond the sensitivity of both microlensing and black hole (BH) evaporation methods. A novel scenario has been proposed: When a PBH with mass $10^{-14}\leq M_{\rm PBH}/M_{\odot}\leq 10^{-11}$ transits through a white dwarf (WD) made up of carbon and oxygen, Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion in a reactive medium creates a shock wave, which generates direct detonation ignition in the WD core and then leads to thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia). The aim of this study is to impose constraints on the PBH to dark matter (DM) abundance fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}$, via comparing the SN Ia event rates between PBH hypotheses and observational data. For PBH fraction less than unity, we found the observed event rate prefers PBH mass region, $7.6\times 10^{-13}\leq M_{\rm PBH}/M_{\odot}\leq 6.1\times 10^{-12}$, under the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. Meanwhile, the aforementioned PBH mass and abundance can be efficiently produced via a cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) in dark sector which associates with $\mathcal{O}({\rm MeV})$ energy scale and thus gives rise to complementary signals of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from $10^{-6}$ Hz to $10^{-5}$ Hz peak frequency which can be probed by future $\mu$Ares GW interferometer.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide one of the most comprehensive metallicity studies at z ~ 4 by analyzing the UV/optical HST photometry, and rest-frame VLT-FORS2 ultraviolet and VLT-XSHOOTER optical spectra of J0332-3557, a gravitationally lensed galaxy magnified by a factor of 20. With a 5{\sigma} detection of the auroral O III] {\lambda}1666 line, we are able to derive a direct gas metallicity estimate for our target. We find Zgas = 12 + log(O/H) = 8.26 +/- 0.06, which is compatible with an increasing of both the gas fraction and the outflow metal loading factor from z ~ 0 to z ~ 4. J0332 is the most metal-rich individual galaxy at z > 3.6 for which the C/O ratio has been measured. We derive a low log(C/O)= -1.02 +/- 0.2, which suggests that J0332 is in the early stages of ISM carbon enrichment driven mostly by massive stars. The low C/O also indicates that J0332 is characterized by a low star formation efficiency, higher yields of oxygen and longer burst duration. We find that the EW[C III]1906,9 is as low as ~ 3 {\AA}. The main drivers of the low EW[C III]1906,9 are the higher gas metallicity and the low C/O. J0332 is characterized by one diffuse and two more compact regions ~ 1 kpc in size. We find that the carbon emission mostly originates in the compact knots.

 - **Abstract**
 The low brightness dust emission at high Galactic latitude is of interest to study the interplay between physical processes in shaping the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM), as well as to statistically characterize dust emission as a foreground to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Progress in this avenue of research have been hampered by the difficulty of separating the dust emission from the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). We demonstrate that dust and CIB may be effectively separated based on their different structure on the sky and use the separation to characterize the structure of diffuse dust emission on angular scales where CIB is a significant component in terms of power. We use scattering transform statistics, the Wavelet Phase Harmonics (WPH), to perform a statistical component separation using Herschel SPIRE observations. This component separation is done only from observational data using non-Gaussian properties as a lever arm, and is done at a single 250 microns frequency. This method, that we validate on mock data, gives us access to non-Gaussian statistics of the interstellar dust and an output dust map essentially free from CIB contamination. Our statistical modelling characterizes the non-Gaussian structure of the diffuse ISM down to the smallest scales observed by Herschel. We recover the power-law shape of the dust power spectrum up to a wavenumber of 2 arcmin$^{-1}$ where the dust signal represents 2 percent of the total power. The output dust map reveals coherent structures at the smallest scales which were hidden by the CIB anisotropies. It opens new observational perspectives on the formation of structure in the diffuse ISM which we discuss with reference to past work. We have succeeded to perform a statistical separation from observational data only at a single frequency by using non-Gaussian statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) 140 is the archetypal periodic dust-forming colliding-wind binary that hosts a carbon-rich WR (WC) star and an O-star companion with an orbital period of 7.93 years and an orbital eccentricity of 0.9. Throughout the past several decades, multiple dust-formation episodes from WR 140 have been observed that are linked to the binary orbit and occur near the time of periastron passage. Given its predictable dust-formation episodes, WR 140 presents an ideal astrophysical laboratory for investigating the formation and evolution of dust in the hostile environment around a massive binary system. In this paper, we present near- and mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopic and imaging observations of WR 140 with Subaru/SCExAO+CHARIS, Keck/NIRC2+PyWFS, and Subaru/COMICS taken between 2020 June and Sept that resolve the circumstellar dust emission linked to its most recent dust-formation episode in 2016 Dec. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of WR 140's resolved circumstellar dust emission reveals the presence of a hot ($T_\mathrm{d}\sim1000$ K) near-IR dust component that is co-spatial with the previously known and cooler ($T_\mathrm{d}\sim500$ K) mid-IR dust component composed of $300-500$ {\AA}-sized dust grains. We attribute the hot near-IR dust emission to the presence of nano-sized ("nanodust") grains and suggest they were formed from grain-grain collisions or the rotational disruption of the larger grain size population by radiative torques in the strong radiation field from the central binary. Lastly, we speculate on the astrophysical implications of nanodust formation around colliding-wind WC binaries, which may present an early source of carbonaceous nanodust in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Our automated reaction discovery program, AutoMeKin, has been utilized to investigate the formation of glycolonitrile (HOCH$_{2}$CN) in the gas phase under the low temperatures of the interstellar medium (ISM). The feasibility of a proposed pathway depends on the absence of barriers above the energy of reactants and the availability of the suggested precursors in the ISM. Based on these criteria, several radical-radical reactions and a radical-molecule reaction have been identified as viable formation routes in the ISM. Among the radical-radical reactions, OH+CH$_{2}$CN appears to be the most relevant, considering the energy of the radicals and its ability to produce glycolonitrile in a single step. However, our analysis reveals that this reaction produces hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) and formaldehyde (CH$_{2}$O), with rate coefficients ranging from (7.3-11.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ across the temperature range of 10-150 K. This finding is particularly interesing given the persistently unexplained overabundance of hydrogen isocyanide in the ISM. Among the radical-molecule reactions investigated, the most promising one is OH+CH$_{2}$CNH, which forms glycolonitrile and atomic hydrogen with rate coefficients in the range (0.3-6.6)$\times$10$^{-10}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ within the 10-150 K temperature range. Our calculations indicate that the formation of both hydrogen isocyanide and glycolonitrile is efficient under the harsh conditions of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions close to the solar surface, where plasma is ejected outwards into space at large speeds. When directed towards Earth, they interfere with Earth's magnetic fields and cause strong geo-effective storms. In order to mitigate the potential damage, forecasting tools are implemented. Recently, a novel heliospheric modelling tool, Icarus, has been implemented, which exploits the open-source framework MPI-AMRVAC as its core MHD solver. This new model efficiently performs 3D MHD simulations of the solar wind and the evolution of interplanetary CMEs with the help of advanced techniques, such as adaptive mesh refinement and gradual radial grid stretching. The numerical methods applied in the simulations can have significant effects on the simulation results and on the efficiency of the model. In this study, the effect of different combinations of numerical schemes and slope limiters, for reconstructing edge-based variabes used in fluxes, is considered. We explore frequently exploited combinations from the available numerical schemes in MPI-AMRVAC: TVDLF, HLL and HLLC along with the slope limiters 'woodward', 'minmod', 'vanleer', and 'koren'. For analysis purposes, we selected one particular solar wind configuration and studied the influence on variables at 1 AU in the equatorial plane. The goal is to find the optimal combination to produce accurate results fast and in a robust way so that the model can be reliable for day-to-day use by space weather scientists. As a conclusion, the best result assessed with these two criteria is the combination of the TVDLF scheme with the 'woodward' limiter.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been shown that the nonminimal coupling between geometry and matter can provide models for massive compact Stars \citep{ElHanafy:2022kjl}, which are consistent with the conformal bound on the sound speed, $0\leq c_s^2 \leq c^2/3$, where the core density approaches a few times the nuclear saturation density. We impose the conformal sound speed upper bound constraint on Rastall's field equations of gravity, with Krori-Barua potentials in presence of an anisotropic fluid as a matter source, to estimate the radius of the most massive pulsar PSR J0952\textendash{0607} ever observed. For its measured mass $M = 2.35\pm 0.17\, M_\odot$, we obtain a radius $R=14.087 \pm 1.0186$~km as inferred by the model. We investigate possible connection between Rastall garvity and MIT bag model with an EoS, $p_r(\rho) \approx c_s^2\left(\rho - \rho_\text{s}\right)$, in the radial direction, with $c_s=c/\sqrt{3}$ and a surface density $\rho_\text{s}$ slightly above the nuclear saturation density $\rho_\text{nuc}=2.7\times 10^{14}$~g/cm$^3$. The corresponding mass\textendash{radius} diagram is in agreement with our estimated value of the radius and with astrophysical observations of other pulsars at 68\% C.L.
#### Complete X-ray census of Mdwarfs in the solar Neighborhood I. GJ 745 AB:  Coronal-hole Stars in the 10 pc Sample

 - **Abstract**
 We have embarked in a systematic study of the X-ray emission in a volume-limited sample of M dwarf stars, in order to explore the full range of activity levels present in their coronae and, thus, to understand the conditions in their outer atmospheres and their possible impact on the circumstellar environment. We identify in a recent catalog of the Gaia objects within 10 pc from the Sun all the stars with spectral type between M0 and M4, and search systematically for X-ray measurements of this sample. To this end, we use both archival data (from ROSAT, XMM-Newton, and from the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) onboard the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission) and our own dedicated XMM-Newton observations. To make inferences on the properties of the M dwarf corona we compare the range of their observed X-ray emission levels to the flux radiated by the Sun from different types of magnetic structures: coronal holes, background corona, active regions and cores of active regions. At the current state of our project, with more than 90\% of the 10pc M dwarf sample observed in X-rays, only GJ 745 A has no detection. With an upper limit luminosity of log Lx [erg/s] < 25.4 and an X-ray surface flux of log FX,SURF [erg/cm^2/s] < 3.6 GJ 745 A defines the lower boundary of the X-ray emission level of M dwarfs. Together with its companion GJ 745 B, GJ 745 A it is the only star in this volume-complete sample located in the range of FX,SURF that corresponds to the faintest solar coronal structures, the coronal holes. The ultra-low X-ray emission level of GJ 745 B (log Lx [erg/s] = 25.6 and log FX,SURF [erg/cm^2/s] = 3.8) is entirely attributed to flaring activity, indicating that, while its corona is dominated by coronal holes, at least one magnetically active structure is present and determines the total X-ray brightness and the coronal temperature of the star.
#### An Atypical Plateau-like Extreme-ultraviolet Late-phase Solar Flare  Driven by the Non-radial Eruption of a Magnetic Flux Rope

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths reveal an EUV late phase in some solar flares, which is characterized by a second peak in the warm coronal emissions (about 3 MK) occurring several tens of minutes to a few hours after the corresponding main flare peak. We aim to clarify the physical origin of an atypical plateau-like EUV late phase in an X1.8-class solar flare occurring on 2011 September 7 from active region (AR) 11283. We first characterize the plateau-like late phase using EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) full-disk integrated irradiance observations and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) spatially-resolved imaging observations on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Then we perform a nonlinear force-free-field (NLFFF) extrapolation, from which a filament-hosting magnetic flux rope (MFR) is revealed. The eruption of the MFR is tracked both in the plane of the sky (POS) and along the line of sight (LOS) through visual inspection and spectral fitting, respectively. Finally, we carry out differential emission measure (DEM) analysis to explore the thermodynamics of the late-phase loops. The MFR shows a non-radial eruption from a fan-spine magnetic structure. The eruption of the MFR and its interaction with overlying arcades invoke multiple magnetic reconnections, which are responsible for the production of different groups of late-phase loops. Afterwards, the late-phase loops enter a long-lasting cooling stage, appearing sequentially in AIA passbands of decreasing response temperatures. Due to their different lengths, the different groups of late-phase loops cool down at different cooling rates, which makes their warm coronal emission peaks temporally separated from each other. Combing the emissions from all late-phase loops together, an elongated plateau-like late phase is formed.
#### The spatial distribution of an aromatic molecule, C6H5CN, in the cold  dark cloud TMC-1

 - **Abstract**
 We present a highly sensitive 2D line survey of TMC-1 obtained with the Yebes 40m radio telescope in the Q-band (31.13-49.53 GHz). These maps cover a region of 320 arcsec x 320 arcsec centred on the position of the QUIJOTE line survey with a spatial sampling of 20 arcsec. The region covering 240 arcsec x 240 arcsec, where a longer integration time was used, shows a homogenous sensitivity of 2-4 mK across the band. We present in this work the first determination of the spatial extent of benzonitrile (C6H5CN), which follows that of cyanopolyynes rather well, but differs significantly from that of the radicals CnH and CnN. We definitively conclude that aromatic species in TMC-1 are formed from chemical reactions involving smaller species in the densest zones of the cloud.
#### Modeling the chemical enrichment history of the Bulge Fossil Fragment  Terzan 5

 - **Abstract**
 Terzan 5 is a heavily obscured stellar system located in the inner Galaxy. It has been postulated to be a stellar relic, a Bulge Fossil Fragment witnessing the complex history of the assembly of the Milky Way bulge. In this paper, we follow the chemical enrichment of a set of putative progenitors of Terzan 5 to assess whether the chemical properties of this cluster fit within a formation scenario in which it is the remnant of a primordial building block of the bulge. We can explain the metallicity distribution function and the runs of different element-to-iron abundance ratios as functions of [Fe/H] derived from optical-infrared spectroscopy of giant stars in Terzan 5, by assuming that the cluster experienced two major star formation bursts separated by a long quiescent phase. We further predict that the most metal-rich stars in Terzan 5 are moderately He-enhanced and a large spread of He abundances in the cluster, Y = 0.26-0.335. We conclude that current observations fit within a formation scenario in which Terzan 5 originated from a pristine, or slightly metal-enriched, gas clump about one order of magnitude more massive than its present-day mass. Losses of gas and stars played a major role in shaping Terzan 5 the way we see it now. The iron content of the youngest stellar population is better explained if the white dwarfs that give rise to type Ia supernovae (the main Fe factories) sink towards the cluster center, rather than being stripped by the strong tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way in the outer regions.
