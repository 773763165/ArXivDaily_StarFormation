 - **Abstract**
 We empirically assess estimates from v3.0 of the JWST NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) using observations of resolved stars in Local Group targets taken as part of the Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science (ERS) Program. For bright stars, we find that: (i) purely Poissonian estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are in good agreement between the ETC and observations, but non-ideal effects (e.g., flat field uncertainties) are the current limiting factor in the photometric precision that can be achieved; (ii) source position offsets, relative to the detector pixels, have a large impact on the ETC saturation predictions and introducing sub-pixel dithers in the observation design can improve the saturation limits by up to ~1 mag. For faint stars, for which the sky dominates the error budget, we find that the choice in ETC extraction strategy (e.g., aperture size relative to point spread function size) can affect the exposure time estimates by up to a factor of 5. We provide guidelines for configuring the ETC aperture photometry to produce SNR predictions in line with the ERS data. Finally, we quantify the effects of crowding on the SNRs over a large dynamic range in stellar density and provide guidelines for approximating the effects of crowding on SNRs predicted by the ETC.

          The Symbiotic X-ray Binary IGR J16194-2810: A Window on the Future Evolution of Wide Neutron Star Binaries From Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical follow-up of IGR J16194-2810, a hard X-ray source discovered by the INTEGRAL mission. The optical counterpart is a $\sim500\,L_\odot$ red giant at a distance of $2.1$ kpc. We measured 16 radial velocities (RVs) of the giant over a period of $\sim 300$ days. Fitting these RVs with a Keplerian model, we find an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 192.73 \pm 0.01$ days and a companion mass function $f(M_2) = 0.361 \pm 0.005 \,M_{\odot}$. We detect ellipsoidal variability with the same period in optical light curves from the ASAS-SN survey. Joint fitting of the RVs, light curves, and the broadband SED allows us to robustly constrain the masses of both components. We find a giant mass of $M_\star = 1.02\pm 0.01\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{2} = 1.35^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\,M_{\odot}$, implying that the companion is a neutron star (NS). We recover a $4.06$-hour period in the system's TESS light curve, which we tentatively associate with the NS spin period. The giant does not yet fill its Roche lobe, suggesting that current mass transfer is primarily via winds. MESA evolutionary models predict that the giant will overflow its Roche lobe in $5$-$10$ Myr, eventually forming a recycled pulsar + white dwarf binary with a $\sim 900$ day period. IGR J16194-2810 provides a window on the future evolution of wide NS + main sequence binaries recently discovered via Gaia astrometry. As with those systems, the binary's formation history is uncertain. Before the formation of the NS, it likely survived a common envelope episode with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $\gtrsim 10$ and emerged in a wide orbit. The NS likely formed with a weak kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 100\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), as stronger kicks would have disrupted the orbit.

          Driving asymmetric red supergiants winds with binary interactions

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars in the red supergiant (RSG) phase are known to undergo strong mass loss through winds and observations indicate that a substantial part of this mass loss could be driven by localised and episodic outflows. Various mechanisms have been considered to explain this type of mass loss in RSGs, but these models often focus on single-star evolution. However, massive stars commonly evolve in binary systems, potentially interacting with their companions. Motivated by observations of the highly asymmetric circumstellar ejecta around the RSG VY~CMa, we investigate a scenario where a companion on an eccentric orbit grazes the surface of a red supergiant at periastron. The companion ejects part of the outer RSG envelope, which radiatively cools, reaching the proper conditions for dust condensation and eventually giving rise to dust-driven winds. Using simple treatments for radiative cooling and dust-driven winds, we perform 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of this scenario with a $20\,M_\odot$ RSG and a $2\,M_\odot$ companion. We follow the evolution of the binary throughout a total of 14 orbits and observe that the orbit tightens after each interaction, in turn enhancing the mass loss of subsequent interactions. We show that one such grazing interaction yields outflows of $3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$, which later results in wide asymmetric dusty ejecta, carrying a total mass of $0.185\,M_\odot$ by the end of simulations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of the binary, potential observational signatures, as well as future improvements of the model required to provide sensible predictions for the evolution of massive binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The spin evolution of stars in close binary systems can be strongly affected by tides. We investigate the rotational synchronisation of the stellar components for 69 SB1 systems and 14 SB2 B-type systems in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud using observations from the VFTS and BBC surveys. Their orbital periods range from a few to a few hundred days, while estimated primary masses for these systems are in the range 5-20 Msun with mass ratio ranges of approximately q=0.03-0.5 and q=0.6-1.0 for the SB1 and SB2 systems, respectively. Projected rotational velocities of the stellar components have been compared with their synchronous velocities derived from the orbital periods. We find that effectively all systems with orbital period of more than 10 days must be asynchronous, whilst all the systems with periods of less than 3 days are likely synchronised. In terms of the stellar fractional radius (r), our results imply that all systems with r<0.1 are asynchronous, with those having r>0.2 probably being synchronised. For the apparently synchronised systems our results are more consistent with synchronisation at the mean orbital angular velocity rather than with that at periastron.

          Accounting for Clock-Induced Charge Production in the EMCCD Gain Register

 - **Abstract**
 An electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) is often used for taking images with space telescopes and other devices. Photons hit the pixels and photo-electrons are created, and these are multiplied via impact ionization as they travel through the gain register from one gain stage to the next. A high gain means a high multiplication factor, and this is achieved through a high voltage difference across a gain stage. If the gain is high enough, the chance of clock-induced charge production in the gain register increases. The probability distribution function governing the gain process in the literature only accounts for charge multiplication if one or more electrons enters the gain register. I derive from first principles the modified probability distribution that accounts for clock-induced charge production in the gain register. I also examine some EMCCD data and show through maximum likelihood estimation that the data conform better to the modified distribution versus the usual one in the literature. The use of the modified distribution would in principle improve the accuracy of signal extraction from a frame.

          Searching for the highest energy of pulsation and critical luminosity of Swift J0243.6+6124 observed by Insight-HXMT

 - **Abstract**
 Owing to the broad energy coverage of Insight-HXMT in the hard X-ray band, we detected the highest energy of pulsation exceeding 200 keV around the 2017-2018 outburst peak of the first Galactic pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124, which is the highest energy detected from PULXs to date. We also obtained the highest energy of pulsation of every exposure during the outburst in 2017-2018, and found the highest energy is roughly positively correlated with luminosity. Using our newly developed method, we identified the critical luminosity being $4\times 10^{38}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ when the main peaks of the low and high energy pulse profiles became aligned, which separates the fan-beam dominated and pencil-beam dominated accretion regimes. Above the critical luminosity, the phase of the main peak shifted gradually from 0.5 to 0.8 until the outburst peak in all energy bands is reached, which is in agreement with the phase shift found previously at low energies. Our result is consistent with what is derived from spectral analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational radiation alone is not efficient in hardening the orbit of a wide binary black hole (BBH). By employing a toy model for the interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding BBHs, here we discuss the effect of this baryonic medium on BBH dynamics. Depending on the BBH's mass, we show that a binary surrounded by an isotropic cold neutral medium (i.e., an asymptotic temperature $T_{\infty} \approx 100$ K) with a time-averaged particle density of $\langle n_H \rangle = \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^{-3}$ can play a significant role in hardening the binary orbit over a $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ yr time scale. Additionally, this causes the black hole's mass to grow at a rate $\propto m^2$. We thus discuss the impact of the ISM on the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observables and quantify the properties of the ISM under which the latter could act as an additional important pathway for driving a subset of LVK's BBH mergers.

          The expected evolution of the binary system PTF J2238+743015.1

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems made by a low-mass CO WD and a He-donor represent possible progenitors of explosive events via He-detonation, producing low-luminosity thermonuclear Supernovae with a peculiar nucleosynthetis. Recently, the binary system PTF J223857.11+743015.1 has been suggested as one. We investigate the evolution of the PTF J223857.11+743015.1 system, composed by a 0.75Msun CO WD and a 0.390Msun subdwarf, capped by a thin H-rich layer, considering rotation of the WD component. We compute the evolution of two stars simultaneously, accounting for the possible evolution of the orbital parameters, as determined by mass transfer between components and by mass ejection from the system during RLOF episodes. We consider that the WD gains angular momentum due to accretion and we follow the evolution of the angular velocity profile as due to angular momentum transport via convection and rotation-induced instabilities. As the donor H-rich envelope is transferred, the WD experiences recurrent very strong H-flashes triggering RLOF episodes during which the entire accreted matter is lost from the system. Due to mixing of chemicals by rotation-induced instabilities during the accretion phase, H-flashes occur inside the original WD. Hence, pulse-by pulse, the accretor mass is reduced down to 0.7453Msun. When He-rich matter is transferred, He-detonation does not occur in the rotating WD, which undergoes 6 very strong He-flashes and subsequent RLOF episodes. Also in this case, due to rotation-induced mixing of the accreted layers with the underlying core, the WD is eroded. Finally, when the mass transfer rate from the donor decreases, a massive He-buffer is piled-up onto the accretor which ends its life as a cooling WD. The binary system PTF J2238+743015.1 as all those binaries having similar components masses and orbital parameters are not good candidates as thermonuclear explosions progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.

          Influence of mid-infrared Galactic bubble on surroundings: A case study on IRAS 16489-4431

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the influence of a massive star on a mid-infrared bubble and its surrounding gas in the IRAS\,16489-4431 star-forming region using multi-wavelength data. The {\it Spitzer} mid-infrared band images revealed the shocked nature of the bubble. Analyses showed that the bubble is developed by a massive star owing to its strong radiation pressure. Evidence of collected material along the edge of the bubble was noted by the cold gas tracer line observed using Atacama Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The presence of dense dust cores with bi-polar outflows and young stellar objects toward the collected material is suggestive of active star formation possibly influenced by the expansion of the radiation driven bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based large-aperture telescopes, interferometers, and future Extremely Large Telescopes equipped with adaptive-optics systems provide angular resolution and high-contrast performance that are superior to space-based telescopes at thermal-infrared wavelengths. Their sensitivity, however, is critically limited by the high thermal background inherent to ground-based observations in this wavelength regime. We aim to improve the subtraction quality of the thermal-infrared background from ground-based observations, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We use data obtained with the Nulling-Optimized Mid-Infrared Camera on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer as a proxy for general high-sensitivity, AO-assisted ground-based data. We apply both a classical background subtraction -- using the mean of dedicated background observations -- and a new background subtraction based on a PCA of the background observations. We compare the performances of these two methods in both high-contrast imaging and aperture photometry. Compared to the classical background subtraction approach, PCA background subtraction delivers up to two times better contrasts down to the diffraction limit of the LBT's primary aperture (i.e., 350 mas in N band), that is, in the case of high-contrast imaging. Improvement factor between two and three are obtained over the mean background retrieval within the diffraction limit in the case of aperture photometry. PCA background subtraction significantly improves the sensitivity of ground-based thermal-infrared imaging observations. When applied to LBTI's nulling interferometry data, we expect the method to improve the sensitivity by a similar factor 2-3. This study paves the way to maximising the potential of future infrared ground-based instruments and facilities, such as the future 30m-class telescopes.

          [X/Fe] Marks the Spot: Mapping Chemical Azimuthal Variations in the Galactic Disk with APOGEE

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical cartography of the Galactic disk provides insights to its structure and assembly history over cosmic time. In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore chemical gradients and azimuthal substructure in the Milky Way disk with giant stars from APOGEE DR17. We confirm the existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the disk of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R $\sim -0.066 \pm 0.0004$ dex/kpc and a vertical metallicity gradient of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$Z $\sim -0.164 \pm 0.001$ dex/kpc. We find azimuthal variations ($\pm0.1$ dex) on top of the radial metallicity gradient that have been previously established with other surveys. The APOGEE giants show strong correlations with stellar age and the intensity of azimuthal variations in iron; older stellar populations show the largest deviations from the radial metallicity gradient. Beyond iron, we show that other elements (e.g., Mg, O) display azimuthal variations at the $\pm0.05$ dex-level across the Galactic disk. We illustrate that moving into the orbit-space could help constrain the mechanisms producing these azimuthal metallicity variations. These results suggest that the spiral arms of the Galaxy are not solely responsible for azimuthal metallicity variations and other Galactic processes are at play.

          The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term evolution of astrophysical systems is driven by a Hamiltonian that is independent of the fast angle. As this Hamiltonian may contain explicitly time-dependent parameters, the conservation of mechanical energy is not guaranteed in such systems. We derive how the semi-major axis evolves in these cases. We analyze two astrophysically interesting examples, those of the harmonic and quadrupole perturbations.

          FAST Discovery of Eight Isolated Millisecond Pulsars in NGC 6517

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of 8 isolated millisecond pulsars in Globular Cluster (GC) NGC 6517 using the Five-Hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The spin periods of those pulsars (namely PSR J1801-0857K to R, or, NGC 6517K to R) are all shorter than 10 ms. With these discoveries, NGC 6517 is currently the GC with the most known pulsars in the FAST sky. The largest difference in dispersion measure of the pulsars in NGC 6517 is 11.2 cm$^{-3}$ pc, the second among all GCs. The fraction of isolated pulsars in this GC (16 of 17, 94$\%$) is consistent with previous studies indicating an overabundance of isolated pulsars in the densest GCs, especially in those undergoing cluster core collapse. Considering the FAST GC pulsar discoveries, we modeled the GC pulsar population using the empirical Bayesian method described by Turk and Lorimer with the recent counts. Using this approach, we find that the expected number of potential pulsars in GCs seems to be correlated with the central escape velocity, hence, the GCs Liller 1, NGC 6441, M54 (NGC 6715), and $\omega$-Cen (NGC 5139) are expected to host the largest numbers of pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Differentiating between real transit events and false positive signals in photometric time series data is a bottleneck in the identification of transiting exoplanets, particularly long-period planets. This differentiation typically requires visual inspection of a large number of transit-like signals to rule out instrumental and astrophysical false positives that mimic planetary transit signals. We build a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to separate eclipsing binaries and other false positives from potential planet candidates, reducing the number of light curves that require human vetting. Our CNN is trained using the TESS light curves that were identified by Planet Hunters citizen scientists as likely containing a transit. We also include the background flux and centroid information. The light curves are visually inspected and labeled by project scientists and are minimally pre-processed, with only normalization and data augmentation taking place before training. The median percentage of contaminants flagged across the test sectors is 18% with a maximum of 37% and a minimum of 10%. Our model keeps 100% of the planets for 16 of the 18 test sectors, while incorrectly flagging one planet candidate (0.3%) for one sector and two (0.6%) for the remaining sector. Our method shows potential to reduce the number of light curves requiring manual vetting by up to a third with minimal misclassification of planet candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 High fidelity separation of astrophysical foreground contributions from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal has been recognized as one of the main challenges of modern CMB data analysis, and one which needs to be addressed in a robust way to ensure that the next generation of CMB polarization experiments lives up to its promise. In this work we consider the non-parametric maximum likelihood CMB cleaning approach recently proposed by some of the authors which has been shown to match the performance of standard parametric techniques for simple foreground models, while superseding it in cases where the foregrounds do not exhibit a simple frequency dependence. We present a new implementation of the method in pixel space, extending its functionalities to account for spatial variability of the properties of the foregrounds. We describe the algorithmic details of our approach and its validation against the original code as well as the parametric method for various experimental set-ups and different models of the foreground components. We argue that the method provides a compelling alternative to other state-of-the-art techniques.
