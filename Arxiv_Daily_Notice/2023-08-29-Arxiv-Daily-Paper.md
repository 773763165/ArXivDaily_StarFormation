#### On the most reliable value of the Galactic aberration constant

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic aberration (GA) is a small effect in proper motions of celestial objects with an amplitude of about 5 $\mu$as/yr already noticeable in highly accurate astrometric observations such as VLBI and Gaia. However accurate accounting for this effect faces difficulty caused by the uncertainty in the GA amplitude (GA constant). Its estimates derived from VLBI and Gaia data processing differ significantly, so it would be very desirable to involve another independent method to solve the problem of inconsistency between these two methods. Such a method, that we consider in this paper, is using determination of the Galactic rotation parameters by methods of stellar astronomy. The result obtained in this study showed that the GA constant estimate obtained from stellar astronomy is closer to the estimate obtained from Gaia.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we present Gammapy, an open-source Python package for the analysis of astronomical $\gamma$-ray data, and illustrate the functionalities of its first long-term-support release, version 1.0. Built on the modern Python scientific ecosystem, Gammapy provides a uniform platform for reducing and modeling data from different $\gamma$-ray instruments for many analysis scenarios. Gammapy complies with several well-established data conventions in high-energy astrophysics, providing serialized data products that are interoperable with other software packages. Starting from event lists and instrument response functions, Gammapy provides functionalities to reduce these data by binning them in energy and sky coordinates. Several techniques for background estimation are implemented in the package to handle the residual hadronic background affecting $\gamma$-ray instruments. After the data are binned, the flux and morphology of one or more $\gamma$-ray sources can be estimated using Poisson maximum likelihood fitting and assuming a variety of spectral, temporal, and spatial models. Estimation of flux points, likelihood profiles, and light curves is also supported. After describing the structure of the package, we show, using publicly available $\gamma$-ray data, the capabilities of Gammapy in multiple traditional and novel $\gamma$-ray analysis scenarios, such as spectral and spectro-morphological modeling and estimations of a spectral energy distribution and a light curve. Its flexibility and power are displayed in a final multi-instrument example, where datasets from different instruments, at different stages of data reduction, are simultaneously fitted with an astrophysical flux model.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance of protoplanetary bodies ejected from their parent star system is presently poorly-constrained. With only two existing optical observations of interstellar objects in the $10^{8} - 10^{10}$ kg mass range and a small number of robust microlensing observations of free-floating planets (FFPs) in the $10^{24} - 10^{25}$ kg mass range, there is a large range of masses for which there are no existing measurements of the unbound population. The three primary microlensing surveys currently searching for FFPs operate at a cadence greater than 15 minutes, which limits their ability to observe events associated with bodies with a mass much below an Earth mass. We demonstrate that existing high-cadence observations of M31 with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam place the best direct constraints at present on the abundance of unbound objects at sub-terrestrial masses, with peak sensitivity at $10^{-4}~M_\oplus$ for Milky Way lenses and $10^{-1}~M_\oplus$ for lenses in M31. For a fiducial $\frac{dn}{dM}\propto M^{-2}$ mass distribution, we find that the abundance of unbound objects is constrained to $n_\text{unbound} < 4.4 \times 10^{7} ~\rm{pc}^{-3}$ for masses within 1 dex of $10^{-4}~M_\oplus$. Additionally, we compute limits on an artificial ``monochromatic'' distribution of unbound objects and compare to existing literature, demonstrating that the assumed spatial distribution of lenses has very significant consequences for the sensitivity of microlensing surveys. Our limits place robust constraints on the unbound population in the sub-terrestrial mass range and motivate new observational strategies for microlensing surveys.
#### Where is the End of the Cosmic-Ray Electron Spectrum?

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting the end of the cosmic-ray (CR) electron spectrum would provide important new insights. While we know that Milky Way sources can accelerate electrons up to at least $\sim$1~PeV, the observed CR electron spectrum at Earth extends only up to 5~TeV (possibly 20~TeV), a large discrepancy. The question of the end of the CR electron spectrum has received relatively little attention, despite its importance. We take a comprehensive approach, showing that there are multiple steps at which the observed CR electron spectrum could be cut off. At the highest energies, the accelerators may not have sufficient luminosity, or the sources may not allow sufficient escape, or propagation to Earth may not be sufficiently effective, or present detectors may not have sufficient sensitivity. For each step, we calculate a rough range of possibilities. Although all of the inputs are uncertain, a clear vista of exciting opportunities emerges. We outline strategies for progress based on CR electron observations and auxiliary multi-messenger observations. In addition to advancing our understanding of CRs in the Milky Way, progress will also sharpen sensitivity to dark matter annihilation or decay.
#### UVIT/AstroSat Investigation of a low luminous Blue Straggler Star in NGC  362: Detection of extremely low mass white dwarf as companion

 - **Abstract**
 In the present study, we identified an extremely low-mass white dwarf as a companion to a low luminous blue straggler star within the Galactic globular cluster NGC 362. To conduct the analysis, we utilized data obtained from various sources, including AstroSat Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope, UVOT, and the 2.2-m ESO telescope. By examining the spectral energy distribution of the blue straggler star candidate, we successfully identified an extremely low mass white dwarf as its binary companion. We determined the effective temperature, radius, and luminosity for both, the extremely low-mass white dwarf and the blue straggler star candidate. Specifically, the extremely low-mass white dwarf exhibits an effective temperature of 15000 K, a radius of 0.17 Rsun, a luminosity of 1.40 Lsun, and a mass range of 0.19-0.20 Msun. Furthermore, the position of the straggler star within the cluster suggests their formation via the Case A/B mass-transfer mechanism in a low-density environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Lava planets are rocky exoplanets that orbit so close to their host star that their day-side is hot enough to melt silicate rock. Their short orbital periods ensure that lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent day and night hemispheres. Such asymmetric magma oceans have no analogs in the Solar System and will exhibit novel fluid dynamics. Here we report numerical simulations of lava planet interiors showing that solid-liquid fractionation in the planetary interior has a major impact on the compositional structure and evolution of the planet. We explored two styles of dynamics that depend primarily on the interior thermal state : 1) a hot fully molten interior, and 2) a mostly solid interior with a shallow day-side magma ocean. In the hot interior scenario, the atmosphere reflects the planet's bulk silicate composition and the night-side crust is gravitationally unstable and constantly replenished. In the cool interior scenario, the distilled atmosphere will lack Na, K and FeO, and the night-side mantle is entirely solid, with a cold surface. These two end-member cases can be distinguished with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, offering an avenue to probe the diversity of terrestrial exoplanet evolutions.
#### Signs of a non-zero equation-of-state for Dark Matter

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13617
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13617
 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate how a changing and negative equation-of-state (EoS) for dark matter can alleviate cosmic tensions and explain the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) void anomaly. We discuss the effect of the model on the cosmic expansion history, growth of structure and the ISW. We show that a negative EoS at late times is able to produce a larger Hubble constant and smaller $\sigma_{8}$, which can explain both cosmological tensions. Furthermore, the model uniquely predicts larger ISW at low redshift, a prediction which is in agreement with observations of larger ISW from voids. The preference for a negative EoS for dark matter at late times is indicative of a unified dark sector and degenerate with models of dark matter and dark energy interaction. Future measurements of the ISW from cosmic voids can provide a unique test for this solution to tensions in cosmology, should they continue to persist.
#### Thermal properties of the leading hemisphere of Callisto inferred from  ALMA observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a thermal observation of Callisto's leading hemisphere obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 0.87 mm (343 GHz). The angular resolution achieved for this observation was $\sim$$0.16^{\prime\prime}$, which for Callisto at the time of this observation ($D\sim 1.05^{\prime\prime}$) was equivalent to $\sim$6 elements across the surface. Our disk-integrated brightness temperature of 116 $\pm$ 5 K (8.03 $\pm$ 0.40 Jy) is consistent with prior disk-integrated observations. Global surface properties were derived from the observation using a thermophysical model (de Kleer et al. 2021) constrained by spacecraft data. We find that models parameterized by two thermal inertia components more accurately fit the data than single thermal inertia models. Our best-fit global parameters adopt a lower thermal inertia of 15-50 $\text{J}\:\text{m}^{-2}\:\text{K}^{-1}\:\text{s}^{-1/2}$ and a higher thermal inertia component of 1200-2000 $\text{J}\:\text{m}^{-2}\:\text{K}^{-1}\:\text{s}^{-1/2}$, with retrieved millimeter emissivities of 0.89-0.91. We identify several thermally anomalous regions, including spots $\sim$3 K colder than model predictions co-located with the Valhalla impact basin and a complex of craters in the southern hemisphere; this indicates the presence of materials possessing either a higher thermal inertia or a lower emissivity. A warm region confined to the mid-latitudes in these leading hemisphere data may be indicative of regolith property changes due to exogenic sculpting.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of strongly irradiated Jupiter-sized planets has no equivalent in the Solar System. It is characterised by strongly bloated atmospheres and atmospheric large-scale heights. Recent space-based observations of SO2 photochemistry demonstrated the knowledge that can be gained from detailed atmospheric studies of these unusual planets about Earth's uniqueness. Aims. Here we explore the atmosphere of WASP-172b a similar planet in temperature and bloating to the recently studied HD~149026~b. In this work, we characterise the atmospheric composition and subsequently the atmospheric dynamics of this prime target. Methods. We observed a particular transit of WASP-172b in front of its host star with ESO's ESPRESSO spectrograph and analysed the spectra obtained before during and after transit. Results. We detect the absorption of starlight by WASP-172b's atmosphere by sodium (5.6sigma), hydrogen (19.5sigma) and obtained a tentative detection of iron (4.1sigma). We detect strong - yet varying - blue shifts, relative to the planetary rest frame, of all of these absorption features. This allows for a preliminary study of the atmospheric dynamics of WASP-172b. Conclusions. With only one transit, we were able to detect a wide variety of species, clearly tracking different atmospheric layers with possible jets. WASP-172b is a prime follow-up target for a more in-depth characterisation both for ground and space-based observatories. If the detection of Fe is confirmed, this may suggest that radius inflation is an important determinant for the detectability of Fe in hot Jupiters, as several non-detections of Fe have been published for planets that are hotter but less inflated than WASP-172b.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13638
 - **Abstract**
 Hubble Space Telescope images obtained in 2018 are combined with archival HST data taken in 1995 to detect changes and measure proper motions in the HH 80/81 shock complex which is powered by the fastest known jet driven by a forming star, the massive object IRAS 18162-2048. Some persistent features close to the radio jet axis have proper motions grater than 1,000 km/s away from IRAS 18162-2048. About 3 to 5 parsecs downstream from the IRAS source and beyond HH 80/81, H-alpha emission traces the rim of a parsec-scale bubble blown by the jet. Lower speed motions are seen in [Sii] away from the jet axis; these features have a large component of motion at right-angles to the jet. We identify new HH objects and H2 shocks in the counterflow opposite HH 80/81. The northeastern counterflow to HH 80/81 exhibits an extended but faint complex of 2.12 um H2 shocks. The inner portion of the outflow is traced by dim 1.64 um [Feii] emission. The full extent of this outflow is at least 1,500" (about 10 pc in projection at a distance of 1.4 kpc). We speculate about the conditions responsible for the production of the ultra-fast jet and the absence of prominent large-scale molecular outflow lobes.

 - **Abstract**
 Very-high-energy and ultra-high-energy neutrinos are messengers of energetic sources in the universe. Sub-orbital and satellite-based neutrino telescopes employ detectors of the atmospheric Cherenkov emission from extensive air showers (EASs) generated by charged particles. These Cherenkov detectors can be pointed below or above the Earth's limb. Cherenkov emissions produced from directions below the limb are from upward-going EASs produced in the atmosphere sourced by Earth-skimming neutrinos. When the Cherenkov telescope is pointed slightly above the Earth's limb, signals from EASs are initiated by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere. For sub-orbital detectors, muons produced from cosmic rays in the atmosphere can directly hit the Cherenkov telescope. Using a semi-analytic technique with cascade equations for atmospheric particle fluxes, we quantify the atmospheric muon flux that reaches sub-orbital telescopes like Extreme Universe Space Observatory Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2). We assess this potential background to the EAS signals. The calculation technique may also provide an understanding of the evolution of the muon content in individual EAS.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT) searches for gamma-ray/X-ray counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) candidate events identified during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Using Fermi-GBM on-board triggers and sub-threshold gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates found in the Fermi-GBM ground analyses, the Targeted Search and the Untargeted Search, we investigate whether there are any coincident GRBs associated with the GWs. We also search the Swift-BAT rate data around the GW times to determine whether a GRB counterpart is present. No counterparts are found. Using both the Fermi-GBM Targeted Search and the Swift-BAT search, we calculate flux upper limits and present joint upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity of each GW. Given these limits, we constrain theoretical models for the emission of gamma-rays from binary black hole mergers.
#### Baikal-GVD Astrophysical Neutrino Candidate near the Blazar TXS~0506+056

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the observation of a rare neutrino event detected by Baikal-GVD in April 2021. The event GVD210418CA is the highest-energy cascade observed by Baikal-GVD so far from the direction below the horizon. The estimated cascade energy is $224\pm75$~TeV. The evaluated signalness parameter of GVD210418CA is 97.1\% using an assumption of the E$^{-2.46}$ spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos. The arrival direction of GVD210418CA is near the position of the well-known radio blazar TXS~0506+056, with the angular distance being within a 90\% directional uncertainty region of the Baikal-GVD measurement. The event was followed by a radio flare observed by the RATAN-600 radio telescope, further strengthening the case for the neutrino-blazar association.
#### Progenitors and Explosion Properties of Supernova Remnants Hosting  Central Compact Objects: II. A Global Systematic Study with a Comparison to  Nucleosynthesis Models

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse explosions of massive stars leave behind neutron stars, with a known diversity that includes the "Central Compact Objects" (CCOs). Typified by the neutron star discovered near the centre of the Cas A supernova remnant (SNR), CCOs have been observed to shine only in X-rays. To address their supernova progenitors, we perform a systematic study of SNRs that contain a CCO and display X-ray emission from their shock-heated ejecta. We make use of X-ray data primarily using the Chandra X-ray observatory, complemented with XMM-Newton. This study uses a systematic approach to the analysis of each SNR aimed at addressing the supernova progenitor as well as the explosion properties (energy and ambient density). After fitting for the ejecta abundances estimated from a spatially resolved spectroscopic study, we compare the data to six nucleosynthesis models making predictions on supernova ejecta yields in core-collapse explosions. We find that the explosion models commonly used by the astrophysics community do not match the ejecta yields for any of the SNRs, suggesting additional physics, e.g. multi-dimensional explosion models or updated progenitor structures, are required. Overall we find low-mass ($\leq$25 solar masses) progenitors among the massive stars population and low-energy explosions ($<$10$^{51}$ ergs). We discuss degeneracies in our model fitting, particularly how altering the explosion energy affects the estimate of the progenitor mass. Our systematic study highlights the need for improving on the theoretical models for nucleosynthesis predictions as well as for sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopy observations to be acquired with next-generation X-ray missions.
#### Extending the Chemical Reach of the H3 Survey: Detailed Abundances of  the Dwarf-galaxy Stellar Stream Wukong/LMS-1

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed chemical-abundance analysis of stars from the dwarf-galaxy stellar stream Wukong/LMS-1 covering a wide metallicity range ($-3.5 < \rm[Fe/H] \lesssim -1.3$). We find abundance patterns that are effectively indistinguishable from the bulk of Indus and Jhelum, a pair of smaller stellar streams proposed to be dynamically associated with Wukong/LMS-1. We discovered a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star ($\rm[C/Fe] > +0.7$ and $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -2.9$) in Wukong/LMS-1 with strong enhancements in Sr, Y, and Zr, which is peculiar given its solar-level [Ba/Fe]. Wukong/LMS-1 stars have high abundances of $\alpha$ elements up to $\rm[Fe/H] \gtrsim -2$, which is expected for relatively massive dwarfs. Towards the high-metallicity end, Wukong/LMS-1 becomes $\alpha$-poor, revealing that it probably experienced fairly standard chemical evolution. We identified a pair of N- and Na-rich stars in Wukong/LMS-1, reminiscent of multiple populations in globular clusters. This indicates that this dwarf galaxy contained at least one globular cluster that was completely disrupted in addition to two intact ones previously known to be associated with Wukong/LMS-1, which is possibly connected to similar evidence found in Indus. From these $\geq$3 globular clusters, we estimate the total mass of Wukong/LMS-1 to be ${\approx}10^{10} M_\odot$, representing ${\sim}1$% of the present-day Milky Way. Finally, the [Eu/Mg] ratio in Wukong/LMS-1 continuously increases with metallicity, making this the first example of a dwarf galaxy where the production of $r$-process elements is clearly dominated by delayed sources, presumably neutron-star mergers.
#### Implications of Mini-EUSO measurements for a space-based observation of  UHECRs

 - **Abstract**
 Mini-EUSO is the first mission of the JEM-EUSO program on board the International Space Station. It was launched in August 2019 and it is operating since October 2019 being located in the Russian section (Zvezda module) of the station and viewing our planet from a nadir-facing UV-transparent window. The instrument is based on the concept of the original JEM-EUSO mission and consists of an optical system employing two Fresnel lenses of 25 cm each and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with single photon counting sensitivity and an overall field of view of 44$\times$44$^\circ$. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the near UV range (predominantly between 290 nm and 430 nm), with a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km and different temporal resolutions of 2.5 $\mu$s, 320 $\mu$s and 41 ms. Mini-EUSO observations are extremely important to better assess the potential of a space-based detector in studying Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) such as K-EUSO and POEMMA. In this contribution we focus the attention on the results of the UV measurements and we place them in the context of UHECR observations from space, namely the estimation of exposure.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) can indicate the existence of an undiscovered planet in the outer solar system. Here, we used N-body computer simulations to investigate the effects of a hypothetical Kuiper Belt planet (KBP) on the orbital structure of TNOs in the distant Kuiper Belt beyond ~50 au. We used observations to constrain model results, including the well-characterized Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS). We determined that an Earth-like planet (m ~ 1.5-3 Earth masses) located on a distant (semimajor axis a ~ 250-500 au, perihelion q ~ 200 au) and inclined (i ~ 30 deg) orbit can explain three fundamental properties of the distant Kuiper Belt: a prominent population of TNOs with orbits beyond Neptune's gravitational influence (i.e., detached objects with q > 40 au), a significant population of high-i objects (i > 45 deg), and the existence of some extreme objects with peculiar orbits (e.g., Sedna). Furthermore, the proposed KBP is compatible with the existence of identified Gyr-stable TNOs in the 2:1, 5:2, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1 Neptunian mean motion resonances. These stable populations are often neglected in other studies. We predict the existence of an Earth-like planet and several TNOs on peculiar orbits in the outer solar system, which can serve as observationally testable signatures of the putative planet's perturbations.

 HESS J1843$-$033 is a very-high-energy gamma-ray source whose origin remains unidentified. This work presents, for the first time, the energy spectrum of gamma rays beyond $100\, {\rm TeV}$ from the HESS J1843$-$033 region using the data recorded by the Tibet air shower array and its underground muon detector array. A gamma-ray source with an extension of $0.34^{\circ} \pm 0.12^{\circ}$ is successfully detected above $25\, {\rm TeV}$ at $(\alpha,\, \delta) = (281.09^{\circ}\pm 0.10^{\circ},\, -3.76^{\circ}\pm 0.09^{\circ})$ near HESS J1843$-$033 with a statistical significance of $6.2\, \sigma$, and the source is named TASG J1844$-$038. The position of TASG J1844$-$038 is consistent with those of HESS J1843$-$033, eHWC J1842$-$035, and LHAASO J1843$-$0338. The measured gamma-ray energy spectrum in $25\, {\rm TeV} < E < 130\, {\rm TeV}$ is described with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}E = (9.70\pm 1.89)\times 10^{-16} (E/40\, {\rm TeV})^{-3.26\pm 0.30}\, {\rm TeV}^{-1} {\rm cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}$, and the spectral fit to the combined spectra of HESS J1843$-$033, LHAASO J1843$-$0338, and TASG J1844$-$038 implies the existence of a cutoff at $49.5\pm 9.0\, {\rm TeV}$. Associations of TASG J1844-038 with SNR G28.6$-$0.1 and PSR J1844-0346 are also discussed in detail for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma rays from HESS J1849$-$000, a middle-aged TeV pulsar wind nebula (PWN), are observed by the Tibet air shower array and the muon detector array. The detection significance of gamma rays reaches $4.0\, \sigma$ and $4.4\, \sigma$ levels above 25 TeV and 100 TeV, respectively, in units of Gaussian standard deviation $\sigma$. The energy spectrum measured between $40\, {\rm TeV} < E < 320\, {\rm TeV}$ for the first time is described with a simple power-law function of ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}E = (2.86 \pm 1.44) \times 10^{-16}(E/40\, {\rm TeV})^{-2.24 \pm 0.41}\, {\rm TeV}^{-1}\, {\rm cm}^{-2}\, {\rm s}^{-1}$. The gamma-ray energy spectrum from the sub-TeV ($E < 1\, {\rm TeV}$) to sub-PeV ($100\, {\rm TeV} < E < 1\, {\rm PeV}$) ranges including the results of previous studies can be modeled with the leptonic scenario, inverse Compton scattering by high-energy electrons accelerated by the PWN of PSR J1849$-$0001. On the other hand, the gamma-ray energy spectrum can also be modeled with the hadronic scenario in which gamma rays are generated from the decay of neutral pions produced by collisions between accelerated cosmic-ray protons and the ambient molecular cloud found in the gamma-ray emitting region. The cutoff energy of cosmic-ray protons $E_{\rm p\, cut}$, cut is estimated at ${\rm log}_{10}(E_{\rm p,\, cut}/{\rm TeV}) = 3.73^{+2.98}_{-0.66}$, suggesting that protons are accelerated up to the PeV energy range. Our study thus proposes that HESS J1849$-$000 should be further investigated as a new candidate for a Galactic PeV cosmic-ray accelerator, PeVatron.
#### The Spatial Distribution of the Unidentified 2.07 \textmu m Absorption  Feature on Europa and Implications for its Origin

 - **Abstract**
 A weak absorption feature at 2.07 \textmu m on Europa's trailing hemisphere has been suggested to arise from radiolytic processing of an endogenic salt, possibly sourced from the interior ocean. However, if the genesis of this feature requires endogenic material to be present, one might expect to find a correlation between its spatial distribution and the recently disrupted chaos terrains. Using archived near-infrared observations from Very Large Telescope/SINFONI with a $\sim$1 nm spectral resolution and a linear spatial resolution $\sim$130 km, we examine the spatial distribution of this feature in an effort to explore this endogenic formation hypothesis. We find that while the presence of the 2.07 \textmu m feature is strongly associated with the irradiation pattern on Europa's trailing hemisphere, there is no apparent association between the presence or depth of the absorption feature and Europa's large-scale chaos terrain. This spatial distribution suggests that the formation pathway of the 2.07 \textmu m feature on Europa is independent of any endogenous salts within the recent geology. Instead, we propose that the source of this feature may simply be a product of the radiolytic sulfur cycle or arise from some unidentified parallel irradiation process. Notably, the 2.07 \textmu m absorption band is absent from the Pwyll crater ejecta blanket, suggesting that radiolytic processing has not had enough time to form the species responsible and placing a lower limit on the irradiation timescale. We are unable to find a plausible spectral match to the 2.07 \textmu m feature within the available laboratory data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed two types of decayless transverse oscillations in short coronalloops: one with short periods scaling with loop lengths, and the other with longer periods that exhibit a peak at around 5 min in the period distribution. To understand such a difference in period, we work in the framework of ideal MHD and model a short coronal loop embedded in an atmosphere with density stratification from the chromosphere to the corona. An inclined p-mode-like driver with a period of 5 min is launched at one loop footpoint. It is discovered that two types of decayless transverse oscillations can be excited in the loop. We interpret the 5 min periodicity as being directly driven by the footpoint driver, while the others, with periods of several tens of seconds, are regarded as kink eigenmodes of different harmonics. Therefore, our simulation shows that both types of decayless oscillations found in observations can be excited by p-modes in one short coronal loop. This study extends our understanding of ubiquitous decayless transverse oscillations in the corona. Furthermore, it suggests that p-modes could be an important energy source for coronal heating by driving decayless transverse oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-Earth asteroids Ryugu and Bennu, were visited, characterised, and sampled by the Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx missions: remote sensing data and sample return analysis showed that both asteroids have primitive, hydrated and organic-rich compositions. The dark families of the inner main belt (IMB) that belong to the spectroscopic C-complex have been claimed to be the sources of both Ryugu and Bennu. Hence, there has been large effort to characterise them. Here we used the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) asteroid reflectance spectra to investigate the 11 known IMB C-complex families (Chaldaea, Chimaera, Clarissa, Erigone, Eulalia, Klio, Polana, Primordial, Sulamitis, Svea, Tamara). For each family, we extracted the family members that have known geometric visible albedo values and Gaia DR3 data and we created an average reflectance spectrum per family between 370 and 950 nm. The average DR3 reflectance spectra of each family were compared with the previous literature data and to Bennu's and Ryugu's spectra. We found that DR3 reflectance spectra of the IMB C-complex families are in general consistent with previous findings with the only exception of the Svea family. We also showed that the Polana and the Eulalia families can be distinguished in the wavelength region 370 - 500 nm. Among all the IMB C-complex families, we determined that the average reflectance spectra of the Eulalia and Polana families are the most similar to those of Bennu and Ryugu, respectively. In particular, Eulalia family's average spectrum is a good match to Bennu's in the wavelength range 450 - 800 nm, while beyond 800 nm the spectrum of Bennu is bluer than that of Eulalia. Moreover, the spectrum of the Polana family has the smallest discrepancy against the spectrum of Ryugu, although this match is formally unsatisfactory (reduced chi^2 ~ 1.9).

 The Baikal-GVD alert system was launched at the beginning of 2021. There are alerts for muon neutrinos (long upward-going track-like events) and all-flavour neutrinos (high-energy cascades). The system is able to get a preliminary response to external alerts with a temporal delay of about 3-10 minutes. The Baikal-GVD data processing and the results of the follow-up procedure are described. We report on the analysis of the coincidence in time and direction between the Baikal-GVD cascade GVD20211208CA with an estimated energy of 43 TeV and the announced alert IceCube211208A possibly associated with a flaring state of the blazar PKS 0735+178.
#### HI in Molecular Clouds: Irradiation by FUV plus Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the analytic theory presented by Sternberg et al. 2014 and Bialy \& Sternberg (2016) for the production of atomic hydrogen (HI) via FUV photodissociation at the boundaries of dense interstellar molecular (H$_2$) clouds, to also include the effects of penetrating (low-energy) cosmic-rays for the growth of the total HI column densities. We compute the steady-state abundances of the HI and H$_2$ in one-dimensional gas slabs in which the FUV photodissociation rates are reduced by depth-dependent H$_2$ self-shielding and dust absorption, and in which the cosmic-ray ionization rates are either constant or reduced by transport effects. The solutions for the HI and H$_2$ density profiles and the integrated HI columns, depend primarily on the ratios $I_{\rm UV}/Rn$ and $\zeta/Rn$, where $I_{\rm UV}$ is the intensity of the photodissociating FUV field, $\zeta$ is the H$_2$ cosmic-ray ionization rate, $n$ is the hydrogen gas density, and $R$ is the dust-surface H$_2$ formation rate coefficient. We present computations for a wide range of FUV field strengths, cosmic-ray ionization rates, and dust-to-gas ratios. We develop analytic expressions for the growth of the HI column densities. For Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with multiphased (warm/cold) HI envelopes, the interior cosmic-ray zones will dominate the production of the HI only if $\zeta \gtrsim 4.5\times 10^{-16} \times (M_{\rm GMC}/10^6 \ M_{\odot})^{-1/2}$~s$^{-1}$, where $M_{\rm GMC}$ is the GMC mass, and including attenuation of the cosmic-ray fluxes. For most Galactic GMCs and conditions, FUV photodissociation dominates over cosmic-ray ionization for the production of the HI column densities. Furthermore, the cosmic-rays do not affect the HI-to-H$_2$ transition points.

 - **Abstract**
 The planetary obliquity plays a significant role in determining physical properties of planetary surfaces and climate. As direct detection is constrained due to the present observation accuracy, kinetic theories are helpful to predict the evolution of the planetary obliquity. Here the coupling effect between the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) effect and the equilibrium tide is extensively investigated, the planetary obliquity performs to follow two kinds of secular evolution paths, based on the conservation of total angular momentum. The equilibrium timescale of the planetary obliquity $t_{\mathrm{eq}}$ varies along with $r_{t}$, which is defined as the initial timescale ratio of the tidal dissipation and secular perturbation. We numerically derive the linear relationship between $t_{\mathrm{eq}}$ and $r_{t}$ with the maximum likelihood method. The spin-axis orientation of S-type terrestrials orbiting M-dwarfs reverses over $90^\circ$ when $r_{t} > 100$, then enter the quasi-equilibrium state between $40^\circ$ and $60^\circ$, while the maximum obliquity can reach $130^\circ$ when $r_{t} > 10^4 $. Numerical simulations show that the maximum obliquity increases with the semi-major axis ratio $a_1$/$a_2$, but is not so sensitive to the eccentricity $e_2$. The likelihood of obliquity flip for S-type terrestrials in general systems with $a_2 < 45$ AU is closely related to $m_1$. The observed potential oblique S-type planets HD 42936 b, GJ 86 Ab and $\tau$ Boot Ab are explored to have a great possibility to be head-down over the secular evolution of spin.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the long-term behavior of the bright gamma-ray blazar PKS 0402-362. Over a span of approximately 12.5 years, from August 2008 to January 2021, we gathered Fermi-LAT temporal data and identified three distinct periods of intense $\gamma$-ray activity. Notably, the second period exhibited the highest brightness ever observed in this particular source. We observed most of the $\gamma$-ray flare peaks to be asymmetric in profile suggesting a slow cooling time of particles or the varying Doppler factor as the main cause of these flares. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is fitted with power-law and log-parabola models, and in both cases, the spectral index is very steep. The lack of time lags between optical-IR and $\gamma$-ray emissions indicates the presence of a single-zone emission model. Using this information, we modeled the broadband SEDs with a simple one-zone leptonic model using the publicly available code `GAMERA'. The particle distribution index is found to be the same as expected in diffusive shock acceleration suggesting it as the main mechanism of particle acceleration to very high energy up to 4 - 6 GeV. During the different flux phases, we observed that the thermal disk dominates the optical emission, indicating that this source presents a valuable opportunity to investigate the connection between the disk and the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar lines observed toward stellar targets change slowly over long timescales, mainly due to the proper motion of the background target relative to the intervening clouds. On longer timescales, the cloud's slowly changing physical and chemical conditions can also cause variation. We searched for systematic variations in the absorption profiles of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) and interstellar atomic and molecular lines by comparing the high-quality data set from the ESO diffuse interstellar bands extensive exploration survey (EDIBLES) to older archival observations, bridging typical timescales of 10 years with a maximum timescale of 22 years. We found good archival observations for 64 EDIBLES targets. Our analysis focused on 31 DIBs, 7 atomic, and 5 molecular lines. We considered various systematic effects and applied a robust Bayesian test to establish which absorption features could display significant variations. While systematic effects greatly complicate our search, we find evidence for variations in the profiles of the $\lambda\lambda$4727 and 5780 DIBs in a few sightlines. Toward HD~167264, we find a new \ion{Ca}{i} cloud component that appears and becomes stronger after 2008. The same sightline furthermore displays marginal but systematic changes in the column densities of the atomic lines originating from the leading cloud component in the sightline. Similar variations are seen toward HD~147933. Our high-quality spectroscopic observations and archival data show that it is possible to probe interstellar time variations on time scales of typically a decade. Even though systematic uncertainties, as well as the generally somewhat lower quality of older data, complicate matters, we can conclude that time variations can be made visible, both in atomic lines and DIB profiles for a few targets, but that generally, these features are stable along many lines of sight.

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ushers in a new era of astronomical observation and discovery, offering unprecedented precision in a variety of measurements such as photometry, astrometry, morphology, and shear measurement. Accurate point spread function (PSF) models are crucial for many of these measurements. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid PSF construction method called HybPSF for JWST NIRCam imaging data. HybPSF combines the WebbPSF software, which simulates the PSF for JWST, with observed data to produce more accurate and reliable PSF models. We apply this method to the SMACS J0723 imaging data and construct supplementary structures from residuals obtained by subtracting the WebbPSF PSF model from the data. Our results show that HybPSF significantly reduces discrepancies between the PSF model and the data compared to WebbPSF. Specifically, the PSF shape parameter ellipticity and size comparisons indicate that HybPSF improves precision by a factor of approximately 10 for \$R^2\$ and \$50\%\$ for \$e\$. This improvement has important implications for astronomical measurements using JWST NIRCam imaging data.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Very high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) observations of the blazar Mrk 501 with MAGIC in 2014 have provided evidence for an unusual narrow spectral feature at about 3 TeV during an extreme X-ray flaring activity. The one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario, widely used in blazar broadband spectral modeling, fails to explain the narrow TeV component. Motivated by this rare observation, we propose an alternative model for the production of narrow features in the VHE spectra of flaring blazars. These spectral features may result from the decay of neutral pions ($\pi^0$ bumps) that are in turn produced via interactions of protons (of tens of TeV energy) with energetic photons, whose density increases during hard X-ray flares. We explore the conditions needed for the emergence of narrow $\pi^0$ bumps in VHE blazar spectra during X-ray flares reaching synchrotron energies $\sim100$ keV using time-dependent radiative transfer calculations. We focus on high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars, which consist the majority of VHE detected extragalactic sources. We find that synchrotron-dominated flares with peak energies $\gtrsim100$ keV can be ideal periods for the search of $\pi^0$ bumps in the VHE spectra of HSP blazars. Application of the model to the SED of Mrk 501 on MJD 56857.98 shows that the VHE spectrum of the flare is described well by the sum of an SSC component and a distinct $\pi^0$ bump centered at 3 TeV. Spectral fitting of simulated SSC+$\pi^0$ spectra for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) show that a $\pi^0$ bump could be detected at a 5$\sigma$ significance level with a 30-min exposure.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the astrophysical sites of the $r$-process, one of the primary mechanisms by which heavy elements are formed, is a key goal of modern astrophysics. The discovery of the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time, GRB 221009A, at a relatively nearby redshift, presented the first opportunity to spectroscopically test the idea that $r$-process elements are produced following the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars. Here we present spectroscopic and photometric $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ (JWST) observations of GRB 221009A obtained $+168$ and $+170$ rest-frame days after the initial gamma-ray trigger, and demonstrate they are well-described by a supernova (SN) and power-law afterglow, with no evidence for an additional component from $r$-process emission, and that the SN component strongly resembles the near-infrared spectra of previous SNe, including SN 1998bw. We further find that the SN associated with GRB 221009A is slightly fainter than the expected brightness of SN 1998bw at this phase, concluding that the SN is therefore not an unusual GRB-SN. We infer a nickel mass of $\approx0.09$ M$_{\odot}$, consistent with the lack of an obvious SN detection in the early-time data. We find that the host galaxy of GRB 221009A has a very low metallicity of $\approx0.12$ Z$_{\odot}$ and our resolved host spectrum shows that GRB 221009A occurred in a unique environment in its host characterized by strong H$_2$ emission lines consistent with recent star formation, which may hint at environmental factors being responsible for its extreme energetics.

 - **Abstract**
 The division of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) into different classes, other than the "short" and "long", has been an active field of research. We investigate whether GRBs can be classified based on a broader set of parameters, including prompt and plateau emission ones. Observational evidence suggests the existence of more GRB sub-classes, but results so far are either conflicting or not statistically significant. The novelty here is producing a machine-learning-based classification of GRBs using their observed X-rays and optical properties. We used two data samples: the first, composed of 203 GRBs, is from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift/XRT), and the latter, composed of 134 GRBs, is from the ground-based Telescopes and Swift/UVOT. Both samples possess the plateau emission (a flat part of the light curve happening after the prompt emission, the main GRB event). We have applied the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to explore multiple parameter spaces and sub-class combinations to reveal if there is a match between the current observational sub-classes and the statistical classification. With these samples and the algorithm, we spot a few micro-trends in certain cases, but we cannot conclude that any clear trend exists in classifying GRBs. These microtrends could point towards a deeper understanding of the physical meaning of these classes (e.g., a different environment of the same progenitor or different progenitors). However, a larger sample and different algorithms could achieve such goals. Thus, this methodology can lead to deeper insights in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the APOGEE survey we conducted a search for carbon-deficient red giants (CDGs). We found 103 new CDGs, increasing the number in the literature by more than a factor of 3. CDGs are very rare, representing $0.03$~per cent of giants. They appear as an extended tail off the normal carbon distribution. We show that they are found in all components of the Galaxy, contrary to previous findings. The location of CDGs in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) shows that they are primarily intermediate-mass stars ($2-4~\rm{M}_{\odot}$). Their extended distribution may indicate that CDGs can also sometimes have $M < 2.0~\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We attempted to identify the evolutionary phases of the CDGs using stellar model tracks. We found that the bulk of the CDGs are likely in the subgiant branch or red clump phase, whereas other CDGs may be in the red giant branch or early asymptotic giant branch phases. Degeneracy in the HRD makes exact identification difficult. We examined their C, N, and O compositions and confirmed previous studies showing that the envelope material has undergone extensive hydrogen burning through the CN(O) cycle. The new-CDGs have [C+N+O/Fe] that generally sum to zero, indicating that they started with scaled-solar composition. However, the previously known-CDGs generally have [C+N+O/Fe$] > 0.0$, indicating that some He-burning products were added to their envelopes. As to the site(s) in which this originally occurred, we do not find a convincing solution.

 - **Abstract**
 The full phase space information on the kinematics of a huge number of stars provided by the Gaia third Data Release raises the demand for a better understanding of the 3D stellar dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the possible regimes of motion of stars in the axisymmetric approximation of a Galactic potential model. The model consists of three components: the axisymmetric disk, the central spheroidal bulge and the spherical halo of dark matter. The axisymmetric disk is divided into stellar and gaseous disk subcomponents, each one modeled by three Miyamoto-Nagai profiles. The physical and structural parameters of the Galaxy components are adjusted by observational kinematic constraints. The phase space of the two-degrees-of-freedom model is studied by means of the Poincar\'e and dynamical mapping, the dynamical spectrum method and the direct numerical integrations of the Hamiltonian equations of motion. For the chosen physical parameters, the nearly-circular and low-altitude stellar behaviour is composed of two weakly coupled simple oscillations, radial and vertical motions. The amplitudes of the vertical oscillations of these orbits are gradually increasing with the growing Galactocentric distances, in concordance with the exponential mass decay assumed. However, for increasing planar eccentricities and the altitudes over the equatorial disk, new regimes of stellar motion emerge as a result of the beating between the radial and vertical oscillation frequencies, which we refer to as e-z resonances. The corresponding resonant motion produces characteristic sudden increase or decrease of the amplitude of the vertical oscillation, bifurcations in the dynamical spectra and the chains of islands of stable motion in the phase space. The results obtained can be useful in the understanding and interpretation of the features observed in the stellar 3D distribution around the Sun.
#### Formation of inner planets in the presence of a Cold Jupiter: orbital  evolution and relative velocities of planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital evolution of planetesimals in the inner disk in the presence of nebula gas and a (proto-) cold Jupiter. By varying the mass, eccentricity, and semi-major axis of the planet, we study the dependence of the relative velocities of the planetesimals on these parameters. For classic small planetesimals ($10^{16}-10^{20} $g) whose mutual gravitational interaction is negligible, gas drag introduces a size-dependent alignment of orbits and keeps the relative velocity low for similar-size bodies, while preventing orbital alignment for different-size planetesimals. Regardless of the location and the mass ratio of the planetesimals, increasing the mass and eccentricity or decreasing the orbital distance of the planet always leads to higher relative velocities of planetesimals. However, for massive planetesimals, the interplay of viscous stirring, gas damping, and secular perturbation results in lower velocity dispersion of equal-size planetesimals when the planet is more massive or when it is located on a closer or more eccentric orbit. The random velocities of such planetesimals remain almost unperturbed when the planet is located beyond Jupiter's current orbit, or when it is less massive or less eccentric than Jupiter. Unlike small planetesimals, such large planetesimals can grow in a runaway fashion as in the unperturbed case. Our results imply that the presence of a cold Jupiter does not impede the formation of inner rocky planets through planetesimal accretion, provided that the planetesimals are initially large.

 - **Abstract**
 Shear instabilities can be the source of significant amounts of turbulent mixing in stellar radiative zones. Past attempts at modeling their effects (either theoretically or using numerical simulations) have focused on idealized geometries where the shear is either purely vertical or purely horizontal. In stars, however, the shear can have arbitrary directions with respect to gravity. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the nonlinear saturation of shear instabilities in a stably stratified fluid, where the shear is sinusoidal in the horizontal direction, and either constant or sinusoidal in the vertical direction. We find that, in the parameter regime studied here (non-diffusive, fully turbulent flow), the mean vertical shear does not play any role in controlling the dynamics of the resulting turbulence unless its Richardson number is smaller than one (approximately). As most stellar radiative regions have a Richardson number much greater than one, our result implies that the vertical shear can essentially be ignored in the computation of the vertical mixing coefficient associated with shear instabilities for the purpose of stellar evolution calculations, even when it is much larger than the horizontal shear (as in the solar tachocline, for instance).

 - **Abstract**
 Glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO) is the simplest monosaccharide sugar in the interstellar medium, and it is directly involved in the origin of life via the 'RNA world' hypothesis. We present the first detection of glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO) towards the hot molecular core G358.93-0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The calculated column density of CH$_{2}$OHCHO towards G358.93-0.03 MM1 is (1.52$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 300$\pm$68.5 K. The derived fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$OHCHO with respect to H$_{2}$ is (4.90$\pm$2.92)$\times$10$^{-9}$, which is consistent with that estimated by existing two-phase warm-up chemical models. We discuss the possible formation pathways of CH$_{2}$OHCHO within the context of hot molecular cores and hot corinos and find that CH$_{2}$OHCHO is likely formed via the reactions of radical HCO and radical CH$_{2}$OH on the grain surface of G358.93-0.03 MM1.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic string loops are non-linear density fluctuations which form in the early universe and could play an important role in explaining many phenomena which are in tension with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Hence, the details of the accretion process onto cosmic string loops should be studied in detail. Most previous works view loops as point masses and ignore the impact of a finite loop size. In this work, we utilize the Zel'dovich approximation to calculate the non-linear mass sourced by a static extended loop with a time-averaged density profile derived from the trajectory of the loop oscillation, and compare the result with what is obtained for a point-mass source. We find that the finite size of a loop mainly affects the evolution of turnaround shells during the early stages of accretion, converging to the point mass result after a critical redshift, $z^{(II)/(III)}_{c}$. For $z>z^{(II)/(III)}_{c}$, the total accreted mass surrounding a loop is suppressed relative to the point mass case and has a growth rate proportional to $(1+z)^{-3/2}$. As an immediate extension, we also qualitatively analyse the accretion onto moving point masses and onto moving extended loops. In addition to the reduction in the nonlinear mass, the loop finite size also changes the shape of the turnaround surface at early stages of accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets from the ground is an actively growing field of research. In this context we have created the ATMOSPHERIX consortium: a research project aimed at characterizing exoplanets atmospheres using ground-based high resolution spectroscopy. This paper presents the publicly-available data analysis pipeline and demonstrates the robustness of the recovered planetary parameters from synthetic data. Simulating planetary transits using synthetic transmission spectra of a hot Jupiter that were injected into real SPIRou observations of the non-transiting system Gl 15 A, we show that our pipeline is successful at recovering the planetary signal and input atmospheric parameters. We also introduce a deep learning algorithm to optimise data reduction which proves to be a reliable, alternative tool to the commonly used principal component analysis. We estimate the level of uncertainties and possible biases when retrieving parameters such as temperature and composition and hence the level of confidence in the case of retrieval from real data. Finally, we apply our pipeline onto two real transits of HD~189733 b observed with SPIRou and obtain similar results than in the literature. In summary, we have developed a publicly available and robust pipeline for the forthcoming studies of the targets to be observed in the framework of the ATMOSPHERIX consortium, which can easily be adapted to other high resolution instruments than SPIRou (e.g. VLT-CRIRES, MAROON-X, ELT-ANDES)

 - **Abstract**
 In a companion paper, we introduced a publicly-available pipeline to characterise exoplanet atmospheres through high-resolution spectroscopy. In this paper, we use this pipeline to study the biases and degeneracies that arise in atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets in near-infrared ground-based transmission spectroscopy. We inject synthetic planetary transits into sequences of SPIRou spectra of the well known M dwarf star Gl 15 A, and study the effects of different assumptions on the retrieval. We focus on (i) mass and radius uncertainties, (ii) non isothermal vertical profiles and (iii) identification and retrieval of multiple species. We show that the uncertainties on mass and radius should be accounted for in retrievals and that depth-dependent temperature information can be derived from high-resolution transmission spectroscopy data. Finally, we discuss the impact of selecting wavelength orders in the retrieval and the issues that arise when trying to identify a single species in a multi-species atmospheric model. This analysis allows us to understand better the results obtained through transmission spectroscopy and their limitations in preparation to the analysis of actual SPIRou data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A* strongly suggests the presence of supermassive black hole at their respective cores. In this work, we use the semi-analytic Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flows (RIAF) model to investigate the resulting images of Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity and the Schwarzschild BH. We aim at choosing the JMN-1 naked singularity model and compare the synchrotron images with the Schwarzschild solution to search any distinct features which can distinguish the two objects and find alternative to the black hole solution. We perform general relativistic ray-tracing and radiative transfer simulations using Brahma code to generate synchrotron emission images utilising thermal distribution function for emissivity and absorptivity. We investigate effects in the images by varying inclination angle, disk width and frequency. The shadow images simulated by the JMN-1 model closely resemble those generated by the Schwarzschild black hole. When we compare these images, we find that the disparities between them are minimal. We conduct simulations using various plasma parameters, but the resulting images remain largely consistent for both scenarios. This similarity is evident in the horizontal cross-sectional brightness profiles of the two instances. Notably, the JMN-1 model exhibits slightly higher intensity in comparison to the Schwarzschild black hole. We conclude that JMN-1 presents itself as a viable substitute for the black hole scenario. This conclusion is not solely grounded in the fact that they are indistinguishable from their respective shadow observations, but also in the consideration that JMN-1 emerges as an end state of a continual gravitational collapse. This paradigm not only allows for constraints on spacetime but also provides a good probe for the nature of the central compact object.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric observations from the last decade have revealed additional low-amplitude periodicities in many classical pulsators that are likely due to pulsations in non-radial modes. One group of multi-mode RR Lyrae stars, the so-called 0.61 stars, is particularly interesting. In these stars, the radial first overtone is accompanied by additional signals with period ratios around 0.61. The most promising explanation for these signals is pulsation in non-radial modes of degrees 8 and 9. If the theory behind the additional signals in the 0.61 stars is substantiated, it would allow us to use non-radial modes to study classical pulsators. We aim to perform asteroseismic modeling of selected 0.61 stars with independently determined physical parameters to test whether this assumption behind the modeling leads to correct results. Namely, we test whether the additional signals are indeed due to non-radial modes of the proposed moderate degrees. We selected a number of and RR Lyrae stars that are also 0.61 stars and have good observational constraints on their other physical parameters. We assume that the nature of those modes is correctly explained with non-radial modes of degrees 8 or 9. Using this assumption and observational constraints on physical parameters, we performed asteroseismic modeling to test whether the observed periods and period ratios can be reproduced. For the majority of selected targets, we obtained a good match between observed and calculated periods and period ratios. For a few targets however, the results obtained are ambiguous and not straightforward to interpret.

 - **Abstract**
 Bolometric light curves play an important role in understanding the underlying physics of various astrophysical phenomena, as they allow for a comprehensive modeling of the event and enable comparison between different objects. However, constructing these curves often requires the approximation and extrapolation from multicolor photometric observations. In this study, we introduce vector Gaussian processes as a new method for reduction of supernova light curves. This method enables us to approximate vector functions, even with inhomogeneous time-series data, while considering the correlation between light curves in different passbands. We applied this methodology to a sample of 29 superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) assembled using the Open Supernova Catalog. Their multicolor light curves were approximated using vector Gaussian processes. Subsequently, under the black-body assumption for the SLSN spectra at each moment of time, we reconstructed the bolometric light curves. The vector Gaussian processes developed in this work are accessible via the Python library gp-multistate-kernel on GitHub. Our approach provides an efficient tool for analyzing light curve data, opening new possibilities for astrophysical research.

 Accretion plays a central role in the physics that governs the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks. The primary goal of this paper is to analyze the stability over time of the mass accretion rate onto TW Hya, the nearest accreting solar-mass young star. We measure veiling across the optical spectrum in 1169 archival high-resolution spectra of TW Hya, obtained from 1998--2022. The veiling is then converted to accretion rate using 26 flux-calibrated spectra that cover the Balmer jump. The accretion rate measured from the excess continuum has an average of $2.51\times10^{-9}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ and a Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 0.22 dex. This accretion rate may be underestimated by a factor of up to 1.5 because of uncertainty in the bolometric correction and another factor of 1.7 because of excluding the fraction of accretion energy that escapes in lines, especially Ly$\alpha$. The accretion luminosities are well correlated with He line luminosities but poorly correlated with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosity. The accretion rate is always flickering over hours but on longer timescales has been stable over 25 years. This level of variability is consistent with previous measurements for most, but not all, accreting young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In radio astronomy, visibility data, which are measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, are transformed into images for observation of distant celestial objects. However, these resultant images usually contain both real sources and artifacts, due to signal sparsity and other factors. One way to obtain cleaner images is to reconstruct samples into dense forms before imaging. Unfortunately, existing visibility reconstruction methods may miss some components of the frequency data, so blurred object edges and persistent artifacts remain in the images. Furthermore, the computation overhead is high on irregular visibility samples due to the data skew. To address these problems, we propose PolarRec, a reconstruction method for interferometric visibility data, which consists of a transformer-conditioned neural fields pipeline with a polar coordinate representation. This representation matches the way in which telescopes observe a celestial area as the Earth rotates. We further propose Radial Frequency Loss function, using radial coordinates in the polar coordinate system to correlate with the frequency information, to help reconstruct complete visibility. We also group visibility sample points by angular coordinates in the polar coordinate system, and use groups as the granularity for subsequent encoding with a Transformer encoder. Consequently, our method can capture the inherent characteristics of visibility data effectively and efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate that PolarRec markedly improves imaging results by faithfully reconstructing all frequency components in the visibility domain while significantly reducing the computation cost.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) has recently gained attention as a motivated candidate for the dark matter (DM) content of the Universe, as opposed to the commonly assumed cold DM (CDM), since the soliton profile intrinsic to FDM models was found to be particularly well suited to reproduce observed galaxy mass profiles. While FDM as a single DM component has been strongly constrained by multiple probes, there remained a mass window between $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $10^{-24}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in which it can comprise a large portion ($\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10\%)$) of the total DM. In this work, we consider gravitational lensing measurements in the strong lensing regime, which are one of the only means to directly constrain the distribution and profile of DM in astronomical bodies. Using a simple model that combines a soliton FDM component with a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, we explore under what conditions DM halos with this hybrid profile are able to reproduce the observed Einstein radii of several known lenses. We find that FDM with a particle mass of $\lesssim 10^{-24}\,{\rm eV}$ cannot explain the observations if it makes up more than $\sim10\%$ of the total DM, effectively closing the lingering FDM mass window.

 - **Abstract**
 Crater mapping using neural networks and other automated methods has increased recently with automated Crater Detection Algorithms (CDAs) applied to planetary bodies throughout the solar system. A recent publication by Benedix et al. (2020) showed high performance at small scales compared to similar automated CDAs but with a net positive diameter bias in many crater candidates. I compare the publicly available catalogs from Benedix et al. (2020) and Lee & Hogan (2021) and show that the reported performance is sensitive to the metrics used to test the catalogs. I show how the more permissive comparison methods indicate a higher CDA performance by allowing worse candidate craters to match ground-truth craters. I show that the Benedix et al. (2020) catalog has a substantial performance loss with increasing latitude and identify an image projection issue that might cause this loss. Finally, I suggest future applications of neural networks in generating large scientific datasets be validated using secondary networks with independent data sources or training methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The data recently released by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves provides compelling evidence supporting the existence of a stochastic signal that aligns with a gravitational-wave background. We show this signal can be the scalar-induced gravitational waves from the Higgs inflation model with the parametric amplification mechanism. Such a gravitational-wave background naturally predicts the substantial existence of planet-mass primordial black holes, which can be planet 9 in our solar system and the lensing objects for the ultrashort-timescale microlensing events observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. The future observations of stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays and planet-mass primordial black holes provide such a possibility to give further confirmations on Higgs inflation, which unifies two fundamental aspects of theoretical physics, particle physics and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze new JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data on the redshift 9.11 galaxy MACS1149-JD1. Our NIRCam imaging data reveal that JD1 comprises three spatially distinct components. Our spectroscopic data indicate that JD1 appears dust-free but is already enriched, $12 + \log {\rm (O/H) } = 7.875^{+0.042}_{-0.045}$. We also find that the Carbon and Neon abundances in JD1 are below the solar abundance ratio. Particularly the Carbon under-abundance is suggestive of recent star formation where Type~II supernovae have already enriched the ISM in Oxygen but intermediate mass stars have not yet enriched the ISM in Carbon. A recent burst of star formation is also revealed by the star formation history derived from NIRCam photometry. Our data do not reveal the presence of a significant amount of old populations, resulting in a factor of $\sim7\times$ smaller stellar mass than previous estimates. Thus, our data support the view that JD1 is a young object.

 - **Abstract**
 As we enter the era of TESS and JWST, instrumentation that can carry out radial velocity measurements of exoplanet systems is in high demand. We will address this demand by upgrading the UC Lick Observatory's 2.4-meter Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope with an adaptive optics (AO) system. The AO upgrade will be directly integrated into the APF telescope by replacing the telescope's static secondary mirror with a 61-actuator adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) to minimize the disturbance to the spectrograph optics. This upgrade is enabled by The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research's (TNO) large-format deformable mirror technology, which will be constructed using a new style of high-efficiency hybrid-variable reluctance actuator. We outline the technical design and manufacturing plan for the proposed APF AO upgrade and simulate the improvement to the science yield using HCIpy. Our simulations predict the AO upgrade will reduce the PSF instabilities due to atmospheric turbulence, concentrating the light on the spectrograph slit by a multiplicative factor of more than two (doubling the telescope's observing efficiency) for targets as dim as I = 14. When completed, the APF adaptive secondary mirror will be among the first pairings of an ASM with a radial velocity spectrograph and become a pathfinder for similar AO systems in telescopes of all sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 At $z \lesssim 1$, shock heating caused by large-scale velocity flows and possibly violent feedback from galaxy formation, converts a significant fraction of the cool gas ($T\sim 10^4$ K) in the intergalactic medium (IGM) into warm-hot phase (WHIM) with $T >10^5$K, resulting in a significant deviation from the previously tight power-law IGM temperature-density relationship, $T=T_0 (\rho / {\bar{\rho}})^{\gamma -1}$. This study explores the impact of the WHIM on measurements of the low-$z$ IGM thermal state, $[T_0,\gamma]$, based on the $b$-$N_{H I}$ distribution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Exploiting a machine learning-enabled simulation-based inference method trained on Nyx hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that [$T_0$, $\gamma$] can still be reliably measured from the $b$-$N_{H I}$ distribution at $z=0.1$, notwithstanding the substantial WHIM in the IGM. To investigate the effects of different feedback, we apply this inference methodology to mock spectra derived from the IllustrisTNG and Illustris simulations at $z=0.1$. The results suggest that the underlying $[T_0,\gamma]$ of both simulations can be recovered with biases as low as $|\Delta \log(T_0/\text{K})| \lesssim 0.05$ dex, $|\Delta \gamma | \lesssim 0.1$, smaller than the precision of a typical measurement. Given the large differences in the volume-weighted WHIM fractions between the three simulations (Illustris 38\%, IllustrisTNG 10\%, Nyx 4\%) we conclude that the $b$-$N_{H I}$ distribution is not sensitive to the WHIM under realistic conditions. Finally, we investigate the physical properties of the detectable Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers, and discover that although their $T$ and $\Delta$ distributions remain mostly unaffected by feedback, they are correlated with the photoionization rate used in the simulation.
