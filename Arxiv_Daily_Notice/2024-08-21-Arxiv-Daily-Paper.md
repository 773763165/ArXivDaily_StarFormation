#### Title:
          The streaming model for the three-point correlation function and its connection to standard perturbation theory

 - **Abstract**
 Redshift-space distortions present a significant challenge in building models for the three-point correlation function (3PCF). We compare two possible lines of attack: the streaming model and standard perturbation theory (SPT). The two approaches differ in their treatment of the non-linear mapping from real to redshift space: SPT expands this mapping perturbatively, while the streaming model retains its non-linear form but relies on simplifying assumptions about the probability density function (PDF) of line-of-sight velocity differences between pairs or triplets of tracers. To assess the quality of the predictions and the validity of the assumptions of these models, we measure the monopole of the matter 3PCF and the first two moments of the pair- and triplewise velocity PDF from a suite of N-body simulations. We also evaluate the large-scale limit of the streaming model and determine under which conditions it aligns to SPT. On scales $>10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, we find that the streaming model for the 3PCF monopole is dominated by the first two velocity moments, making the exact shape of the PDF irrelevant. This model can match the accuracy of a Stage-IV galaxy survey, if the velocity moments are measured directly from the simulations. However, replacing the measurements with perturbative expressions to leading order generates large errors already on scales of $60-70 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. This is the main drawback of the streaming model. Conversely, the SPT model for the 3PCF cannot account for the significant velocity dispersion that is present at all scales, and consequently provides predictions with limited accuracy. We demonstrate that this issue can be addressed by isolating the large-scale limit of the dispersion, which leads to typical Fingers-of-God damping functions. Overall, the SPT model with a damping function provides the best deal in terms of accuracy and computing time.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D- early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr- AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4$He anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes

 - **Abstract**
 A new image-reconstruction algorithm, PRIMO, applied to the interferometric data of the M87 black hole collected with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), resulted in an image that reached the native resolution of the telescope array. PRIMO is based on learning a compact set of image building blocks obtained from a large library of high-fidelity, physics-based simulations of black hole images. It uses these building blocks to fill the sparse Fourier coverage of the data that results from the small number of telescopes in the array. In this paper, we show that this approach is readily justified. Since the angular extent of the image of the black hole and of its inner accretion flow is finite, the Fourier space domain is heavily smoothed, with a correlation scale that is at most comparable to the sizes of the data gaps in the coverage of Fourier space with the EHT. Consequently, PRIMO or other machine-learning algorithms can faithfully reconstruct the images without the need to generate information that is unconstrained by the data within the resolution of the array. We also address the completeness of the eigenimages and the compactness of the resulting representation. We show that PRIMO provides a compact set of eigenimages that have sufficient complexity to recreate a broad set of images well beyond those in the training set.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar limb darkening is the observed variation in brightness of a star between its centre and edge (or limb) when viewed in the plane of the sky. Stellar brightness is maximal at the centre and then decreases radially and monotonically towards the limb -- hence the term "limb darkening". This effect is crucial for finding and characterising planets beyond our Solar System, known as exoplanets, as these planets are often studied when crossing in front of their host stars. As such, limb darkening is directly linked to the exoplanet signals. Limb darkening is typically modelled by one of various functional forms, as outlined in Claret (2000) and Sing (2010), and the coefficients of these functions is what ExoTiC-LD is designed to compute. A wide variety of functional forms are supported, including those benchmarked by Espinoza & Jordán (2016) as well as reparameterisations suggested by Kipping (2013).

 - **Abstract**
 Large spectroscopic surveys of individual massive stars, such as ULLYSES and XSHOOTU, provide observational data for hundreds of massive stars. Their analysis requires large numbers of synthetic spectra so that stellar parameters can be determined. In addition, libraries of massive stars' spectra are needed to produce population synthesis models able to reproduce the observed spectra of unresolved young stellar populations, such as those revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the early Universe. Our main goal is to provide an extensive library of synthetic spectra and spectral energy distributions of OB stars at metallicities of the Magellanic Clouds. This library will offer a wealth of spectrophotometric information, making it readily applicable to a variety of astrophysical problems. We used the CMFGEN code to calculate 606 NLTE, line-blanketed, expanding atmosphere models using a comprehensive set of atomic data. An overall metallicity of 1/2 Z$_\odot$ and 1/5 Z$_\odot$ was adopted for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. We produced high-resolution spectra from 30 angstroms to 3 $\mu$m for stars on the Main Sequence and slightly beyond. We provide spectral energy distributions, normalized synthetic spectra, ionizing fluxes, and photometry in various bands: Johnson UBV, Cousins RI, Bessel JHK, selected wide JWST filters, Gaia, and LSST ugrizy filters. For each of these filters, we compute bolometric corrections for all synthetic spectra and calibrations as a function of effective temperature. All of our synthetic spectra are publicly available through the POLLUX database, aiming to expedite multiwavelength analyses of massive stars in low metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 It is now well established that galactic systems are inherently multiphase, and that understanding the roles and interactions of the various phases is key towards a more complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution. For example, these interactions play a pivotal role in the cycling of baryons which fuels star formation. It remains a challenge that the transport and dynamics of cold clouds in their surrounding hot environment are governed by complex small scale processes (such as the interplay of turbulence and radiative cooling) that determine how the phases exchange mass, momentum and energy. Large scale models thus require subgrid prescriptions in the form of models validated on small scale simulations, which can take the form of a system of coupled differential equations. In this work, we explore using neural ordinary differential equations which embed a neural network as a term in the subgrid model to capture an uncertain physical process. We then apply Symbolic Regression on the learned model to potentially discover new insights into the physics of cloud-environment interactions. We test this on both generated mock data and actual simulation data. We also extend the neural ODE to include a secondary neural term. We show that neural ODEs in tandem with Symbolic Regression can be used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of subgrid models, and/or discover the underlying equations to improve generality and scientific understanding. We highlight the potential of this scientific machine learning approach as a natural extension to the traditional modelling paradigm, both for the development of semi-analytic models and for physically interpretable equation discovery in complex non-linear systems.

          The GT and GHC models for molecular clouds compared. Differences, similarities, and myths

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a detailed comparison between the ``gravoturbulent'' (GT) and ``global hierarchical collapse'' (GHC) models for molecular clouds and star formation, their respective interpretations of the observational data, the features they share, and suggested tests and observations to discern between them. Also, we clarify common misconceptions in recent literature about the global and hierarchical nature of the GHC scenario, and briefly discuss the evolution of some aspects of both models toward convergence. GT assumes that molecular clouds and their substructures are in approximate virial equilibrium and are in a near-stationary state, interprets the linewidth-derived nonthermal motions exclusively as turbulence, which provides additional pressure against self-gravity. Conversely, GHC assumes that most star-forming molecular clouds and their substructures are part of a continuous gravitationally-driven flow, each accreting from their parent structure. Thus, the clouds and their star formation rate evolve in time. GHC interprets nonthermal motions as a mixture of infall and turbulent components, with the relative importance of the former increasing as the objects become denser and/or more massive. Tests that may provide clues to distinguishing between GT and GHC must take into account that the innermost parts of globally gravitationally bound structures may not locally appear bound, and thus the binding may have to be searched for at the largest scale of the structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilized steady-state, axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic fluid equations around a black hole in a Schwarzschild geometry background. Here, the relativistic Schwarzschild geometry is mimicked by the Paczy{ń}sky-Wiita potential. We investigated two types of inflowing gases that can generate different kinds of accretion flows around the central objects. The inflowing gases are presented on the local energies ($B_{ob}$) of the gases versus the outermost accretion boundary locations ($r_{ob}$) plane we named it the outermost boundary condition (OBC)-plane. Based on the energies of the inflowing gases we found two types of inflowing gas classified as cold-mode and hot-mode inflowing gases in the OBC-plane. Doing so we have found the initial temperature of the inflowing gases can be a parameter for the study of the accretion process. As it can affect the disk structure and optical depth of the accretion flow, which in turn can impact the radiative emissions observed in many accreting sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.

 - **Abstract**
 SPIDER is a balloon-borne instrument designed to map the cosmic microwave background at degree-angular scales in the presence of Galactic foregrounds. SPIDER has mapped a large sky area in the Southern Hemisphere using more than 2000 transition-edge sensors (TESs) during two NASA Long Duration Balloon flights above the Antarctic continent. During its first flight in January 2015, SPIDER observed in the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, setting constraints on the B-mode signature of primordial gravitational waves. Its second flight in the 2022-23 season added new receivers at 280 GHz, each using an array of TESs coupled to the sky through feedhorns formed from stacks of silicon wafers. These receivers are optimized to produce deep maps of polarized Galactic dust emission over a large sky area, providing a unique data set with lasting value to the field. In this work, we describe the instrument's performance during SPIDER's second flight.

 - **Abstract**
 Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.

          Viewing the explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation

 - **Abstract**
 The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a molecular survey of long period comets C/2021 A1 (Leonard) and C/2022 E3 (ZTF). Comet C/2021 A1 was observed with the IRAM 30-m radio telescope in November-December 2021 before perihelion when it was closest to the Earth. We observed C/2022 E3 in January-February 2023 with the Odin 1-m space telescope and IRAM 30-m, shortly after its perihelion, and when it was closest to the Earth. Snapshots were obtained during 12-16 November 2021 period for comet C/2021 A1. Spectral surveys were undertaken over the 8-13 December 2021 period for comet C/2021 A1 (8, 16, and 61 GHz bandwidth in the 3 mm, 2 mm, and 1 mm window) and over the 3-7 February 2023 period for comet C/2022 E3 (25 and 61 GHz at 2 and 1mm). We report detections of 14 molecular species (HCN, HNC, CH3CN, HNCO, NH2CHO, CH3OH, H2CO, HCOOH, CH3CHO, H2S, CS, OCS, C2H5OH and aGg-(CH2OH)2 ) in both comets plus HC3N and CH2OHCHO marginally detected in C/2021 A1 and CO and H2O (with Odin detected in C/2022 E3. The spatial distribution of several species is investigated. Significant upper limits on the abundances of other molecules and isotopic ratios are also presented. The activity of comet C/2021 A1 did not vary significantly between 13 November and 13 December 2021. Short-term variability in the outgassing of comet C/2022 E3 on the order of +-20% is present and possibly linked to its 8h rotation period. Both comets exhibit rather low abundances relative to water for volatiles species such as CO (< 2%) and H2S (0.15%). Methanol is also rather depleted in comet C/2021 A1 (0.9%). Following their revised photo-destruction rates, HNCO and HCOOH abundances in comets have been reevaluated. Both molecules are relatively enriched in these two comets (0.2% relative to water). We cannot exclude that these species could be produced by the dissociation of ammonium salts.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitational three-body decay (graviton Bremsstrahlung process) can leave an indelible signal at ultrahigh frequencies. We focus on a scenario where superheavy particles are produced gravitationally at a transition between the inflationary and kination phases and analyze the detectability of the signal in the presence of GWs generated from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation. We find that, in many cases, GWs from the graviton Bremsstrahlung are buried in the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from inflation. However, if the superheavy particles are as heavy as the Planck scale, the graviton Bremsstrahlung can produce a sizable amount of GWs, surpassing the inflationary ones.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of atmospheric parameters is fundamental for scientific research using stellar spectra. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), scheduled to be launched in 2024, will provide researchers with hundreds of millions of slitless spectra for stars during a 10 yr survey. And machine learning has unparalleled efficiency in processing large amounts of data compared to manual processing. Here we studied the stellar parameters of early-type stars (effective temperature Teff more than 15,000 K) based on the design indicators of the CSST slitless spectrum and the machine learning algorithm, Stellar LAbel Machine. We used the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (POWR) synthetic spectra library for cross validation. Then we tested the reliability of machine learning results by using the Next Generation Spectrum Library (NGSL) from Hubble Space Telescope observation data. We use the spectra with the impact of interstellar extinction (AV = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mag) and radial velocity (RV = -50, -30, 0, 30, 50 km s-1) from the POWR library as the test set. When RV = 0 km s-1 and AV = 0 mag, the average value and standard deviation for 3 wavelength ranges (2550-4050 Ang (R = 287); 4050-6300 Ang (R = 232); 6300-10000 Ang (R = 207)) are -66 K, 550 K, and 356 K for Teff, and 0.004 c.g.s, -0.024 c.g.s, and 0.01 c.g.s for log g. When using the observed data from NGSL as the testing samples, the deviation of Teff is less than 5%, and the deviation of log g is less than 11%. In addition, we also test the influence of shifting of spectra on the parameters accuracy. The deviation of Teff for the case with a shift of 5 Ang and 10 Ang are 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively; the deviation of log g are 4.2% and 5.1%. These results demonstrate that we can obtain relatively accurate stellar parameters of a population of early-type stars with the CSST slitless spectra and a machine-learning method.

          Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., radial gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span $50\%$ to $70\%$ of each planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, quickly leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations of convective staircases in non-rotating and rotating flows, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. Thus, the current existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.

 Many super-Earths are on very short orbits around their host star and, therefore, more likely to be tidally locked. Because this locking can lead to a strong contrast between the dayside and nightside surface temperatures, these super-Earths could exhibit mantle convection patterns and tectonics that could differ significantly from those observed in the present-day solar system. The presence of an atmosphere, however, would allow transport of heat from the dayside towards the nightside and thereby reduce the surface temperature contrast between the two hemispheres. On rocky planets, atmospheric and geodynamic regimes are closely linked, which directly connects the question of atmospheric thickness to the potential interior dynamics of the planet. Here, we study the interior dynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b ($R=1.34$ $R_{\oplus}$, $M=3.0$ $M_{\oplus}$, T$_\mathrm{eq}\approx700$ K), which is one of the most suitable M-dwarf super-Earth candidates for retaining an atmosphere produced by degassing from the mantle and magma ocean. We investigate how the geodynamic regime of GJ 486b is influenced by different surface temperature contrasts by varying possible atmospheric circulation regimes. We also investigate how the strength of the lithosphere affects the convection pattern. We find that hemispheric tectonics, the surface expression of degree-1 convection with downwellings forming on one hemisphere and upwelling material rising on the opposite hemisphere, is a consequence of the strong lithosphere rather than surface temperature contrast. Anchored hemispheric tectonics, where downwellings und upwellings have a preferred (day/night) hemisphere, is favoured for strong temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside and higher surface temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to strong irradiation, hot rocky exoplanets are able to sustain lava oceans. Direct interaction between these oceans and overlying atmospheres can provide insight into planetary interiors. In order to fully understand how the composition of the atmosphere of such planets are affected by the properties of the oceans, comprehensive chemical equilibrium models are required. Thus far, most models have only taken non-volatile species into account when calculating lava vaporisation. We investigate the effect of including C-, H-, N-, S-, and P-bearing species in the equilibrium lava vaporisation calculations on the overall atmospheric composition of hot rocky exoplanets by expanding our LavAtmos code. In LavAtmos 2.0 we integrate the chemical equilibrium code FastChem to expand the considered gas phase species to 523. We apply this new approach to calculate the composition of "pure" atmospheres which contain only a single volatile element and more complex atmospheres which contain C, H, N, S, and P. We also test two proposed compositions for the atmosphere of 55-Cnc e. We find that the inclusion of volatile elements in vaporisation calculations increases the partial pressures of vaporised species for all tested atmospheric compositions. Our models indicate that the tested volatile atmospheres above a lava ocean have a relatively low C-O ratio. This demonstrates the utility of complex chemical models that better describe the chemical behavior of atmospheres across a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Volatile elements must be taken into account for comprehensive modeling of vaporisation from a surface lava ocean into a volatile atmosphere. Vaporised species such as SiO, TiO, and Na may be present in greater abundances than previously estimated. A low atmospheric C/O ratio may be able to function as a new tracer for the presence of surface lava oceans on hot rocky exoplanets.

          Varying water activity and momentum transfer on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from its non-gravitational forces and torques

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the ability of a simultaneous fitting of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's non-gravitational forces, torques and total water-outgassing rate, as observed by Rosetta, to constrain complex thermophysical models of cometary material. We extend the previous work of fitting geographically defined surface outgassing models to the Rosetta observations by testing the effects of a more detailed geomorphological mapping, the resolution of the shape-model used, self-heating by neighbouring facets on the shape-model, thermal inertia in the outgassing solution, and variation in the momentum coupling between the gas and the nucleus. We also directly compare the non-gravitational acceleration curves available in the literature. We correct an error in the calculation of pole-orientation in the previous paper. We find that, under the assumptions of the model: non-gravitational forces and torques are driven by water sublimation from the nucleus, thermal inertia and self-heating have only minor effects, spatially uniform activity cannot explain 67P's non-gravitational dynamics, spatially uniform momentum transfer cannot explain 67P's non-gravitational dynamics, and different terrain types have different instantaneous responses to insolation. Consolidated terrain facing south on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has a high outgassing flux, steep response to insolation, and large gas momentum transfer coefficient. Meanwhile, that facing north behaves differently, producing low-to-no water outgassing, and with a lower momentum transfer efficiency. Dusty terrain also has a lower outgassing rate and momentum transfer efficiency, and either depletes its volatile component or is buried in fall-back as the comet approaches the Sun. Momentum transfer appears correlated with insolation, likely due to an increased enhancement in the gas temperature as the dust it flows through is heated.

 - **Abstract**
 The programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG Telescope (PLACID) instrument will be installed on the Turkish 4-m Telescope by the fall of 2024 and is expected to be on-sky by the end of the year. PLACID will be the first ''active stellar coronagraph instrument'', equipped with a customized spatial light modulator (SLM), which performs as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) from H- to Ks- band. A Python-based numerical simulator of SLM-based focal-plane phase coronagraph is developed to investigate the effects of discrete pixelated FPM patterns in place of classical phase masks. The simulator currently explores the impacts of two design choices, spatial sampling in the coronagraphic focal-plane (number of SLM pixels per $\lambda$/D) and phase resolution (SLM greylevel steps). The preliminary results of the monochromatic simulations show that in ideal conditions (no wavefront errors) it is sufficient to use FPMs with spatial sampling of 10 SLM pixel per $\lambda$/D and phase resolution of 8 bits. The tool is expected to enable detailed simulations of PLACID or similar SLM-based instruments, and to help with real-time operations (optimal choice of FPM for given observing conditions) and interpretation of real data. Additionally, the tool is designed to integrate and simulate advanced operation modes, in particular focal-plane phase diversity for coherent differential imaging (CDI) of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The Programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG telescope (PLACID) instrument is a novel high-contrast direct imaging facility that was recently delivered to the Turkish 4-m DAG telescope, with first light anticipated by the end of 2024. In a nutshell, PLACID consists in a fore-optics coronagraphic intermediate stage platform, installed in-between the TROIA XAO system and the DIRAC HAWAII-1RG focal-plane array. The PLACID project, led by a consortium of Swiss Universities contracted by the Atatürk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center (ATASAM), has passed the Delivery Readiness Review (DRR) milestone in September 2023, and was delivered to ATASAM campus facilities in March 2024. The PLACID commissioning activities with the calibration light source at the summit, on the DAG telescope Nasmyth platform, are foreseen to take place this fall, with first light scheduled to take place before the end of the year. When on-sky, PLACID will be the world's first ''active coronagraph'' facility, fielding a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph from H- to Ks-band. This will provide a wealth of novel options to observers, among which software-only abilities to change or re-align the FPM pattern in function of conditions or science requirements, free of any actuator motion. Future features will include non-common path aberrations (NCPA) self-calibration, optimized coronagraphy for binary stars, as well as coherent differential imaging (CDI). We hereby present the delivered PLACID instrument, its current capabilities, and Factory Acceptance commissioning results with relevant performance metrics.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been generally accepted that the originators of the double star astronomy were Christian Mayer and William Herschel. We recovered the memory of the poorly known Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna, who published the first catalogue of stellar binaries over a century before Mayer and Herschel. We analysed the fourth section of 1654 G. B. Hodierna's book "De systemate orbis cometici deque admirandis coeli characteribus". There, Hodierna listed a dozen pairs of stars whose identification with modern star names had been lost for centuries. To identify the pairs, we used Hodierna's Latin descriptions of location in constellations for all primary stars, ecliptic coordinates and angular separations to companions for some, and the Washington Double Star, Hipparcos, and Gaia catalogues. We were able to identify the twelve primaries and eleven multiple systems with companions, of which nine were double and two were triple. Besides, with up-to-date data, we confirmed that four systems are physically bound: Atlas and Pleione, alpha1,2 Lib, nu1,2 Dra, and theta1 Ori A, C, and D. The other seven pairs are alignments of very bright stars at different distances.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a $\gamma=5/3$ (or $\gamma=4/3$) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor $\beta \gtrsim 0.62$ (or $\gtrsim 1.1$) or loses energy vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.

 - **Abstract**
 The operation of upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and neutrino radio-detection experiments, like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), poses significant computational challenges involving the production of numerous simulations of particle showers and their detection, and a high data throughput. GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data. We present an overview of GRANDlib to serve as the basis of future GRAND analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first global Bayesian analysis of the time-ordered DIRBE data within the Cosmoglobe framework, building on the same methodology that has previously been successfully applied to Planck LFI and WMAP. These data are analyzed jointly with COBE-FIRAS, Gaia, Planck HFI, and WISE, allowing for more accurate instrumental and astrophysical characterization than possible through single-experiment analysis. This paper provides an overview of the analysis pipeline and main results, and we present and characterize a new set of zodiacal light subtracted mission average (ZSMA) DIRBE maps spanning 1.25 to 240 $\mu$m. A novel aspect of this processing is the characterization and removal of excess radiation between 4.9 and 60$\,\mu$m that appears static in solar-centric coordinates. The DR2 ZSMA maps have several advantages with respect to the previously available maps, including 1) lower zodiacal light (and possibly straylight) residuals; 2) better determined zero-levels; 3) natively HEALPix tessellated maps with a $7'$ pixel size; 4) nearly white noise at pixel scales; and 5) a more complete and accurate noise characterization established through the combination of MCMC samples and half-mission maps. In addition, because the model has been simultaneously fitted with both DIRBE and HFI data, this is the first consistent unification of the infrared and CMB wavelength ranges into one global sky model covering 100 GHz to 1 $\mu$m. However, even though the new maps are improved with respect to the official maps, and should be preferred for most future analyses that require DIRBE sky maps, they still exhibit non-negligible zodiacal light residuals between 12 and 60$\,\mu$m. Further improvements should be made through joint analysis with complementary infrared experiments such IRAS, AKARI, WISE and SPHEREx, and releasing the full combined potential of all these powerful infrared observatories.

          Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream

 - **Abstract**
 The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of the highly active FRB 20240114A with MeerKAT using the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF; $544\text{--}1088$ MHz) and L-band ($856\text{--}1712$ MHz) receivers. A total of 62 bursts were detected in coherent tied-array beams using the MeerTRAP real-time transient detection pipeline. We measure a structure-optimising dispersion measure of $527.65\pm0.01\,\text{pc}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ using the brightest burst in the sample. We find the bursts of FRB 20240114A are generally detected in part of the broad band of MeerKAT, $\sim40\%$ in the UHF and $\sim30\%$ in the L-band, indicating the band limited nature. We analyse the fluence distribution of the 44 bursts detected at UHF, constraining the fluence completeness limit to $\sim1\,$Jy ms, above which the cumulative burst rate follows a power law $R (>F)\propto (F/1\,\text{Jy}\,\text{ms})^\gamma$ with $\gamma=-1.8\pm0.2$. Using channelised telescope data captured in our transient buffer we localise FRB 20240114A in the image domain to RA = 21h27m39.86s, Dec = +04d19m45.01s with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec. This localisation allows us to confidently identify the host galaxy of FRB 20240114A. Also using the transient buffer data we perform a polarimetric study and demonstrate that most of the bursts have $\sim100\%$ linear polarisation fractions and up to $\sim20\%$ circular polarisation fractions. Finally, we predict the flux density of a potential persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A is $\backsimeq[0.6\text{--}60]\,\mu\text{Jy}$ based on the simple relation between the luminosity of the PRS and the rotation measure arising from the FRB local environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of lithium abundances in solar-type stars have shown that standard models of stellar evolution are incapable of explaining the observed depletion as a function of stellar age. Beryllium is one of the lightest elements that can be measured in stellar photospheres, and it can be burned in relatively low temperatures. Studying its abundances as a function of stellar age can provide important constraints to stellar mixing models, as the level of depletion as a function of time will indicate how deep the photospheric material must be dredged to explain the observed abundances of both elements. In an effort to provide the most stringent constraints for non-standard stellar mixing models, we observed a sample of solar-twins and concomitantly analyzed their lithium and beryllium abundances. Unlike what is typically observed for lithium, we find that beryllium does not decrease as a function of stellar age, constraining models that predict burning of both materials. Based on our data, models that invoke convective overshoot and convective settling are preferred over typical rotationaly-induced mixing models, as the later burn Be in excess while the former do not. Previous works also proposed mixing due to gravity waves as a possible explanation for observed abundances, which can fit our data as well. We also confirm previous finds of an increase in Be abundance as a function of metallicity, indicative of galactic production via cosmic ray spallation.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines, the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

          Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?

 - **Abstract**
 We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.
