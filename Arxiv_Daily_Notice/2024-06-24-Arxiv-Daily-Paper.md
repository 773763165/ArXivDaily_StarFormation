 - **Abstract**
 During reionization, intergalactic ionization fronts (I-fronts) are sources of Ly$\alpha$ line radiation produced by collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms within the fronts. In principle, detecting this emission could provide direct evidence for a reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we use a suite of high-resolution one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations run on cosmological density fields to quantify the parameter space of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ production efficiency -- the ratio of emitted Ly$\alpha$ flux to incident ionizing flux driving the front -- depends mainly on the I-front speed and the spectral index of the ionizing radiation. IGM density fluctuations on scales smaller than the typical I-front width produce scatter in the efficiency, but they do not significantly boost its mean value. The Ly$\alpha$ flux emitted by an I-front is largest if 3 conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the incident ionizing flux is large; (2) the incident spectrum is hard, consisting of more energetic photons; (3) the I-front is traveling through a cosmological over-density, which causes it to propagate more slowly. We present a convenient parameterization of the efficiency in terms of I-front speed and incident spectral index. We make these results publicly available as an interpolation table and we provide a simple fitting function for a representative ionizing background spectrum. Our results can be applied as a sub-grid model for I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions in reionization simulations with spatial and/or temporal resolutions too coarse to resolve I-front structure. In a companion paper, we use our results to explore the possibility of directly imaging Ly$\alpha$ emission around neutral islands during the last phases of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a stellar dynamical mass measurement of the supermassive black hole in the elliptical (E1) galaxy NGC 3258. Our findings are based on Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer observations in Narrow Field Mode with adaptive optics and in the MUSE Wide Field Mode, from which we extract kinematic information by fitting the Ca II and Mg $b$ triplets, respectively. Using axisymmetric, three-integral Schwarzschild orbit-library models, we fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distributions to infer the supermassive black hole mass, the $H$-band mass-to-light ratio, the asymptotic circular velocity, and the dark matter halo scale radius of the galaxy. We report a black hole mass of $(2.2 \pm 0.2)\times10^9 \ \rm M_{\scriptscriptstyle\odot}$ at an assumed distance of $31.9 \ \rm Mpc$. This value is in close agreement with a previous measurement from ALMA CO observations. The consistency between these two measurements provides strong support for both the gas dynamical and stellar dynamical methods.

          Imaging reionization's last phases with I-front Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions

 - **Abstract**
 Long troughs observed in the $z > 5.5$ Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ forests are thought to be caused by the last remaining neutral patches during the end phases of reionization -- termed neutral islands. If this is true, then the longest troughs mark locations where we are most likely to observe the reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). A key feature of the neutral islands is that they are bounded by ionization fronts (I-fronts) which emit Lyman series lines. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly imaging the outline of neutral islands with a narrowband survey targeting Ly$\alpha$. In a companion paper, we quantified the intensity of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions during reionization and its dependence on the spectrum of incident ionizing radiation and I-front speed. Here we apply those results to reionization simulations to model the emissions from neutral islands. We find that neutral islands would appear as diffuse structures that are tens of comoving Mpc across, with surface brightnesses in the range $\approx 1 - 5\times 10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. The islands are brighter if the spectrum of ionizing radiation driving the I-fronts is harder, and/or if the I-fronts are moving faster. We develop mock observations for current and futuristic observatories and find that, while extremely challenging, detecting neutral islands is potentially within reach of an ambitious observing program with wide-field narrowband imaging. Our results demonstrate the potentially high impact of low-surface brightness observations for studying reionization.

          Inner walls or vortices? Crescent-shaped asymmetries in ALMA observations of protoplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 Crescent-shaped asymmetries are common in millimetre observations of protoplanetary discs and are usually attributed to vortices or dust overdensities. However, they often appear on a single side of the major axis and roughly symmetric about the minor axis, suggesting a geometric origin. In this work, we interpret such asymmetries as emission from the exposed inner cavity walls of inclined discs and use them to characterise their vertical extent. Here we focus on the discs around CIDA 9 and RY Tau, first modelling their observations in visibility space with a simple geometric prescription for the walls, and then exploring more detailed radiative transfer models. Accounting for the wall emission yields significantly better residuals than purely axisymmetric models, and we estimate the dust scale height of these systems to be 0.4 au at 37 au for CIDA 9 and 0.2 au at 12 au for RY Tau. Finally, we identify crescent-shaped asymmetries in twelve discs, nine of which have constraints on their orientation - in all cases, the asymmetry appears on the far-side of the disc, lending support to the hypothesis that they are due to their inner rims. Modelling this effect in larger samples of discs will help to build a statistical view of their vertical structure.

          Multistructured accretion flow of Sgr A* I: Examination of a RIAF model

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme low-luminosity supermassive black hole Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory in which to test radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. Previous fits to the quiescent Chandra ACIS-S spectrum found a RIAF model with an equal inflow-outflow balance works well. In this work, we apply the RIAF model to the Chandra HETG-S spectrum obtained through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program, which displays features suggestive of temperature and velocity structures within the plasma. A comprehensive forward model analysis accounting for the accretion flow geometry and HETG-S instrumental effects is required for a full interpretation of the quiescent Chandra HETG-S spectrum. We present a RIAF model that takes these effects into account. Our fits to the high-resolution gratings spectrum indicate an inflow balanced by an outflow ($s \sim 1$) alongside a temperature profile that appears shallower than what would be expected from a gravitational potential following $1/r$. The data require that the abundance of Iron relative to solar is $Z_{Fe} < 0.32 Z_\odot$ (90\% credible interval), much lower than the $2~Z_\odot$ metallicity measured in nearby late-type giants. While future missions like NewAthena will provide higher spectral resolution, source separation will continue to be a problem. Leveraging Chandra's unparalleled spatial resolution, which is not expected to be surpassed for decades, remains essential for detailed investigations of the densely populated Galactic Center in X-rays.

          Multistructured accretion flow of Sgr A* II: Signatures of a Cool Accretion Disk in Hydrodynamic Simulations of Stellar Winds

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations of the stellar winds from Wolf-Rayet stars within the Galactic Center can provide predictions for the X-ray spectrum of supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Herein, we present results from updated smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations, building on the architecture of Cuadra et al. (2015); Russell et al. (2017), finding that a cold gas disk forms around Sgr A* with a simulation runtime of 3500 years. This result is consistent with previous grid-based simulations, demonstrating that a cold disk can form regardless of numerical method. We examine the plasma scenarios arising from an environment with and without this cold disk, by generating synthetic spectra for comparison to the quiescent Fe K alpha Sgr A* spectrum from Chandra HETG-S, taken through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program. We find that current and future X-ray missions are unlikely to distinguish between the kinematic signatures in the plasma in these two scenarios. Nonetheless, the stellar wind plasma model presents a good fit to the dispersed Chandra spectra within 1.5" of Sgr A*. We compare our results to the Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) model fit to the HETG-S spectrum presented in Paper I and find that the Bayesian model evidence does not strongly favor either model. With 9" angular resolution and high spectral resolution of the X-IFU, NewAthena will offer a clearer differentiation between the RIAF plasma model and hydrodynamic simulations, but only a future X-ray mission with arcsecond resolution will significantly advance our understanding of Sgr A*'s accretion flow in X-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The ring-like images of the two supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide powerful probes of the physics of accretion flows at horizon scales. Specifically, the brightness asymmetry in the images carries information about the angular velocity profile of the inner accretion flow and the inclination of the observer, owing to the Doppler boosts photons experience at their site of emission. In this paper, we develop a method for quantifying the brightness asymmetry of black-hole images in the Fourier domain, which can be measured directly from interferometric data. We apply this method to current EHT data and find that the image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) has an unusually low degree of asymmetry that is even lower than that inferred for M87. We then use a covariant semi-analytic model to obtain constraints on the inclinations and velocity profiles of the inner accretion flow for Sgr A*. We find that the lack of significant brightness asymmetry forces the observer inclination to uncomfortably small values ($6-10^\circ$), if the plasma velocity follows Keplerian profiles. Alternatively, larger inclination angles can be accommodated if the plasma velocities are significantly sub-Keplerian and the black hole is not spinning rapidly.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has recently revealed a large population of accreting black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Even after accounting for possible systematic biases, the high-z $M_*-M_{\rm \rm bh}$ relation derived from these objects by Pacucci et al. (2023 P23 relation) is above the local scaling relation by $>3\sigma$. To understand the implications of potentially overmassive high-z BH populations, we study the BH growth at $z\sim4-7$ using the $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations with systematic variations of heavy seed models that emulate direct collapse black hole (DCBH) formation. In our least restrictive seed model, we place $\sim10^5~M_{\odot}$ seeds in halos with sufficient dense and metal-poor gas. To model conditions for direct collapse, we impose additional criteria based on a minimum Lyman Werner flux (LW flux $=10~J_{21}$), maximum gas spin, and an environmental richness criterion. The high-z BH growth in our simulations is merger dominated, with a relatively small contribution from gas accretion. For the most restrictive simulation that includes all the above seeding criteria for DCBH formation, the high-z $M_*-M_{\rm bh}$ relation falls significantly below the P23 relation (by factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim4$). Only by excluding the spin and environment based criteria, and by assuming $\lesssim750~\mathrm{Myr}$ delay times between host galaxy mergers and subsequent BH mergers, are we able to reproduce the P23 relation. Overall, our results suggest that if high-z BHs are indeed systematically overmassive, assembling them would require more efficient heavy seeding channels, higher initial seed masses, additional contributions from lighter seeds to BH mergers, and / or more efficient modes for BH accretion.

          Modelling the evolution of the Galactic disc scale height traced by open clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The scale height of the spatial distribution of open clusters (OCs) in the Milky Way exhibits a well known increase with age which is usually interpreted as evidence for dynamical heating of the disc or of the disc having been thicker in the past. Aims. We address the increase of the scale height with age of the OC population from a different angle. We propose that the apparent thickening of the disc can be largely explained as a consequence of a stronger disruption of OCs near the Galactic plane by disc phenomena, namely encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Methods. We present a computational model that forms OCs with different initial masses and follows their orbits while subjecting them to different disruption mechanisms. To setup the model and infer its parameters, we use and analyse a Gaia-based OC catalogue (Dias et al. 2021). We investigate both the spatial and age distributions of the OC population and discuss the completeness of the sample. The simulation results are then compared to the observations. Results. Consistent with previous studies, the observations reveal that the SH of the spatial distribution of OCs increases with age. We find that it is very likely that the OC sample is incomplete even for the solar neighbourhood. The model simulations successfully reproduce the SH increase with age and the total number of OCs that survive with age up to 1 Gyr. For older OCs, the predicted SH from the model starts deviating from the observations, although remaining within the uncertainties of the observations. This can be related with effects of incompleteness and/or simplifications in the model. Conclusions. A selective disruption of OCs near the galactic plane through GMC encounters is able to explain the SH evolution of the OC population.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical makeup of our solar system is a reflection of Galactic chemical evolution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) over the past ~9 Ga before the formation of the solar system. Although the incorporated ISM dust was mostly destroyed during the solar system formation, a small fraction of the ISM dust, known as presolar grains, is preserved in pristine extraterrestrial materials and identified through their exotic isotopic compositions, pointing to their formation in gas outflows or explosions of ancient stars. Since their stellar birth at more than 4.6 Ga, presolar grains have borne witness to a diverse array of astrophysical and cosmochemical processes. In this chapter, I will review recent progress in utilizing the isotopic and structural compositions of presolar grains to constrain physical mixing processes and dust formation in stars, stellar nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, and the origin and evolution of the solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the occultation of Betelgeuse by asteroid (319) Leona on December 12, 2023, observed using a 64x64 pixel Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array mounted on a 10-inch telescope at the AstroCamp Observatory in Nerpio, Southeast of Spain, just a few kilometers from the center of the occultation shadow path. This study highlights remarkable advancements in applying SPAD technology in astronomy. The SPAD array's asynchronous readout capacity and photon-counting timestamp mode enabled a temporal resolution of 1 microsecond in our light curve observations of Betelgeuse. Our data analysis addressed challenges inherent to SPAD arrays, such as optical cross-talk and afterpulses, which typically cause the photon statistics to deviate from a Poisson distribution. By adopting a generalized negative binomial distribution for photon statistics, we accurately describe the observational data. This method yielded an optical cross-talk estimation of 1.07% in our SPAD array and confirmed a negligible impact of spurious detected events due to afterpulses. The meticulous statistical examination of photon data underscores our SPAD-array's exceptional performance in conducting precise astronomical observations. The observations revealed a major decrease in Betelgeuse's intensity by 77.78% at the occultation's peak, allowing us to measure Betelgeuse's angular diameter at 57.26 mas in the SDSS g-band. This measurement, employing a simplified occultation model and considering the known properties of Leona, demonstrates the potential of SPAD technology for astronomy and sets a new standard for observing ultra-rapid transient celestial events, providing a valuable public dataset for the astronomical community.

 Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will revolutionize our understanding of the Galactic Bulge with its Galactic Bulge Time Domain survey. At the same time, Rubin Observatories's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor billions of stars in the Milky Way. The proposed Roman survey of the Galactic Plane, with its NIR passbands and exquisite spacial resolution, promises groundbreaking insights for a wide range of time-domain galactic astrophysics. In this white paper, we describe the scientific returns possible from the combination of the Roman Galactic Plane Survey with the data from LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are often characterized indirectly by analyzing the properties of secondary cosmic ray particles produced in the collisions with air nuclei, the particle number $N_\mu$ of muon and the depth of shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$ after air shower cascade are mostly studied to infer the energy and mass of the incident cosmic rays. While, researches have shown that there is a significant excess comparing the observed number of muons arriving at the ground from extensive air showers (EAS) with the simulations by using the existing cosmic ray hadronic interaction model. To explain this muon excess phenomenon, a new theoretical model, the gluon condensation model (GC model), is introduced in this paper and simulated by using the AIRES engine. We asumme that the GC effect appearing mainly in the first colliding of the cascade, leads to a significant increase in the strangeness production, accodingly, the production rate of kaons is improved appearantly. The model assumes that only pions and kaons are the new prodcutions in the hadron cascades. It is found that, considering the GC effect, the value of $n_K/n_\pi$ increases and more energy of the incident cosmic rays paticipate in hadron cascades, and then increase the number of mouns finally. This model provides a new theoretical possibility to explain the muon excess puzzle.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmography can be used to constrain the kinematics of universe in a model-independent way. In this work, we attempted to combine the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$ approximations with the latest Pantheon+ sample for testing cosmological principle. Based on the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$ approximations, we first gave the cosmographic constraints on the different order polynomials including third-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,1)}$), fourth-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,2)}$) and fifth-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(3,2)}$). Based on the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,1)}$ ($j_{0}$ = 1) polynomial and hemisphere comparison (HC) method, we tested the cosmological principle and found the preferred directions of cosmic anisotropy, such as (l, b) = (304.6$^{\circ}$$_{-37.4}^{+51.4}$, $-$18.7$^{\circ}$$_{-20.3}^{+14.7}$) and (311.1$^{\circ}$$_{-8.4}^{+17.4}$, $-$17.53$^{\circ}$$_{-7.7}^{+7.8}$) for $q_{0}$ and $H_{0}$, respectively. These two directions are consistent with each other in $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the corresponding results of statistical isotropy analyses including Isotropy and Isotropy with real positions (RP) are quite different. The statistical significance of $H_{0}$ are stronger than that of $q_{0}$, i.e., 4.75$\sigma$ and 4.39$\sigma$ for the Isotropy and Isotropy with RP respectively. Reanalysis with fixed $q_{0} = -0.55$ (corresponds to $\Omega_{m}$ = 0.30) gives similar results. Overall, our model-independent results provide clear indications for a possible cosmic anisotropy, which must be taken seriously. Further test is needed to better understand this signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama desert of Chile, will conduct wide-field and small deep-field surveys of the sky with more than 100,000 detectors on the Prime-Cam instrument. Kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) were chosen as the primary sensor technology for their high density focal plane packing. Additionally, they benefit from low cost, ease of fabrication, and simplified cryogenic readout, which are all beneficial for successful deployment at scale. The cryogenic multiplexing complexity is pulled out of the cryostat and is instead pushed into the digital signal processing of the room temperature electronics. Using the Xilinx Radio Frequency System on a Chip (RFSoC), a highly multiplexed KID readout was developed for the first light Prime-Cam and commissioning Mod-Cam instruments. We report on the performance of the RFSoC-based readout with multiple detector arrays in various cryogenic setups. Specifically we demonstrate detector noise limited performance of the RFSoC-based readout under the expected optical loading conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the spatial distribution of organics on Ceres using the visible and near-infrared data collected by the Dawn mission. We employ a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) approach to map organic materials within the Ernutet crater at the highest available spatial resolution revealing a discontinuous, granular distribution and a possible correlation with an ancient crater on which Ernutet has been superimposed. The SMA technique also helps us identify 11 new areas as potential sites for organics. These regions are predominantly located within craters or along their walls, resembling the distribution pattern observed in Ernutet, which implies a possible geological link with materials exposed from beneath the surface. In one of these candidate regions situated in the Yalode quadrangle, we detected the characteristic 3.4-micron absorption band in the infrared spectrum, indicative of organics and carbonates. By combining the spatial resolution of the Framing Camera data with the spectral resolution of the Visual and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer using SMA, we investigated the distribution of the 3.4-micron band in this quadrangle. The absorption pattern correlates with the Yalode/Urvara smooth material unit, which formed after significant impacts on Ceres. The association of organic-rich materials with complex and multiple large-impact events supports for an endogenous origin for the organics on Ceres.

          Plunging region emission in the X-ray binary MAXI J0637$-$430

 - **Abstract**
 On the second of November 2019 the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J0637$-$430 went into outburst, at the start of which it was observed in a thermal ``disc-dominated'' state. High photon energy (extending above 10 keV) observations taken by the NuSTAR telescope reveal that this thermal spectrum can not be fit by conventional two-component (disc plus corona) approaches which ignore disc emission sourced from within the plunging region of the black hole's spacetime. Instead, these models require a third ``additional'' thermal component to reproduce the data. Using new disc solutions which extend classical models into the plunging region we show that this ``additional'' thermal emission can be explained self-consistently with photons emitted from the accretion flow at radii within the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole. This represents the second low mass X-ray binary, after MAXI J1820+070, with a detection of plunging region emission, suggesting that signatures of this highly relativistic region may well be widespread but not previously widely appreciated. To allow for a detection of the plunging region, the black hole in MAXI J0637$-$430 must be at most moderately spinning, and we constrain the spin to be $a_\bullet < 0.86$ at 99.9$\%$ confidence. We finish by discussing the observational requirements for the robust detection of this region.

          X Persei: A study on the origin of its high-energy emission

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The origin of the hard X-ray emission in the Be/X-ray binary system X Persei has long been debated as its atypical 'two-hump' spectrum can be modelled in multiple ways. The main debate focuses on the the high-energy hump, which is fit as either a cyclotron resonance scatter frequency (CRSF) or inverse Comptonization due to bulk Comptonization. Methods. Using INTEGRAL/JEM-X and ISGRI data, we studied the temporal and spectral variability in the 3-250 keV energy range during observations over ~15 years. A NuSTAR observation was also included in a joint spectral fit with the INTEGRAL spectrum. Results. We find that the joint spectrum can be described well by a low-energy component due to thermal Comptonization and a high-energy component due to bulk Comptonization, a CRSF, or a cyclotron emission line. The three models begin to diverge above ~120 keV, where statistics are low. Conclusions. We compare our results with observations of other Be/X-ray binaries that show similar 'two-hump' spectra while in a low-luminosity state. As the sources are in a low accretion state, the bulk Comptonization process is likely inefficient, and thus not an explanation for the high-energy component. The broad CRSF (27 +/- 2 keV) in X Persei suggests that the high-energy emission is not due to a CRSF. Thus, the high-energy component is potentially due to cyclotron emission, though other scenarios are not definitively excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 There is something about inverse-square laws that makes them fail at extremities. The inverse-square law, which is used commonly in studying the irradiance on exoplanets fails at the extreme case of planets closer than 0.01 AU. Therefore, in order to correctly predict possible climate states of such systems, we need a new model which accurately calculates angles subtended by various surface elements and integrate the generalized equation. A direct consequence of such a model is the shift of the terminator about 20 degrees beyond the poles. The irradiance at the poles is about 100-200 kW/m2 higher than what is predicted by the inverse-square law. This work therefore becomes crucial because it underscores the need to modify the current GCM models. The error in the numerical integration values of irradiance is less than one percent making our estimate very reliable.

 - **Abstract**
 The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC), a series of upgrades to the Keck II Adaptive Optics System and Instrument Suite, aims to demonstrate high-resolution spectroscopy of faint exoplanets that are spatially resolved from their host stars. In this paper, we measure KPIC's sensitivity to companions as a function of separation (i.e., the contrast curve) using on-sky data collected over four years of operation. We show that KPIC is able to reach contrasts of $1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ at 90 mas and $9.2 \times 10^{-6}$ at 420 mas separation from the star, and that KPIC can reach planet-level sensitivities at angular separations within the inner working angle of coronagraphic instruments such as GPI and SPHERE. KPIC is also able to achieve more extreme contrasts than other medium-/high-resolution spectrographs that are not as optimized for high-contrast performance. We decompose the KPIC performance budget into individual noise terms and discuss limiting factors. The fringing that results from combining a high-contrast imaging system with a high-resolution spectrograph is identified as an important source of systematic noise. After mitigation and correction, KPIC is able to reach within a factor of 2 of the photon noise limit at separations < 200 mas. At large separations, KPIC is limited by the background noise performance of NIRSPEC.

 - **Abstract**
 The ground-based technique for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes became a rapidly developing and powerful branch of science. Thanks to this technique, over 250 very high-energy gamma-ray sources of galactic and extragalactic origin have been discovered. Many fundamental questions of astrophysics, astro-particle physics, the physics of cosmic rays and cosmology are the focus of this technique. In the past 33 years since the discovery of the first gamma-ray source, the Crab Nebula, the discipline has made remarkable progress. Today, the technology boasts highly sensitive telescopes capable of detecting a point source 100 times fainter than the standard candle, the Crab Nebula, in 25 hours of observation. Further developments in this technology led to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the next-generation large instrument. The sensitivity of CTA will be several times higher than that of the current best instruments. This article presents a brief history of ground-based very high energy gamma-ray astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper is a mosaic telescope comprising 120 Canon telephoto lenses, based on the design of the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. With a wide field of view, and the addition of the "Dragonfly Filter-Tilter" instrumentation holding ultra narrow bandpass filters in front of each lens, the Dragonfly Spectral Line mapper is optimized for ultra low surface brightness imaging of visible wavelength line emission. The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper was constructed and commissioned in four phases from March 2022 to November 2023. During this time, four individual mounts of 30 lenses each were constructed and commissioned. The commissioning of the telescope included the deployment of the "Dragonfly StarChaser" which carries out image stabilization corrections in the telephoto lens, to enable hour-long exposures to be taken. In addition, we introduced new instrumentation such as a film to cover the optics to keep the filters clean. Here we describe the updated design of the complete 120-lens array, and the implementation of the instrumentation described above. Additionally, we present updated characterization of the cameras and filter transmission for the full array. Finally, we reflect on the construction and commissioning process of the complete 120-lens array Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper, and remark on the feasibility of a larger 1000-lens array.

 - **Abstract**
 LHS 1140 b is the second-closest temperate transiting planet to the Earth with an equilibrium temperature low enough to support surface liquid water. At 1.730$\pm$0.025 R$_\oplus$, LHS 1140 b falls within the radius valley separating H$_2$-rich mini-Neptunes from rocky super-Earths. Recent mass and radius revisions indicate a bulk density significantly lower than expected for an Earth-like rocky interior, suggesting that LHS 1140 b could either be a mini-Neptune with a small envelope of hydrogen ($\sim$0.1% by mass) or a water world (9--19% water by mass). Atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy can readily discern between these two scenarios. Here, we present two JWST/NIRISS transit observations of LHS 1140 b, one of which captures a serendipitous transit of LHS 1140 c. The combined transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b shows a telltale spectral signature of unocculted faculae (5.8 $\sigma$), covering $\sim$20% of the visible stellar surface. Besides faculae, our spectral retrieval analysis reveals tentative evidence of residual spectral features, best-fit by Rayleigh scattering from an N$_2$-dominated atmosphere (2.3 $\sigma$), irrespective of the consideration of atmospheric hazes. We also show through Global Climate Models (GCM) that H$_2$-rich atmospheres of various compositions (100$\times$, 300$\times$, 1000$\times$solar metallicity) are ruled out to $>$10 $\sigma$. The GCM calculations predict that water clouds form below the transit photosphere, limiting their impact on transmission data. Our observations suggest that LHS 1140 b is either airless or, more likely, surrounded by an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight. Our tentative evidence of an N$_2$-rich atmosphere provides strong motivation for future transmission spectroscopy observations of LHS 1140 b.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be star zeta Tau was recently reported to be a gamma Cas analog; that is, it displays an atypical (bright and hard) X-ray emission. The origin of these X-rays remains debated.The first X-ray observations indicated a very large absorption of the hot plasma component (N_H~ 10^{23}/cm^2). This is most probably related to the edge-on configuration of the zeta Tau disk. If the X-ray emission arises close to the companion, an orbital modulation of the absorption could be detected as the disk comes in and out of the line of sight. New XMM-Newton data were obtained to characterize the high-energy properties of zeta Tau in more detail. They are complemented by previous Chandra and SRG/eROSITA observations as well as by optical spectroscopy and TESS photometry. The high-quality XMM-Newton data reveal the presence of a faint soft X-ray emission, which appears in line with that recorded for non-gamma Cas Be stars. In addition, zeta Tau exhibits significant short-term variability at all energies, with larger amplitudes at lower frequencies (``red noise''), as is found in X-ray data of other gamma Cas stars. Transient variability (softness dip, low-frequency signal) may also be detected at some epochs. In addition, between X-ray exposures, large variations in the spectra are detected in the 1.5-4.keV energy band. They are due to large changes in absorption toward the hottest (9keV) plasma. These changes are not correlated with either the orbital phase or the depth of the shell absorption of the Halpha line. These observed properties are examined in the light of proposed gamma Cas models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Gravity.jl, a new software for the modeling of gravitational lens systems. Gravity.jl is written in the Julia programming language, and is designed to be fast, accurate, and flexible. It can be used to model gravitational lens systems composed of multiple lensing planes, and to perform Bayesian inference on the lens model parameters. In this paper we present the theoretical and statistical ideas behind the code, and we describe its main features. In this first paper of the series, we focus on the modeling of point-like and small extended sources, for which we can linearize the lens equation. We show a practical use of Gravity.jl on a galaxy-scale lens, and we compare the results with those obtained with other codes. We also show how Gravity.jl can be used to perform Bayesian inference on cosmological parameters.

          Optically Quiet, But FUV Loud: Results from comparing the far-ultraviolet predictions of flare models with TESS and HST

 - **Abstract**
 The far-ultraviolet (FUV) flare activity of low-mass stars has become a focus in our understanding of the exoplanet atmospheres and how they evolve. However, direct detection of FUV flares and measurements of their energies and rates are limited by the need for space-based observations. The difficulty of obtaining such observations may push some works to use widely available optical data to calibrate multi-wavelength spectral models that describe UV and optical flare emission. These models either use single temperature blackbody curves to describe this emission, or combine a blackbody curve with archival spectra. These calibrated models would then be used to predict the FUV flare rates of low-mass stars of interest. To aid these works, we used TESS optical photometry and archival HST FUV spectroscopy to test the FUV predictions of literature flare models. We tested models for partially (M0-M2) and fully convective (M4-M5) stars, 40 Myr and field age stars, and optically quiet stars. We calculated FUV energy correction factors that can be used to bring the FUV predictions of tested models in line with observations. A flare model combining optical and NUV blackbody emission with FUV emission based on HST observations provided the best estimate of FUV flare activity, where others underestimated the emission at all ages, masses and activity levels, by up to a factor of 104 for combined FUV continuum and line emission and greater for individual emission lines. We also confirmed previous findings that showed optically quiet low-mass stars exhibit regular FUV flares.

          SPRINT for WFAO systems

 - **Abstract**
 The calibration of future wide field adaptive optics (WFAO) systems requires knowledge of the geometry of the system, in particular the alignment parameters between the sub-apertures of the wavefront sensors (WFS), pupil and deformable mirror (DM) actuator grid. Without this knowledge, closed-loop operation is not possible and the registration must be identified with an error significantly smaller than the sub-aperture size to achieve the nominal performance of the adaptive optics system. Furthermore, poor accuracy in this estimation will not only affect performance, but could also prevent the closed loop from being stable. Identification is not trivial because in a WFAO system several elements can move with respect to each other, more than in a SCAO system. For example, the pairing of the sub-aperture and the actuator grating on a DM conjugated to an altitude different from 0 can depend on the size of the pupil on the WFS, the exact conjugation of the DM, the position of the guide star and the field rotation. This is the same for each WFS/DM pair. SPRINT, System Parameters Recurrent INvasive Tracking, is a strategy for monitoring and compensating for DM/WFS mis-registrations and has been developed in the context of single conjugate adaptive optics (SCAO) systems for the ESO Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In this work, we apply SPRINT in the context of WFAO systems with multiple WFSs and DMs, investigating the best approach for such systems, considering a simultaneous identification of all parameters or subsequent steps working on one DM at a time.

          Impact & Mitigation of Polarized Extragalactic Foregrounds on Bayesian Cosmic Microwave Background Lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Future low-noise cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from e.g., CMB-S4 will be polarization dominated, rather than temperature dominated. In this new regime, statistically optimal lensing reconstructions outperform the standard quadratic estimator, but their sensitivity to extragalactic polarized foregrounds has not been quantified. Using realistic simulations of polarized radio and infrared point sources, we show for the first time that optimal Bayesian lensing from a CMB-S4-like experiment is insensitive to the expected level of polarized extragalactic foregrounds after masking, as long as an accurate foreground power spectrum is included in the analysis. For more futuristic experiments where these foregrounds could cause a detectable bias, we propose a new method to jointly fit for lensing and the Poisson foregrounds, generalizing the bias hardening from the standard quadratic estimator to Bayesian lensing.
