#### SN 2022jli: The ultraluminous birth of a low-mass X-ray binary

 - **Abstract**
 Observations show that the 12.4 d binary system descending from the recent supernova SN 2022jli closely fits hypotheses of how low-mass X-ray binaries form, but requires an apparently super-Eddington accretion luminosity from the accreting component. We show that this agrees very well with the type of accretion-induced beaming found in ultraluminous X-ray sources, as recently strongly confirmed by X-ray polarimetry of the X-ray binary Cyg X-3. Beaming in the SN2022jli binary system occurs because of the very high mass-transfer rate induced by the violent effect of the supernova on the binary geometry. This explains the very soft nature of the accretion luminosity, its distinctive periodic light curve, and its luminosity decay on a ~250 day timescale. A test of this picture is that the system's orbital period should increase on a $10^5$ year timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the multiband properties of two ultraluminous X-ray sources (2CXO J225728.9-410211 = X-1 and 2CXO J225724.7-410343 = X-2) and their surroundings, in the spiral galaxy NGC 7424. Both sources have approached X-ray luminosities L_{X} ~ 10^{40} erg/s at some epochs. Thanks to a more accurate astrometric solution (based on Australia Telescope Compact Array and Gaia data), we identified the point-like optical counterpart of X-1, which looks like an isolated B8 supergiant (M ~ 9 Msun, age ~ 30 Myr). Instead, X-2 is in a star-forming region (size of about 100 pc x 150 pc), near young clusters and ionized gas. Very Large Telescope long-slit spectra show a spatially extended region of HeII 4686 emission around the X-ray position, displaced by about 50 pc from the brightest star cluster, which corresponds to the peak of lower-ionization line emission. We interpret the HeII 4686 emission as a signature of X-ray photo-ionization from the ULX, while the other optical lines are consistent with UV ionization in an ordinary HeII region. The luminosity of this He^{++} nebula puts it in the same class as other classical photo-ionized ULX nebulae such as those around Holmberg II X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1. We locate a strong (5.5-GHz luminosity nu L_{nu} ~ 10^{35} erg/s), steep-spectrum, unresolved radio source at the peak of the low-ionization lines, and discuss alternative physical scenarios for the radio emission. Finally, we use WISE data to obtain an independent estimate of the reddening of the star-forming clump around X-2.
#### On the structural properties of multiple populations in globular  clusters: the instructive case of NGC 3201

 - **Abstract**
 All multiple population (MP) formation models in globular clusters (GCs) predict that second population (SP) stars form more centrally concentrated than the first population (FP). As dynamical evolution proceeds, differences are progressively erased, and only dynamically young clusters are expected to still retain a partial memory of the initial structural differences. In recent years, this picture has been supported by observations of the MP radial distributions of both Galactic and extragalactic GCs. However, recent observations have suggested that in some systems, FPs might actually form more centrally segregated, with NGC 3201 being one significant example of such a possibility. Here we present a morphological and kinematic characterization of the MPs in NGC 3201 based on a combination of photometric and astrometric data. We show that the distribution of the SP is bimodal. Specifically, the SP is significantly more centrally concentrated than the FP within ~1.3 cluster's half-mass radius. Beyond this point, the SP fraction increases again, likely due to asymmetries in the spatial distributions of the two populations. The central concentration of the SP observed in the central regions implies that it formed more centrally concentrated than the FP, even more so than what is observed in the present-day. This interpretation is supported by the MP kinematic properties. Indeed, we find that the FP is isotropic across all the sampled cluster extension, while the velocity distribution of the SP becomes radially anisotropic in the cluster's outer regions, as expected for the dynamical evolution of SP stars formed more centrally concentrated than the FP. The combination of spatial and kinematic observations provide key insights into the dynamical properties of this cluster and lend further support to scenarios in which the SP forms more centrally concentrated than the FP.
#### Star clusters forming in a low metallicity starburst -- rapid  self-enrichment by (very) massive stars
 - **Authors:** Natalia Lahén, Thorsten Naab, Dorottya Szécsi

 - **Abstract**
 Massive ($\gtrsim9$ M$_\odot$) and very massive ($\gtrsim100$ M$_\odot$) stars are expected to release large amounts of energy and metal-enriched material throughout their relatively short lives. Their stellar winds may play an important role in the metal-enrichment during the formation of star clusters. With novel high-resolution hydrodynamical GRIFFIN-project simulations, we investigate the rapid recycling of stellar wind-material during the formation of massive star clusters up to $M_\mathrm{cluster}\sim2\times10^5$ M$_\odot$ in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy starburst. The simulation realises new stars from a stellar initial mass function (IMF) between $0.08$ M$_\odot$ and $\sim400$ M$_\odot$and follows stellar winds, radiation and supernova-feedback of single massive stars with evolution tracks. Star clusters form on timescales less than $\sim5$ Myr, and their supernova-material is very inefficiently recycled. Stellar wind-material, however, is trapped in massive clusters resulting in the formation of stars self-enriched in Na, Al, and N within only a few Myr. Wind-enriched (second population) stars can be centrally concentrated in the most massive clusters ($\gtrsim10^4$ M$_\odot$) and the locked wind-material increases approximately as $M_\mathrm{cluster}^{2}$. These trends resemble the characteristics of observed second population stars in globular clusters. We fit scaling relations to the log-normal distributed wind-mass fractions and extrapolate to possible globular cluster progenitors of $M_\mathrm{cluster}=10^7$ M$_\odot$ to investigate whether a dominant second population could form. This can only happen if the IMF is well sampled, single massive stars produce at least a factor of a few more enriched winds e.g. through a top-heavy IMF, and a significant fraction of the first population (unenriched) stars is lost during cluster evolution.
#### C3NN: Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network -- an  interpretable machine learning tool for cosmological analyses

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological research in large scale structure has witnessed an increasing number of applications of machine learning methods. Among them, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have received substantial attention due to their outstanding performance in image classification, cosmological parameter inference and various other tasks. However, many models which make use of CNNs are criticized as "black boxes" due to the difficulties in relating their outputs intuitively and quantitatively to the cosmological fields under investigation. To overcome this challenge, we present the Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) -- a fusion of CNN architecture with the framework of cosmological N-point correlation functions (NPCFs). We demonstrate that the output of this model can be expressed explicitly in terms of the analytically tractable NPCFs. Together with other auxiliary algorithms, we are able to open the "black box" by quantitatively ranking different orders of the interpretable convolution outputs based on their contribution to classification tasks. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this by applying our framework to a series of binary classification tasks using Gaussian and Log-normal random fields and relating its outputs to the analytical NPCFs describing the two fields. Furthermore, we exhibit the model's ability to distinguish different dark energy scenarios ($w_0=-0.95$ and $-1.05$) using N-body simulated weak lensing convergence maps and discuss the physical implications coming from their interpretability. With these tests, we show that C3NN combines advanced aspects of machine learning architectures with the framework of cosmological NPCFs, thereby making it an exciting tool with the potential to extract physical insights in a robust and explainable way from observational data.
#### Atmospheric Retrievals of the Young Giant Planet ROXs 42B b from Low-  and High-Resolution Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Previous attempts have been made to characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged planets at low-resolution (R$\sim$10s-100s), but the presence of clouds has often led to degeneracies in the retrieved atmospheric abundances with cloud opacity and temperature structure that bias retrieved compositions. In this study, we perform retrievals on the ultra-young ($\lesssim$ 5 Myr) directly imaged planet ROXs 42B b with both a downsampled low-resolution $JHK$-band spectrum from Gemini/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS, and a high-resolution $K$-band spectrum from pre-upgrade Keck/NIRSPAO. Using the atmospheric retrieval framework of petitRADTRANS, we analyze both data sets individually and combined. We additionally fit for the stellar abundances and other physical properties of the host stars, a young M spectral type binary, using the SPHINX model grid. We find that the measured C/O, $0.50\pm0.05$, and metallicity, [Fe/H] = $-0.67\pm0.35$, for ROXs 42B b from our high-resolution spectrum agree with that of its host stars within 1$\sigma$. The retrieved parameters from the high-resolution spectrum are also independent of our choice of cloud model. In contrast, the retrieved parameters from the low-resolution spectrum show strong degeneracies between the clouds and the retrieved metallicity and temperature structure. When we retrieve on both data sets together, we find that these degeneracies are reduced but not eliminated, and the final results remain highly sensitive to cloud modeling choices. We conclude that high-resolution spectroscopy offers the most promising path for reliably determining atmospheric compositions of directly imaged companions independent of their cloud properties.
#### Families of eccentric resonant orbits in galaxy discs: backbones for  bars and spirals

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely believed that resonant orbits play an important role in formation and evolution of bars and large-scale spirals in galaxy discs. These resonant orbits have been studied in a number of specific potentials, often with an imposed bar component. In this paper I show that families of resonant (e.g., two-dimensional $x_1$) orbits of differing eccentricities can be excited at a common pattern speed, in a variety of axisymmetric potentials. These families only exist over finite ranges of frequency in most of these potentials. Populations of such resonant eccentric orbits (REOs) can provide the backbone of both bars and spirals. At each frequency in the allowed range there is a maximum eccentricity, beyond which the REOs generically become quasi-stable (or `sticky'), then unstable (or chaotic), as the eccentricity increases, at values that depend on the potential and the orbit frequency. Sticky and chaotic orbits have been extensively studied recently with invariant/unstable manifolds in a variety of phase planes, but it is found that studying them as a function of eccentricity and pattern speed provides a particularly useful framework for classifying them and their stability transitions. The characteristics of these orbit families depend on the galaxy potential and the pattern speed, and as backbones of bars and spirals can help understand a number of observed or predicted regularities. These include: the size and speed of bars in different potentials, the range of pattern speeds and windup rates in spirals within galaxy discs, and constraints wave growth.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) experiment is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment located in the Atacama Desert, Chile. The SO' s small aperture telescopes (SATs) consist of three telescopes designed for precise CMB polarimetry at large angular scales. Each SAT uses a cryogenic rotating half-wave plate (HWP) as a polarization modulator to mitigate atmospheric 1/f noise and other systematics. To realize efficient polarization modulation over the observation bands, we fabricated an achromatic HWP (AHWP) consisting of three sapphire plates with anti-reflection coatings. The AHWP is designed to have broadband modulation efficiency and transmittance. This paper reports on the design and the preliminary characterization of the AHWPs for SATs.

 - **Abstract**
 An accretion disk formed around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) after it disrupts a star is expected to be initially misaligned with respect to the black hole's equatorial plane. This misalignment induces relativistic torques (the Lense-Thirring effect) on the disk, causing the disk to precess at early times, while at late times the disk aligns with the black hole and precession terminates. Here, using high-cadence X-ray monitoring observations of a TDE, we report the discovery of strong, quasi-periodic X-ray flux and temperature modulations from a TDE. These X-ray modulations are separated by 17.0$^{+1.2}_{-2.4}$ days and persist for roughly 130 days during the early phase of the TDE. Lense-Thirring precession of the accretion flow can produce this X-ray variability, but other physical mechanisms, such as the radiation-pressure instability, cannot be ruled out. Assuming typical TDE parameters, i.e., a solar-like star with the resulting disk extending at-most to so-called circularization radius, and that the disk precesses as a rigid body, we constrain the disrupting black hole's dimensionless spin parameter to be 0.05<|a|<0.5.
#### Alive but Barely Kicking: News from 3+ years of Swift and XMM-Newton  X-ray Monitoring of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions from eRO-QPE1

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic Eruptions (QPEs) represent a novel class of extragalactic X-ray transients that are known to repeat at roughly regular intervals of a few hours to days. Their underlying physical mechanism is a topic of heated debate, with most models proposing that they originate either from instabilities within the inner accretion flow or from orbiting objects. At present, our knowledge of how QPEs evolve over an extended timescale of multiple years is limited, except for the unique QPE source GSN 069. In this study, we present results from strategically designed Swift observing programs spanning the past three years, aimed at tracking eruptions from eRO-QPE1. Our main results are: 1) the recurrence time of eruptions can vary between 0.6 and 1.2 days, 2) there is no detectable secular trend in evolution of the recurrence times, 3) consistent with prior studies, their eruption profiles can have complex shapes, and 4) the peak flux of the eruptions has been declining over the past 3 years with the eruptions barely detected in the most recent Swift dataset taken in June of 2023. This trend of weakening eruptions has been reported recently in GSN 069. However, because the background luminosity of eRO-QPE1 is below our detection limit, we cannot verify if the weakening is correlated with the background luminosity (as is claimed to be the case for GSN 069). We discuss these findings within the context of various proposed QPE models.
#### Detecting the effect of non-thermal sources on the warm-hot Galactic  halo

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09726
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09726
 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of non-thermal broadening of OVII lines in the warm-hot $\approx 10^6$ K circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. We use $z$=0 absorption of OVII K$\alpha$, OVII K$\beta$, and OVIII K$\alpha$ lines in archival grating data of $b>$15$^\circ$ quasar sightlines from $Chandra$ and $XMM$-$Newton$. Non-thermal line broadening is evident in two-third of the sightlines considered, and on average is constrained at 4.6$\sigma$ significance. Non-thermal line broadening dominates over thermal broadening. We extensively test whether the appearance of non-thermal line broadening could instead be because of multiple thermally broadened velocity components and robustly rule it out. Non-thermal line broadening is more evident toward sightlines at lower galactic latitude indicating the Galactic disk origin of the nonthermal sources. There is weak/no correlation between non-thermal line broadening and the angular separation of sightlines from the Galactic center, indicating that the nuclear region might not be a major source of non-thermal factors.
#### Near-infrared spectroscopic characterisation of Gaia ultra-cool dwarf  candidates; Spectral types and peculiarities

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The local census of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is crucial to improving our understanding of the stellar-substellar transition and their formation history. These objects, known as ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs), are essential targets for searches of potentially habitable planets. However, their detection poses a challenge because of their low luminosity. The Gaia survey has identified numerous new UCD candidates thanks to its large survey and precise astrometry. Aims: We aim to characterise 60 UCD candidates detected by Gaia in the solar neighbourhood with a spectroscopic follow-up to confirm that they are UCDs, as well as to identify peculiarities. Methods: We acquired the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of 60 objects using the SOFI spectrograph between 0.93 and 2.5 microns (R$\sim600$). We identified their spectral types using a template-matching method. Their binarity is studied using astrometry and spectral features. Results: We confirm that 60 objects in the sample have ultra-cool dwarf spectral types close to those expected from astrometry. Their NIR spectra reveal that seven objects could host an unresolved coolest companion and seven UCDs share the same proper motions as other stars. The characterisation of these UCDs is part of a coordinated effort to improve our understanding of the Solar neighbourhood.
#### Hydrodynamic models of pulsation period evolution in R Hydrae

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsation period evolution during the helium-shell flash in the Mira variable R Hya is investigated using consistent stellar evolution and non-linear stellar pulsation computations. The initial and time-dependent inner boundary conditions for the equations of radiation hydrodynamics describing non-linear stellar oscillations were determined using a grid of TP-AGB model sequences with initial masses on the main sequence $1.5M_\odot\le M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\le 5.0M_\odot$ and the initial metallicity $Z=0.014$. The setup of initial conditions for hydrodynamic models corresponds to $\approx 100$ yr prior to the maximum of the helium-shell luminosity and ensures that the stellar envelope of the evolution model is under both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. Solution of the equations of hydrodynamics allowed us to determine the temporal variation of the pulsation period $\Pi(t)$ during $\approx 500$~yr. Within this time interval R Hya is a fundamental mode pulsator. The period temporal dependencies $\Pi(t)$ calculated for the AGB star models at the beginning of the third dredge-up phase and with masses $4.4M_\odot\le M\le 4.5M_\odot$ are in agreement with observational estimates of the period of R Hya obtained during last two centuries. The mean radius of R Hya pulsation models at the end of the XX century ($470 R_\odot < \bar{R} < 490 R_\odot$) agrees with observational estimates obtained using the interferometric angular diameter measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 SMC X-2 exhibits X-ray outburst behaviour that makes it one of the most luminous X-ray sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud. In the last decade it has undergone two such massive outbursts - in 2015 and 2022. The first outburst is well reported in the literature, but the 2022 event has yet to be fully described and discussed. That is the goal of this paper. In particular, the post-peak characteristics of the two events are compared. This reveals clear similarities in decay profiles, believed to be related to different accretion mechanisms occurring at different times as the outbursts evolve. The H{\alpha} emission line indicates that the Be disc undergoes complex structural variability, with evidence of warping as a result of its interaction with the neutron star. The detailed observations reported here will be important for modelling such interactions in this kind of binary systems.
#### On the Chemical Composition of the Evolved Very Bright Metal-Poor Star  HD 1936

 - **Abstract**
 We present chemical abundances of the very bright metal-poor star HD~1936 based on high-resolution and high SNR spectra from AUKR. We obtain the abundances of 29 atomic species with atomic numbers between 3 and 63. In this context, the derived lithium abundance of 1.01 is consistent with the thin Li plateau observed in lower red giant branch stars. The star is a carbon-normal with the ratio of -0.31, just like other low-luminosity red giants on the thin Li plateau. We find the ratios of [Eu/Fe]=0.43 and [Ba/Eu]=-0.64, indicating very little s-process contamination. These ratios allow us to classify the star as a moderately r-process-enhanced (r-I) metal-poor star for the first time. It is worth mentioning that the star has a metallicity of -1.74, a [Cu/Fe] of -0.74, a [Zn/Fe] of 0.04, and a [Mg/C] of 0.69. The results suggest that it may be a second-generation star formed in a multi-enriched environment, rather than being a descendant of very massive first-generation stars. A last point worth mentioning is the possibility that HD~1936 may host a sub-stellar component with a mass of 18.35$M_{\rm J}$. Although our study does not confirm or deny this, we briefly discuss the possibility of the star hosting a planet.
#### Neutron Stars constraints on a late G transition

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested recently that the Hubble tension could be eliminated by a sharp, $\sim 10\%$ increase of the effective gravitational constant at $z \sim 0.01$. This would decrease the luminosities of type 1a supernovae in just the needed amount to explain the larger value of the Hubble parameter. In the present paper we call attention to a dramatic effect of such transition on neutron stars. A neutron star that existed at $z=0.01$ would contract, conserving the baryon mass but undergoing a mass reduction. We computed neutron star models, with a realistic equation of state, and obtained that this reduction is typically $ 0.04 M_{\odot}$. This amounts to an energy of $7 \times 10^{52}$ erg. The transition will affect {\it all} neutron stars that formed along the history of each galaxy prior to the transition. Given the large number of neutron stars per galaxy, the liberated energy is huge. An estimate of the expected fluxes of neutrinos and x-rays yields values exceeding observational upper limits, thus rendering the late G transition scenario non-viable.
#### Rotation of ZZ Ceti stars as seen by TESS

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Knowing the rotation rates and masses of white dwarf stars is an important step towards characterising the angular momentum transport mechanism in their progenitors, and coupling the cores of red giants to their envelopes. However, deriving these rotation rates is not an easy task. One can use the rotational broadening of spectral lines, but there is another way to gather reliable information on the stellar rotation periods of pulsators: through studying the splitting effect of rotation on oscillation frequencies. Aims. We aim to derive stellar rotation periods in the TESS sample for as many white dwarf pulsators as possible. Methods. We rely on light-curve analysis of the TESS observations, and search for closely spaced frequency multiplets that could be rotationally split pulsation modes. We work with triplet frequencies, even if one or two triplet components are only marginally detectable. We also utilise ground-based observations available from the literature in an attempt to confirm the presence of several triplets. Results. We successfully identified rotationally split multiplets and derived rotation rates for 14 stars. The fastest rotators we identified have rotation periods of 6.6-10.0 h. The majority of the pulsators rotate with periods of 11.9-47.5 h, while we derived 85.5 and 93.2 h periods for the slowest rotators. In addition to providing stellar mass estimations, our results confirm previous findings that larger-mass WDs rotate faster than their lower-mass counterparts. We determine the rotation periods of four stars for the first time.
#### Understanding the phenomenological and intrinsic blazar sequence using a  simple scaling model

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar sequence, including negative correlations between radiative luminosity $L_{\rm rad}$ and synchrotron peak frequency $\nu$, and between Compton dominance $Y$ and $\nu$, is widely adopted as a phenomenological description of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars, although its underlying cause is hotly debated. In particular, these correlations turn positive after correcting Doppler boosting effect. In this work, we revisit the phenomenological and intrinsic blazar sequence with three samples, which are historical sample (SEDs are built with historical data), quasi-simultaneous sample (SEDs are built with quasi-simultaneous data) and Doppler factor corrected sample (a sample with available Doppler factors), selected from literature. We find that phenomenological blazar sequence holds in historical sample, but does not exist in quasi-simultaneous sample, and intrinsic correlation between $L_{\rm rad}$ and $\nu$ becomes positive in Doppler factor corrected sample. We also analyze if the blazar sequence still exists in subclasses of blazars, i.e., flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacertae objects, with different values of $Y$. To interpret these correlations, we apply a simple scaling model, in which physical parameters of the dissipation region are connected to the location of the dissipation region. We find that the model generated results are highly sensitive to the chosen ranges and distributions of physical parameters. Therefore, we suggest that even though the simple scaling model can reproduce the blazar sequence under specific conditions that have been fine-tuned, such results may not have universal applicability. Further consideration of a more realistic emission model is expected.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a brown dwarf orbiting a M1 host star. We first identified the brown dwarf within the Next Generation Transit Survey data, with supporting observations found in TESS sectors 11 and 38. We confirmed the discovery with follow-up photometry from the South African Astronomical Observatory, SPECULOOS-S, and TRAPPIST-S, and radial velocity measurements from HARPS, which allowed us to characterise the system. We find an orbital period of ~1.25 d, a mass of 69.0+5.3-4.8 MJ, close to the Hydrogen burning limit, and a radius of 0.95 +- 0.05 RJ. We determine the age to be >0.5 Gyr, using model isochrones, which is found to be in agreement with SED fitting within errors. NGTS-28Ab is one of the shortest period systems found within the brown dwarf desert, as well as one of the highest mass brown dwarfs that transits an M dwarf. This makes NGTS-28Ab another important discovery within this scarcely populated region.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomy is a discipline primarily reliant on visual data. However, alternative data representation techniques are being explored, in particular ''sonification'', namely, the representation of data into sound. While there is increasing interest in the astronomical community in using sonification in research and educational contexts, its full potential is still to be explored. This study measured the performance of astronomers and non-astronomers to detect a transit-like feature in time series data (i.e., light curves), that were represented visually or auditorily, adopting different data-to-sound mappings. We also assessed the bias that participants exhibited in the different conditions. We simulated the data of 160 light curves with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We represented them as visual plots or auditory streams with different sound parameters to represent brightness: pitch, duration, or the redundant duration & pitch. We asked the participants to identify the presence of transit-like features in these four conditions in a session that included an equal number of stimuli with and without transit-like features. With auditory stimuli, participants detected transits with performances above the chance level. However, visual stimuli led to overall better performances compared to auditory stimuli and astronomers outperformed non-astronomers. Visualisations led to a conservative response bias (reluctance to answer ''yes, there is a transit''), whereas sonifications led to more liberal responses (proneness to respond ''yes, there is a transit''). Overall, this study contributes to understanding how different representations (visual or auditory) and sound mappings (pitch, duration, duration & pitch) of time series data affect detection accuracy and biases.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Gamma-ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) has been surveying the sky above 20 keV since its launch in 2002 providing new insights into the nature of the sources that populate our Universe at soft gamma-ray energies. The latest IBIS/ISGRI survey lists 929 hard X-ray sources, of which 113 are reported as unidentified, i.e. lacking a lower energy counterpart or simply not studied in other wavebands. To overcome this lack of information, we either browsed the X-ray archives, or, if no data in the X-ray band were available, we requested Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Following this approach, we selected a sample of 10 objects for which X-ray data were key to investigate their nature. We found a single X-ray association for all of the sources, except for IGR J16267-3303, for which two X-ray detections were spotted within the IBIS positional uncertainty. We then browsed multi-waveband archives to search for counterparts to these X-ray detections at other wavelengths and analysed X-ray spectral properties to determine their nature and association with the high-energy emitter. As a result of our analysis, we identified the most likely counterpart for 7 sources, although in some cases its nature/class could not be definitely assessed on the basis of the information collected. Interestingly, SWIFT J2221.6+5952, first reported in the 105-month Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) survey, is the only source of the sample for which we did not find any counterpart at radio/optical/IR wavebands. Finally, we found that two IBIS source, IGR J17449-3037 and IGR J17596-2315 are positionally associated with a Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) object.

 - **Abstract**
 Approximately 150 low-mass white dwarfs, with masses below 0.4Msun, have been discovered. The majority of these low-mass WDs are observed in binary systems as they cannot be formed through single-star evolution within the Hubble time. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the double low-mass WD eclipsing binary system J2102-4145. Our investigation involved an extensive observational campaign, resulting in the acquisition of approximately 28 hours of high-speed photometric data across multiple nights using NTT/ULTRACAM, SOAR/Goodman, and SMARTS-1m telescopes. These observations have provided critical insights into the orbital characteristics of this system, including parameters such as inclination and orbital period. To disentangle the binary components of J2102-4145, we employed the XT GRID spectral fitting method with GMOS/Gemini-South and X-Shooter data. Additionally, we used the PHOEBE package for light curve analysis on NTT/ULTRACAM high-speed time-series photometry data to constrain the binary star properties. Our analysis reveals remarkable similarities between the two components of this binary system. For the primary star, we determined Teff1 = 13688 +- 65 K, log g1 = 7.36 +- 0.01, R1 = 0.0211 +- 0.0002 Rsun, and M1 = 0.375 +- 0.003 Msun, while the secondary star is characterized by Teff2 = 12952 +- 53 K, log g2 = 7.32 +- 0.01, R2 = 0.0203 +- 0.0002 Rsun, and M2 = 0.31 +- 0.003 Msun. Furthermore, we observe a notable discrepancy between Teff and R of the less massive WD compared to evolutionary sequences for WDs from the literature, which has significant implications for our understanding of WD evolution. We discuss a potential formation scenario for this system that might explain this discrepancy and explore its future evolution. We predict that this system will merge in about 800 Myr, evolving into a helium-rich hot subdwarf star and later into a hybrid He/CO WD.
#### Curves of growth for transiting exocomets: Application to Fe II lines in  the Beta Pictoris system

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces the exocomet curve of growth, a new method to analyse the variable absorptions observed in $\beta$ Pictoris spectrum and link them to the physical properties of the transiting cometary tails. We show that the absorption depth of a comet in a set of lines arising from similar excitation levels of a given chemical species follows a simple curve as a function of the gf-values of the lines. This curve is the analogue of the curve of growth for interstellar absorption lines, where equivalent widths are replaced by absorption depths. To fit this exocomet curve of growth, we introduce a model where the cometary absorption is produced by a homogeneous cloud, covering a limited fraction of the stellar disc. This model is defined by two parameters: $\alpha$, the covering factor of the cloud, and $\beta$, related to its typical the optical depth. This model is tested on two comets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in December 1997 and October 2018, in a set of Fe II lines at 275 nm. The measured absorption depths are found to satisfactory match the two-parameter curve of growth model, indicating that both comets cover roughly 40 % of the stellar disc ($\alpha=0.4$) and have optical thicknesses close to unity. Then, we show that if we consider a set of lines arising from a wider range of energy levels, the absorbing species seems to be populated at thermodynamical equilibrium, causing the cometary absorption to follow a curve of growth as a function of $gf \cdot e^{-E_l/k_B T}$ (where T is the temperature of the absorbing medium). For the comet observed on December 6, 1997, we derive a temperature of $10500\pm500$ K and a total Fe II column density of $(1.11\pm0.09)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. By probing the population of the highest excited energy levels ($E_l\sim25000$ cm$^{-1}$), we also estimate an electronic density of $(3\pm1)\times10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing sky models from dirty radio images for accurate source localization and flux estimation is crucial for studying galaxy evolution at high redshift, especially in deep fields using instruments like the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). With new projects like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), there's a growing need for better source extraction methods. Current techniques, such as CLEAN and PyBDSF, often fail to detect faint sources, highlighting the need for more accurate methods. This study proposes using stochastic neural networks to rebuild sky models directly from dirty images. This method can pinpoint radio sources and measure their fluxes with related uncertainties, marking a potential improvement in radio source characterization. We tested this approach on 10164 images simulated with the CASA tool simalma, based on ALMA's Cycle 5.3 antenna setup. We applied conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for sky models reconstruction, then used Photutils to determine source coordinates and fluxes, assessing the model's performance across different water vapor levels. Our method showed excellence in source localization, achieving more than 90% completeness at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 2. It also surpassed PyBDSF in flux estimation, accurately identifying fluxes for 96% of sources in the test set, a significant improvement over CLEAN+ PyBDSF's 57%. Conditional DDPMs is a powerful tool for image-to-image translation, yielding accurate and robust characterisation of radio sources, and outperforming existing methodologies. While this study underscores its significant potential for applications in radio astronomy, we also acknowledge certain limitations that accompany its usage, suggesting directions for further refinement and research.
