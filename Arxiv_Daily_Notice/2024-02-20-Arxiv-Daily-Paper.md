 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA interferometer has played a key role in revealing a new component of the Sun-like star forming process: the molecular streamers, i.e. structures up to thousands of au long funneling material non-axisymmetrically to disks. In the context of the FAUST ALMA LP, the archetypical VLA1623-2417 protostellar cluster has been imaged at 1.3 mm in the SO(5$_6$--4$_5$), SO(6$_6$--5$_5$), and SiO(5--4) line emission at the spatial resolution of 50 au. We detect extended SO emission, peaking towards the A and B protostars. Emission blue-shifted down to 6.6 km s$^{-1}$ reveals for the first time a long ($\sim$ 2000 au) accelerating streamer plausibly feeding the VLA1623 B protostar. Using SO, we derive for the first time an estimate of the excitation temperature of an accreting streamer: 33$\pm$9 K. The SO column density is $\sim$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, and the SO/H$_2$ abundance ratio is $\sim$ 10$^{-8}$. The total mass of the streamer is 3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ $Msun$, while its accretion rate is 3--5 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$. This is close to the mass accretion rate of VLA1623 B, in the 0.6--3 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$ range, showing the importance of the streamer in contributing to the mass of protostellar disks. The highest blue- and red-shifted SO velocities behave as the SiO(5--4) emission, the latter species detected for the first time in VLA1623-2417: the emission is compact (100-200 au), and associated only with the B protostar. The SO excitation temperature is $\sim$ 100 K, supporting the occurrence of shocks associated with the jet, traced by SiO.

 - **Abstract**
 The intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) can develop during proton ingestion events (PIE), potentially during the early stages of low-mass low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine the impact of overshoot mixing on the triggering and development of i-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars of various initial masses and metallicities. We computed AGB stellar models, with initial masses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 M$_{\odot}$ and metallicities in the $-2.5 \le $ [Fe/H] $\le 0$ range, using the stellar evolution code STAREVOL with a network of 1160 nuclei coupled to the transport equations. We considered different overshooting profiles below and above the thermal pulses, and below the convective envelope. The occurrence of PIEs is found to be primarily governed by the amount of overshooting at the top of pulse ($f_{\rm top}$) and to increase with rising $f_{\rm top}$. For $f_{\rm top} =$ 0, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.1, we find that 0 %, 6 %, 24 %, and 86 % of our 21 AGB models with $-2<$ [Fe/H] $<0$ experience a PIE, respectively. We also find that PIEs leave a $^{13}$C-pocket at the bottom of the pulse that can give rise to an additional radiative s-process nucleosynthesis, and ultimately produce a noticeable mixed i+s chemical signature at the surface. Finally, the chemical abundance patterns of 22 observed r/s-stars candidates with $-2<$ [Fe/H] $<-1$ are found to be in reasonable agreement with our AGB model predictions. The binary status of the dwarfs/giants being unclear, we suggest that these stars have acquired their chemical pattern either from the mass transfer of a now-extinct AGB companion or from an early generation AGB star that polluted the natal cloud. Stricter constraints from multi-dimensional hydrodynamical models on overshoot coefficients could deliver new insights into the contribution of AGB stars to heavy elements in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from the NICER observation data of MAXI J1803-298 across the entire 2021 outburst. In the intermediate and soft state, we detect significant absorption lines at $\sim 7.0$ keV and $\sim 6.7$ keV, arising from the X-ray disk wind outflowing with a velocity of hundreds of km per second along our line of sight. The fitting results from photoionized model suggest that the wind is driven by thermal pressure and the mass-loss rate is low. We find a clear transition for iron from predominantly H-like to predominantly He-like during the intermediate-to-soft state transition. Our results indicate this transition for iron is caused by the evolution of the illuminating spectrum and the slow change of the geometric properties of the disk wind together. The coexistence of disk wind and QPOs features in intermediate state is also reported. Our study makes MAXI J1803-298 the first source in which a transition from optical wind to X-ray wind is detected, offering new insights into the evolution of disk winds across an entire outburst and long-term coupling of accretion disks and mass outflows around accreting black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out three-dimensional computations of the accretion rate onto an object (of size $R_{\rm sink}$ and mass $m$) as it moves through a uniform medium at a subsonic speed $v_{\infty}$. The object is treated as a fully-absorbing boundary (e.g. a black hole). In contrast to early conjectures, we show that when $R_{\rm sink}\ll R_{A}=2Gm/v^2$ the accretion rate is independent of $v_{\infty}$ and only depends on the entropy of the ambient medium, its adiabatic index, and $m$. Our numerical simulations are conducted using two different numerical schemes via the Athena++ and Arepo hydrodynamics solvers, which reach nearly identical steady-state solutions. We find that pressure gradients generated by the isentropic compression of the flow near the accretor are sufficient to suspend much of the surrounding gas in a near-hydrostatic equilibrium, just as predicted from the spherical Bondi-Hoyle calculation. Indeed, the accretion rates for steady flow match the Bondi-Hoyle rate, and are indicative of isentropic flow for subsonic motion where no shocks occur. We also find that the accretion drag may be predicted using the Safronov number, $\Theta=R_{A}/R_{\rm sink}$, and is much less than the dynamical friction for sufficiently small accretors ($R_{\rm sink}\ll R_{A}$).

 - **Abstract**
 The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), launched on December 9, 2021, enables X-ray polarimetric observations with unprecedented sensitivity in the 2-8 keV energy range. X-ray polarization allows us to test accretion disk, corona, and emission models of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries found predominantly in soft and hard states of accretion. Every state is dominated by a combination of thermal disk, coronal, or reflected emission$\unicode{x2014}$each type containing different information about the environment around the black hole that can be understood through polarization. In 2022, IXPE measured the polarization signatures of four stellar-mass black holes: Cygnus X-1, 4U 1630-47, Cygnus X-3, and LMC X-1. We report on the physical consequences of these first IXPE observations and the science driven by this new chapter in X-ray polarimetry.

 - **Abstract**
 We report spectroscopic surveys of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31), using the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The spectra are of high quality and cover the whole optical range, mostly from 3650 \r{A} to beyond 1 micron, enabling detection of nebular emission lines critical for spectral analysis as well as photoionization modeling. We obtained GTC spectra of 24 compact (angular diameter <5 arcsec) PNe located in the Galactic disk, ~3-20 kpc from the Galactic centre, and can be used to constrain stellar evolution models and derive radial abundance gradients of the Milky Way. We have observed 30 PNe in the outer halo of M31 using the GTC. These halo PNe are uniformly metal-rich and probably all evolved from low-mass stars, consistent with the conjecture that they all formed from the metal-rich gas in M31 disk but displaced to their present locations due to galaxy interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The far-infrared (FIR) opacity of dust in dark clouds within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud is investigated through multi-wavelength infrared observations from UKIDSS, Spitzer and Herschel. Employing the infrared color excess technique with both near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data, a high-resolution extinction map in the $K$ band ($A_K$) is constructed for three dark clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712. The derived extinction map has a resolution of $1'$ and reaches a depth of $A_K\sim3$ mag. The FIR optical depths $\tau_{250}$ at a reference wavelength of $250\,\rm \mu m$ are obtained by fitting the Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\rm \mu m$ using a modified blackbody model. The average dust opacity per unit gas mass at $250\rm \mu m$, $r\kappa_{250}$ is determined through a pixel-by-pixel correlation of $\tau_{250}$ with $A_K$, yielding a value of approximately $0.09\,\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}$, which is about 2-3 times higher than the typical value in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Additionally, an independent analysis across 16 sub-regions within the Ophiuchus cloud indicates spatial variations in dust opacity, with values ranging from 0.07-0.12$\,\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}$. Although the observed trend of increasing dust opacity with higher extinction implies grain growth, our findings indicate that rapid grain growth clearly not yet occurred in the dark clouds studied in this work.
#### Quasar winds caught on acceleration and deceleration

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational study of wind acceleration based on four low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasars (J0136, J1238, J1259, J1344). J0136 and J1344 (group-1) are radio quiet and show large BAL-velocity shifts as opposed to stable line-locking associated absorption lines (AALs). Notably, J1344 displays a linear relation between BAL-velocity shift and time interval over three consecutive epochs, characteristic of compelling evidence for BAL acceleration. J1238 and J1259 (group 2) exhibit small BAL-velocity shifts along with steep-spectrum, weak radio emission at 3.0 and 1.4 GHz. All four quasars have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a peak at $\lambda_{\rm rest }\sim10~\mu$m, suggesting a link between the BAL acceleration and hot dust emission. The group-2 quasars are redder than group-1 quasars and have a steeper rise at $1<\lambda_{\rm rest }<3~\mu$m in their SEDs. All but J1238 exhibit a steep rise followed by a plateau-like time evolution in BAL-velocity shift. Our investigations, combined with previous studies of BAL acceleration, indicate that (1) the BAL-ISM coupling process is one of the major avenues for the origin of quasar reddening and patchy obscuration, (2) AAL outflows are ubiquitous and likely signify large-scale remnants of BAL winds coupled to interstellar medium (ISM), and (3) wind deceleration that is closely linked to the BAL-ISM coupling process may produce weak radio emission in otherwise radio-quiet quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity to understand the physics and chemistry of planets at extreme conditions. WASP-12b stands out as an archetype of this class of exoplanets. We performed comprehensive analyses of the transits, occultations, and phase curves of WASP-12b by combining new CHEOPS observations with previous TESS and Spitzer data to measure the planet's tidal deformation, atmospheric properties, and orbital decay rate. The planet was modeled as a triaxial ellipsoid parameterized by the second-order fluid Love number, $h_2$, which quantifies its radial deformation and provides insight into the interior structure. We measured the tidal deformation of WASP-12b and estimated a Love number of $h_2=1.55_{-0.49}^{+0.45}$ (at 3.2$\sigma$) from its phase curve. We measured occultation depths of $333\pm24$ppm and $493\pm29$ppm in the CHEOPS and TESS bands, respectively, while the dayside emission spectrum indicates that CHEOPS and TESS probe similar pressure levels in the atmosphere at a temperature of 2900K. We also estimated low geometric albedos of $0.086\pm0.017$ and $0.01\pm0.023$ in the CHEOPS and TESS passbands, respectively, suggesting the absence of reflective clouds in the dayside of the WASP-12b. The CHEOPS occultations do not show strong evidence for variability in the dayside atmosphere of the planet. Finally, we refine the orbital decay rate by 12% to a value of -30.23$\pm$0.82 ms/yr. WASP-12b becomes the second exoplanet, after WASP-103b, for which the Love number has been measured (at 3$sigma$) from the effect of tidal deformation in the light curve. However, constraining the core mass fraction of the planet requires measuring $h_2$ with a higher precision. This can be achieved with high signal-to-noise observations with JWST since the phase curve amplitude, and consequently the induced tidal deformation effect, is higher in the infrared.
#### Extracting $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ in Pacif Parametrization Models through  Late-Time Data with Covariance Matrix Simulation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10499
 - **Abstract**
 The study analyzes five models derived from the Pacif parametrization scheme, a generalized form of the Hubble parameter ($H$), yielding various forms of the deceleration parameter (DP) that vary linearly, quadratically, cubically, quartically, and quintically. We aim to explore the impact of these DP variations on late-time evolution and their potential to alleviate cosmological tensions. Additionally, we enhance model constraints by introducing non-diagonal elements into the covariance matrix, thereby simulating correlations between data points and better capturing the true statistical properties of the dataset. Furthermore, our objective is to test the sensitivity of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ to the Pacif parametrization scheme. To avoid imposing a prior from CMB, we treat the sound horizon $r_{d}$ as a free parameter, allowing the late-time data itself to constrain the value of $r_{d}$ along with other cosmological parameters. This is achieved by incorporating the most recent measurements, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the latest galaxy surveys. The considered redshift range spans from (0.106 < z < 2.33), encompassing Hubble measurements obtained through Cosmic Chronometers Methods, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Quasars (Q). Additionally, an extra constraint is introduced by integrating the latest Hubble constant measurement from Riess in 2022. Our analysis yields optimal fit values for the Hubble parameter $H_{0}$ and sound horizon $r_{d}$. The results highlight a notable consistency between the values derived from the Pacif parametrization models and those obtained from Planck CMB data. Finally, we employ the Akaike information criterion approach to compare the three models, revealing that none of them can be discounted based on the latest observational measurements.
#### Evolution of the relation between the mass accretion rate and the  stellar and disk mass from brown dwarfs to stars

 - **Abstract**
 The time evolution of the dependence of the mass accretion rate with the stellar mass and the disk mass represents a fundamental way to understand the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of planets. In this work, we present observations with X-Shooter of 26 Class II very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the Ophiuchus, Cha-I, and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions (SFRs). These new observations extend down to SpT M9 ($\sim$0.02 $M_\odot$) the measurement of the mass accretion rate in Ophiuchus and Cha-I and add 11 very-low-mass stars to the sample of objects studied with broadband spectroscopy in Upper Scorpius. We obtained their SpT, extinction and physical parameters, and we used the intensity of various emission lines to derive their accretion luminosity and mass accretion rates. Combining these new observations with data from the literature, we compare relations between accretion and stellar and disk properties of four different SFRs with different ages: Ophiuchus (1 Myr), Lupus (2 Myr), Cha-I (3 Myr), and Upper Scorpius (5-12 Myr). We find the slopes of the $L_*-L\mathrm{_{acc}}$ and $M_*-\dot{M}\mathrm{_{acc}}$ relationships to steepen between Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Cha-I and that both relationships may be better described with a single power law. We also find the relationship between the disk mass and the mass accretion rate of the stellar population to steepen with time down to the age of Upper Scorpius. Overall, we observe hints of a faster evolution into low accretion rates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We also find that brown dwarfs present higher $M\mathrm{_{disk}}/\dot{M}\mathrm{_{acc}}$ ratios (i.e., longer accretion depletion timescales) than stars in Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Cha-I. This apparently contradictory result may imply that the evolution of protoplanetary disks around brown dwarfs is different from what is seen in the stellar regime.
#### Investigating black hole accretion disks as potential polluter sources  for the formation of enriched stars in globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks surrounding stellar mass black holes (BHs) have been suggested as potential locations for the nucleosynthesis of light elements, which are our primary observational discriminant of multiple stellar populations within globular clusters. The population of enriched stars in globular clusters are enhanced in N14, Na23, and sometimes in Al27 and/or in K39. In this study, our aim is to investigate the feasibility of initiating nucleosynthesis for these four elements in BH accretion disks, considering various internal parameters such as the temperature of the gas and timescale of the accretion. To achieve this, we employed a 132-species reaction network. We used the slim disk model, suitable for the Super-Eddington mass accretion rate and for geometrically and optically thick disks. We explored the conditions related to the mass, mass accretion rate, viscosity, and radius of the BH-accretion disk system that would allow for the creation of N14, Na23, Al27, and K39 before the gas is accreted onto the central object. Our findings reveal that there is no region in the parameter space where the formation of Na23 can occur and only a very limited region where the formation of N14, Al27, and K39 is plausible. Specifically, this occurs for BHs with masses lower than 10 solar masses, with a preference toward even lower mass values and extremely low viscosity parameters ($\alpha <10^{-3}$). Such values are highly unlikely based on current observations of stellar mass BHs. However, such low mass BHs could actually exist in the early universe, as so-called primordial BHs. In conclusion, our study suggests that the nucleosynthesis within BH accretion disks of four elements of interest for the multiple stellar populations is improbable, but not impossible, using the slim disk model.

 - **Abstract**
 The classical theory of differentiation states that due to the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements, some asteroids form an iron core, an olivine-rich mantle, and a crust. The collisional breakup of these differentiated bodies is expected to lead to exposed mantle fragments, creating families of newly-formed asteroids. Among these new objects, some are expected to show an olivine-rich composition in spectroscopic observations. However, several years of spectrophotometric surveys have led to the conclusion that olivine-rich asteroids are rare in the asteroid main belt, and no significant concentration of olivine-rich bodies in any asteroid family has been detected to date. Using ESA's Gaia DR3 reflectance spectra, we show that the family (36256) 1999 XT17 presents a prominence of objects that are likely to present an olivine-rich composition (A-type spectroscopic class). If S-complex asteroids as the second most prominent spectroscopic class in the family are real family members, then arguably the 1999 XT17 family has originated from the break-up of a partially differentiated parent body. Alternatively, if the S-complex asteroids are interlopers, then the 1999 XT17 family could have originated from the breakup of an olivine-rich body. This body could have been part of the mantle of a differentiated planetesimal, which may have broken up in a different region of the Solar System, and one of its fragments (i.e. the parent body of the 1999 XT17 family) could have been dynamically implanted in the main belt.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate atmospheric fractionation in escaping planetary atmospheres using IsoFATE, a new open-source numerical model. We expand the parameter space studied previously to planets with tenuous atmospheres that exhibit the greatest helium and deuterium enhancement. We simulate the effects of EUV-driven photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss on deuterium-hydrogen and helium-hydrogen fractionation of sub-Neptune atmospheres around G, K, and M stars. Our simulations predict prominent populations of deuterium- and helium-enhanced planets along the upper edge of the radius valley with mean equilibrium temperatures of 370 K and as low as 150 K across stellar types. We find that fractionation is mechanism-dependent, so constraining He/H and D/H abundances in sub-Neptune atmospheres offers a unique strategy to investigate the origin of the radius valley around low-mass stars. Fractionation is also strongly dependent on retained atmospheric mass, offering a proxy for planetary surface pressure as well as a way to distinguish between desiccated enveloped terrestrials and water worlds. Deuterium-enhanced planets tend to be helium-dominated and CH4-depleted, providing a promising strategy to observe HDO in the 3.7 um window. We present a list of promising targets for observational follow-up.
#### Revisiting a Core-Jet Laboratory at High Redshift: Analysis of the Radio  Jet in the Quasar PKS 2215+020 at z=3.572

 - **Abstract**
 The prominent radio quasar PKS 2215+020 (J2217+0220) was once labelled as a new laboratory for core--jet physics at redshift z=3.572 because of its exceptionally extended jet structure traceable with very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations up to a ~600 pc projected distance from the compact core and a hint of an arcsec-scale radio and an X-ray jet. While the presence of an X-ray jet could not be confirmed later, this active galactic nucleus is still unique at high redshift with its long VLBI jet. Here, we analyse archival multi-epoch VLBI imaging data at five frequency bands from 1.7 to 15.4 GHz covering a period of more than 25 years from 1995 to 2020. We constrain apparent proper motions of jet components in PKS 2215+020 for the first time. Brightness distribution modeling at 8 GHz reveals a nearly 0.02 mas/yr proper motion (moderately superluminal with apparently two times the speed of light), and provides delta=11.5 for the Doppler-boosting factor in the inner relativistic jet that is inclined within 2 deg to the line of sight and has a Gamma=6 bulk Lorentz factor. These values qualify PKS 2215+020 as a blazar, with rather typical jet properties in a small sample of only about 20 objects at z>3.5 that have similar measurements to date. According to the 2-GHz VLBI data, the diffuse and extended outer emission feature at ~60 mas from the core, probably a place where the jet interacts with and decelerated by the ambient galactic medium, is consistent with being stationary, albeit slow motion cannot be excluded based on the presently available data.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are profoundly affected by their ambient medium. We present carbon monoxide (CO) observations around two mixed morphology SNRs, VRO 42.05.01 and G 350.0-2.0, that look remarkably similar in continuum radio emission, showing what we refer to as a shell and wing shape. It has been proposed that the shell and wing shape is the result of environmental effects, in the form of a sharp density gradient or discontinuity. Our motivation for studying these two sources jointly is that if the dense molecular environment causes the development of these sources' shell and wing shape, then these two sources' environments must be similar. This is contrary to what we observe. In the case of VRO 42.05.01, we have found direct evidence of an interaction with its molecular environment, in the form of broadened $^{12}$CO line profiles, high $(J=2-1)$ to $(J=1-0)$ line ratios, and arc features in position-velocity space. We interpret some of these features to be associated with the SNR shock, and some of them to be due to the presence of a pre-supernova stellar wind. We have found no such features in the abundant molecular gas surrounding G 350.0-2.0. We have also made a spectral index map of G 350.0-2.0, and we see that the radio spectrum of G 350.0-2.0 steepens significantly at frequencies $<200$~MHz, much like that of VRO 42.05.01. In spite of their spectral and morphological similarities, these two sources look substantially different in their optical and infrared emission. The lack of large-scale correspondence between the radio continuum and the molecular material, as well as the differences in the excitation and morphological properties of the molecular gas surrounding both sources, lead us to conclude that the shell and wing morphology of these two sources is not due to interactions with a similar ambient molecular ISM.
#### An X-ray Synchrotron Shell and a Pulsar: The Peculiar Supernova Remnant  G32.4+0.1

 - **Abstract**
 We present a deep Chandra observation of the shell supernova remnant G32.4+0.1, whose featureless X-ray spectrum has led to its classification as an X-ray synchrotron-dominated supernova remnant (SNR). We find a partial shell morphology whose outline is quite circular, with a radius of about 11 pc at an assumed distance of 11 kpc. Thermal and power-law spectral models for three relatively bright regions provided equally good fits, but the absence of spectral lines required ionization timescales from thermal fits that are inconsistent with mean densities derived from emission measures. We thus confirm the nonthermal, i.e., synchrotron, origin of X-rays from G32.4+0.1. Shock velocities needed to accelerate electrons to the required TeV energies are >~1000 km/s, giving remnant ages <~5,000 -- 9,000 yr. There is no obvious X-ray counterpart to the radio pulsar PSR J1850--0026, but its position adjoins a region of X-ray emission whose spectrum is somewhat harder than that of other regions of the shell, and which may be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN), though its spectrum is steeper than almost all known X-ray PWNe. The distance of the pulsar from the center of symmetry of the shell disfavors a birth in a supernova event at that location only a few thousand years before: either the pulsar (and putative PWN) are not associated with the shell SNR, requiring a coincidence of both position and (roughly) absorbing column density, or the SNR is much older, making the origin of nonthermal emission problematic.
#### The radial variation of the LMC-induced reflex motion of the Milky Way  disc observed in the stellar halo

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the kinematic signature arising from the Milky Way (MW) disc moving with respect to the outer stellar halo, which is observed as a dipole signal in the kinematics of stellar halo tracers. We quantify how the reflex motion varies as a function of Galactocentric distance, finding that (i) the amplitude of the dipole signal increases as a function of radius, and (ii) the direction moves across the sky. We compare the reflex motion signal against a compilation of published models that follow the MW--LMC interaction. These models show a similar trend of increasing amplitude of the reflex motion as a function of distance, but they do not reproduce the direction of the disc motion with respect to the stellar halo well. We also report mean motions for the stellar halo as a function of distance, finding radial compression in the outer halo and nonzero prograde rotation at all radii. The observed compression signal is also present in MW--LMC models, but the rotation is not, which suggests that the latter is not induced by the LMC. We extensively validate our technique to measure reflex motion against idealised tests. We discuss prospects for directly constraining the mass and orbital history of the LMC through the impact on the motion of the MW stellar disc, and how the modelling of the reflex motion can be improved as more and better data become available.

 - **Abstract**
 Certain relations among neutron-star observables that are insensitive to the equation of state are known to exist. Such universal relations have been shown to be valid for cold and stationary neutron stars. Here, we study these relations in more dynamic scenarios: protoneutron stars and hypermassive neutron stars. First, we study protoneutron stars. We use an effective equation of state, extracted from three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations, to obtain the structure of spherically symmetric protoneutron stars. We then consider nonradial oscillations to compute their $f$-mode frequency ($f$), as well as slow rotation and small tidal deformation, to compute their moment of inertia ($I$), spin-induced quadrupole moment ($Q$), and Love number. We find that well-established universal relations for cold neutron stars involving these observables ($I$-Love-$Q$ and $f$-Love relations) are approximately valid for protoneutron stars, with a deviation below $\approx$ 10$\%$ for a postbounce time above $\approx$ 0.5 s, considering eight different supernova progenitors and the SFHo equation of state. Next, we study hypermassive neutron stars. We obtain a new universal relation between the $f$-mode frequency and the compactness of cold and nonrotating neutron stars, using bulk quantities. We show that this relation has an equation-of-state-variation of $\approx$ $3\%$, considering a set of ten equations of state. Using results from binary neutron star merger simulations, we study the evolution of hypermassive neutron stars on the $f$-$C$ plane, considering two different mass ratios and the SFHo equation of state. We find that the relation between the peak frequency of the gravitational-wave signal and the compactness from these hypermassive neutron stars deviates from the universal $f$-$C$ relation by 70 $-$ 80$\%$, when the peak frequency is taken directly as a proxy for the $f$-mode.

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzes secular dynamics using averaged equations that detail tidal effects on the motion of two extended bodies in Keplerian orbits. It introduces formulas for energy dissipation within each body of a binary system. The equations, particularly in contexts like the Sun-Mercury system, can be delineated into a fast-slow system. A significant contribution of this work is the demonstration of the crucial role complex rheological models play in the capture by spin-orbit resonances. This is particularly evident in the notable enlargement of the basin of attraction for Mercury's current state when transitioning from a single characteristic time rheology to a dual characteristic time model, under the constraint that both models comply with the same estimate of the complex Love number at orbital frequency. The study also underscores the importance of Mercury's elastic rigidity on secular timescales.
#### Spin-Orbit Synchronization and Singular Perturbation Theory

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we formulate a set of differential equations for a binary system to describe the secular-tidal evolution of orbital elements, rotational dynamics, and deformation (flattening), under the assumption that one body remains spherical while the other is slightly aspherical throughout the analysis. By applying singular perturbation theory, we analyze the dynamics of both the original and secular equations. Our findings indicate that the secular equations serve as a robust approximation for the entire system, often representing a slow-fast dynamical system. Additionally, we explore the geometric aspects of spin-orbit resonance capture, interpreting it as a manifestation of relaxation oscillations within singularly perturbed systems.
