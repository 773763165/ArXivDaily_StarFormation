 - **Abstract**
 We present new CO ($J=5-4$ and $7-6$) and [CI] ($^3P_2\,-\, ^3P_1$ and $^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0$) emission line observations of the star-forming galaxy D49 at the massive end of the Main Sequence at $z=3$. We incorporate previous CO ($J=3-2$) and optical-to-millimetre continuum observations to fit its spectral energy distribution (SED). Our results hint at high-$J$ CO luminosities exceeding the expected location on the empirical correlations with the infrared luminosity. [CI] emission fully consistent with the literature trends is found. We do not retrieve any signatures of a bright active galactic nucleus that could boost the $J=5-4,\,7-6$ lines in either the infrared or X-ray bands, but warm photon-dominated regions, shocks or turbulence could in principle do so. We suggest that mechanical heating could be a favourable mechanism able to enhance the gas emission at fixed infrared luminosity in D49 and other main-sequence star-forming galaxies at high redshift, but further investigation is necessary to confirm this explanation. We derive molecular gas masses from dust, CO, and [CI] that all agree within the uncertainties. Given its large star formation rate (SFR) $\sim 500~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and stellar mass $>10^{11.5}~M_\odot$, the short depletion time scale of $<0.3$ Gyr might indicate that D49 is experiencing its last growth spurt and will soon transit to quiescence.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the SIMBA galaxy formation simulation suite to explore anisotropies in the properties of circumgalactic gas that result from accretion and feedback processes. We particularly focus on the impact of bipolar active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet feedback as implemented in SIMBA, which quenches galaxies and has a dramatic effect on large-scale gas properties. We show that jet feedback at low redshifts is most common in the stellar mass range $(1-5)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$, so we focus on galaxies with active jets in this mass range. In comparison to runs without jet feedback, jets cause lower densities and higher temperatures along the galaxy minor axis (SIMBA jet direction) at radii >=$0.5r_{200c}-4r_{200c}$ and beyond. This effect is less apparent at higher or lower stellar masses, and is strongest within green valley galaxies. The metallicity also shows strong anisotropy out to large scales, driven by star formation feedback. We find substantially stronger anisotropy at <=$0.5r_{200c}$, but this also exists in runs with no explicit feedback, suggesting that it is due to anisotropic accretion. Finally, we explore anisotropy in the bulk radial motion of the gas, finding that both star formation and AGN wind feedback contribute to pushing the gas outwards along the minor axis at <=1 Mpc, but AGN jet feedback further causes bulk outflow along the minor axis out to several Mpc, which drives quenching via gas starvation. These results provide observational signatures for the operation of AGN feedback in galaxy quenching.
