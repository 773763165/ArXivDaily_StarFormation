#### Title:
          Gas permeability and mechanical properties of dust grain aggregates at hyper- and zero-gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Particle-particle and particle-gas processes significantly impact planetary precursors such as dust aggregates and planetesimals. We investigate gas permeability ($\kappa$) in 12 granular samples, mimicking planetesimal dust regoliths. Using parabolic flights, this study assesses how gravitational compression -- and lack thereof -- influences gas permeation, impacting the equilibrium state of low-gravity objects. Transitioning between micro- and hyper-gravity induces granular sedimentation dynamics, revealing collective dust-grain aerodynamics. Our experiments measure $\kappa$ across Knudsen number (Kn) ranges, reflecting transitional flow. Using mass and momentum conservation, we derive $\kappa$ and calculate pressure gradients within the granular matrix. Key findings: 1. As confinement pressure increases with gravitational load and mass flow, $\kappa$ and average pore space decrease. This implies that a planetesimal's unique dust-compaction history limits sub-surface volatile outflows. 2. The derived pressure gradient enables tensile strength determination for asteroid regolith simulants with cohesion. This offers a unique approach to studying dust-layer properties when suspended in confinement pressures comparable to the equilibrium state on planetesimals surfaces, which will be valuable for modelling their collisional evolution. 3. We observe a dynamical flow symmetry breaking when granular material moves against the pressure gradient. This occurs even at low Reynolds numbers, suggesting that Stokes numbers for drifting dust aggregates near the Stokes-Epstein transition require a drag force modification based on permeability.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M < ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high resolution chemical study of a representative sample of 21 luminous giant stars of Liller~1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge, based on H band spectra acquired with the Near InfraRed Spectrograph at KeckII. 15 stars turn out to have a subsolar iron abundance and enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely old that formed early and quickly from gas mainly enriched by type~II supernovae, and 6 stars with supersolar iron and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely younger, thus formed at later epochs from gas also enriched by type~Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [N/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values, indicating the occurrence of significant mixing in the stellar interiors of these evolved stars. The current study has also made evident that the sub-solar subpopulation shows some structuring, and the presence of a third subcomponent with iron content and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement somewhat intermediate between the metal-poor and metal-rich main subpopulations, has been statistically assessed, providing the chemical signature of an extended star formation with multiple bursts and of some self-enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 Although there is strong evidence that many long GRBs are associated with the collapse of a massive star, tantalizing results in recent years have upended the direct association of {\em all} long GRBs with massive stars. In particular, kilonova signals in some long GRB light curves as well as a suggested uptick in the rate density of long GRBs at low redshifts (deviating significantly from the star formation rate) suggest that compact object mergers may be a non-negligible fraction of the long GRB population. Here we investigate the contribution of white dwarf-black hole mergers to the long GRB population. We present evidence for the deviation of the long GRB rate density from the star formation rate at low redshifts, and provide analytic and numerical arguments for why a white dwarf-black hole merger system may be a viable progenitor to explain this deviation. We show the range of parameter space in which the durations, energetics, and rates of these systems can account for a significant sub-population of low-redshift long GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarization provides a new way to probe accretion geometry in black hole systems. If the accretion geometry of black holes is similar regardless of mass, we should expect the same to be true of their polarization properties. We compare the polarimetric properties of all non-blazar black holes observed with IXPE. We find that their polarization properties are very similar, particularly in the hard state, where the corona dominates. This tentatively supports the idea that stellar and supermassive black holes share a common coronal geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Variable stars in stellar clusters can offer key constraints on stellar evolution and pulsation models, utilising estimates of host cluster properties to constrain stellar physical parameters. We present a catalogue of 86 luminous (F814W<19) variable stars in M31 clusters identified by mining the archival Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using a combination of statistical analysis of sparse PHAT light curves and difference imaging. We determine the evolutionary phases and initial masses of these variable stars by matching them with theoretical isochrones generated using host cluster properties from the literature. We calculate the probability of PHAT photometry being blended due to the highly crowded nature of cluster environments for each cluster-variable star, using these probabilities to inform our level of confidence in the derived properties of each star. Our 86 cluster-variable stars have initial masses between 0.8--67 $M_{\odot}$. Their evolutionary phases span the main sequence, more evolved hydrogen- and helium-burning phases, and the post-asymptotic giant branch. We identify numerous candidate variable star types: RV Tauri variables, red supergiants and slowly pulsating B-type supergiants, along with Wolf Rayet stars, $\alpha$ Cygni and Mira variables, a classical Cepheid and a possible super-asymptotic giant. We characterise 12 cluster-variable stars at higher confidence based on their difference image quality and lower blending probability. Ours is the first systematic study of variable stars in extragalactic stellar clusters leveraging the superior resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and demonstrating the unique power of stellar clusters in constraining the fundamental properties of variable stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming surveys such as Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (Roman) will detect hundreds of high-redshift (z > 7) quasars, but distinguishing them from the billions of other sources in these catalogues represents a significant data analysis challenge. We address this problem by extending existing selection methods by using both i) Bayesian model comparison on measured fluxes and ii) a likelihood-based goodness-of-fit test on images, which are then combined using an Fbeta statistic. The result is an automated, reproduceable and objective high-redshift quasar selection pipeline. We test this on both simulations and real data from the cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) catalogues. On this cross-matched dataset we achieve an AUC score of up to 0.795 and an F3 score of up to 0.79, sufficient to be applied to the Euclid, LSST and Roman data when available.

 - **Abstract**
 We use 1-4" (300-1200 au) resolution 12CO(2-1) data from the MASSES (Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA) project to measure the projected opening angles of 46 protostellar outflows in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, 37 of which are measured with sufficiently high confidence to use in further analysis. We find that there is a statistically significant difference in the distributions of outflow opening angles for Class 0 and Class I outflows, with a distinct lack of both wide-angle Class 0 outflows and highly collimated Class I outflows. Synthesizing our results with several previous studies, we find that outflows widen with age through the Class 0 stage but do not continue to widen in the Class I stage. The maximum projected opening angle reached is approximately 90 degrees +/- 20 degrees, with the transition between widening and remaining constant occurring near the boundary between the Class 0 and Class I phases of evolution. While the volume fractions occupied by these outflows are no more than a few tens of percent of the total core volume, at most, recent theoretical work suggests outflows may still be capable of playing a central role in setting the low star formation efficiencies of 25%-50% observed on core scales.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first public data release (DR1) of the FRB Line-of-sight Ionization Measurement From Lightcone AAOmega Mapping (FLIMFLAM) Survey, a wide field spectroscopic survey targeted on the fields of 10 precisely localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). DR1 encompasses spectroscopic data for 10,468 galaxy redshifts across 10 FRBs fields with z<0.4, covering approximately 26 deg^2 of the sky in total. FLIMFLAM is composed of several layers, encompassing the `Wide' (covering ~ degree or >10 Mpc scales), `Narrow', (several-arcminute or ~ Mpc) and integral field unit (`IFU'; ~ arcminute or ~ 100 kpc ) components. The bulk of the data comprise spectroscopy from the 2dF-AAOmega on the 3.9-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope, while most of the Narrow and IFU data was achieved using an ensemble of 8-10-meter class telescopes. We summarize the information on our selected FRB fields, the criteria for target selection, methodologies employed for data reduction, spectral analysis processes, and an overview of our data products. An evaluation of our data reveals an average spectroscopic completeness of 48.43%, with over 80% of the observed targets having secure redshifts. Additionally, we describe our approach on generating angular masks and calculating the target selection functions, setting the stage for the impending reconstruction of the matter density field.

 - **Abstract**
 AstroPix is a novel monolithic high-voltage CMOS active pixel sensor proposed for next generation medium-energy gamma-ray observatories like the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). For AMEGO-X AstroPix must maintain a power consumption of less than $1.5~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$ while having a pixel pitch of up to $500~\rm{\mu m}$. We developed the second and third versions of AstroPix, namely AstroPix2 and AstroPix3. AstroPix2 and AstroPix3 exhibit power consumptions of $3.4~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$ and $4.1~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$, respectively. While AstroPix2 has a pixel pitch of $250~\rm{\mu m}$, AstroPix3 achieves the desired size for AMEGO-X with a pixel pitch of $500~\rm{\mu m}$. Performance evaluation of a single pixel in an AstroPix2 chip revealed a dynamic range from 13.9 keV to 59.5 keV, with the energy resolution meeting the AMEGO-X target value ($<10\%$ (FWHM) at 60 keV). We performed energy calibration on most of the pixels in an AstroPix3 chip, yielding a mean energy resolution of 6.2 keV (FWHM) at 59.5 keV, with 44.4% of the pixels satisfying the target value. The dynamic range of AstroPix3 was assessed to span from 22.2 keV to 122.1 keV. The expansion of the depletion layer aligns with expectations in both AstroPix2 and AstroPix3. Furthermore, radiation tolerance testing was conducted on AstroPix. An AstroPix2 chip was subjected to an equivalent exposure of approximately 10 Gy from a high-intensity $\rm{^{60}Co}$ source. The chip was fully operational after irradiation although a decrease in gain by approximately 4% was observed.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we conducted simulations to find the geometric aberrations expected for images taken by the Main Survey Camera (MSC) of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) due to its motion. As anticipated by previous work, our findings indicate that the geometric distortion of light impacts the focal plane's apparent scale, with a more pronounced influence as the size of the focal plane increases. Our models suggest that the effect consistently influences the pixel scale in both the vertical and parallel directions. The apparent scale variation follows a sinusoidal distribution throughout one orbit period. Simulations reveal that the effect is particularly pronounced in the center of the Galaxy and gradually diminishes along the direction of ecliptic latitude. At low ecliptic latitudes, the total aberration leads to about 0.94 pixels offset (a 20-minute exposure) and 0.26 pixels offset (a 300-second exposure) at the edge of the field of view, respectively. Appropriate processings for the geometric effect during the CSST pre- and post-observation phases are presented.

          Unveiling the chemical fingerprint of phosphorus-rich stars II. Heavy-element abundances from UVES/VLT spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of phosphorus-rich stars have been shown to contain between 10 and 100 times more P than our Sun. Given its crucial role as an essential element for life, it is especially necessary to uncover the origin of P-rich stars to gain insights into the still unknown nucleosynthetic formation pathways of P in our Galaxy. Our objective is to obtain the extensive chemical abundance inventory of four P-rich stars, covering a large range of heavy elements. This characterization will serve as a milestone for the nuclear astrophysics community to uncover the processes that form the unique chemical fingerprint of P-rich stars. We performed a detailed 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis on the optical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars. Our focus lay on the neutron-capture elements, in particular, on the elements between Sr and Ba, as well as on Pb, as they provide valuable constraints to nucleosynthesis calculations. We compare the obtained abundances with three different nucleosynthetic scenarios: a single i-process, a double i-process, and a combination of s- and i-processes. We have performed the most extensive abundance analysis of P-rich stars to date, including the elements between Sr and Ba, such as Ag, which are rarely measured in any type of stars. We found overabundances with respect to solar in the s-process peak elements, accompanied by an extremely high Ba abundance and slight enhancements in some elements between Rb and Sn. No global solution explaining all four stars could be found for the nucleosynthetic origin of the pattern. The model that produces the least number of discrepancies in three of the four stars is a combination of s- and i-processes, but the current lack of extensive multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to follow the occurrence of the i-process in different types of stars makes this scenario highly uncertain.

          An Analytic Model of Gravitational Collapse Induced by Radiative Cooling: Instability Scale, Infall Velocity, and Accretion Rate

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytic description of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of radiatively cooling gas clouds. The approach is based on developing the "one-zone" density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full dynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a barotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and velocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities we calculate the time-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach clarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium contraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate instability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined criterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the chemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context of a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two further examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the collapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, our results agree well with full hydrodynamical treatments.

          M giants with IGRINS IV. Identification and characterization of a near-IR line of the s-element Barium

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron-capture elements represent an important nucleosynthetic channel in the study of the Galactic Chemical Evolution of stellar populations. For stellar populations behind significant extinction, such as those in the Galactic Center and along the Galactic plane, abundance analyses based on near-IR spectra are necessary. Previously, spectral lines from the neutron-capture elements such as copper (Cu), cerium (Ce), neodymium (Nd), and ytterbium (Yb) have been identified in the H band, while yttrium (Y) lines have been identified in the K band. Due to the scarcity of spectral lines from neutron-capture elements in the near-IR, the addition of useful spectral lines from other neutron-capture elements is highly desirable. The aim of this work is to identify and characterise a spectral line suitable for abundance determination from the most commonly used s-process element, namely barium. We observed near-IR spectra of 37 M giants in the solar neighbourhood at high S/N and high spectral resolution using the IGRINS spectrometer on the GEMINI South telescope. Using a manual spectral synthesis method, we determined the stellar parameters for these stars and derived the barium abundance from the Ba line (6s5d $^3$D$_2 \rightarrow$ 6s6p $^3$P$^o_2$) at $\lambda_\mathrm{air}=23\,253.56\,$Å in the K band. We demonstrate that the Ba line in the K band at 2.33\,\mic\ ($\lambda$23253.56) is useful for abundance analysis from spectra of M giants. The line becomes progressively weaker at higher temperatures and is only useful in M giants and the coolest K giants at supersolar metallicities. We can now add Ba to the trends of the heavy elements Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb, which can be retrieved from high-resolution H- and K-band spectra. This opens up the study of nucleosynthetic channels, including the s-process and the r-process, in dust-obscured populations such as the Galactic Center.

 - **Abstract**
 In this Roadmap, we present a vision for the future of submillimetre and millimetre astronomy in the United Kingdom over the next decade and beyond. This Roadmap has been developed in response to the recommendation of the Astronomy Advisory Panel (AAP) of the STFC in the AAP Astronomy Roadmap 2022. In order to develop our stragetic priorities and recommendations, we surveyed the UK submillimetre and millimetre community to determine their key priorities for both the near-term and long-term future of the field. We further performed detailed reviews of UK leadership in submillimetre/millimetre science and instrumentation. Our key strategic priorities are as follows: 1. The UK must be a key partner in the forthcoming AtLAST telescope, for which it is essential that the UK remains a key partner in the JCMT in the intermediate term. 2. The UK must maintain, and if possible enhance, access to ALMA and aim to lead parts of instrument development for ALMA2040. Our strategic priorities complement one another: AtLAST (a 50m single-dish telescope) and an upgraded ALMA (a large configurable interferometric array) would be in synergy, not competition, with one another. Both have identified and are working towards the same overarching science goals, and both are required in order to fully address these goals.

 - **Abstract**
 Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe to study cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were suggested, and some tight empirical relations have been found for them. In particular, Guo and Wei suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young populations, which have also some new empirical relations. They also proposed to use one of the empirical relations without dispersion measure (DM) to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. Thus, it is time to check the empirical relations with the current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm.

          Detection of a Transient Quasi-periodic Oscillation in $\gamma$-Rays from Blazar PKS 2255-282

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive variability analysis of the blazar PKS 2255-282 using Fermi-LAT observations spanning over four years, from MJD 57783.5 to 59358.5. Our analysis revealed a transient quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of 93$\pm$2.6 days. We employed a variety of Fourier-based methods, including the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) and Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ), as well as time domain analysis techniques such as Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and the Stochastic modeling with Stochastically Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) models. Consistently, the QPO with a period of 93 days was detected across all methods used. The observed peak in LSP and time-averaged WWZ plots has a significance level of 4.06$\sigma$ and 3.96$\sigma$, respectively. To understand the source of flux modulations in the light curve, we explored various physical models. A plausible scenario involves the precession of the jet with a high Lorentz factor or the movement of a plasma blob along a helical trajectory within the relativistic jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The aromatic infrared Bands (AIBs) dominate the mid-infrared spectra of many galactic and extragalactic sources. These AIBs are generally attributed to fluorescent emission from aromatic molecules. Unified efforts from experimentalists and theoreticians to assign these AIB features have recently gotten additional impetus with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) delivers mid-IR spectrum with greatly increased sensitivity and spectral resolution. PAHs in space can exist in either neutral or ionic forms, absorb UV photons and undergo fragmentation, becoming a rich source of small hydrocarbons. This top-down mechanism of larger PAHs fragmenting into smaller species is of utmost importance in photo-dissociation regions (PDR) in space. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the photo-fragmentation pathways of two astronomically significant PAH cations - corannulene (C20H10) and sumanene (C21H12) that are structural motifs of fullerene C60, to understand their sequential fragmentation pathways. The photo-fragmentation experiments exhibit channels that are much different from planar PAHs. The breakdown of carbon skeleton is found to have different pathways for C20H10 and C21H12 because of the number and positioning of pentagon rings; yet the most abundant low mass cations produced by these two species are found to be similar. The low mass cations showcased in this work could be of interest for their astronomical detections. For completeness, the qualitative photo fragmentation behaviour of the dicationic corannulene and sumanene have also been experimented, but the potential energy surface of these dications are beyond the scope of this paper.

 The present-day abundance of beryllium in the solar atmosphere provides clues about mixing mechanisms within stellar interiors. However, abundance determinations based on the Be II 313.107 nm line are prone to systematic errors due to imperfect model spectra. These errors arise from missing continuous opacity in the UV, a significant unidentified blend at 313.102 nm, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and microturbulence and macroturbulence fudge parameters associated with one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres. Although these factors have been discussed in the literature, no study has yet accounted for all of them simultaneously. To address this, we present 3D non-LTE calculations for neutral and ionised beryllium in the Sun. We used these models to derive the present-day solar beryllium abundance, calibrating the missing opacity on high resolution solar irradiance data and the unidentified blend on the centre-to-limb variation. We find a surface abundance of 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 dex, which is significantly lower than the value of 1.38 dex that has been commonly adopted since 2004. Taking the protosolar beryllium abundance via CI chondrites, 1.32 $\pm$ 0.04 dex, our result implies that the surface abundance of beryllium has been depleted by 0.11 $\pm$ 0.06 dex, or 22 $\pm$ 11%. This is in tension with standard solar models, which predict negligible depletion, as well as with contemporary solar models that have extra mixing calibrated on the abundances of helium and lithium, which predict excessive depletion. These discrepancies highlight the need for further improvements to the physics in solar and stellar models.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate the properties of neutron stars admixed with selfinteracting scalar bosonic dark matter. The dark matter interaction is described by a generalized $\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability analysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable radial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations where the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$ km which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum mass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \, M_\odot$. With our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness of these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even larger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes. These ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while having a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron stars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be explained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron star masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark matter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the gravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the selfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of state for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.

          Polarization Measurement of Gamma-ray Bursts with Fermi-GBM: The Case of GRB 180720B

 - **Abstract**
 To achieve confident non-zero polarization measurements for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) we need sensitive polarimeters and bright GRBs. Here we report on the polarimetric analysis of the bright GRB 180720B using the \Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We rely on the detection of photons that scattered off Earth's atmosphere and into GBM from this burst. Polarized gamma-rays will exhibit a characteristic pattern when scattering off the atmosphere that differs from an unpolarized beam. We compare the measured photon counts in the GBM detectors with extensive simulations of polarized beams to derive the most probable polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA). For the entire GRB, we find PD$=72^{+24}_{-30}\% ~(1\sigma)$ and PA$=91^{+11}_{-9}$ deg ($1\sigma$, equatorial frame). Interestingly, the PA value is broadly consistent with an early optical PA measurement by the Kanata telescope, starting shortly after the end of the prompt emission. The consistency of PAs lends support for this method. The relatively high polarization degree (albeit with large uncertainties) agrees with similar past measurements suggesting that some GRBs might be highly polarized. This will be confirmed or refuted by the upcoming dedicated GRB polarimeters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectro-temporal analysis of 137 fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB baseband catalog, including 125 one-off bursts and 12 repeat bursts, down to microsecond resolution using the least-squares optimization fitting routine: fitburst. Our measured values are compared with those in the first CHIME/FRB intensity catalog, revealing that nearly one-third of our sample exhibits additional burst components at higher time resolutions. We measure sub-burst components within burst envelopes as narrow as $\sim$23 $\mu$s (FWHM), with 20% of the sample displaying sub-structures narrower than 100 $\mu$s, offering constraints on emission mechanisms. Scattering timescales in the sample range from 30 $\mu$s to 13 ms at 600 MHz. We observe no correlations between scattering time and dispersion measure, rotation measure, or linear polarization fraction, with the latter suggesting that depolarization due to multipath propagation is negligible in our sample. Bursts with narrower envelopes ($\leq$ 1 ms) in our sample exhibit higher flux densities, indicating the potential presence of sub-ms FRBs that are being missed by our real-time system below a brightness threshold. Most multicomponent bursts in our sample exhibit sub-burst separations of $\leq$ 1 ms, with no bursts showing separations $<$41 $\mu$s, even at a time resolution of 2.56 $\mu$s, but both scattering and low signal-to-noise ratio can hinder detection of additional components. Lastly, given the morphological diversity of our sample, we suggest that one-off and repeating FRBs can come from different classes but have overlapping property distributions.

          Bending the web: exploring the impact of modified gravity on the density field and halo properties within the cosmic web

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the impact of different Modified Gravity (MG) models on the large-scale structures (LSS) properties in relation to the cosmic web (CW), using N-body simulations of f(R) and nDGP models. We analyse the impact of the MG effect on the density field through density distribution and clustering statistics, and assess its influence on halo properties by examining the halo mass function and spin. We find that the PDF of dark matter density fields shift towards lower densities for stronger variants of f(R) and nDGP. Additionally, when segregated into CW environments, the stronger variants show a higher mean density in knots, and a lower mean density in voids compared to LCDM. For higher-order clustering statistics relative to LCDM, the scale-dependent f(R) variants exhibit a greater non-monotonic deviation as a function of scale when segregated into environments, compared to nDGP. Additionally, the halo mass function separated into CW environments shows a similar behaviour, introducing complex trends as a function of mass for f(R) and nDGP models. We also report up to a 15% enhancement in the angular momentum of halos in f(R) gravity models compared to LCDM, with similar differences when considering environmental segregation. We demonstrate that this difference in the spin arises largely due to different tidal torquing across the various MG models. Therefore, studying higher-order statistics of the cosmological fields and halo properties separated into CW components probes the additional physics contained within the MG models. We conclude that considering the effect of CW in MG studies increases the constraining power of these LSS statistics, and can further aid the distinction between the cosmologies that have an identical expansion history to the standard LCDM but differing underlying physics, such as the MG models presented in this work.
