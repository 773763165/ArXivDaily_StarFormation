 - **Abstract**
 The number of gravitational arcs systems detected is increasing quickly and should even increase at a faster rate in the near future. This wealth of new gravitational arcs requires the development of a purely automated method to reconstruct the lens and source. A general reconstruction method based on the singular perturbative approach is proposed in this paper. This method generates a lens and source reconstruction directly from the gravitational arc image. The method is fully automated and works in two steps. The first step is to generate a guess solution based on the circular solution in the singular perturbative approach. The second step is to break the sign degeneracy and to refine the solution by using a general source model. The refinement of the solution is conducted step by step to avoid the source-lens degeneracy issue. One important asset of this automated method is that the lens solution is written in universal terms which allows the computation of statistics. Considering the large number of lenses which should be available in the near future this ability to compute un-biased statistics is an important asset.

 - **Abstract**
 The third data release of Gaia was the first to include orbital solutions assuming non-single stars. Here, we apply the astrometric triage technique of Shahaf et al. 2019 to identify binary star systems with companions that are not single main-sequence stars. Gaia's synthetic photometry of these binaries is used to distinguish between systems likely to have white-dwarf companions and those that may be hierarchical triples. The study uncovered a population of nearly 3200 binaries, characterised by orbital separations on the order of an astronomical unit, in which the faint astrometric companion is probably a white dwarf. Remarkably, over 110 of these systems exhibit significant ultraviolet excess flux, confirming this classification and, in some cases, indicating their relatively young cooling ages. We show that the sample is not easily reproduced by binary population synthesis codes. Therefore, it challenges current binary evolution models, offering a unique opportunity to gain insights into the processes governing white-dwarf formation, binary evolution, and mass transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for primordial non-Gaussianity in cosmological perturbations are a key means of revealing novel primordial physics. However, robustly extracting signatures of primordial non-Gaussianity from non-linear scales of the late-time Universe is an open problem. In this paper, we apply k-Nearest Neighbor cumulative distribution functions, kNN-CDFs, to the \textsc{quijote-png} simulations to explore the sensitivity of kNN-CDFs to primordial non-Gaussianity. An interesting result is that for halo samples with $M_h<10^{14}$ M$_\odot$/h, the kNN-CDFs respond to \textit{equilateral} PNG in a manner distinct from the other parameters. This persists in the galaxy catalogs in redshift space and can be differentiated from the impact of galaxy modelling, at least within the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework considered here. kNN-CDFs are related to counts-in-cells and, through mapping a subset of the kNN-CDF measurements into the count-in-cells picture, we show that our results can be modeled analytically. A caveat of the analysis is that we only consider the HOD framework, including assembly bias. It will be interesting to validate these results with other techniques for modeling the galaxy--halo connection, e.g., (hybrid) effective field theory or semi-analytical methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the collision of precursor icy moons analogous to Dione and Rhea as a possible origin for Saturn's remarkably young rings. Such an event could have been triggered a few hundred million years ago by resonant instabilities in a previous satellite system. Using high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we find that this kind of impact can produce a wide distribution of massive objects and scatter material throughout the system. This includes the direct placement of pure-ice ejecta onto orbits that enter Saturn's Roche limit, which could form or rejuvenate rings. In addition, fragments and debris of rock and ice totalling more than the mass of Enceladus can be placed onto highly eccentric orbits that would intersect with any precursor moons orbiting in the vicinity of Mimas, Enceladus, or Tethys. This could prompt further disruption and facilitate a collisional cascade to distribute more debris for potential ring formation, the re-formation of the present-day moons, and evolution into an eventual cratering population of planeto-centric impactors.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Circumstellar debris disks provide insight into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. Resolved belts in particular help to locate planetesimals in exosystems, and can hint at the presence of disk-sculpting exoplanets. Aims: We study the circumstellar environment of HD 112810 (HIP 63439), a mid-F type star in the Sco-Cen association with a significant infrared excess indicating the presence of a circumstellar debris disk. Methods: We collected five high-contrast observations of HD 112810 with VLT/SPHERE. We identified a debris disk in scattered light, and found that the debris signature is robust over a number of epochs and a variety of reduction techniques. We modelled the disk, accounting for self-subtraction and assuming that it is optically thin. Results: We find a single-belt debris disk, with a radius of 118$\pm$9au and an inclination angle of ${75.7}^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$$\deg$. This is in good agreement with the constraints from SED modelling and from a partially-resolved ALMA image of the system. No planets are detected, though planets below the detection limit ($\sim$2.6M$_\textrm{J}$ at a projected separation of 118au) could be present and could have contributed to sculpting the ring of debris. Conclusions: HD 112810 adds to the growing inventory of debris disks imaged in scattered light. The disk is faint, but the radius and the inclination of the disk are promising for follow-up studies of the dust properties.
#### Opportunities and limits of lunar gravitational-wave detection

 - **Abstract**
 A new era of lunar exploration has begun with participation of all major space agencies. This activity brings opportunities for revolutionary science experiments and observatories on the Moon. The idea of a lunar gravitational-wave detector was already proposed during the Apollo program. The key characteristic of the Moon is that it is seismically extremely quiet. It was also pointed out that the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar poles provide ideal conditions for gravitational-wave detection. In recent years, three different detector concepts were proposed with varying levels of technological complexity and science potential. In this paper, we confront the three concepts in terms of their observational capabilities based on a first more detailed modeling of instrumental noise. We identify important technological challenges and potential show-stoppers.

 - **Abstract**
 The degree of mass loss, i.e. the fraction of stars lost by globular clusters, and specifically by their different populations, is still poorly understood. Many scenarios of the formation of multiple stellar populations, especially the ones involving self-enrichment, assume that the first generation (FG) was more massive at birth than now to reproduce the current mass of the second generation (SG). This assumption implies that, during their long-term evolution, clusters lose around $90\%$ of the FG. We have tested whether such strong mass loss could take place in a massive globular cluster orbiting the Milky Way at $4\ {\rm kpc}$ from the centre and composed of two generations. We perform a series of $N$-body simulations for ${12\ \rm Gyr}$ to probe the parameter space of internal cluster properties. We have derived that, for an extended FG and a low-mass second one, the cluster loses almost $98\%$ of its initial FG mass and the cluster mass can be as much as 20 times lower after a Hubble time. Furthermore, under these conditions, the derived fraction of SG stars, $f_{\rm enriched}$, falls in the range occupied by observed clusters of similar mass ($\sim 0.6-0.8$). In general, the parameters that affect the most the degree of mass loss are the presence or not of primordial segregation, the depth of the central potential, $W_{0,FG}$, the initial mass of the SG, $M^{ini}_{SG}$, and the initial half-mass radius of the SG, $r_{h,SG}$. Higher $M^{ini}_{SG}$ have not been found to imply higher final $f_{\rm enriched}$ due to the deeper cluster potential well which slows down mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomy observation is difficult in urban environments due to the background noise generated by human activities. Consequently, promoting astronomy in metropolitan areas is challenging. In this work, we propose a low-cost, educational experiment called Wok the Hydrogen (WTH) that offers opportunities for scientific observation in urban environments, specifically the observation of the $21$ cm ($f_{21} = 1420.4$ MHz) emission from neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way. We demonstrate how to construct a radio telescope using kitchenware, along with additional electronic equipment that can be easily purchased online. The total system cost is controlled within 150 dollars. We also outline the subsequent data analysis procedures for deriving the recession velocity of galactic hydrogen from the raw data. The system was tested on the campus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, which is located approximately 2 km northeast of the nearest residential area with a population of 0.4 million and about 10 km east of the downtown area with a population of 2 million. We show that a precision of $\Delta v \approx \pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ can be achieved for determining the recession velocity of neutral hydrogen with this relatively simple setup, and the precision can be further improved with longer exposure time.
#### ParamANN: A Neural Network to Estimate Cosmological Parameters for  $Λ$CDM Universe using Hubble Measurements

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15179
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15179
 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we employ a machine learning (ML) approach for the estimations of four fundamental parameters, namely, the Hubble constant ($H_0$), matter ($\Omega_{0m}$), curvature ($\Omega_{0k}$) and vacuum ($\Omega_{0\Lambda}$) densities of non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We use $53$ Hubble parameter values measured by differential ages (DA) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) techniques in the redshift interval $0.07 \leq z \leq 2.36$. We create an artificial neural network (called ParamANN) and train it with simulated values of $H(z)$ using various sets of $H_0$, $\Omega_{0m}$, $\Omega_{0k}$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}$ parameters chosen from different and sufficiently wide prior intervals. We use a correlated noise model in the analysis. We demonstrate accurate validation and prediction by ParamANN. ParamANN provides an excellent cross-check for the validity of the $\Lambda$CDM model and alleviates the Hubble tension problem which has been reported earlier in the literature. We obtain $H_0 = 66.11 \pm 2.59$ $\rm{kmMpc^{-1}sec^{-1}}$, $\Omega_{0m} = 0.3359 \pm 0.0814$, $\Omega_{0k} = 0.0237 \pm 0.1248$ and $\Omega_{0\Lambda} = 0.6405 \pm 0.0861$ by using the trained network. These parameter values agree very well with the results of global CMB observations of Planck collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 Models with an interaction between dark energy and dark matter have already been studied for about twenty years. However, in this paper, we provide for the first time a general analytical solution for models with an energy transfer given by $\mathcal{E} = 3H(\xi_1 \rho_c + \xi_2 \rho_d)$. We also use a new set of age-redshift data for 114 old astrophysical objects (OAO) and constrain some special cases of this general energy transfer. We use a method inspired on artificial intelligence, known as Chaos Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (CQPSO), to explore the parameter space and search the best fit values. We test this method under a simulated scenario and also compare with previous MCMC results and find good agreement with the expected results.
#### A Tale of 3 Dwarf Planets: Ices and Organics on Sedna, Gonggong, and  Quaoar from JWST Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We observed Sedna, Gonggong, and Quaoar with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). All three bodies were observed in the low-resolution prism mode at wavelengths spanning 0.7 to 5.2 {\mu}m. Quaoar was also observed at 10x higher spectral resolution from 0.97 to 3.16 {\mu}m using medium-resolution gratings. Sedna's spectrum shows a large number of absorption features due to ethane (C2H6), as well as acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), H2O, and possibly minor CO2. Gonggong's spectrum also shows several, but fewer and weaker, ethane features, along with stronger and cleaner H2O features and CO2 complexed with other molecules. Quaoar's prism spectrum shows even fewer and weaker ethane features, the deepest and cleanest H2O features, a feature at 3.2 {\mu}m possibly due to HCN, and CO2 ice. The higher-resolution medium grating spectrum of Quaoar reveals several overtone and combination bands of ethane and methane (CH4). Spectra of all three objects show steep red spectral slopes and strong, broad absorptions between 2.7 and 3.6 {\mu}m indicative of complex organic molecules. The suite of light hydrocarbons and complex organic molecules are interpreted as the products of irradiation of methane. The differences in apparent abundances of irradiation products are likely due to their distinctive orbits, which lead to different timescales of methane retention and to different charged particle irradiation environments. In all cases, however, the continued presence of light hydrocarbons implies a resupply of methane to the surface. We suggest that these three bodies have undergone internal melting and geochemical evolution similar to the larger dwarf planets and distinct from all smaller KBOs.
#### Spatiotemporal patterns of Io's bright transient eruptions, 1978-2022

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzes Io's thermally detected volcanic outbursts and mini-outbursts, generally called bright transient eruptions. We examine their evolving characteristics over the history of outburst observations between the Voyager flybys in 1978 and 2022. We catalog, compare, and interpret the data of these bright transient eruptions from several spacecraft flybys and numerous ground-based observation campaigns. To test the spatiotemporal behavior of these events, we compare them to a population of randomly spaced, stochastic events with an equal likelihood of occurrence anywhere on Io's surface. We find that the aggregate of all outbursts is consistent with a random distribution across Io, whereas mini-outbursts strongly prefer the trailing hemisphere (180 to 360 W). On shorter timescales, however, outbursts show a significant change in spatiotemporal behavior before and after the year 2012. Outbursts from 1995 to 2007 favor the northern leading hemisphere, while outbursts from 2013 to 2021 favor the southern trailing hemisphere. These temporally separated clusters of outbursts are remarkably similar to Io's two primary mountainous regions, indicating that outbursts may be related to mountain-forming activity. These trends show how bright transient eruptions are distinct from Io's other forms of volcanism. These could be essential constraints to assess models of Io's interior heat transport between tidal generation and volcanic distribution.
#### Degenerate interpretations of O$_3$ spectral features in exoplanet  atmosphere observations due to stellar UV uncertainties: a 3D case study with  TRAPPIST-1e

 - **Abstract**
 TRAPPIST-1e is a potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanet orbiting an ultra-cool M Dwarf star and is a key target for observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). One-dimensional photochemical modelling of terrestrial planetary atmospheres has shown the importance of the incoming stellar UV flux in modulating the concentration of chemical species, such as O$_3$ and H$_2$O. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) modelling has demonstrated anisotropy in chemical abundances due to transport in tidally locked exoplanet simulations. We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6), a 3D Earth System Model, to investigate how uncertainties in the incident UV flux, combined with transport, affect observational predictions for TRAPPIST-1e (assuming an initial Earth-like atmospheric composition). We use two semi-empirical stellar spectra for TRAPPIST-1 from the literature. The UV flux ratio between them can be as large as a factor of 5000 in some wavelength bins. Consequently, the photochemically-produced total O$_3$ columns differ by a factor of 26. Spectral features of O$_3$ in both transmission and emission spectra vary between these simulations (e.g. differences of 19 km in transmission spectra effective altitude for O$_3$ at 0.6 $\mu$m). This leads to potential ambiguities when interpreting observations, including overlap with scenarios that assume alternative O$_2$ concentrations. Hence, to achieve robust interpretations of terrestrial exoplanetary spectra, characterisation of the UV spectra of their host stars is critical. In the absence of such stellar measurements, atmospheric context can still be gained from other spectral features (e.g. H$_2$O), or by comparing direct imaging and transmission spectra in conjunction.

 - **Abstract**
 As comets journey into the inner solar system, they deliver particulates and volatile gases into their comae that reveal the most primitive materials in the solar system. Cometary dust particles provide crucial information for assessing the physico-chemical conditions in the outer disk from which they formed. Compared to the volatiles and soluble organics, the refractory dust particles are more robust and may be traceable to other small bodies. Using data from the Spitzer Heritage Archive, we present thermal dust models of 57 observations of 33 comets observed spectroscopically with the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope. This comet spectral survey offers the opportunity to study comets with data from the same instrument, reduced by the same methods, and fitted by the same thermal model using the same optical constants. The submicron dust tends to be dominated by amorphous carbon, and the submicron silicate mass tends to be dominated by amorphous silicate materials. We discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to Mg-rich crystalline silicates, which are high-temperature condensates, as well as to potential ion irradiation of amorphous Mg:Fe silicates prior to their incorporation into comets. These results impact our understandings of the protoplanetary disk conditions of planetesimal formation. Lastly, we cannot definitively conclude that a distinct difference exists in the dust composition between Oort cloud and Jupiter-family comet dynamical population as a whole.
#### Bayesian Inference on the Isotopic Building Blocks of Mars and Earth

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic anomalies provide a means of probing the materials responsible for the formation of terrestrial planets. By analyzing new iron isotopic anomaly data from Martian meteorites and drawing insights from published data for O, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Si, we scrutinize potential changes in the isotopic composition of the material accreted by Mars and Earth during their formation. A Principal Component Analysis of isotopic anomalies in meteorites identifies three main clusters (forming the three parts of the isotopic trichotomy): CI, CC=CM+CO+CV+CR, and NC=EH+EL+H+L+LL. Our results suggest that Earth is primarily an isotopic mixture of ~92% E, 6 % CI, and <2% COCV and O. Mars, on the other hand, appears to be a mixture of ~65% E, 33% O, and <2% CI and COCV. We establish that Earth's CI contribution substantially increased during the latter half of its accretion. Mars began accreting a mix of O and E but predominantly accreted E later. Mars' changing isotopic makeup during accretion can be explained if it underwent gas-driven type I migration from its origin near the O - E boundary to a location well within the E region during the first few million years of solar system history. Earth's later increased CI contribution may be attributed to the stochastic impact of an interloper carbonaceous embryo that moved inside the inner solar system region while nebular gas was still present, and subsequently participated in the stage of chaotic growth. The recent findings of Si isotopic anomalies in enstatite chondrites when compared to terrestrial rocks likely stems from insufficient correction for high-temperature equilibrium isotopic fractionation. With appropriate adjustments for this influence, both the silicate Earth and enstatite chondrites exhibit comparable Si isotopic anomalies, reaffirming a genetic link between them.

 - **Abstract**
 A wide class of scalar field models including Quintessence and K-essence have the attractive property of tracker regimes, where the energy density stored in the field evolves so as to mimic that of the dominant background component for a period of time. During this evolution, for a brief period of time there is an increase in the energy density of the field as it spirals in towards it's attractor solution. We show that when the peak of this energy density occurs around the epoch of equality, we can address a key requirement of early dark energy (EDE), postulated as a solution to the Hubble tension. In particular we demonstrate how this can occur in a wide class of Quintessence, axion and K-essence models, before showing that the Quintessence models suffer in that they generally lead to sound speeds incompatible with the requirements of EDE, whereas the K-essence and axion models can do a better job of fitting the data.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the kinematic and chemical properties of Monoceros stellar overdensity by combining data from 2MASS, WISE, APOGEE, and \text{Gaia}. Monoceros is a structure located towards the Galactic anticenter and close to the disk. We identified that its stars have azimuthal velocity in the range of $200 < v_{\phi}\,{\rm(km\,s^{-1})}< 250$. Combining their kinematics and spatial distribution, we designed a new method to select stars from this overdensity. This method allows us to easily identify the structure in both hemispheres and estimate their distances. Our analysis was supported by comparison with simulated data from the entire sky generated by $\texttt{Galaxia}$ code. Furthermore, we characterized, for the first time, the Monoceros overdensity in several chemical-abundance spaces. Our results confirm its similarity to stars found in the thin disk of the Galaxy and suggest an \textit{in situ} formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the southern (Mon-S) and northern (Mon-N) regions of Monoceros exhibit indistinguishable chemical compositions.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous work by our group has shown the potential for an aerogravity assist at Triton using a trailing ballute to capture a probe into orbit about Neptune. The current work extends that study by using the LOFTID aeroshell configuration, a flight-proven inflatable, to perform the aeromaneuver. Numerical simulations were carried out beginning at the atmospheric interface for a range of entry velocities (3.0-14.0 km/s) and angles (45-56 degrees). The spin-stabilized vehicle was assumed to fly at zero angle of attack, producing no lift, and is capable of reaching outbound conditions sufficient to capture into orbit about Neptune without violating the vehicle's aerothermal limits or penetrating too deeply into Triton's atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has been mainly focused on nearby stars and their planets in recent years. Barnard's star is the second closest star system to the sun and the closest star in the FAST observable sky which makes the minimum Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) required for a hypothetical radio transmitter from Barnard's star to be detected by FAST telescope a mere 4.36x10^8 W. In this paper, we present the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) telescope as the most sensitive instrument for radio SETI observations toward nearby star systems and conduct a series of observations to Barnard's star (GJ 699). By applying the multi-beam coincidence matching (MBCM) strategy on the FAST telescope, we search for narrow-band signals (~Hz) in the frequency range of 1.05-1.45 GHz, and two orthogonal linear polarization directions are recorded. Despite finding no evidence of radio technosignatures in our series of observations, we have developed predictions regarding the hypothetical extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) signal originating from Barnard's star. These predictions are based on the star's physical properties and our observation strategy.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass ($M_{\rm TOV}$) and radius ($R_{\rm TOV}$) of the maximum-mass nonrotating neutron star (NS) play a crucial role in constraining the elusive equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter and in predicting the fate of remnants from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. In this study, we introduce a novel method to deduce these parameters by examining the mergers of second-generation (2G) BHs with NSs. These 2G BHs are assumed to originate from supramassive neutron stars (SMNSs) formed in BNS mergers. Since the properties of the remnant BHs arising from the collapse of SMNSs follow a universal relation governed by $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{\rm TOV}$, we anticipate that by analyzing a series ($\sim 100$ detections) of mass and spin measurements of the 2G BHs using the third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors, $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{\rm TOV}$ can be determined with a precision of $\sim 0.01M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.6$ km, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmosphere of a terrestrial planet that is replenished with secondary gases should have accumulated hydrogen-rich gas from its protoplanetary disk. Although a giant impact blows off a large fraction of the primordial atmosphere of a terrestrial planet in the late formation stage, the remaining atmosphere can become water-rich via chemical reactions between hydrogen and vaporized core material. We find that a water-rich post-impact atmosphere forms when a basaltic or CI chondrite core is assumed. In contrast, little post-impact water is generated for an enstatite chondrite core. We investigate the X-ray- and UV-driven mass loss from an Earth-mass planet with an impact-induced multi-component H$_2$$-$He$-$H$_2$O atmosphere for Gyrs. We show that water is left in the atmosphere of an Earth-mass planet when the low flux of escaping hydrogen cannot drag water upward via collisions. For a water-dominated atmosphere to form, the atmospheric mass fraction of an Earth-mass planet with an oxidizing core after a giant impact must be less than a few times 0.1%. We also find that Earth-mass planets with water-dominated atmospheres can exist at semimajor axes ranging from a few times 0.1 au to a few au around a Sun-like star depending on the mass loss efficiency. Such planets are important targets for atmospheric characterization in the era of JWST. Our results indicate that efficient mixing between hydrogen and rocky components during giant impacts can play a role in the production of water in an Earth-mass planet.
#### Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XIV. The F-type system V570  Persei

 - **Abstract**
 V570 Per is a binary star system containing two F-type stars in a 1.90 d period circular orbit. It shows shallow partial eclipses that were discovered from its Hipparcos light curve. We present an analysis of this system based on two sectors of high-quality photometry from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, and published spectroscopic light ratio and radial velocity measurements. We find masses of 1.449 +/- 0.006 and 1.350 +/- 0.006 Msun, and radii of 1.538 +/- 0.035 and 1.349 +/- 0.032 Rsun. The radius measurements are set by the spectroscopic light ratio and could be improved by obtaining a more precise light ratio. The eclipses in the TESS data arrived 660 +/- 30 s later than expected, suggesting the presence of a faint third body on a wider orbit around the eclipsing system. Small trends in the residuals of the fit to the TESS light curve are attributed to weak starspots. The distance to the system is close to the Gaia DR3 value, but the Gaia spectroscopic orbit is in moderate disagreement with the results from the published ground-based data.
#### In search of gravity mode signatures in main sequence solar-type stars  observed by Kepler

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity modes (g modes), mixed gravito-acoustic modes (mixed modes), and gravito-inertial modes (gi modes) possess unmatched properties as probes for stars with radiative interiors. The structural and dynamical constraints that they are able to provide cannot be accessed by other means. While they provide precious insights into the internal dynamics of evolved stars as well as massive and intermediate-mass stars, their non-detection in main sequence (MS) solar-type stars make them a crucial missing piece in our understanding of angular momentum transport in radiative zones and stellar rotational evolution. In this work, we aim to apply certain analysis tools originally developed for helioseismology in order to look for g-mode signatures in MS solar-type stars. We select a sample of the 34 most promising MS solar-type stars with Kepler four-year long photometric time series. All these stars are well-characterised late F-type stars with thin convective envelopes, fast convective flows, and stochastically excited acoustic modes (p modes). For each star, we compute the background noise level of the Fourier power spectrum to identify significant peaks at low frequency. After successfully detecting individual peaks in 12 targets, we further analyse four of them and observe distinct patterns of surrounding peaks with a low probability of being noise artifacts. Comparisons with the predictions from reference models suggest that these patterns are compatible with the presence of non-asymptotic low-order pure g modes, pure p modes, and mixed modes. Given their sensitivity to both the convective core interface stratification and the coupling between p- and g-mode resonant cavities, such modes are able to provide strong constraints on the structure and evolutionary states of the related targets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the dynamics of two less massive objects moving around a central massive object, which are all embedded within a thin accretion disc. In addition to the gravitational interaction between these objects, the disc-object interaction is also crucial for describing the long-term dynamics of the multi-body system, especially in the regime of mean-motion resonances. We point out that near the resonance the density waves generated by the two moving objects generally coherently interfere with each other, giving rise to extra angular momentum fluxes. The resulting backreaction on the objects is derived within the thin-disc scenario, which explicitly depends on the resonant angle. With this density-wave mediated interaction included, we find that a system initially locked into the mean-motion resonance either asymptotes to a quai-stationary fixed point or automatically exits the resonance with large amplitude circulations. We have performed hydrodynamical simulations with planets embedded within a thin accretion disc and have found signatures of interfering density waves from the evolution of planet eccentricities. By including the type-I migration torques in the evolution of a pair of planets, we show that the eccentricity-damping effect contributed by the interfering densities may increase the period ratio of the planets when they are trapped in mean-motion resonances. This may explain the $1\%-2\%$ offset (for the period ratios) from the exact resonance values as observed in Kepler multi-planet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, cosmography emerged as a valuable tool to effectively describe the vast amount of astrophysical observations without relying on a specific cosmological model. Its model-independent nature ensures a faithful representation of data, free from theoretical biases. Indeed, the commonly assumed fiducial model, the $\Lambda$CDM, shows some shortcomings and tensions between data at late and early times that need to be further investigated. In this paper, we explore an extension of the standard cosmological model by adopting the $f(z)$CDM approach, where $f(z)$ represents the cosmographic series characterizing the evolution of recent universe driven by dark energy. To construct $f(z)$, we take into account the Pad\'e series, since this rational polynomial approximation offers a better convergence at high redshifts than the standard Taylor series expansion. Several orders of such an approximant have been proposed in previous works, here we want to answer the questions: What is the impact of the cosmographic series choice on the parameter constraints? Which series is the best for the analysis? So, we analyse the most promising ones by identifying which order is preferred in terms of stability and goodness of fit. Theoretical predictions of the $f(z)$CDM model are obtained by the Boltzmann solver code and the posterior distributions of the cosmological and cosmographic parameters are constrained by a Monte Carlo Markov Chains analysis. We consider a joint data set of cosmic microwave background temperature measurements from the Planck collaboration, type Ia supernovae data from the latest Pantheon+ sample, baryonic acoustic oscillations and cosmic chronometers data. In conclusions, we state which series can be used when only late time data are used, while which orders has to be considered in order to achieve the necessary stability when large redshifts are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic acceleration problem remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is the modification of gravity on large scales. In this paper, we explore the well-known $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ parametrization scenarios, and confront them with observational data, including the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as large-scale structure data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS: BAO+RSD) and Pantheon Supernovae (SN) catalog. We employ a Bayesian framework to constrain the model parameters and discuss the implications of our results on the viability of modified gravity theories. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of the $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ parametrization and provides valuable insights into the nature of gravity on cosmological scales. From the joint analysis ACT + WMAP + SDDS + SN, we find $\mu -1 = 0.02 \pm 0.19$ and $\Sigma -1 = 0.021 \pm 0.068$ at 68\% CL. In light of the SPT + WMAP + SDDS + SN, we find $\mu -1 = 0.07 \pm 0.18$ and $\Sigma -1 = -0.009^{+0.078}_{-0.11}$ at 68\% CL. We also discuss and present several other results involving these datasets. In all the analysis carried out, we did not find any deviations from the theory of general relativity. Our results represent an observational update on the well-known $\mu$-$\Sigma$ parameterization in view of current CMB data, independent and competitive with the constraints obtained with the Planck data.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will provide unprecedented sensitivity to inspiraling binary neutron stars and black holes, enabling detections at the peak of star formation and beyond. However, the signals from these systems will last much longer than those in current detectors, and overlap in both time and frequency, leading to increased computational cost to search for them with standard matched filtering analyses, and a higher probability that they are observed in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. We therefore present a method to search for gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals in next-generation detectors that is computationally efficient and robust against gaps in data collection and noise non-stationarities. Our method, based on the Hough Transform, finds tracks in the time/frequency plane of the detector that uniquely describe specific inspiraling systems. We find that we could detect $\sim 5$ overlapping, intermediate-strength signals without a sensitivity loss. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can enable multi-messenger astronomy: using only low frequencies ($2-20$ Hz), we could warn astronomers $\sim 2.5$ hours before a GW170817-like merger at 40 Mpc and provide a sky localization of $\sim 20$ deg$^2$ using only one interferometer. Additionally, assuming that primordial black holes (PBHs) exist, we derive projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter they could compose, $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-4}$, for $\sim 1-0.1M_\odot$ equal-mass systems, respectively, using a rate suppression factor $f_{\rm sup}=2.5\times 10^{-3}$. Our method only incurs a strain sensitivity loss of a factor of a few at binary neutron star masses compared to the matched filter, which may be reduced depending on available computational power.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the amplitude of local Primordial Non-Gaussianities (PNG), $f_{\rm NL}$, using the quasar sample in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 16. We analyze the power spectrum monopole, testing for the presence of scale dependent galaxy bias induced by local PNG. Our analysis makes use of optimal redshift weights that maximize the response of the quasar sample to the possible presence of non zero PNG. We find $-4<f_{\rm NL}<27$ at $68\%$ confidence level, which is among the strongest bounds with Large Scale Structure data. The optimal analysis reduces the error bar by about 10% compared to the standard one, an amount which is smaller than what was expected from a Fisher matrix analysis. This, and the reduced improvement over previous releases of the same catalog, suggest the presence of still unknown systematic effects in the data. If the quasars have a lower response to local PNG, our optimal constraint becomes $-23<f_{\rm NL}<21$ at $68\%$, with an improvement of $30\%$ over standard analyses. We also show how to use the optimal weights to put data-driven priors on the sample's response to local PNG.

 - **Abstract**
 The no-scale flipped SU(5) superstring framework constitutes a very promising paradigm for physics below the Planck scale providing us with a very rich cosmological phenomenology in accordance with observations. In particular, it can accommodate Starobinsky-like inflation, followed by a reheating phase, which is driven by a light "flaton" field, and during which the GUT phase transition occurs. In this Letter, we extract for the first time a gravitational-wave (GW) signal which naturally arises in the context of the flipped SU(5) cosmological phenomenology and is related to the existence of an early matter era (eMD) driven by the flaton field. Specifically, we study GWs non-linearly induced by inflationary perturbations and which are abundantly produced during a sudden transition from the flaton-driven eMD era to the late-time radiation-dominated era. Remarkably, we find a GW signal with a characteristic peak frequency $f_\mathrm{GW,peak}$ depending only on the string slope $\alpha'$ and reading as $f_\mathrm{GW,peak} \propto 10^{-9} \left(\frac{\alpha'}{\alpha'_*}\right)^4 \mathrm{Hz}$, where $\alpha'_{*}$ is the fiducial string slope being related directly to the reduced Planck scale $M_\mathrm{Pl}$ as $\alpha'_{*} = 8/M^2_\mathrm{Pl}$. Interestingly enough, $f_\mathrm{GW,peak}$ lies within the $\mathrm{nHz}$ frequency range; hence rendering this primordial GW signal potentially detectable by SKA, NANOGrav and PTA probes at their very low frequency region of their detection bands.

 Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow light curves and spectra provide information about the density of the environment, the energy of the explosion, the properties of the particle acceleration process, and the structure of the decelerating jet. Due to the large number of parameters involved, the model can present a certain degree of parameter degeneracy. In this paper, we present synthetic photometric observations of GRB afterglows and model them using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This method has emerged as the preferred approach for analysing and interpreting data in astronomy. We show that, depending on the choice of priors, the parameter degeneracy can go unnoticed by the MCMC method. Furthermore, we apply the MCMC method to analyse the GRB~170817A afterglow. We find that there is a complete degeneracy between the energy of the explosion, the density of the environment, and the microphysical parameters describing the particle acceleration process, which cannot be determined by the afterglow light curve alone. Our results emphasise the importance of gaining a deep understanding of the degeneracy properties which can be present in GRB afterglows models, as well as the limitations of the MCMC method.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field survery have recently detected recurring optical and X-ray sources near galactic nuclei, with period spanning hours to years. These phenomena could result from repeated partial tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or by interaction between star and SMBH-accretion discs. We study the physical processes that produce period changes in such sources, highlighting the key role of the interaction between the orbiting star and the accretion disc. We focus on ASASSN-14ko - a repeatedly flaring optical source with a mean period $P_0 = 115 \, \rm d$ and a detected period decay $\dot{P} = -2.6\times 10^{-3}$ (Payne et al. 2022). We argue that the system's $\dot{P}$ is most compatible with true orbital decay produced by hydrodynamical drag as a star passes through the accretion disc on an inclined orbit, twice per orbit. The star is likely a sun-like star whose envelope is somewhat inflated, possibly due to tidal heating. Star-disc interaction inevitably leads to drag-induced stripping of mass from the star, which may be the dominant component in powering the observed flares. We discuss ASASSN-14ko's possible formation history and observational tests of our interpretation of the measured $\dot P$. Our results imply that partial tidal disruption events manifesting as repeating nuclear transients cannot be modeled without accounting for the cumulative impact of tidal heating over many orbits. We discuss the implications of our results for other repeating transients, and predict that the recurrence time of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions is expected to decay at a rate of order $|\dot{P}| \approx 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$.
