 - **Abstract**
 The common-envelope (CE) phase is a crucial stage in binary star evolution because the orbital separation can shrink drastically while ejecting the envelope of a giant star. Three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of CE evolution are indispensable to learning about the mechanisms that play a role during the CE phase. While these simulations offer great insight, they are computationally expensive. We propose a one-dimensional (1D) model to simulate the CE phase within the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ by using a parametric drag force prescription for dynamical drag and adding the released orbital energy as heat into the envelope. We compute CE events of a $0.97\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ asymptotic giant-branch star and a point mass companion with mass ratios of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, and compare them to 3D simulations of the same setup. The 1D CE model contains two free parameters, which we demonstrate are both needed to fit the spiral-in behavior and the fraction of ejected envelope mass of the 1D method to the 3D simulations. For mass ratios of 0.25 and 0.50, we find good-fitting 1D simulations, while for a mass ratio of 0.75, we do not find a satisfactory fit to the 3D simulation as some of the assumptions in the 1D method are no longer valid. In all our simulations, we find that the released recombination energy is important to accelerate the envelope and drive the ejection.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the mean free path of Lyman-continuum photons in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization can help constrain the nature of the sources as well as sinks of hydrogen-ionizing radiation. A recent approach to this measurement has been to utilize composite spectra of multiple quasars at $z\sim 6$, and infer the mean free path after correcting the spectra for the presence of quasar proximity zones. This has revealed not only a steep drop in the mean free path from $z=5$ to $z=6$, but also potentially a mild tension with reionization simulations. We critically examine such direct measurements of the mean free path for biases due to quasar environment, incomplete reionization, and quasar proximity zones. Using cosmological radiative transfer simulations of reionization combined with one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of quasar proximity zones, we find that the bias in the mean free path due to overdensities around quasars is minimal at $z\sim 6$. Patchiness of reionization at this redshift also does not affect the measurements significantly. Fitting our model to the data results in a mean free path of $\lambda_{\mathrm{mfp}}=0.90^{+0.66}_{-0.40}$ pMpc at $z=6$, which is consistent with the recent measurements in the literature, indicating robustness with respect to the modelling of quasar proximity zones. We also compare various ways in which the mean free path has been defined in simulations before the end of reionization. Overall, our finding is that recent measurements of the mean free path appear to be robust relative to several sources of potential bias.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal freeze-out mechanism in its classical form is tightly connected to physics beyond the Standard Model around the electroweak scale, which has been the target of enormous experimental efforts. In this work we study a dark matter model in which freeze-out is triggered by a strong first-order phase transition in a dark sector, and show that this phase transition must also happen close to the electroweak scale, i.e. in the temperature range relevant for gravitational wave searches with the LISA mission. Specifically, we consider the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry through the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field, which generates the mass of a fermionic dark matter candidate that subsequently annihilates into dark Higgs and gauge bosons. In this set-up the peak frequency of the gravitational wave background is tightly correlated with the dark matter relic abundance, and imposing the observed value for the latter implies that the former must lie in the milli-Hertz range. A peculiar feature of our set-up is that the dark sector is not necessarily in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model during the phase transition, and hence the temperatures of the two sectors evolve independently. Nevertheless, the requirement that the universe does not enter an extended period of matter domination after the phase transition, which would strongly dilute any gravitational wave signal, places a lower bound on the portal coupling that governs the entropy transfer between the two sectors. As a result, the predictions for the peak frequency of gravitational waves in the LISA band are robust, while the amplitude can change depending on the initial dark sector temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of the ionizing photon mean free path (MFP) based on composite quasar spectra may point to a late end to reionization at $z<6$. These measurements are challenging, however, because they rely on assumptions about the proximity zones of the quasars in the analysis. For example, some of the $z\sim 6$ quasars in the composite might have been close to large-scale regions where reionization was still ongoing ("neutral islands"), and it is unclear how this would affect the measurements. We address the question here with mock MFP measurements from radiative transfer simulations. We find that, even in the presence of neutral islands, the inferred MFP tracks to within $30 \%$ the true attenuation scale of the spatially averaged IGM, which includes opacity from both the ionized medium and the islands. During reionization, this scale is always shorter than the MFP in the ionized medium. The inferred MFP is sensitive at the $< 50\%$ level to assumptions about the quasar environments and lifetimes for realistic models. We demonstrate that future analyses with improved data may require explicitly modeling the effects of neutral islands on the composite spectra, and we outline a method for doing this. Lastly, we quantify the effects of neutral islands on Lyman-series transmission, which has been modeled with optically thin simulations in previous MFP analyses. Neutral islands can suppress transmission at $\lambda_{\rm rest} < 912$ \r{A} significantly, up to a factor of 2 for $z_{\rm qso} = 6$ in a plausible reionization scenario, owing to absorption by many closely spaced lines as quasar light redshifts into resonance. However, the suppression is almost entirely degenerate with the spectrum normalization, thus does not significantly bias the inferred MFP.

 - **Abstract**
 Closure invariants in interferometry carry calibration-independent information about the morphology of an observed object. Excepting simple cases, a mapping between closure invariants and morphologies is not well established. We aim to demonstrate that closure invariants can be used to classify the morphology and estimate the morphological parameters using simple Machine Learning models. We consider 6 morphological classes -- point-like, uniform circular disc, crescent, dual disc, crescent with elliptical accretion disc, and crescent with double jet lobes -- described by phenomenological parameters. Using simple logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network, and random forest models on closure invariants obtained from a sparse aperture coverage, we find that all models except logistic regression are able to classify the morphology with an $F_1$ score $\gtrsim 0.8$. The classification accuracy notably improves with greater aperture coverage. We also estimate morphological parameters of uniform circular disc, crescent, and dual disc using simple MLP models, and perform a parametric image reconstruction. The reconstructed images do not retain information about absolute position or intensity scale. The estimated parameters and reconstructed images are found to correspond well with the inputs. However, the prediction accuracy worsens with increasing morphological complexity. This proof-of-concept method opens an independent approach to interferometric imaging under challenging observing conditions such as that faced by the Event Horizon Telescope and Very Long Baseline Interferometry in general, and can complement other methods to robustly constrain an object's morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer measured with high significance the X-ray polarization of the brightest Z-source Sco X-1, resulting in the nominal 2-8 keV energy band in a polarization degree of 1.0(0.2)% and a polarization angle of 8(6){\deg} at 90% of confidence level. This observation was strictly simultaneous with observations performed by NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT, which allowed for a precise characterization of its broad-band spectrum from soft to hard X-rays. The source has been observed mainly in its soft state, with short periods of flaring. We also observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations. From a spectro-polarimetric analysis, we associate a polarization to the accretion disk at <3.2% at 90% of confidence level, compatible with expectations for an electron-scattering dominated optically thick atmosphere at the Sco X-1 inclination of 44{\deg}; for the higher-energy Comptonized component, we obtain a polarization of 1.3(0.4)%, in agreement with expectations for a slab of Thomson optical depth of ~7 and an electron temperature of ~3 keV. A polarization rotation with respect to previous observations by OSO-8 and PolarLight, and also with respect to the radio-jet position angle, is observed. This result may indicate a variation of the polarization with the source state that can be related to relativistic precession or to a change in the corona geometry with the accretion flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Super Soft X-ray Sources (SSS) are white dwarf (WD) binaries that radiate almost entirely below $\sim$1~keV. Their X-ray spectra are often complex when viewed with the X-ray grating spectrometers, where numerous emission and absorption features are intermingled and hard to separate. The absorption features are mostly from the WD atmosphere, for which radiative transfer models have been constructed. The emission features are from the corona surrounding the WD atmosphere, in which incident emission from the WD surface is reprocessed. Modeling the corona requires different solvers and assumptions for the radiative transfer, which is yet to be achieved. We chose CAL87, a SSS in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which exhibits emission-dominated spectra from the corona as the WD atmosphere emission is assumed to be completely blocked by the accretion disk. We constructed a radiative transfer model for the corona using the two radiative transfer codes; xstar for a one-dimensional two-stream solver and MONACO for a three-dimensional Monte Carlo solver. We identified their differences and limitations in comparison to the spectra taken with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard the XMM-Newton satellite. We finally obtained a sufficiently good spectral model of CAL87 based on the radiative transfer of the corona plus an additional collisionally ionized plasma. In the coming X-ray microcalorimeter era, it will be required to interpret spectra based on radiative transfer in a wider range of sources than what is presented here.

 - **Abstract**
 Purpose: The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope is China's first X-ray astronomy satellite launched on June 15th, 2017, dubbed Insight-HXMT. Active and passive thermal control measures are employed to keep devices at suitable temperatures. In this paper, we analyzed the on-orbit thermal monitoring data of the first 5 years and investigated the effect of thermal deformation on the point spread function (PSF) of the telescopes. Methods: We examined the data of the on-orbit temperatures measured using 157 thermistors placed on the collimators, detectors and their support structures and compared the results with the thermal control requirements. The thermal deformation was evaluated by the relative orientation of the two star sensors installed on the main support structure. its effect was estimated with evolution of the PSF obtained with calibration scanning observations of the Crab nebula. Conclusion: The on-orbit temperatures met the thermal control requirements thus far, and the effect of thermal deformation on the PSF was negligible after the on-orbit pointing calibration.
#### Star formation history of the post-collisional Cartwheel galaxy using  Astrosat/UVIT FUV images

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained by analysing new Astrosat/UVIT far ultraviolet (FUV) image of the collisional-ring galaxy Cartwheel. The FUV emission is principally associated with the star-forming outer ring, with no UV detection from the nucleus and inner ring. A few sources are detected in the region between the inner and the outer rings, all of which lie along the spokes. The FUV fluxes from the detected sources are combined with aperture-matched multi-band photometric data from archival images to explore the post-collision star formation history of the Cartwheel. The data were corrected for extinction using Av derived from the Balmer decrement ratios and commonly used extinction curves. We find that the ring regions contain stellar populations of wide range of ages, with the bulk of the FUV emission coming from non-ionizing stars, formed over the last 20 to 150 Myr, that are ~25 times more massive than the ionizing populations. On the other hand, regions belonging to the spokes have negligible current star formation, with the age of the dominant older population systematically increasing as its distance from the outer ring increases. The presence of populations of a wide range of ages in the ring suggests that the stars formed in the wave in the past were dragged along it to the current position of the ring. We derive an average steady star formation rate, SFR=5 Msun/yr, over the past 150 Myr, with an increase to ~18 Msun/yr in the recent 10 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 There have been significant developments in the period estimation tools and methods for analysing high energy pulsars in the past few decades. However, these tools lack well-standardised methods for calculating uncertainties in period estimation and other recovered parameters for Poisson--dominated data. Error estimation is important for assigning confidence intervals to the models we study, but due to their high computational cost, errors in the pulsar periods were largely ignored in the past. Furthermore, existing literature has often employed semi-analytical techniques that lack rigorous mathematical foundations or exhibit a predominant emphasis on the analysis of white noise and time series data. We present results from our numerical and analytical study of the error distribution of the recovered parameters of high energy pulsar data using the $Z_n^2$ method. We comprehensively formalise the measure of error for the generic pulsar period with much higher reliability than some common methods. Our error estimation method becomes more reliable and robust when observing pulsars for few kilo-seconds, especially for typical pulsars with periods ranging from a few milliseconds to a few seconds. We have verified our results with observations of the \emph{Crab} pulsar, as well as a large set of simulated pulsars. Our codes are publicly available for use.
#### The shape of the electron and muon lateral distribution functions of  extensive air showers

 - **Abstract**
 The lateral density data obtained for different secondaries of an extensive air shower (EAS) from an array of detectors are usually described by some suitable lateral density functions (LDFs). Analyzing non-vertical simulated EASs generated with the CORSIKA code, it is found that the lateral and polar density distributions of electrons and muons are asymmetric in the ground plane. It means that typical expressions for symmetric lateral density functions (SLDFs) (\emph{e.g.} the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen function) are inadequate to reconstruct the lateral and polar dependencies of such asymmetric electron or muon densities accurately. In order to provide a more consistent LDF for non-vertical shower reconstruction in the ground plane, the paper considers the issue of the modification of the SLDF analytically. The asymmetry arising from additional attenuation and correction of the positional coordinates (radial and polar) of cascade particles causes a gap length between the center of concentric equidensity ellipses and the EAS core. A toy function is introduced as a basic LDF to describe the asymmetric lateral and polar density distributions of electrons or muons of EASs, thereby predicting the gap length parameter. Consequently, the desired LDF describing the asymmetric density distributions of electrons and muons of EASs has emerged. We compare results from detailed simulations with the predictions of the analytical parametrization. The LDF derived in this work is found to be well-suited to reconstruct EASs in the ground plane directly.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present the discovery and confirmation of two hot Jupiters orbiting red-giant stars, TOI-4377 b and TOI-4551 b, observed by TESS in the southern ecliptic hemisphere and later followed-up with radial-velocity (RV) observations. For TOI-4377 b we report a mass of $0.957^{+0.089}_{-0.087} \ M_\mathrm{J}$ and a inflated radius of $1.348 \pm 0.081 \ R_\mathrm{J}$ orbiting an evolved intermediate-mass star ($1.36 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, $3.52 \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$; TIC 394918211) on a period of of $4.378$ days. For TOI-4551 b we report a mass of $1.49 \pm 0.13 \ M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius that is not obviously inflated of $1.058^{+0.110}_{-0.062} \ R_\mathrm{J}$, also orbiting an evolved intermediate-mass star ($1.31 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, $3.55 \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$; TIC 204650483) on a period of $9.956$ days. We place both planets in context of known systems with hot Jupiters orbiting evolved hosts, and note that both planets follow the observed trend of the known stellar incident flux-planetary radius relation observed for these short-period giants. Additionally, we produce planetary interior models to estimate the heating efficiency with which stellar incident flux is deposited in the planet's interior, estimating values of $1.91 \pm 0.48\%$ and $2.19 \pm 0.45\%$ for TOI-4377 b and TOI-4551 b respectively. These values are in line with the known population of hot Jupiters, including hot Jupiters orbiting main sequence hosts, which suggests that the radii of our planets have reinflated in step with their parent star's brightening as they evolved into the post-main-sequence. Finally, we evaluate the potential to observe orbital decay in both systems.
#### Rethinking Thorne-Żytkow Object Formation: The Fate of X-ray Binary  LMC X-4 and Implications for Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present a start-to-end simulation aimed at studying the long-term fate of high mass X-ray binaries and whether a Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO) might ultimately be produced. We analyze results from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation that models the eventual fate of LMC X-4, a compact high mass X-ray binary system, after the primary fills its Roche lobe and engulfs the neutron star companion. We discuss the outcome of this engulfment within the standard paradigm of T\.ZO formation. The post-merger angular momentum content of the stellar core is a key ingredient, as even a small amount of rotation can break spherical symmetry and produce a centrifugally supported accretion disk. Our findings suggest the inspiraling neutron star, upon merging with the core, can accrete efficiently via a disk at high rates ($\approx 10^{-2}M_\odot/{\rm s}$), subsequently collapsing into a black hole and triggering a bright transient with a luminosity and duration typical of an ultra-long gamma-ray burst. We propose that the canonical framework for T\.ZO formation via common envelope needs to be revised, as the significant post-merger accretion feedback will unavoidably unbind the vast majority of the surrounding envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the nature of progenitors is crucial for understanding the origin and the mechanism of core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae (SNe). While several methods have been developed to derive stellar properties so far, many questions remain poorly understood. In this paper we demonstrate an observational approach to constrain progenitors of supernova remnants (SNRs) using abundances of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) in shock-heated circumstellar material (CSM). Our calculations with stellar evolution codes indicate that a total amount of these CNO elements will provide a more sensitive determination of the progenitor masses than the conventional method based on ejecta abundances. If the CNO lines (particularly those of C and N) are detected and measured their abundance ratios accurately, they can provide relatively robust constraint on the progenitor mass (and in some cases the rotation velocity) of SNRs. Since our method requires a better energy resolution and larger effective area in the soft X-ray band ($<1$~keV), XRISM launched on September 7, 2023 and next-generation microcalorimeter missions such as Athena, Lynx, LEM, and HUBS will bring a new insight into link between the progenitors and their remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galclaim software is blue designed to identify association between astrophysical transient sources and host galaxy by computing the probability of chance alignment. It is distributed as an open source Python software. It is already used to identify, confirm or reject host galaxy candidates of GRBs and to validate or invalidate transient candidates in astrophysical observations. Such tools are also very useful to characterise archived transient candidates in large sky survey telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Methane (CH4) is a primarily biogenic greenhouse gas. As such, it represents an essential biosignature to search for life on exoplanets. Atmospheric CH4 abundance on Earth-like inhabited exoplanets is likely controlled by marine biogenic production and atmospheric photochemical consumption. Such interactions have been previously examined for the case of the early Earth where primitive marine ecosystems supplied CH4 to the atmosphere, showing that the atmospheric CH4 response to biogenic CH4 flux variations is nonlinear, a critical property when assessing CH4 reliability as a biosignature. However, the contributions of atmospheric photochemistry, metabolic reactions, or solar irradiance to this nonlinear response are not well understood. Using an atmospheric photochemical model and a marine microbial ecosystem model, we show that production of hydroxyl radicals from water vapor photodissociation is a critical factor controlling the atmospheric CH4 abundance. Consequently, atmospheric CH4 partial pressure (pCH4) on inhabited Earth-like exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars (F-, G-, and K-type stars) would be controlled primarily by stellar irradiance. Specifically, irradiance at wavelengths of approximately 200-210 nm is a major controlling factor for atmospheric pCH4 when the carbon dioxide partial pressure is sufficiently high to absorb most stellar irradiance at 170-200 nm. Finally, we also demonstrated that inhabited exoplanets orbiting near the outer edge of K-type stars' habitable zones are better suited for atmospheric pCH4 buildup. Such properties will valuably support future detection of life signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the problem of reconstruction of high-energy cosmic rays mass composition from the experimental data of extensive air showers. We develop several machine learning methods for the reconstruction of energy spectra of separate primary nuclei at energies 1-100 PeV, using the public data and Monte-Carlo simulations of the KASCADE experiment from the KCDC platform. We estimate the uncertainties of our methods, including the unfolding procedure, and show that the overall accuracy exceeds that of the method used in the original studies of the KASCADE experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 The warm inflationary scenario is investigated in the context of affine gravity formalism. A general framework is provided for studying different single-field potentials. Using the sphaleron mechanism we explain the continuous dissipation of the inflaton field into radiation, leading to the $\Gamma=\Gamma_0 T^3$ dissipation coefficient. The treatment is performed in the weak and strong dissipation limits. We consider the quartic potential as a case study to provide a detailed study. Moreover, in this study, we discuss various constraints on inflationary models in general. We compare the theoretical results of the quartic potential model within warm inflation with the observational constraints from Planck $2018$ and BICEP/Keck 2018, as presented by the tensor-to-scalar ratio, spectral index and the perturbation spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We fit a dynamical model to Kepler systems that contain four or more transiting planets using the analytic method AnalyticLC, and obtain physical and orbital parameters for 101 planets in 23 systems, of which 95 are of mass significance better than 3 sigma, and 46 are without previously reported mass constraints nor upper limits. In addition, we compile a list of 71 KOIs that display significant Impact Parameter Variations (TbVs), complementing our previously published work on two- and three-transiting planet systems. Together, these works include the detection of significant TbV signals of 130 planets, which is, to our knowledge, the largest catalog of this type to date. The results indicate that the typical detectable TbV rate in the Kepler population is of order 10^{-2} yr^{-1}, and that rapid TbV rates (>~0.05 yr^{-1}) are observed only in systems that contain a transiting planet of an orbital period less than ~20 days. The observed TbV rates are only weakly correlated with orbital period within Kepler's <~100 days-period planets. If this extends to longer periods, it implies a limit on the utility of the transit technique for long-period planets. The TbVs we find may not be detectable in direct impact parameter measurements but rather are inferred from the full dynamics of the system, encoded in all types of transit variations. Finally, we find evidence that the mutual inclinations distribution is qualitatively consistent with the previously suggested AMD (angular momentum deficit) model using an independent approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimation of planetary orbital and physical parameters from light-curve data relies heavily on the accurate interpretation of Transit Timing Variations (TTV) measurements. In this letter, we review the process of TTV measurement and compare two fitting paradigms - one that relies on making transit-by-transit timing estimates and then fitting a TTV model to the observed timings and one that relies on fitting a global flux model to the entire light-curve data simultaneously. The latter method is achieved either by solving for the underlying planetary motion (often referred to as "photodynamics"), or by using an approximate or empirical shape of the TTV signal. We show that across a large range of the transit SNR regime, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the mid-transit time significantly deviates from a Gaussian, even if the flux errors do distribute normally. Treating the timing uncertainties as if they are distributed normally leads, in such a case, to a wrong interpretation of the TTV measurements. We illustrate these points using numerical experiments and conclude that a fitting process that relies on a global flux fitting rather than the derived TTVs, should be preferred.
#### Red Giant Rotational Inversion Kernels Need Nonlinear Surface  Corrections

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology is our only means of measuring stellar rotation in their interiors, rather than at their surfaces. Some techniques for measurements of this kind -- "rotational inversions" -- require the shapes of linear response kernels computed from reference stellar models to be representative of those in the stars they are intended to match. This is not the case in evolved stars exhibiting gravitoacoustic mixed modes: we show that the action of the asteroseismic surface term -- systematic errors in the modelling of near-surface layers -- changes the shapes of their inversion kernels. Corrections for the surface term are not ordinarily considered necessary for rotational inversions. We show how this may have caused previous estimates of red-giant envelope rotation rates from mixed-mode asteroseismic inversions to have been unintentionally contaminated by core rotation as a result, with errors comparable to the entire reported estimates. We derive a mitigation procedure for this hitherto unaccounted systematic error, and demonstrate its viability and effectiveness. We recommend this mitigation be applied when revising existing rotational inversions. Finally, we discuss both the prospects for applying such mitigation to the harder problem of inversions for stellar structure (rather than rotation), as well as the broader implications of this systematic error with regards to the longstanding problem of internal angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems around solar analogs inform us about how planets form and evolve in Solar System-like environments. We report the detection and characterization of two planetary systems around the solar analogs TOI-1736 and TOI-2141 using TESS photometry data and spectroscopic data obtained with the SOPHIE instrument on the 1.93 m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP). We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of these systems to obtain the precise radial velocities (RV) and physical properties of their host stars. TOI-1736 and TOI-2141 each host a transiting sub-Neptune with radii of $2.44\pm0.18$ R$_{\oplus}$ and $3.05\pm0.23$ R$_{\oplus}$, orbital periods of $7.073088(7)$ d and $18.26157(6)$ d, and masses of $12.8\pm1.8$ M$_{\oplus}$ and $24\pm4$ M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. TOI-1736 shows long-term RV variations that are consistent with a two-planet solution plus a linear trend of $-0.177$ ms$^{-1}$d$^{-1}$. We measured an RV semi-amplitude of $201.1\pm0.7$ ms$^{-1}$ for the outer companion, TOI-1736 c, implying a projected mass of $m_{c}\sin{i}=8.09\pm0.20$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. From the GAIA DR3 astrometric excess noise, we constrained the mass of TOI-1736 c at $8.7^{+1.5}_{-0.6}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. This planet is in an orbit of $570.2\pm0.6$ d with an eccentricity of $0.362\pm0.003$ and a semi-major axis of $1.381\pm0.017$ au, where it receives a flux of $0.71\pm0.08$ times the bolometric flux incident on Earth, making it an interesting case of a supergiant planet that has settled into an eccentric orbit in the habitable zone of a solar analog. Our analysis of the mass-radius relation for the transiting sub-Neptunes shows that both TOI-1736 b and TOI-2141 b likely have an Earth-like dense rocky core and a water-rich envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are believed to be key determinants in understanding globular cluster evolution. In this paper, we present the Multi-band photometric analyses of five variables in the nearest galactic globular cluster M4, from the observations of CASE, M4 Core Project with HST for four variables (V48, V49, V51, and V55) and the data collected from T40 and C18 Telescopes of Wise Observatory for one variable (NV4). The light curves of five binaries are analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney method (WD) and their fundamental parameters have been derived. A period variation study was carried out using times of minima obtained from the literature for four binaries and the nature of the variation observed is discussed. The evolutionary state of systems is evaluated using M-R diagram, correlating with that of a few well-studied close binaries in other globular clusters. Based on the data obtained from the Gaia DR3 database, a three-dimensional Vector-Point Diagrams (VPD) was built to evaluate the cluster membership of the variables, and two out of them (V49 and NV4) were found to be not cluster members.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal orbital decay plays a vital role in the evolution of hot Jupiter systems. As of now, this was only observationally confirmed for the WASP-12 system. There are a few other candidates, including WASP-4 b, but no conclusive result could be obtained for these systems as of yet. In this study, we present an analysis of new TESS data of WASP-4 b together with archival data, taking the light-time effect (LTE), induced by the second planetary companion, into account as well. We make use of three different Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo models; a circular orbit with a constant orbital period, a circular orbit with a decaying orbit, and an elliptical orbit with apsidal precession. This analysis is repeated for four cases. The first case features no LTE correction, with the remaining three cases featuring three different timing correction approaches. Comparison of these models yields no conclusive answer to the cause of WASP-4\,b's apparent transit timing variations. A broad range of values of the orbital decay and apsidal precession parameters are possible, depending on the LTE correction. This work highlights the importance of continued photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of hot Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic string contributes to our understanding and revelation of the fundamental structure and evolutionary patterns of the universe, unifying our knowledge of the cosmos and unveiling new physical laws and phenomena. Therefore, we anticipate the detection of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) signals generated by cosmic strings in space-based detectors. We have analyzed the detection capabilities of individual space-based detectors, Lisa and Taiji, as well as the joint space-based detector network, Lisa-Taiji, for SGWB signals produced by cosmic strings, taking into account other astronomical noise sources. The results indicate that the Lisa-Taiji network exhibits superior capabilities in detecting SGWB signals generated by cosmic strings and can provide strong evidence. The Lisa-Taiji network can achieve an uncertainty estimation of $\Delta G\mu/G\mu<0.5$ for cosmic string tension $G\mu\sim4\times10^{-17}$, and can provide evidence for the presence of SGWB signals generated by cosmic strings at $G\mu\sim10^{-17}$, and strong evidence at $G\mu\sim10^{-16}$. Even in the presence of only SGWB signals, it can achieve a relative uncertainty of $\Delta G\mu/G\mu<0.5$ for cosmic string tension $G\mu<10^{-18}$, and provide strong evidence at $G\mu\sim10^{-17}$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this contribution, we briefly present the equation-of-state modelling for application to neutron stars and discuss current constraints coming from nuclear physics theory and experiments. To assess the impact of model uncertainties, we employ a nucleonic meta-modelling approach and perform a Bayesian analysis to generate posterior distributions for the equation of state with filters accounting for both our present low-density nuclear physics knowledge and high-density neutron-star physics constraints. The global structure of neutron stars thus predicted is discussed in connection with recent astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Regularized imaging spectroscopy was introduced for the construction of electron flux images at different energies from count visibilities recorded by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). In this work we seek to extend this approach to data from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board the Solar Orbiter mission. Our aims are to demonstrate the feasibility of regularized imaging spectroscopy as a method for analysis of STIX data, and also to show how such analysis can lead to insights into the physical processes affecting the nonthermal electrons responsible for the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX. STIX records imaging data in an intrinsically different manner from RHESSI. Rather than sweeping the angular frequency plane in a set of concentric circles (one circle per detector), STIX uses $30$ collimators, each corresponding to a specific angular frequency. In this paper we derive an appropriate modification of the previous computational approach for the analysis of the visibilities observed by STIX. This approach also allows for the observed count data to be placed into non-uniformly-spaced energy bins. We show that the regularized imaging spectroscopy approach is not only feasible for analysis of the visibilities observed by STIX, but also more reliable. Application of the regularized imaging spectroscopy technique to several well-observed flares reveals details of the variation of the electron flux spectrum throughout the flare sources. We conclude that the visibility-based regularized imaging spectroscopy approach is well-suited to analysis of STIX data. We also use STIX electron flux spectral images to track, for the first time, the behavior of the accelerated electrons during their path from the acceleration site in the solar corona toward the chromosphere
#### The donor star radial velocity curve in the cataclysmic variable GY Cnc  confirms white dwarf eclipse modelling mass

 - **Abstract**
 A large number of white dwarf and donor masses in cataclysmic variables have been found via modelling the primary eclipse, a method that relies on untested assumptions. Recent measurements of the mass of the white dwarf in the cataclysmic variable GY Cnc, obtained via modelling its ultraviolet spectrum, conflict with the mass obtained via modelling the eclipse light curve. Here we measure the radial velocity of the absorption lines from the donor star in GY Cnc to be $K_{\rm abs} = 280 \pm 2$ kms$^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with the prediction based on the masses derived from modelling the eclipse light curve. It is possible that the white dwarf mass derived from the ultraviolet spectrum of GY Cnc is affected by the difficulty of disentangling the white dwarf spectrum from the accretion disc spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a simultaneous observational campaign with both Swift/XRT and NuSTAR targeting the symbiotic X-ray binary IGR J16194-2810. The main goal of the campaign was to investigate the possible presence of cyclotron scattering absorption features in the broad-band spectrum of the source, and help advance our understanding of the process of neutron star formation via the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. The 1-30 keV spectrum of the source, as measured during our campaign, did not reveal the presence of any statistically significant absorption feature. The spectrum could be well described using a model comprising a thermal black-body hot component, most likely emerging from the surface of the accreting neutron star, and a power-law with no measurable cut-off energy (and affected by a modest absorption column density). Compared to previous analyses in the literature, we could rule out the presence of a colder thermal component emerging from an accretion disk, compatible with the idea that IGR J16194-2810 is a wind-fed binary (as most of the symbiotic X-ray binaries). Our results were strengthened by exploiting the archival XRT and INTEGRAL data, extending the validity of the spectral model used up to 0.3-40 keV and demonstrating that IGR J16194-2810 is unlikely to undergo significant spectral variability over time in the X-ray domain.
#### Testing Millisecond Pulsars as the Source of the Galactic Center Excess  Gamma-Ray emission

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) $\gamma$-ray emission detected with the Large Area Telescope onboard the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} has been considered as a possible sign for dark matter (DM) annihilation, but other possibilities such as the millisecond pulsar (MSP) origin have also been suggested. As a spectral fitting method, constructed based on properties of $\gamma$-ray MSPs, has been developed, we apply this method to the study of the GCE emission for the purpose of probing the MSP origin for the GCE. A number of $\sim$1660 MSPs can provide a fit to the spectrum of the GCE emission upto $\sim$10\,GeV, but the higher energy part of the spectrum requires additional emission components. We further carry out a stacking analysis of 30--500\,GeV data for relatively nearby $\gamma$-ray MSPs, and the resulting flux upper limits are still lower than those of the GCE emission. We consider the single DM annihilation channel $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ or channel $b\bar{b}$,or the combination of the two for comparison, and find they generally can provide better fits than MSPs. Combination of MSPs plus a DM channel are also tested, and MSPs plus the DM channel $b\bar{b}$ can always provide better fits. Comparing this combination case to the pure DM channel $b\bar{b}$, the MSP contribution is found to be marginally needed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a photometric variability survey of young planetary-mass objects using the New Technology Telescope in the Js and Ks bands. Surface gravity plays an important role in the atmospheric structure of brown dwarfs, as young low gravity L dwarfs have a higher variability rate than field L dwarfs. In this study, we extend variability studies to young T-type planetary-mass objects and investigate the effects of surface gravity on the variability of L and T dwarfs across a large sample. We conduct continuous monitoring for 18 objects with spectral types from L5 to T8 and detect four new variables and two variable candidates. Combining with previous variability surveys of field and young L and T objects, we find that young objects tend to be more variable than field objects within peak-to-peak variability amplitude ranges of 0.5-10 per cent and period ranges of 1.5-20 hr. For the first time, we constrain the variability rate of young T dwarfs to be 56 per cent compared to 25 per cent for field T dwarfs. Both field and young samples have higher variability rates at the L/T transition than outside the L/T transition. The differences in the variability rates between field and young samples are about 1 sigma and therefore larger sample sizes are needed to confirm and refine the results. Besides the L/T transition, young L dwarfs with strong variability tend to assemble in a narrow spectral type range of L6-L7.5. This work supports the critical role of surface gravity on the atmospheric structure from L to T spectral types.

 Models of neutron stars are considered in the case of a uniform density distribution. An algebraic equation, valid for any equation of state, is obtained. This equation allows one to find the approximate mass of a star of a given density without resorting to the integration of differential equations. The solutions presented in the paper for various equations of state, including more realistic ones, differ from the exact solutions obtained by the numerical integration of differential equations by at most ~20%

 The emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe remains a topic of profound interest and debate. In this paper, we investigate the formation and growth of the first SMBHs within the framework of Modified Gravity (MOG), where gravity exhibits increased strength. We explore how MOG, as an alternative to the standard model, may offer novel insights into the emergence of SMBHs and potentially reconcile the discrepancies observed in the accretion and growth processes. We examine the dynamics of gas and matter in this modified gravitational framework, shedding light on the unique interplay between gravity and the formation of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the silicate dust content in the disk of one of the youngest eruptive stars, V900 Mon, at the highest angular resolution probing down to the inner 10 au of said disk, and study the historical evolution of the system traced in part by a newly discovered emission clump. We performed high-angular resolution mid-infrared interferometric observations of V900 Mon with MATISSE/VLTI with a spatial coverage ranging from 38-m to 130-m baselines, and compared them to archival MIDI/VLTI data. We also mined and re-analyzed archival optical and infrared photometry of the star to study its long-term evolution since its eruption in the 1990s. We complemented our findings with integral field spectroscopy data from MUSE/VLT. The MATISSE/VLTI data suggest a radial variation of the silicate feature in the dusty disk, whereby at large spatial scales ($\geq10$ au) the protostellar disk's emission is dominated by large-sized ($\geq1\,\mu m$) silicate grains, while at smaller spatial scales and closer to the star ($\leq5$ au), silicate emission is absent suggesting self-shielding. We propose that the self-shielding may be the result of small dust grains at the base of the collimated CO outflow previously detected by ALMA. A newly discovered knot in the MUSE/VLT data, located at a projected distance approximately 27,000 au from the star, is co-aligned with the molecular gas outflow at a P.A. of $250^o$ ($\pm5^o$) consistent with the position angle and inclination of the disk. The knot is seen in emission in H$\alpha$, [N II], and the [S II] doublet and its kinematic age is about 5150 years. This ejected material could originate from a previous eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 Dimorphos' oblate shape challenges formation models. Landslides on Didymos, induced by YORP effect, probably created a debris ring from which Dimorphos would have formed. Nonetheless, ring-derived satellites typically form with a prolate lemon shape. In light of the newest Dimorphos shape model, we revisit our previous work, Madeira et al. (2023a), and conducted new 1D simulations with material deposition in an extended region from 1.0 to 1.5 Didymos radii. An instantaneous landslide leads to a fast formation of a prolate Dimorphos directly from the ring. Now, if Didymos progressively deposits mass, Dimorphos grows through low-velocity impacts with large impactor-to-target mass ratio (pyramidal regime growth). Even during rapid, day-scale depositions, Dimorphos experiences one of these impacts, while for slower depositions, the satellite formation is primarily via pyramidal impacts. This process might reshape the satellite into an oblate shape (Leleu et al., 2018) or even in a contact-binary shape, a scenario worthy of investigation that should be studied in the future with more suitable tools. Our conclusions can be applied to Dinkinesh's satellite, recently discovered by NASA's Lucy mission.

 - **Abstract**
 ANAIS is a direct dark matter detection experiment whose goal is to confirm or refute in a model independent way the positive annual modulation signal claimed by DAMA/LIBRA. Consisting of 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators, ANAIS-112 is taking data at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain since August, 2017. Results corresponding to the analysis of three years of data are compatible with the absence of modulation and incompatible with DAMA/LIBRA. However, testing this signal relies on the knowledge of the scintillation quenching factors (QF), which measure the relative efficiency for the conversion into light of the nuclear recoil energy with respect to the same energy deposited by electrons. Previous measurements of the QF in NaI(Tl) show a large dispersion. Consequently, in order to better understand the response of the ANAIS-112 detectors to nuclear recoils, a specific neutron calibration program has been developed. This program combines two different approaches: on the one hand, QF measurements were carried out in a monoenergetic neutron beam; on the other hand, the study presented here aims at the evaluation of the QF by exposing directly the ANAIS-112 crystals to neutrons from low activity $^{252}$Cf sources, placed outside the lead shielding. Comparison between these onsite neutron measurements and detailed GEANT4 simulations will be presented, confirming that this approach allows testing different QF models.

 PKS 1830$-$211 is a $\gamma$-ray emitting, high-redshift (z $= 2.507 \pm 0.002$), lensed flat-spectrum radio quasar. During the period mid-February to mid-April 2019, this source underwent a series of strong $\gamma$-ray flares that were detected by both AGILE-GRID and Fermi-LAT, reaching a maximum $\gamma$-ray flux of $F_{\rm E>100 MeV}\approx 2.3\times10^{-5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Here we report on a coordinated campaign from both on-ground (Medicina, OVRO, REM, SRT) and orbiting facilities (AGILE, Fermi, INTEGRAL, NuSTAR, Swift, Chandra), with the aim of investigating the multi-wavelength properties of PKS 1830$-$211 through nearly simultaneous observations presented here for the first time. We find a possible break in the radio spectra in different epochs above 15 GHz, and a clear maximum of the 15 GHz data approximately 110 days after the $\gamma$-ray main activity periods. The spectral energy distribution shows a very pronounced Compton dominance (> 200) which challenges the canonical one-component emission model. Therefore we propose that the cooled electrons of the first component are re-accelerated to a second component by, e.g., kink or tearing instability during the $\gamma$-ray flaring periods. We also note that PKS 1830$-$211 could be a promising candidate for future observations with both Compton satellites (e.g., e-ASTROGAM) and Cherenkov arrays (CTAO) which will help, thanks to their improved sensitivity, in extending the data availability in energy bands currently uncovered.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study on the coupling of haze and clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We developed a cloud microphysics model simulating the formation of Na2S and MgSiO3 condensates over photochemical hazes in gas giant atmospheres. We apply this model to WASP-39b, recently observed with the JWST to study how these heterogeneous components may affect the transit spectrum. We simulate both morning and evening terminators independently and average their transit spectra. While MgSiO3 formation has negligible impact on the spectrum, Na2S condensates produce gray opacities in the water band, in agreement with HST and JWST observations. Moreover, the formation of Na2S on the morning side depletes the atmosphere of its sodium content, decreasing the strength of the Na line. Combining morning and evening profiles results in a good fit of the Na observations. These nominal results assume a small Na2S/haze contact angle (5.7{\deg}). Using a larger value (61{\deg}) reduces the cloud density and opacity, but the effect on the Na profile and spectral line remains identical. In addition, the presence of haze in the upper atmosphere reproduces the UV-visible slope observed in the HST and VLT data and contributes to the opacity between the water bands at wavelengths below 2 microns. The averaged spectra are rather insensitive to the variation of eddy diffusion and haze mass flux tested in this study, though the UV-visible slope, probing the haze layer above the clouds, is affected. Finally, our disequilibrium chemistry model, including photochemistry, reproduces the SO2 and CO2 absorption features observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Young solar-type stars frequently produce superflares, serving as a unique window into the young Sun-Earth environments. Large solar flares are closely linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with filament/prominence eruptions, but its observational evidence for stellar superflares remains scarce. Here, we present a 12-day multi-wavelength campaign observation of young solar-type star EK Draconis (G1.5V, 50-120 Myr age) utilizing TESS, NICER, and Seimei telescope. The star has previously exhibited blueshifted H$\alpha$ absorptions as evidence for a filament eruption associated with a superflare. Our simultaneous optical and X-ray observations identified three superflares of $1.5\times10^{33}$ -- $1.2\times10^{34}$ erg. We report the first discovery of two prominence eruptions on a solar-type star, observed as blueshifted H$\alpha$ emissions at speed of 690 and 430 km s$^{-1}$ and masses of $1.1\times10^{19}$ and $3.2\times10^{17}$ g, respectively. The faster, massive event shows a candidate of post-flare X-ray dimming with the amplitude of up to $\sim$10 \%. Several observational aspects consistently point to the occurrence of a fast CME associated with this event. The comparative analysis of the estimated length scales of flare loops, prominences, possible dimming region, and starspots provides the overall picture of the eruptive phenomena. Furthermore, the energy partition of the observed superflares in the optical and X-ray bands is consistent with flares from the Sun, M-dwarfs, and close binaries, yielding the unified empirical relations. These discoveries provide profound implications of impact of these eruptive events on the early Venus, Earth and Mars and young exoplanets.

 Experimental 21 cm cosmology aims to detect the formation of the first stars during the cosmic dawn and the subsequent epoch of reionization by utilizing the 21 cm hydrogen line transition. While several experiments have published results that begin to constrain the shape of this signal, a definitive detection has yet to be achieved. In this paper, we investigate the influence of uncertain antenna-sky interactions on the possibility of detecting the signal. This paper aims to define the level of accuracy to which a simulated antenna beam pattern is required to agree with the actual observing beam pattern of the antenna to allow for a confident detection of the global 21 cm signal. By utilising singular value decomposition, we construct a set of antenna power patterns that incorporate minor, physically motivated variations. We take the absolute mean averaged difference between the original beam and the perturbed beam averaged over frequency ($\Delta D$) to quantifying this difference, identifying the correlation between $\Delta D$ and antenna temperature. To analyse the impact of $\Delta D$ on making a confident detection, we utilize the REACH Bayesian analysis pipeline and compare the Bayesian evidence $\log \mathcal{Z}$ and root-mean-square error for antenna beams of different $\Delta D$ values. Our calculations suggest that achieving an agreement between the original and perturbed antenna power pattern with $\Delta D$ better than -35 dB is necessary for confident detection of the global 21 cm signal. Furthermore, we discuss potential methods to achieve the required high level of accuracy within a global 21~cm experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for transient radio sources on time-scales of seconds to hours at 144 MHz using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). This search is conducted by examining short time-scale images derived from the LoTSS data. To allow imaging of LoTSS on short time-scales, a novel imaging and filtering strategy is introduced. This includes sky model source subtraction, no cleaning or primary beam correction, a simple source finder, fast filtering schemes and source catalogue matching. This new strategy is first tested by injecting simulated transients, with a range of flux densities and durations, into the data. We find the limiting sensitivity to be 113 and 6 mJy for 8 second and 1 hour transients respectively. The new imaging and filtering strategies are applied to 58 fields of the LoTSS survey, corresponding to LoTSS-DR1 (2% of the survey). One transient source is identified in the 8 second and 2 minute snapshot images. The source shows one minute duration flare in the 8 hour observation. Our method puts the most sensitive constraints on/estimates of the transient surface density at low frequencies at time-scales of seconds to hours; $<4.0\cdot 10^{-4} \; \text{deg}^{-2}$ at 1 hour at a sensitivity of 6.3 mJy; $5.7\cdot 10^{-7} \; \text{deg}^{-2}$ at 2 minutes at a sensitivity of 30 mJy; and $3.6\cdot 10^{-8} \; \text{deg}^{-2}$ at 8 seconds at a sensitivity of 113 mJy. In the future, we plan to apply the strategies presented in this paper to all LoTSS data.

 - **Abstract**
 We have witnessed different values of the Hubble constant being found in the literature in the past years. Albeit, early measurements often result in an $H_0$ much smaller than those from late-time ones, producing a statistically significant discrepancy, and giving rise to the so-called Hubble tension. The trouble with the Hubble constant is often treated as a cosmological problem. However, the Hubble constant can be a laboratory to probe cosmology and particle physics models. In our work, we will investigate if the possibility of explaining the $H_0$ trouble using non-thermal dark matter production aided by phantom-like cosmology is consistent with the Cosmic Background Radiation (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. We performed a full Monte Carlo simulation using CMB and BAO datasets keeping the cosmological parameters $\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_c h^2$, $100\theta$, $\tau_{opt}$, and $w$ as priors and concluded that a non-thermal dark matter production aided by phantom-like cosmology yields at most $H_0=70.5$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ which is consistent with some late-time measurements. However, if $H_0> 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ as many late-time observations indicate, an alternative solution to the Hubble trouble is needed. Lastly, we limited the fraction of relativistic dark matter at the matter-radiation equality to be at most 1\%.

 - **Abstract**
 The very high energy gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193 has been detected by the LHAASO and HAWC observatory beyond 100 TeV energy. It is an interesting candidate for exploring the underlying mechanisms of gamma-ray production due to the presence of supernova remnants, pulsar and molecular clouds close to it. We have considered the injection of the energetic cosmic rays from a past explosion, whose reminiscent may be SNR G011.0-00.0, which is located within the extended gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193. We explain the multi-wavelength data from the region of HESS J1809-193 with synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung emission of cosmic ray electrons and secondary gamma-ray production in interactions of cosmic ray protons with the cold protons in the local molecular clouds within a time-dependent framework including the diffusion loss of cosmic rays. The observational data has been modelled with the secondary photons produced by the time-evolved cosmic ray spectrum, assuming the age of the explosion is 4500 years.

 Aims. We aim to characterize the gas properties in the cluster outskirts ($R_{500}<r<R_{200}$) and in the detected inter-cluster filaments ($>R_{200}$) of the A3391/95 system and to compare them to predictions. Methods. We performed X-ray image and spectral analyses using the eROSITA PV data to assess the gas morphology and properties in the outskirts and the filaments in the directions of the previously detected Northern and Southern Filament of the A3391/95 system. We took particular care of the foreground. Results. In the filament-facing outskirts of A3391 and the Northern Clump, we find higher temperatures than typical cluster outskirts profiles, with a significance of $1.6-2.8\sigma$, suggesting heating due to their connections with the filaments. We confirm SB excess in the profiles of the Northern, Eastern, and Southern Filaments. From spectral analysis, we detect hot gas of ~1 keV for the Northern and Southern Filaments. The filament metallicities are below 10% solar metallicity and the $n_e$ range between 2.6 and $6.3\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The characteristic properties of the Little Southern Clump (~1.5$R_{200}$ from A3395S in the Southern Filament) suggest that it is a small galaxy group. Excluding the LSC from the analysis of the Southern Filament decreases the gas density by 30%. This shows the importance of taking into account any clumps to avoid overestimation of the gas measurement in the outskirts and filament regions. Conclusions. The $n_e$ of the filaments are consistent with the WHIM properties as predicted by cosmological simulations, but the temperatures are higher, close to the upper WHIM temperature limit. As both filaments are short and located in a denser environment, stronger gravitational heating may be responsible for this temperature enhancement. The metallicities are low, but still within the expected range from the simulations.
#### The Effects of Wind Roche-lobe Overflow on Binary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Wind Roche-Lobe Overflow (WRLOF) is a mass-transfer mechanism for stellar binaries wherein the wind acceleration zone of the donor star exceeds its Roche lobe radius, allowing material to be transferred to the accretor. WRLOF may explain characteristics observed in blue lurkers and blue stragglers, such as their fast rotation rate. While WRLOF has been implemented in rapid population synthesis codes, it has yet to be explored thoroughly in detailed binary models such as MESA, and over a wide range of initial binary configurations. We incorporate WRLOF accretion in MESA using the POSYDON infrastructure and investigate wide low-mass binaries at solar metallicity, and perform a parameter study over initial orbital period and star mass. In most of the models where we consider angular momentum transfer during accretion, the accretor is spun up to the critical rotation rate and develops a boosted wind. Balanced by boosted wind loss, the accretor only gains $\sim 2\%$ of its total mass due to wind accretion, but can maintain a near-critical rotation rate during WRLOF. Notably, the mass transfer efficiency is significantly smaller than in previous studies in which the rotation of the accretor star is ignored. We compare our results to observational data of blue lurkers in M67 and find that the WRLOF mechanism can qualitatively explain their rapid rotation speed, their location on the HR diagram and their orbital periods.
