 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging observations of planets revealed that wide-orbit ($>10$ au) giant planets exist even around subsolar-metallicity host stars and do not require metal-rich environments for their formation. A possible formation mechanism of wide-orbit giant planets in subsolar-metallicity environments is the gravitational fragmentation of massive protoplanetary discs. Here, we follow the long-term evolution of the disc for 1 Myr after its formation, which is comparable to disc lifetime, by way of a two-dimensional thin-disc hydrodynamic simulation with the metallicity of 0.1 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$. We find a giant protoplanet that survives until the end of the simulation. The protoplanet is formed by the merger of two gaseous clumps at $\sim$0.5 Myr after disc formation, and then it orbits $\sim$200 au from the host star for $\sim$0.5 Myr. The protoplanet's mass is $\sim$10 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ at birth and gradually decreases to 1 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ due to the tidal effect from the host star. The result provides the minimum mass of 1 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ for protoplanets formed by gravitational instability in a subsolar-metallicity disc. We anticipate that the mass of a protoplanet experiencing reduced mass loss thanks to the protoplanetary contraction in higher resolution simulations can increase to $\sim$10 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$. We argue that the disc gravitational fragmentation would be a promising pathway to form wide-orbit giant planets with masses of $\ge1$ ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ in subsolar-metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Lava worlds are a potential emerging population of Super-Earths that are on close-in orbits around their host stars with likely partially molten mantles. To date, few studies address the impact of magma on the observed properties of a planet. At ambient conditions magma is less dense than solid rock; however, it is also more compressible with increasing pressure. Therefore, it is unclear how large-scale magma oceans affect planet observables, such as bulk density. We update ExoPlex, a thermodynamically self-consistent planet interior software, to include anhydrous, hydrous (2.2 wt \% H_2O), and carbonated magmas (5.2 wt\% CO_2). We find that Earth-like planets with magma oceans larger than \sim 1.5 R_{\oplus} and \sim 3.2 M_{\oplus} are modestly denser than an equivalent mass solid planet. From our model, three classes of mantle structures emerge for magma ocean planets: (1) mantle magma ocean, (2) surface magma ocean, and (3) one consisting of a surface magma ocean, solid rock layer, and a basal magma ocean. The class of planets in which a basal magma ocean is present may sequester dissolved volatiles on billion-year timescales, in which a 4 M_{\oplus} mass planet can trap more than 130 times the mass of water than in Earth's present-day oceans and 1000 times the carbon in the Earth's surface and crust.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the proof-of-concept of a method to find strongly lensed quasars using their spatially-extended photometric variability through difference imaging in cadenced imaging survey data. We apply the method to Pan-STARRS, starting with an initial selection of 14 107 Gaia multiplets with quasar-like infrared colours from WISE. We identify 229 candidates showing notable spatially-extended variability during the Pan-STARRS survey period. These include 20 known lenses, alongside an additional 12 promising candidates for which we obtain long-slit spectroscopy follow-up. This process results in the confirmation of four doubly lensed quasars, four unclassified quasar pairs and one projected quasar pair. Only three are pairs of stars or quasar+star projections, the false positive rate is thereby 25%. The lenses have separations between 0.81" and 1.24" and source redshifts between z = 1.47 and z = 2.46. Three of the unclassified quasar pairs are promising dual quasars candidates with separations ranging from 6.6 to 9.3 kpc. We expect that this technique will be a particularly efficient way to select lensed variables in the upcoming Rubin-LSST, which will be crucial given the expected limitations for spectroscopic follow-up
#### Keck Near-Infrared Detections of Mab and Perdita

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first near-infrared detection of Uranus's tiny moon Mab, the presumed source of the blue and diffuse $\mu$ ring, using the NIRC2 instrument at Keck Observatory. The detection was permitted by an updated shift-and-stack procedure allowing us to integrate on Mab as it moved across the detector in 23 separate exposures taken over $\sim$2 hours, as well as the very low (0.02$^{\circ}$) phase angle at the time of observation. At this phase angle, Mab has an integrated I/F of 24 $\pm$ 3 km$^2$ at 1.6 $\mu$m and $\lesssim$37 km$^2$ at 2.1 $\mu$m. Comparing these values with Mab's visible reflectance as derived by HST reveals that Mab is spectrally blue; its (0.5 $\mu$m)/(1.6 $\mu$m) color is more consistent with Miranda's value than Puck's value. Mab is therefore more likely a $\sim$6-km radius body with a Miranda-like surface than a 12-km radius body with a Puck-like surface, in agreement with prior work based on infrared upper limits, but we caution that a Puck-like color is only ruled out at the 2$\sigma$ level. We also report the first infrared photometry of Perdita, finding an integrated I/F of 31 $\pm$ 3 km$^2$ at 1.6 $\mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, pulsational variability has been measured from nearly 70 DBVs and 500 DAVs, with only a fraction of these having been the subjects of asteroseismic analysis. One way to approach white dwarf asteroseismology is forward modeling, where one assumes an interior structure and calculates the model's periods. Many such models are calculated, in the search for the one that best matches an observed period spectrum. It is not computationaly manageable, nor necessary, to vary every possible parameter for every object. We engage in a systematic study, based on a sample of 14 hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs, chosen to be representative of the types of pulsation spectra we encounter in white dwarf asteroseismology. These white dwarfs are modeled with carbon and oxygen cores . Our goal is to draw a connection between the period spectra and what parameters they are most sensitive to. We find that the presence of longer period modes generally muddies the mass and effective temperature determinations, unless continuous sequences of l = 1 and l = 2 modes are present. All period spectra are sensitive to structure in the helium and hydrogen envelope and most to at least some fatures of the oxygen abundance profile. Such sensitivity can be achieved either by the presence of specific low radial overtone modes, or by the presence of longer period modes. Convective efficiency only matters when fitting periods greater than 800 s. The results of this study can be used to inform parameter selection and pave the way to pipeline asteroseismic fitting of white dwarfs.
#### Symbiotic star T CrB as an extreme SU UMa type dwarf nova

 - **Abstract**
 T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that exhibits quiescent and active phases between its classical nova eruptions. The statistical properties of these active phases have been poorly studied thus far. Because of that their nature remained unknown. Here we study statistical properties of the active phases and show that they are consistent with outburst and superoutbursts observed in SU UMa type dwarf novae. The recurrence time of these outbursts is consistent with theoretical predictions for similar systems. Moreover, the visual and X-ray evolution of the last active phase is consistent with a superoutburst. This suggests that T CrB is a dwarf nova with an extremely long orbital period, closely related to SU UMa dwarf novae. The similarities between the last superoutburst and the reported activity preceding the 1946 nova eruption may suggest that next classical nova eruption in T CrB could be indeed soon expected.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent NASA TESS mission has the potential to increase the available asteroseismic sample dramatically, but its precision and accuracy have yet to be confirmed. To date, NASA's Kepler mission has been considered the gold standard for asteroseismic samples, despite data only being available for a small portion of the sky. TESS's observations cover the whole sky, and previous work has identified 158,000 potential red giant oscillators. Using APOGEE, which is calibrated to the asteroseismic scale of the Kepler data, we show that seismology from TESS is calibrated to the Kepler scale to better than 5% for about 90% of red giants, and has only slight trends with mass, metallicity, and surface gravity. We therefore conclude that current TESS seismic results can already be used for galactic archaeology, and future results are likely to be highly transformational to our understanding.

 - **Abstract**
 Ahead of upcoming space missions intending to conduct observations of low-mass stars in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region it becomes imperative to simultaneously conduct atmospheric modeling from the UV to the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR). Investigations on extended spectral regions will help to improve the overall understanding of the diversity of spectral lines arising from very different atmospheric temperature regions. Here we investigate atmosphere models with a chromosphere and transition region for the M2.5V star GJ 436, which hosts a close-in Hot Neptune. The atmosphere models are guided by observed spectral features from the UV to the VIS/NIR originating in the chromosphere and transition region of GJ 436. High-resolution observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-earths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs (CARMENES) are used to obtain an appropriate model spectrum for the investigated M dwarf. We use a large set of atomic species considered in nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium conditions within our PHOENIX model computations to approximate the physics within the low-density atmospheric regions. In order to obtain an overall match for the nonsimultaneous observations, it is necessary to apply a linear combination of two model spectra, where one of them better reproduces the UV lines while the other better represents the lines from the VIS/NIR range. This is needed to adequately handle different activity states across the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 As the scale of cosmological surveys increases, so does the complexity in the analyses. This complexity can often make it difficult to derive the underlying principles, necessitating statistically rigorous testing to ensure the results of an analysis are consistent and reasonable. This is particularly important in multi-probe cosmological analyses like those used in the Dark Energy Survey and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where accurate uncertainties are vital. In this paper, we present a statistically rigorous method to test the consistency of contours produced in these analyses, and apply this method to the Pippin cosmological pipeline used for Type Ia supernova cosmology with the Dark Energy Survey. We make use of the Neyman construction, a frequentist methodology that leverages extensive simulations to calculate confidence intervals, to perform this consistency check. A true Neyman construction is too computationally expensive for supernova cosmology, so we develop a method for approximating a Neyman construction with far fewer simulations. We find that for a simulated data-set, the 68% contour reported by the Pippin pipeline and the 68% confidence region produced by our approximate Neyman construction differ by less than a percent near the input cosmology, however show more significant differences far from the input cosmology, with a maximal difference of 0.05 in $\Omega_{M}$, and 0.07 in $w$. This divergence is most impactful for analyses of cosmological tensions, but its impact is mitigated when combining supernovae with other cross-cutting cosmological probes, such as the Cosmic Microwave Background.
#### Updated directions of IceCube HESE events with the latest ice model  using DirectFit

 - **Abstract**
 The initial evidence of astrophysical neutrinos by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory stemmed from the high-energy starting events (HESE) sample: a selection of the highest-energy neutrino interactions that occurred within the detector fiducial volume. Each event was reconstructed based on our best knowledge of the ice at the time, with the latest results published in a description of the sample using 7.5 years of data. Since then, several major improvements in ice modeling have occurred using in-situ calibration data. These include a microscopic description of ice anisotropy arising from ice crystal birefringence and a more complete mapping of the ice layer undulations across the detector. The improvements feed into more accurate descriptions of individual events, and can especially affect the directional reconstruction of particle showers. Here, we apply the latest ice model in an exact manner to reconstruct IceCube's high-energy events using DirectFit. This reconstruction samples posterior distributions across parameters of interest by performing full event resimulation and photon propagation at each step. We obtain improved per-event descriptions, as well as updates on previously published source searches using the aggregated sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new maps of the Milky Way disk showing the distribution of metallicity ([Fe/H]), $\alpha$-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]), and stellar age, using a sample of 66,496 red giant stars from the final data release (DR17) of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. We measure radial and vertical gradients, quantify the distribution functions for age and metallicity, and explore chemical clock relations across the Milky Way for the low-$\alpha$ disk, high-$\alpha$ disk, and total population independently. The low-$\alpha$ disk exhibits a negative radial metallicity gradient of $-0.06 \pm 0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, which flattens with distance from the midplane. The high-$\alpha$ disk shows a flat radial gradient in metallicity and age across nearly all locations of the disk. The age and metallicity distribution functions shift from negatively skewed in the inner Galaxy to positively skewed at large radius. Significant bimodality in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane and in the [Mg/Fe]-age relation persist across the entire disk. The age estimates have typical uncertainties of $\sim0.15$ in $\log$(age) and may be subject to additional systematic errors, which impose limitations on conclusions drawn from this sample. Nevertheless, these results act as critical constraints on galactic evolution models, constraining which physical processes played a dominant role in the formation of the Milky Way disk. We discuss how radial migration predicts many of the observed trends near the solar neighborhood and in the outer disk, but an additional more dramatic evolution history, such as the multi-infall model or a merger event, is needed to explain the chemical and age bimodality elsewhere in the Galaxy.
#### \textit{Swift} Deep Galactic Plane Survey Classification of Swift  J170800$-$402551.8 as a Candidate Intermediate Polar Cataclysmic Variable

 - **Abstract**
 Here, we present the results of our multi-wavelength campaign aimed at classifying \textit{Swift} J170800$-$402551.8 as part of the \textit{Swift} Deep Galactic Plane Survey (DGPS). We utilized Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations with \textit{Swift}, \textit{NICER}, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{NuSTAR}, and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), as well as multi-wavelength archival observations from \textit{Gaia}, VPHAS, and VVV. The source displays a periodicity of 784 s in our \textit{XMM-Newton} observation. The X-ray spectrum (\textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR}) can be described by thermal bremsstrahlung radiation with a temperature of $kT$\,$\approx$\,$30$ keV. The phase-folded X-ray lightcurve displays a double-peaked, energy-dependent pulse-profile. We used \textit{Chandra} to precisely localize the source, allowing us to identify and study the multi-wavelength counterpart. Spectroscopy with SALT identified a Balmer H$\alpha$ line, and potential HeI lines, from the optical counterpart. The faintness of the counterpart ($r$\,$\approx$\,$21$ AB mag) favors a low-mass donor star. Based on these criteria, we classify \textit{Swift} J170800$-$402551.8 as a candidate intermediate polar cataclysmic variable, where the spin period of the white dwarf is 784 s.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube-Gen2 facility will extend the energy range of IceCube to ultra-high energies. The key component to detect neutrinos with energies above 10 PeV is a large array of in-ice radio detectors. In previous work, direction reconstruction algorithms using the forward-folding technique have been developed for both shallow ($\lesssim 20$ m) and deep in-ice detectors, and have also been successfully used to reconstruct cosmic rays with ARIANNA. Here, we focus on the reconstruction algorithm for the deep in-ice detector, which was recently introduced in the context of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G). We discuss the performance-critical aspects of the algorithm, as well as recent and future improvements, and apply it to study the performance of a station of the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice radio array. We obtain the angular resolution, which turns out to be strongly asymmetric, and use this to optimize the configuration of a single station.
#### $AstroSat$ view of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 340+0

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the spectral evolution along the `Z'-shaped track in the hardness-intensity diagram of Z-sources, which are a class of luminous neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, is crucial to probe accretion processes close to the neutron star. Here, we study the horizontal branch (HB) and the normal branch (NB) of the Z source GX 340+0 using $AstroSat$ data. We find that the HB and the NB appear as two different types of X-ray intensity dips, which can appear in any sequence and with various depths. Our $0.8-25$~keV spectra of dips and the hard apex can be modeled by the emissions from an accretion disk, a Comptonizing corona covering the inner disk, and the neutron star surface. We find, as the source moves onto the HB the corona is replenished and energized by the disk and a reduced amount of disk matter reaches the neutron star surface. We also conclude that quasi-periodic oscillations during HB/NB are strongly associated with the corona, and explain the evolution of strength and hard-lag of this timing feature using the estimated coronal optical depth evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful relativistic jets are one of the ubiquitous features of accreting black holes in all scales. GRS 1915+105 is a well-known fast-spinning black-hole X-ray binary with a relativistic jet, termed as a ``microquasar'', as indicated by its superluminal motion of radio emission. It exhibits persistent x-ray activity over the last 30 years, with quasi-periodic oscillations of $\sim 1-10$ Hz and 34 and 67 Hz in the x-ray band. These oscillations likely originate in the inner accretion disk, but other origins have been considered. Radio observations found variable light curves with quasi-periodic flares or oscillations with periods of $\sim 20-50$ minutes. Here we report two instances of $\sim$5 Hz transient periodic oscillation features from the source detected in the 1.05-1.45 GHz radio band that occurred in January 2021 and June 2022, respectively. Circular polarization was also observed during the oscillation phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive numerical experiments on the long-term dynamics of planetesimals near the orbits of planets around single stars with debris disks have been carried out. The radial sizes of planetesimal clusters and the planetary chaotic zone as a function of mass parameter $\mu$ (planet-star mass ratio) have been determined numerically with a high accuracy separately for the outer and inner parts of the chaotic zone. The results obtained have been analyzed and interpreted in light of existing analytical theories (based on the planet-planetesimal mean motion resonance overlap criterion) and in comparison with previous numerical experiment approaches to the problem. We show and explain how the stepwise dependence of the chaotic zone sizes on $\mu$ is determined by the marginal resonances.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect the radio emission from air showers triggered by ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere. GRANDProto300 is its pathfinder array, of which the first 100 detection units have already been produced. A custom data acquisition (DAQ) board receives, processes, and transmits radio signals. We report on the board design, and on the functions and performance tests applied to it. Function tests are of signal acquisition and transmission, and of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) filter algorithm. Performance tests are of the analog-to-digital conversion and GPS time accuracy. We developed an efficient system to automate the test, in line with the mass-production scale needed to build future, larger versions of GRAND.
#### Initial radiometric calibration of the High-Resolution EUV Imager  ($\textrm{HRI}_\textrm{EUV}$) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)  instrument onboard Solar Orbiter

 - **Abstract**
 The $\textrm{HRI}_\textrm{EUV}$ telescope was calibrated on ground at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany's national metrology institute, using the Metrology Light Source (MLS) synchrotron in April 2017 during the calibration campaign of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument onboard the Solar Orbiter mission. We use the pre-flight end-to-end calibration and component-level (mirror multilayer coatings, filters, detector) characterization results to establish the beginning-of-life performance of the $\textrm{HRI}_\textrm{EUV}$ telescope which shall serve as a reference for radiometric analysis and monitoring of the telescope in-flight degradation. Calibration activities at component level and end-to-end calibration of the instrument were performed at PTB/MLS synchrotron light source (Berlin, Germany) and the SOLEIL synchrotron. Each component optical property is measured and compared to its semi-empirical model. This pre-flight characterization is used to estimate the parameters of the semi-empirical models. The end-to-end response is measured and validated by comparison with calibration measurements, as well as with its main design performance requirements. The telescope spectral response semi-empirical model is validated by the pre-flight end-to-end ground calibration of the instrument. It is found that $\textrm{HRI}_\textrm{EUV}$ is a highly efficient solar EUV telescope with a peak efficiency superior to 1 e$^-$.ph$^{-1}$), low detector noise ($\approx$ 3 e- rms), low dark current at operating temperature, and a pixel saturation above 120 ke- in low-gain or combined image mode. The ground calibration also confirms a well-modeled spectral selectivity and rejection, and low stray light. The EUI instrument achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of signal-to-noise and image spatial resolution.

 We study breaking properties of a solid neutron star crust. We consider the case in which the crust at any fixed density consists of two types ions, forming a strongly ordered Coulomb crystal. It is shown that the breaking stress of a such matter noticeably depends on ionic composition, and it is typically larger than for a one-component crystal. The difference may reach a factor of several.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological bounds on neutrinos and additional hypothetical light thermal relics, such as QCD axions, are currently among the most restrictive ones. These limits mainly rely on Cosmic Microwave Background temperature anisotropies. Nonetheless, one of the largest cosmological signatures of thermal relics is that on gravitational lensing, due to their free streaming behavior before their non-relativistic period. We investigate late time only hot relic mass constraints, primarily based on recently released lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, both alone and in combination with lensing data from the Planck Satellite. Additionally, we consider other local probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements, shear-shear, galaxy-galaxy, and galaxy-shear correlation functions from the Dark Energy Survey, and distance moduli measurements from Type Ia Supernovae. The tightest bounds we find are $\sum m_\nu<0.43$ eV and $m_a<1.1$ eV, both at $95\%$ CL. Interestingly, these limits are still much stronger than those found on e.g. laboratory neutrino mass searches, reassessing the robustness of the extraction of thermal relic properties via cosmological observations. In addition, when considering lensing-only data, the significance of the Hubble constant tension is considerably reduced, while the clustering parameter $\sigma_8$ controversy is completely absent.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) reported observation of photons with energies above 10~TeV from gamma ray burst GRB221009A. A suggestion was proposed that this result may contradict with our knowledge of special relativity~(SR) and the standard model~(SM), according to which photons of about 10~TeV from such a distant object should be severely suppressed because of the absorption by extragalactic background light. As a result, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to solve this potential puzzle, including Lorentz invariance violation~(LIV). In this work, we perform a detailed numerical calculation and show the feasibility to constrain LIV of photons from the LHAASO observation of GRB221009A quantitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of radio pulsars is observed to demonstrate certain polarization properties not explained by the conventional picture of pulsar polarization, namely frequency evolution of polarization, deviations of the linear polarization angle from a curve of geometric origins and the presence of features in the circular polarization. We present the partial-coherence model as a way to explain the co-occurrence of these features and to provide an origin for circular polarization in radio pulsar profiles. We describe the mathematics of the model and demonstrate how it can explain these observed features, both on a population level and for the idiosyncrasies of individual pulsars. The partial coherence model can account for complex polarization behaviour, enabling improved access to information about pulsar geometries. We discuss the scientific implications of this for our understanding of pulsar radio emission and propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-0825. This event was identified as a planetary candidate by preliminary modeling. We find that significant residuals from the best-fit static binary-lens model exist and a xallarap effect can fit the residuals very well and significantly improves $\chi^2$ values. On the other hand, by including the xallarap effect in our models, we find that binary-lens parameters like mass-ratio, $q$, and separation, $s$, cannot be constrained well. However, we also find that the parameters for the source system like the orbital period and semi major axis are consistent between all the models we analyzed. We therefore constrain the properties of the source system better than the properties of the lens system. The source system comprises a G-type main-sequence star orbited by a brown dwarf with a period of $P\sim5$ days. This analysis is the first to demonstrate that the xallarap effect does affect binary-lens parameters in planetary events. It would not be common for the presence or absence of the xallarap effect to affect lens parameters in events with long orbital periods of the source system or events with transits to caustics, but in other cases, such as this event, the xallarap effect can affect binary-lens parameters.
#### The ubiquity of carbon dredge-up in hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs as  revealed by GALEX

 - **Abstract**
 The convective dredge-up of carbon from the interiors of hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs has long been invoked to explain the presence of carbon absorption features in the spectra of cool DQ stars ($T_{\rm eff} < 10{,}000\,{\rm K}$). It has been hypothesized that this transport process is not limited to DQ white dwarfs and also operates, albeit less efficiently, in non-DQ hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs within the same temperature range. This non-DQ population is predominantly composed of DC white dwarfs, which exhibit featureless optical spectra. However, no direct observational evidence of ubiquitous carbon pollution in DC stars has thus far been uncovered. In this Letter, we analyze data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) to reveal the photometric signature of ultraviolet carbon lines in most DC white dwarfs in the $8500\,{\rm K} \leq T_{\rm eff} \leq 10{,}500\,{\rm K}$ temperature range. Our results show that the vast majority of hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs experience carbon dredge-up at some point in their evolution.
#### Can Cold Jupiters Sculpt the Edge-of-the-Multis?

 - **Abstract**
 Compact systems of multiple close-in super-Earths/sub-Neptunes ("compact multis") are a ubiquitous outcome of planet formation. It was recently discovered that the outer edges of compact multis are located at smaller orbital periods than expected from geometric and detection biases alone, suggesting some truncation or transition in the outer architectures. Here we test whether this "edge-of-the-multis" might be explained in any part by distant giant planets in the outer regions ($\gtrsim 1$ AU) of the systems. We investigate the dynamical stability of observed compact multis in the presence of hypothetical giant ($\gtrsim 0.5 \ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$) perturbing planets. We identify what parameters would be required for hypothetical perturbing planets if they were responsible for dynamically sculpting the outer edges of compact multis. "Edge-sculpting" perturbers are generally in the range $P\sim100-500$ days for the average compact multi, with most between $P\sim200-300$ days. Given the relatively close separation, we explore the detectability of the hypothetical edge-sculpting perturbing planets, finding that they would be readily detectable in transit and radial velocity data. We compare to observational constraints and find it unlikely that dynamical sculpting from distant giant planets contributes significantly to the edge-of-the-multis. However, this conclusion could be strengthened in future work by a more thorough analysis of the detection yields of the perturbing planets.
#### Flow of gas detected from beyond the filaments to protostellar scales in  Barnard 5

 - **Abstract**
 Infall of gas from outside natal cores has proven to feed protostars after the main accretion phase (Class 0). This changes our view of star formation to a picture that includes asymmetric accretion (streamers), and a larger role of the environment. However, the connection between streamers and the filaments that prevail in star-forming regions is unknown. We investigate the flow of material toward the filaments within Barnard 5 (B5) and the infall from the envelope to the protostellar disk of the embedded protostar B5-IRS1. Our goal is to follow the flow of material from the larger, dense core scale, to the protostellar disk scale. We present new HC$_3$N line data from the NOEMA and 30m telescopes covering the coherence zone of B5, together with ALMA H$_2$CO and C$^{18}$O maps toward the protostellar envelope. We fit multiple Gaussian components to the lines so as to decompose their individual physical components. We investigate the HC$_3$N velocity gradients to determine the direction of chemically-fresh gas flow. At envelope scales, we use a clustering algorithm to disentangle the different kinematic components within H$_2$CO emission. At dense core scales, HC$_3$N traces the infall from the B5 region toward the filaments. HC$_3$N velocity gradients are consistent with accretion toward the filament spines plus flow along them. We found a $\sim2800$ au streamer in H$_2$CO emission which is blueshifted with respect to the protostar and deposits gas at outer disk scales. The strongest velocity gradients at large scales curve toward the position of the streamer at small scales, suggesting a connection between both flows. Our analysis suggests that the gas can flow from the dense core to the protostar. This implies that the mass available for a protostar is not limited to its envelope, and can receiving chemically-unprocessed gas after the main accretion phase.
#### The Magellanic Puzzle: origin of the periphery

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we analyse the metallicity structure of the Magellanic Clouds using parameters derived from the Gaia DR3 low-resolution XP spectra, astrometry and photometry. We find that the qualitative behavior of the radial metallicity gradients in the LMC and SMC are quite similar, with both of them having a metallicity plateau at intermediate radii and a second at larger radii. The LMC has a first metallicity plateau at [Fe/H]$\approx$-0.8 for 3$-$7\degr, while the SMC has one at [Fe/H]$\approx$-1.1 at 3$-$5\degr. The outer LMC periphery has a fairly constant metallicity of [Fe/H]$\approx$-1.0 (10$-$18\degr), while the outer SMC periphery has a value of [Fe/H]$\approx$-1.3 (6$-$10\degr). The sharp drop in metallicity in the LMC at $\sim$8\dgr and the marked difference in age distributions in these two regions suggests that there were two important evolutionary phases in the LMC. In addition, we find that the Magellanic periphery substructures, likely Magellanic debris, are mostly dominated by LMC material stripped off in old interactions with the SMC. This presents a new picture in contrast with the popular belief that the debris around the Clouds had been mostly stripped off from the SMC due to having a lower mass. We perform a detailed analysis for each known substructure and identify its potential origin based on metallicities and motions with respect to each galaxy.
