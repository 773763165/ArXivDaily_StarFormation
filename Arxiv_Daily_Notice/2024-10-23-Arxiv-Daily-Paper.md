#### Title:
          An automated occultation network for gravitational mapping of the trans-neptunian solar system

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of an array of O(100) small fixed telescopes, aligned along a meridian and automated to measure millions of occultations of Gaia stars by minor planets, to constrain gravitational signatures from a "Planet X" mass in the outer solar system. The accuracy of center-of-mass tracking for the occulters is limited by photon noise, uncertainties in asteroid shapes, and Gaia's astrometry of the occulted stars. Using both parametric calculations and survey simulations, we assess the total information obtainable from occultation measurements of main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We find that MBAs are the optimal target population due to their higher occultation rates and abundance of objects above LSST detection thresholds. A 10-year survey of occultations by MBAs and Trojans using an array of 200 40 cm telescopes at 5 km separation would achieve $5\sigma$ sensitivity to the gravitational tidal field of a $5M_\oplus$ Planet X at 800 AU for $>90\%$ of potential sky locations. This configuration corresponds to an initial cost of $\approx $15 million. While the occultation survey's sensitivity to tidal forces improves rapidly with increasing number of telescopes, sensitivity to a Planet X becomes limited by degeneracy with the uncertain masses of large moonless TNOs. The 200-telescope survey would additionally detect $\approx $1800 TNO occultations, providing detailed shape, size, and albedo information. The survey would also measure the Yarkovski effect on many individual MBAs, measure the masses of many asteroids involved in mutual gravitational deflections, and enable better searches for primordial black holes and departures from General Relativity.

          On priors and scale cuts in EFT-based full-shape analyses

 - **Abstract**
 Parameter estimation from galaxy survey data from the full-shape method depends on scale cuts and priors on EFT parameters. The effects of priors, including the so-called "prior volume" phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to the priors used by D'Amico et al. (2019). We point out that in addition to the "prior volume" effect there is a much more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the "prior volume" effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that the analysis choices of D'Amico et al.~(2019), especially their scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\sigma_8$ by over $5\%$ (equivalent to $1\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to a negligible ($\lesssim 1\%$) bias in the recovery of cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.

          Filament Accretion and Fragmentation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Observations suggest that filaments in molecular clouds can grow by mass accretion while forming cores via fragmentation. Here we present one of the first large sample studies of filament accretion using velocity gradient measurements of star-forming filaments on the $\sim 0.05$ pc scale with NH$_3$ observations of the Perseus Molecular Cloud, primarily obtained as a part of the GBT Ammonia Survey (GAS). In this study, we find significant correlations between velocity gradient, velocity dispersion, mass per unit length, and the number of cores per unit length of the Perseus filaments. Our results suggest a scenario in which filaments not only grow through mass accretion but also form new cores continuously in the process well into the thermally supercritical regime. Such behavior is contrary to that expected from isolated filament models but consistent with how filaments form within a more realistic cloud environment, suggesting that the cloud environment plays a crucial role in shaping core formation and evolution in filaments. Furthermore, even though velocity gradients within filaments are not oriented randomly, we find no correlation between velocity gradient orientation and the filament properties we analyzed. This result suggests that gravity is unlikely the dominant mechanism imposing order on the $\sim 0.05$ pc scale for dense star-forming gas.
#### Title:
          511 keV Galactic Photons from a Dark Matter Spike
 - **Authors:** Pedro De la Torre Luque, Shyam Balaji, Malcolm Fairbairn, Filippo Sala, Joseph Silk

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We propose that a dark matter (DM) spike around the Galactic Center's (GC) supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, could account for most of the bulge's measured 511 keV line intensity while remaining cosmologically compatible. DM annihilation can be the primary source of the 511 keV line emission without violating constraints from disk emission observations and in-flight positron annihilation with the interstellar medium, provided the disk emission is dominated by an astrophysical source of low-energy positrons. We find that a DM mass up to approximately 20 MeV, either with a Gondolo-Silk spike or one softened by stellar heating, could explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission profile. Our proposal can be tested by future observations of the continuum diffuse emission close to the GC.

          A systematic analysis of star cluster disruption by tidal shocks -- II. Predicting star cluster dissolution rates from a time-series analysis of their tidal histories

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the dynamical mass loss from star clusters is thought to be caused by the time-variability of the tidal field (``tidal shocks''). Systematic studies of tidal shocks have been hampered by the fact that each tidal history is unique, implying both a reproducibility and a generalisation problem. Here we address these issues by investigating how star cluster evolution depends on the statistical properties of its tidal history. We run a large suite of direct N-body simulations of clusters with tidal histories generated from power spectra of a given slope and with different normalisations, which determine the time-scales and amplitudes of the shocks, respectively. At fixed normalisation (i.e. the same median tidal field strength), the dissolution time-scale is nearly independent of the power spectrum slope. However, the dispersion in dissolution time-scales, obtained by repeating simulations for different realisations of statistically identical tidal histories, increases with the power spectrum slope. This result means that clusters experiencing high-frequency shocks have more similar mass loss histories than clusters experiencing low-frequency shocks. The density-mass relationship of the simulated clusters follows a power-law with slope between 1.08 and 1.45, except for the lowest normalisations (for which clusters effectively evolve in a static tidal field). Our findings suggest that star cluster evolution can be described statistically from a time-series analysis of its tidal history, which is an important simplification for describing the evolution of the star cluster population during galaxy formation and evolution.

          Search for spatial coincidence between IceCube neutrinos and gamma-ray bright red dwarfs
 - **Authors:** Fathima Shifa M, Shantanu Desai
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We search for a spatial coincidence between high energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino detector and ten red dwarfs which have been observed in gamma-rays. For our analysis, we use the unbinned maximum likelihood method to look for a statistically significant excess. We do not find any such spatial association between any of the red dwarfs and Icecube-detected neutrinos. Therefore, we conclude that none of the gamma-ray bright red dwarfs contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational constraints on classical novae are heavily biased to phases near optical peak and later because of the simple fact that novae are not typically discovered until they become bright. The earliest phases of brightening, coming before discovery, are typically missed, but this is changing with the proliferation of wide-field optical monitoring systems including ZTF, ASAS-SN, and Evryscope. Here, we report on unprecedented observations of the fast nova V1674 Her beginning >10 mag below its optical peak and including high-cadence (2 min.) observations that chart a rise of ~8 mag in just 5 hours. Two clear breaks are identified as the light curve transitions first from rising slowly to rising rapidly, followed by a transition to an even faster, nearly linear rate of increasing flux with time. The depths of the observations allow us to place tight constraints on the size of the photosphere under the assumption of blackbody emission from a white dwarf emitting at its Eddington luminosity. We find that the white dwarf was unlikely to have overflowed its Roche lobe prior to the launch of a fast wind, which poses a challenge for explaining the Fermi $\gamma$-ray detections as the interaction of a fast wind with a slow-torus of gas stripped from the inflated white dwarf envelope by the companion. High-cadence observations of novae from Evryscope and the planned Argus Array can record the diversity of rising nova light curves and help resolve how the interplay between thermonuclear fusion, binary interaction, and shocks power their earliest light.

          Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA -- Uncertainty and Biases

 - **Abstract**
 The coupling of the angular jitter of the spacecraft and their sub-assemblies with the optical bench and the telescope into the interferometric length readout will be a major noise source in the LISA mission. We refer to this noise as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. It will be reduced directly by realignments, and the residual noise will then be subtracted in post-processing. The success of these mitigation strategies depends on an accurate computation of the TTL coupling coefficients. We present here a thorough analysis of the accuracy of the coefficient estimation under different jitter characteristics, angular readout noise levels, and gravitational wave sources. We analyze in which cases the estimates degrade using two estimators, the common least squares estimator and the instrumental variables estimator. Our investigations show that angular readout noise leads to a bias of the least squares estimator, depending on the TTL coupling coefficients, jitter and readout noise level, while the instrumental variable estimator is not biased. We present an equation that predicts the estimation bias of the least squares method due to angular readout noise.

          Giant branch systems: surveys and populations

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the recent discoveries of planets orbiting stars at all evolutionary stages, the evolution of planetary systems remains poorly understood. Studying planetary systems around red giant branch stars can reveal how main sequence planetary systems can change and evolve into white dwarf systems over time. Decades of radial velocity and transit surveys have yielded the detection of hundreds of planets and planet candidates orbiting evolved stars. These planetary systems have provided important insights into understanding how planetary atmospheres and orbits can be disrupted by stellar evolution, potentially being restructured at late stages, and how planets can be eventually engulfed by their stars, possibly reborn as white dwarf planetary systems. Evolved star targets will reveal planet occurrence at the largest distances and most varied environments across the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will search for biosignatures from Earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. The wavelength range for biosignatures used by the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concept studies was 200 nm to 2 microns and, as such, this is a candidate wavelength range for HWO. The visible wavelength range (500-1000 nm) provides for detection of water, oxygen, and Raleigh scattering; the near-ultraviolet is valuable for detection of ozone; and the near-infrared enables detection of carbon dioxide and methane for Earth-like atmospheres. Damiano et al. 2023 showed the significant improvement in spectral retrieval reliability when the NUV and NIR are both used with the visible. However, the challenge of the NUV, in addition to the technological and engineering challenges of starlight suppression in the NUV, is the drop in flux of host stars. In the NIR, the challenge is the geometric access to the habitable zone due to the wavelength dependency of the inner working angle limit of coronagraphs. For these reasons, exoplanet yields are lower in the NUV and NIR than in the visible (Morgan et al. 2023, Morgan et al. 2024) and some instrument parameters are more critical for improving NUV and NIR yields than others. In this paper we present a new capability for performing a large number of end-to-end yield modeling simulations to enable large, multivariate parameter sweeps. We utilize this capability to calculate the Visible, NIR, and NUV yield sensitivities to the instrument parameters: aperture diameter, coronagraph core throughput, contrast, and inner working angle (IWA). We find that parameter interactions are important in determining yield, the most important of which is the interaction between contrast and IWA, but that the strength of that interaction is different in each of the three wavebands.

 - **Abstract**
 Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the origin of energetic cosmic rays (CRs) below the "knee" of their spectrum at $\sim3$ petaelectronvolt (PeV, $10^{15}$ eV). Nevertheless, the precise location, duration, and operation of CR acceleration in young SNRs are open questions. Here, we report on multi-epoch X-ray observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a 350-year-old SNR, in the 15-50 keV band that probes the most energetic CR electrons. The observed X-ray flux decrease $(15\pm1\%)$, contrary to the expected $>$90\% decrease based on previous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations, provides unambiguous evidence for CR electron acceleration operating in Cas A. A temporal model for the radio and X-ray data accounting for electron cooling and continuous injection finds that the freshly injected electron spectrum is significantly harder (exponential cutoff power law index $q=2.15$), and its cutoff energy is much higher ($E_{cut}=36$ TeV) than the relic electron spectrum ($q=2.44\pm0.03$, $E_{cut}=4\pm1$ TeV). Both electron spectra are naturally explained by the recently developed modified nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (mNLDSA) mechanism. The CR protons producing the observed gamma rays are likely accelerated at the same location by the same mechanism as those for the injected electron. The Cas A observations and spectral modeling represent the first time radio, X-ray, gamma ray and CR spectra have been self-consistently tied to a specific acceleration mechanism -- mNLDSA -- in a young SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 The most prominent of the IRAS debris disk systems, $\alpha$ Lyrae (Vega), at a distance of 7.7 pc, has been observed by both the NIRCam and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This paper describes NIRCam coronagraphic observations which have achieved F444W contrast levels of 3$\times10^{-7}$ at 1\arcsec\ (7.7 au), 1$\times10^{-7}$ at 2\arcsec\ (15 au) and few $\times 10^{-8}$ beyond 5\arcsec\ (38 au), corresponding to masses of $<$ 3, 2 and 0.5 MJup for a system age of 700 Myr. Two F444W objects are identified in the outer MIRI debris disk, around 48 au. One of these is detected by MIRI, appears to be extended and has a spectral energy distribution similar to those of distant extragalactic sources. The second one also appears extended in the NIRCam data suggestive of an extragalactic this http URL NIRCam limits within the inner disk (1\arcsec\ --10\arcsec) correspond to a model-dependent masses of 2$\sim$3 \mj. \citet{Su2024} argue that planets larger even 0.3 MJup would disrupt the smooth disk structure seen at MIRI wavelengths. Eight additional objects are found within 60\arcsec\ of Vega, but none has astrometric properties or colors consistent with planet candidates. These observations reach a level consistent with expected Jeans Mass limits. Deeper observations achieving contrast levels $<10^{-8}$ outside of $\sim$4\arcsec\ and reaching masses below that of Saturn are possible, but may not reveal a large population of new objects.

          Long-term Dynamical Stability in the Outer Solar System. II. Detailed Secular Evolution of Four Large Regular and Resonant Trans-Neptunian Objects

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term evolution of the outer Solar System is subject to the influence of the giant planets, however, perturbations from other massive bodies located in the region imprint secular signatures, that are discernible in long-term simulations. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of the evolution of massive objects Eris, 2015 KH$_{162}$, Pluto, and 2010 EK$_{139}$ (a.k.a. Dziewanna), subject to perturbations from the giant planets and the 34 largest trans-Neptunian objects. We do this by analysing 200, 1 Gyr long simulations with identical initial conditions, but requiring the numerical integrator to take different time steps for each realization. Despite the integrator's robustness, each run's results are surprisingly different, showing the limitations of individual realizations when studying the trans-Neptunian region due to its intrinsic chaotic nature. For each object, we find orbital variables with well-defined oscillations and limits, and others with surprisingly large variances and seemingly erratic behaviors. We found that 2015 KH$_{162}$ is a non-resonant and very stable object that experiences only limited orbital excursions. Pluto is even more stable and we found a new underlying constraining mechanism for its orbit; 2010 EK$_{139}$ is not well trapped in the 7:2 mean motion resonance in the long-term and cannot be trapped simultaneously in von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai resonance; and finally, we found that at present Eris's longitude of perihelion is stationary, tightly librating around 190$^\circ$, but unexpectedly loses its confinement, drifting away after 150 Myr, suggesting a missing element in our model.

 - **Abstract**
 New line lists for four isotopologues of nickel monohydride, $^{58}$NiH, $^{60}$NiH, $^{62}$NiH, and $^{58}$NiD are presented covering the wavenumber range $<10000$ cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda > 1$ $\mu$m), $J$ up to 37.5 for transitions within and between the three lowest-lying electronic states, ${X}\,^{2}\Delta$, ${W}\,^{2}\Pi$, and ${V}\,^{2}\Sigma^{+}$. The line lists are applicable for temperatures up to 5000 K. The line lists calculations are based on a recent empirical NiH spectroscopic model [Havalyova et al. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf., 272, 107800, (2021)] which is adapted for the variational nuclear-motion code Duo. The model consists of potential energy curves, spin-orbit coupling curves, electronic angular momentum curves, spin-rotation coupling curves, $\Lambda$-doubling correction curve for $^2\Pi$ states and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) rotational correction curves. New ab initio dipole moment curves, scaled to match the experimental dipole moment of the ground state, are used to compute Einstein A coefficients. The BYOT line lists are included in the ExoMol database at this http URL.

          The Impact of Initial Composition on Massive Star Evolution and Nucleosynthesis

 - **Abstract**
 We study the sensitivity of presupernova evolution and supernova nucleosynthesis yields of massive stars to variations of the initial composition. We use the solar abundances from Lodders (2009), and compute two different initial stellar compositions: i) scaled solar abundances, and ii) the isotopic galactic chemical history model (GCH) developed by West and Heger (2013b). We run a grid of models using the KEPLER stellar evolution code, with 7 initial stellar masses, 12 initial metallicities, and two for each scaling method to explore the effects on nucleosynthesis over a metallicity range of $-4.0\leq[Z]\leq+0.3$. We find that the compositions from the GCH model better reproduce the weak \emph{s}-process peak than the scaled solar models. The model yields are then used in the OMEGA Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) code to assess this result further. We find that initial abundances used in computing stellar structure have more of an impact on GCE results than initial abundances used in the burn network, with the GCH model again being favored when compared to observations. Lastly, a machine learning algorithm was used to verify the free parameter values of the GCH model, which were previously found by West and Heger (2013b) using a stochastic fitting process. The updated model is provided as an accessible tool for further nucleosynthesis studies.

 Here we present several use cases for using Generative AI (Gen AI) to improve systems engineering and cognitive knowledge management related to the future of astronomy from a culmination of working meetings and presentations as part of the Gen AI Task Group for the NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Science and Technology Architecture Review Team (START) AI/ML Working Group. Collectively, our group mission statement is "Where is the Human-in-the-loop as Gen AI systems become more powerful and autonomous?" with an emphasis on the ethical applications of Gen AI, guided by using these systems to remove drudgery from human work while simultaneously increasing opportunities for humans to experience more collective creativity and innovation. The HWO mission stands to benefit dramatically from generative models for different data types including text, time series/spectra, and image data. These cover a wide range of applications in science and engineering for HWO, including: mission development acceleration, data analysis and interpretation, enhancing imaging capabilities, anomaly detection, predictive modeling and simulation, data augmentation for machine learning, instrument calibration and optimization, public engagement and education, and assisting in mission planning. As an example, through sensitivity analysis of simulated exoplanet population science data sets of various generative model complexity, we can reverse engineer the measurement uncertainty requirements for HWO instruments to produce data that can constrain population models and thus inform HWO design requirements. This approach to HWO design is one example of a strategy that can ensure that HWO remains AI-ready. Through presenting herein a combination of visionary ideas balanced with grounded validated use case examples, we aim to support the development of a long-term strategy to keep HWO AI-ready as it moves forward.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the fundamental-mode ($f$-mode) oscillation frequencies of nonrotating neutron stars using a phenomenological Gaussian process model for the unknown dense-matter equation of state conditioned on a suite of gravitational-wave, radio and X-ray observations. We infer the quadrupolar $f$-mode frequency preferred by the astronomical data as a function of neutron star mass, with error estimates that quantify the impact of equation of state uncertainty, and compare it to the contact frequency for inspiralling neutron-star binaries, finding that resonance with the orbital frequency can be achieved for the coalescences with the most unequal mass ratio. For an optimally configured binary neutron star merger, we estimate the gravitational waveform's tidal phasing due to $f$-mode dynamical tides as $7^{+2}_{-3}$ rad at merger. We assess prospects for distinguishing $f$-mode dynamical tides with current and future-generation gravitational-wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancies between theoretical and observed spectra, and the systematic differences between various spectroscopic parameter estimates, complicate the determination of atmospheric parameters of M-type stars. In this work, we present an empirical sample of 5105 M-type star spectra with homogeneous atmospheric parameter labels through stellar-label transfer and sample cleaning. We addressed systematic discrepancies in spectroscopic parameter estimates by adopting recent results for Gaia EDR3 stars as a reference standard. Then, we used a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise to remove unreliable samples in each subgrid of parameters. To confirm the reliability of the stellar labels, a 5-layer neural network was utilized, randomly partitioning the samples into training and testing sets. The standard deviations between the predicted and actual values in the testing set are 14 K for Teff , 0.06 dex for log g, and 0.05 dex for [M/H], respectively. In addition, we conducted an internal cross-validation to enhance validation and obtained precisions of 11 K, 0.05 dex, and 0.05 dex for Teff , log g, and [M/H], respectively. A grid of 1365 high Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) spectra and their labels, selected from the empirical sample, was utilized in the stellar parameter pipeline for M-Type stars (LASPM) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), producing an almost seamless Kiel distribution diagram for LAMOST DR10 and DR11 data. The atmospheric parameters for M-type stars from LAMOST DR11 show improved precision compared to the data from DR9, with improvements (for spectra with S/N higher than 10) from 118 to 67 K in Teff , 0.2 to 0.07 dex in log g, and 0.29 to 0.14 dex in [M/H].

 The Ly$\alpha$ forest, a series of HI absorption lines in the quasar spectra, is a powerful tool for probing the large-scale structure of the intergalactic medium. Its three-dimensional (3D) correlation and cross-correlations with quasars allow precise measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature and redshift space distortions at redshifts $z>2$. Understanding small-scale astrophysical phenomena, such as star formation and feedback, is crucial for full-shape analyses. In this study, we measure the 3D auto-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and its cross-power spectrum with halos using hydrodynamic simulations from the GADGET3-OSAKA code, which includes models for star formation and supernova feedback. Across five astrophysical models, we find significant deviations from the Fiducial model, with $5-10\,\%$ differences for wavenumbers $k>2\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in the Ly$\alpha$ auto-power spectrum. The Ly$\alpha\,\times\,$halo cross-power spectra show even larger deviations, exceeding $10\,\%$ in some cases. Using the fitting models of Arinyo-i-Prats et al. (2015) and Givans et al. (2022), we jointly fit the Ly$\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\alpha$ $\times$ halo cross-power spectra, and assess the accuracy of the estimated $f\sigma_8$ parameter by comparing it with the ground truth from the simulations, while varying the maximum wavenumber $k_\mathrm{max}$ and minimum halo mass $M_h$. Our results demonstrate that the extended model of Givans et al. (2022) is highly effective in reproducing $f\sigma_8$ at $k_\mathrm{max}\leq3.0\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $M_h>10^{10.5} M_\odot$, and remains robust against astrophysical uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The light curves and spectra of many Type I and Type II supernovae (SNe) are heavily influenced by the interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. The observed diversity shows that many progenitors have undergone some level of stripping and polluted their CSM shortly before the explosion. The presence of a binary companion and the mass transfer that can ensue offers a mechanism that can give rise to this diversity. We present a set of detailed massive evolutionary models in which the donor star, a Red Supergiant (RSG) is in a wide orbit around a main-sequence companion, and undergoes stable or unstable mass transfer in the later stages of evolution, up to the moment of core collapse. We also discuss some significant physics of these systems that may impact our results, from the presence of pulsations and extended atmospheres in RSGs, to the initial eccentricity of the orbit. The resulting SN types range from Type IIP to H-deficient IIb and H-free Ib. In models undergoing stable mass transfer, the material lost during this process is expected to form a dense CSM surrounding the system by the time of core collapse and give rise to significant interaction effects in the SN light curve and spectra. In the systems with unstable mass transfer mass transfer, the SN may occur during common-envelope evolution. In this case, the progenitor may show significant variability in the last few thousand years before core collapse, and the following SN will likely exhibit strong interaction effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the use of dust-scattering rings from GRB 221009A to measure cosmic curvature. We derive the relationship between scattering angle and time delay in non-flat universes and attempt to constrain cosmological parameters by fitting theoretical predictions to observational data. The results show that this method is limited in its effectiveness due to the small geometric scale of observations. While unable to provide significant constraints, this study introduces a novel approach to cosmological measurements using GRB scattering rings. We discuss the method's limitations and potential future applications with larger-scale observations.

          Long and short term variability of the possible nascent planetary nebula IRAS 22568+6141: A late thermal pulse?

 - **Abstract**
 IRAS 22568+6141 has been classified as a low-ionisation planetary nebula (PN) and presents non-thermal radio continuum emission, which could be a signature of nascent PNe. We present intermediate-resolution long-slit spectra obtained in 2021 and 2023, high-resolution long-slit spectra taken in 2023, and a light curve at the $r$-filter between 1953 and 2019, that reveal changes in IRAS 22568+6141 with timescales of decades and a few years. The object underwent an energetic event around 1990 that suddenly increased its brightness which has been fading since then. A comparison with a published spectrum from 1988 shows an increase of the H$\beta$ flux in 2021 by factor of $\simeq$6 and the [O III] emission lines that were absent in 1988. Between 2021 and 2023 the H$\beta$ flux decreased by a factor of $\simeq$1.7, and the [O III] emission lines almost vanished. These results and the variability observed in other emission lines indicate that IRAS 22568+6141 is recombining and cooling down between 2021 and 2023, and probably since 2005, as suggested by archival radio continuum and mid-IR observations. The intermediate- and high-resolution spectra show that the excitation of the emission lines is dominated by shocks in 2021 and 2023, and, probably, also in 1988, which may be related to the non-thermal radio continuum emission from the object. Although the variability might be due to changes in the physical conditions in the shocks or in a nova-like eruption, it accommodates better to that expected from a late thermal pulse, which is further suggested by a comparison with other similar objects. New observations and monitoring in the coming years are crucial to corroborate the origin of the variability.

 Matter falling onto black holes, {also called} accretion discs, emit intense high-energy radiation. Accretion discs during {hard to hard intermediate} spectral states also emit bipolar outflows. Radiation drag was supposed to impose the upper limit on the terminal speed. It was later shown that a radiation field around an advective accretion disc imposes no upper limit on speed, about a few hundred of Schwarzschild radius from the disc surface. We {study radiatively driven electron-proton and electron-positron jets, for gemeotrically thick and slim transonic discs} by using numerical simulation. We show that pair-dominated jets can reach ultra-relativistic speeds by radiation driving. We also discuss at what limits radiative acceleration may fail.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Transient sky astronomy is entering a new era with the advent of the SVOM mission (Space Variable Objects Monitor), which was successfully launched on the 26th of June, 2024. The primary goal of SVOM is to monitor the hard X-ray sky searching for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). On top of its on-board follow-up capabilities, SVOM will be backed by its ground segment composed of several facilities, of which the near-infrared imager CAGIRE. Mounted on the robotic telescope COLIBRI, it will be a unique instrument, able to perform fast follow-up of GRB afterglows in J and H bands, an ideal combination to catch high-redshift (z>6) and/or obscured GRBs. Aims. This paper aims at estimating the performances of CAGIRE for GRB near-infrared afterglow detection based on the characteristics of the detector and the specificities of the COLIBRI telescope. Quickly fading GRB afterglows pose challenges that should be addressed by adapting observing strategies to the capabilities of CAGIRE. Methods. We use an end-to-end image simulator to produce realistic CAGIRE images, taking into account results from the characterization of the ALFA detector used by CAGIRE. We implemented a GRB afterglow generator that simulates infrared lightcurves and spectra based on published observation of distant GRBs (z>6). Results. We retrieved the photometry of 9 GRB afterglows in various scenarios covered by CAGIRE. Catching afterglows as early as two minutes after burst allows the identification of a nIR counterpart in the brightest 4 events. When artificially redshifted even further away, these events remain detectable by CAGIRE up to z=9.6 in J band, and z=13.3 in H band, indicating the potential of CAGIRE to be a pioneer in the identification of the most distant GRBs to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sufficiently energetic to be detectable from luminosity distances up to at least seven billion parsecs (redshift $z > 1$). Probing the maximum energies and luminosities of FRBs constrains their emission mechanism and cosmological population. Here we investigate the maximum energetics of a highly active repeater, FRB 20220912A, using 1,500h of observations. We detect $130$ high-energy bursts and find a break in the burst energy distribution, with a flattening of the power-law slope at higher energy. This is consistent with the behaviour of another highly active repeater, FRB 20201124A. Furthermore, we model the rate of the highest-energy bursts and find a turnover at a characteristic spectral energy density of $E^{\textrm{char}}_{\nu} = 2.09^{+3.78}_{-1.04}\times10^{32}$ erg/Hz. This characteristic maximum energy agrees well with observations of apparently one-off FRBs, suggesting a common physical mechanism for their emission. The extreme burst energies push radiation and source models to their limit.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the localization and host galaxy of FRB 20190208A, a repeating source of fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered using CHIME/FRB. As part of the PRECISE repeater localization program on the EVN, we monitored FRB 20190208A for 65.6 hours at $\sim1.4$ GHz and detected a single burst, which led to its VLBI localization with 260 mas uncertainty (2$\sigma$). Follow-up optical observations with the MMT Observatory ($i\gtrsim 25.7$ mag (AB)) found no visible host at the FRB position. Subsequent deeper observations with the GTC, however, revealed an extremely faint galaxy ($r=27.32 \pm0.16$ mag), very likely ($99.95 \%$) associated with FRB 20190208A. Given the dispersion measure of the FRB ($\sim580$ pc cm$^{-3}$), even the most conservative redshift estimate ($z_{\mathrm{max}}\sim0.83$) implies that this is the lowest-luminosity FRB host to date ($\lesssim10^8L_{\odot}$), even less luminous than the dwarf host of FRB 20121102A. We investigate how localization precision and the depth of optical imaging affect host association, and discuss the implications of such a low-luminosity dwarf galaxy. Unlike the other repeaters with low-luminosity hosts, FRB 20190208A has a modest Faraday rotation measure of a few tens of rad m$^{-2}$, and EVN plus VLA observations reveal no associated compact persistent radio source. We also monitored FRB 20190208A for 40.4 hours over 2 years as part of the ÉCLAT repeating FRB monitoring campaign on the Nançay Radio Telescope, and detected one burst. Our results demonstrate that, in some cases, the robust association of an FRB with a host galaxy will require both high localization precision, as well as deep optical follow-up.

 In this work, we analyzed the orbits of more than 35,000 (for 2024) near-Earth objects (NEOs) for the possibility of successive approaches to all pairs of planets: Earth, Venus, and Mars in the time range from 2020 to 2120. We have selected 120 candidates for Earth-Mars, Earth-Venus, Mars-Earth, Mars-Venus, Venus-Earth, and Venus-Mars fast transfers (within 180 days); 2 candidates for double transfers (consecutive approaches with three planets); 10 candidates for multiple transfers, when an asteroid has several consecutive paired approaches to planets in a hundred years.

          The optical, UV-plateau and X-ray tidal disruption event luminosity functions reproduced from first principles

 - **Abstract**
 We reproduce the luminosity functions of the early-time peak optical luminosity, the late-time UV plateau luminosity, and the peak X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events, using an entirely first-principles theoretical approach. We do this by first fitting three free parameters of the tidal disruption event black hole mass distribution using the observed distribution of late time UV plateau luminosities, using a time-dependent relativistic accretion model. Using this black hole mass distribution we are then, with no further free parameters of the theory, able to reproduce exactly the peak X-ray luminosity distribution of the tidal disruption event population. This proves that the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events are sourced from the same accretion flows which produce the late time UV plateau. Using an empirical scaling relationship between peak optical luminosities and black hole masses, itself calibrated using the same relativistic accretion theory, we are able to reproduce the observed peak optical luminosity function, again with no additional free parameters. Implications of these results include that there is no tidal disruption event "missing energy problem", that the optical and X-ray selected tidal disruption event populations are drawn from the same black hole mass distribution, that the early time optical luminosity in tidal disruption events is somewhat simple, at least on the population level, and that future LSST observations will be able to constrain the black hole mass function at low masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Theoretical models of early accretion during the formation process of massive stars have predicted that HII regions exhibit radio variability on timescales of decades. However, large-scale searches for such temporal variations with sufficient sensitivity have not yet been carried out. Aims: We aim to identify HII regions with variable radio wavelength fluxes and to investigate the properties of the identified objects, especially those with the highest level of variability. Methods: We compared the peak flux densities of 86 ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions measured by the GLOSTAR and CORNISH surveys and identified variables that show flux variations higher than 30% over ~8 yr timespan between these surveys. Results: We found a sample of 38 variable UCHII regions, which is the largest sample identified to date. The overall occurrence of variability is 44$\pm$5%, suggesting that variation in UCHII regions is significantly more common than prediction. The variable UCHII regions are found to be younger than non-variable UCHII regions, all of them meeting the size criterion of hypercompact (HC) HII regions. We studied the 7 UCHII regions (the ``Top7'') that show the highest variability with variations > 100%. The Top7 variable UCHII regions are optically thick at 4--8 GHz and compact, suggesting they are in a very early evolutionary stage of HCHII or UCHII regions. There is a significant correlation between variability and the spectral index of the radio emission. No dependence is observed between the variations and the properties of the sources' natal clumps traced by submillimeter continuum emission from dust, although variable HII regions are found in clumps at an earlier evolutionary stage.

 - **Abstract**
 In an era marked by renewed interest in lunar exploration and the prospect of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon, innovative approaches supporting mission preparation and astronaut training are imperative. To this end, the advancements in Virtual Reality (VR) technology offer a promising avenue to simulate and optimize future human missions to the Moon. Through VR simulations, tests can be performed quickly, with different environment parameters and a human-centered perspective can be maintained throughout the experiments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework that harnesses VR simulations to replicate the challenges and opportunities of lunar exploration, aiming to enhance astronaut readiness and mission success. Multiple environments with physical and visual characteristics that reflect those found in interesting Moon regions have been modeled and integrated into simulations based on the Unity graphical engine. We exploit VR to allow the user to fully immerse in the simulations and interact with assets in the same way as in real contexts. Different scenarios have been replicated, from upcoming exploration missions where it is possible to deploy scientific payloads, collect samples, and traverse the surrounding environment, to long-term habitation in a futuristic lunar base, performing everyday activities. Moreover, our framework allows us to simulate human-robot collaboration and surveillance directly displaying sensor readings and scheduled tasks of autonomous agents which will be part of future hybrid missions, leveraging the ROS2-Unity bridge. Thus, the entire project can be summarized as a desire to define cornerstones for human-machine design and interaction, astronaut training, and learning of potential weak points in the context of future lunar missions, through targeted operations in a variety of contexts as close to reality as possible.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to study astrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requires substantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientific information from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration and analysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of procedures as well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choices are typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, an understanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offs between compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what is considered "best practice". A metric of absolute correctness is not always available and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlying principles and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for a given dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists. Our goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, and numerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With these objective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision system that is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processing interferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of the principles behind interferometry and the procedures required for data processing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches and propose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstrated and the results are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early Solar System. However, it remains unclear whether the early Solar System was highly enriched relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the Solar System possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions through two likely important SLR sources, stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae. We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar wind SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the Solar System is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more supernovae dependent isotope 60Fe we find that the Solar System is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary goal of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres is to constrain planetary bulk properties, such as their metallicity, C/O ratio, and intrinsic heat. However, there are significant uncertainties in many aspects of atmospheric physics, such as the strength of vertical mixing. Here we use PICASO and the photochem model to explore how atmospheric chemistry is influenced by planetary properties like metallicity, C/O ratio, $T_{\rm int}$, $T_{\rm eq}$, and $K_{\rm zz}$ in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We vary the $T_{\rm eq}$ of the planets between 400 K- 1600 K, across ``cold",``warm," and `hot" objects. We also explore an extensive range of $T_{\rm int}$ values between 30-500 K, representing sub-Neptunes to massive gas giants. We find that gases like CO and CO$_2$ show a drastically different dependence on $K_{\rm zz}$ and C/O for planets with cold interiors (e.g., sub-Neptunes) compared to planets with hotter interiors (e.g., Jupiter mass planets), for the same $T_{\rm eq}$. We also find that gases like CS and CS$_2$ can carry a significant portion of the S- inventory in the upper atmosphere near $T_{\rm eq}$ $\le$ 600 K, below which SO$_2$ ceases to be abundant. For solar C/O, we show that the CO/CH$_4$ ratio in the upper atmospheres of planets can become $\le$1 for planets with low $T_{\rm eq}$, but only if their interiors are cold ($T_{\rm int}$$\le$100 K). We find that photochemical haze precursor molecules in the upper atmosphere show very complex dependence on C/O, $K_{\rm zz}$, $T_{\rm eq}$, and $T_{\rm int}$ for planets with cold interiors (e.g., sub-Neptunes). We also briefly explore fully coupling PICASO and photochem to generate self-consistent radiative-convective-photochemical-equilibrium models.

 - **Abstract**
 The plasma opacity in stars depends mainly on the local state of matter (the density, temperature, and chemical composition at the point of interest), but in supernova ejecta it also depends on the expansion velocity gradient, because the Doppler effect shifts the spectral lines differently in different ejecta layers. This effect is known in the literature as the expansion opacity. The existing approaches to the inclusion of this effect, in some cases, predict different results in identical conditions. In this paper we compare the approaches of Blinnikov (1996) and Friend and Castor (1983) - Eastman and Pinto (1993) to calculating the opacity in supernova ejecta and give examples of the influence of different approximations on the model light curves of supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Concerning recent published studies exploring the presence or otherwise of a gravitational anomaly at low accelerations in wide binary stars as observed by the {\it Gaia} satellite, Cookson (2024) presents an interesting case. In that study, RMS values of binned relative internal velocities in 1D for wide binaries are compared to Newtonian predictions for that quantity, with the author concluding that the data presented show no indication of any inconsistency with Newtonian expectations. However, the comparison presented is critically flawed, as the Newtonian predictions used refer to wide binaries with mean total masses of 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This is larger than the 1.56 $M_{\odot}$ value which applies to the data used in said paper. In this short note we correct the error mentioned above and show that the data and error bars as given in Cookson (2024) are in fact inconsistent with Newtonian expectations. Contrary to the assertion by Cookson, the data presented in Cookson (2024) actually show a clear anomaly in the low acceleration gravitational regime, this being consistent with a number of independent studies yielding this same result. Based on the analysis by Cookson (2024), wide binary systems show a clear Milgromian deviation from Newtonian dynamics.

The KS4 data covers $\sim2500\,{\rm deg}^{2}$ sky area, reaching 5$\sigma$ detection limits of $\sim$22.1-22.7 AB mag in the $BVRI$ bands. Combining this with available infrared photometric data from the surveys covering the southern sky, we select the unobscured QSO candidates based on their colors and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) fitting results. The final catalog contains 72,964 unobscured QSO candidates, of which only 0.4% are previously identified as QSOs based on spectroscopic observations. Our selection method achieves an 87% recovery rate for spectroscopically confirmed bright QSOs at $z<2$ within the KS4 survey area. In addition, the number count of our candidates is comparable to that of spectroscopically confirmed QSOs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the northern sky. These demonstrate that our approach is effective in searching for unobscured QSOs in the southern sky. Future spectro-photometric surveys covering the southern sky will enable us to discern their true nature and enhance our understanding of QSO populations in the southern hemisphere.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present the pulse profile of the unique and the second brightest gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, and analyze its temporal behavior using a joint GECAM--Fermi/GBM time-resolved spectral analysis. The utilization of GECAM data is advantageous as it successfully captured significant data during the pile-up period of the Fermi/GBM. We investigate the evolution of its flux, photon fluence, photon flux, peak energy, and the corresponding hardness-intensity and hardness-flux correlations. The findings within the first 27 seconds exhibit consistent patterns reported previously, providing valuable insights for comparing observations with predictions from the synchrotron radiation model invoking an expanding shell. Beyond the initial 27 seconds, we observe a notable transition in the emitted radiation, attributed to high latitude emission (HLE), influenced by the geometric properties of the shells and the relativistic Doppler effects. By modeling the data within the framework of the large-radius internal shock model, we discuss the required parameters as well as the limitations of the model. We conclude that a more complicated synchrotron emission model is needed to fully describe the observational data of GRB 230307A.

 - **Abstract**
 The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova is a complex interplay between neutrino heating and cooling (including the effects of neutrino-driven convection), the gravitational potential, and the ram pressure of the infalling material. To analyze the post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the generalized Force Explosion Condition (FEC+), which succinctly formalizes the interplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent with realistic simulations. In this paper, we use the FEC+ to study the post-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is included through a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can significantly change the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion threshold. We systematically explore this by (i) artificially smoothing the pre-supernova density profile, and (ii) artificially varying the mixing length. In both cases, we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O interface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close to the explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O interface has a substantial effect on the critical condition for supernova explosions, contributing between 5\% and 15\%, depending on how pronounced the density contrast at the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection affects the critical condition by 25--30\%, which demonstrates that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable role in influencing shock dynamics.

          Cosmic Ray Mediated Thermal Fronts in the Warm-Hot Circumgalactic Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the 1D plane-parallel front connecting the warm ($10^4$ K) and hot ($10^6$ K) phases of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), focusing on the influence of cosmic rays (CRs) in shaping these transition layers. We find that cosmic rays dictate the thermal balance while other fluxes (thermal conduction, radiative cooling, and gas flow) adjust to compensate. We compute column density ratios for selected transition temperature ions and compare them with observational data. While most of our models fail to reproduce the observations, a few are successful, although we make no claims for their uniqueness. Some of the discrepancies may indicate challenges in capturing the profiles in cooler, photoionized regions, as has been suggested for by previous efforts to model thermal transition layers.
