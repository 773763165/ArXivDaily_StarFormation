 - **Abstract**
 A tracer sample in a gravitational potential, starting from a generic initial condition, phase-mixes towards a stationary state. This evolution is accompanied by an entropy increase, and the final state is characterized by a distribution function (DF) that depends only on integrals of motion (Jeans theorem). In terms of angle-action variables, the final state is uniform in angles (high entropy) and maximally clustered in actions (low entropy). We present a method exploring this fact to constrain a gravitational potential using a sample that is stationary in it. We estimate the entropy in the action space of trial potentials and recover the true potential by minimizing this entropy. This method avoids assuming a known DF, and may be applicable to other sets of integrals. We provide expressions for the entropy of DFs depending on energy, $f(E)$, energy and angular momentum, $f(E,L)$, or three actions, $f(\vec{J})$, and investigate the bias and fluctuations in their estimates. We show that the method correctly recovers the potential parameters for spherical and axisymmetric potentials. We also present a methodology to characterize the posterior probability distribution of the parameters with an Approximate Bayesian Computation, and indicate a pathway for application to observational data. Using $N=10^4$ tracers with $20\%$-uncertainties in the 6D coordinates, we recover the flattening parameter $q$ of an axisymmetric potential with $\sigma_q/q\sim 10\%$.

          Fragmention in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns >~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye << 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to < Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars (``collapsars''), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within <~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope (``kilonovae inside a supernova'').

 - **Abstract**
 The recent inference of sulphur dioxide (SO$_2$) in the atmosphere of the hot ($\sim$1100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high temperature exoplanet atmospheres. This is due to the low ($<$1 ppb) abundance of SO$_2$ under thermochemical equilibrium, compared to that produced from the photochemistry of H$_2$O and H$_2$S (1-10 ppm). However, the SO$_2$ inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 $\mu$m, and therefore the detection of other SO$_2$ absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO$_2$ abundance. Here we report the detection of SO$_2$ spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5 $\mu$m in the 5-12 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS). Our observations suggest an abundance of SO$_2$ of 0.5-25 ppm (1$\sigma$ range), consistent with previous findings. In addition to SO$_2$, we find broad water vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 $\mu$m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of $\sim$7.1-8.0 $\times$ solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.

          General relativistic viscous accretion flow around a gravitational wave inspired black hole

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical properties of accretion flows around Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, proposed by deforming Kerr spacetime to address the inaccuracies in the observation of gravitational waves resulting from a binary black hole merger. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types) and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly depend on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the observed high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.

          New Wolf-Rayet wind yields and nucleosynthesis of Helium stars

 - **Abstract**
 Strong metallicity-dependent winds dominate the evolution of core He-burning, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, which eject both H and He-fusion products such as 14N, 12C, 16O, 19F, 22Ne and 23Na during their evolution. The chemical enrichment from cWRs can be significant. cWR stars are also key sources for neutron production relevant for the weak s-process. We calculate stellar models of cWRs at solar metallicity for a range of initial Helium star masses (12-50M), adopting the recent hydrodynamical wind rates from Sander & Vink (2020). Stellar wind yields are provided for the entire post-main sequence evolution until core O-exhaustion. While literature has previously considered cWRs as a viable source of the radioisotope 26Al, we confirm that negligible 26Al is ejected by cWRs since it has decayed to 26Mg or proton-captured to 27Al. However, in Paper I, Higgins et al. (2023) we showed that very massive stars eject substantial quantities of 26Al, among other elements including N, Ne, and Na, already from the zero-age-main-sequence. Here, we examine the production of 19F and find that even with lower mass-loss rates than previous studies, our cWR models still eject substantial amounts of 19F. We provide central neutron densities (Nn) of a 30M cWR compared with a 32M post-VMS WR and confirm that during core He-burning, cWRs produce a significant number of neutrons for the weak s-process via the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction. Finally, we compare our cWR models with observed [Ne/He], [C/He] and [O/He] ratios of Galactic WC and WO stars.

          Rising from the Ashes: How the Milky Way Got Its Scars

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundance distribution of stars encodes the history of the gas-phase abundance in the Milky Way. Without a large, unbiased sample of highly precise stellar ages, the exact timing and nature of this history must be inferred from the abundances. In the two-dimensional plane of [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H], it is now clear that two separate populations exist -- the low-alpha and high-alpha sequences. Structure in the elemental abundance distribution can arise from many processes -- proposals include specific gas infall scenarios, radial migration, high-redshift clump formation, and various effects associated with galaxy mergers, among others. In this work, we demonstrate another possible avenue for structure formation with clear observational predictions. In this scenario, the Galaxy underwent a starburst followed by a brief (hundreds of Myr) quiescent phase -- i.e., the Galaxy underwent a post-starburst rejuvenation sequence at z~2. A natural consequence of the quiescent phase is that stars in the valley of the bimodality do not form because: (1) the absence of enrichment from high-mass stars leads to a rapid reduction in [alpha/Fe], and (2) any time the gas spends in the abundance valley is deemphasized in the present day distribution because the star formation rate is lower. With a set of idealized merger simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal. This "phoenix hypothesis" predicts a ~300 Myr gap in stellar ages at a fixed [Fe/H] and that stars which form directly after this gap would have lower [alpha/Fe] than stars which form slightly (~1 Gyr) later.

 - **Abstract**
 The WIYN 3.5m Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory hosts a suite of optical and near infrared instruments, including an extreme precision, optical spectrograph, NEID, built for exoplanet radial velocity studies. In order to achieve sub ms precision, NEID has strict requirements on survey efficiency, stellar image positioning, and guiding performance, which have exceeded the native capabilities of the telescope's original pointing and tracking system. In order to improve the operational efficiency of the telescope we have developed a novel telescope pointing system, built on a recurrent neural network, that does not rely on the usual pointing models (TPoint or other quasi physical bases). We discuss the development of this system, how the intrinsic properties of the pointing problem inform our network design, and show preliminary results from our best models. We also discuss plans for the generalization of this framework, so that it can be applied at other sites.

 - **Abstract**
 The central regions of the Milky Way constitute a unique laboratory for a wide swath of astrophysical studies, consequently the inner $\sim$400 pc has been the target of numerous large surveys at all accessible wavelengths. In this paper we present a catalog of sources at 25 and 37 $\mu$m located within all of the regions observed with the SOFIA/FORCAST instrument in the inner $\sim$200 pc of the Galaxy. The majority of the observations were obtained as part of the SOFIA Cycle 7 Galactic Center Legacy program survey, which was designed to complement the Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu$m catalog in regions saturated in the MIPS observations. Due to the wide variety of source types captured by our observations at 25 and 37 $\mu$m, we do not limit the FORCAST source catalog to unresolved point sources, or treat all sources as if they are point-like sources. The catalog includes all detectable sources in the regions, resulting in a catalog of 950 sources, including point sources, compact sources, and extended sources. We also provide the user with metrics to discriminate between the source types.

          Spectroastrometry and Reverberation Mapping (SARM) of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. The H$\beta$ Broad-line Region Structure and Black Hole Mass of Five Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a reverberation mapping (RM) campaign to spectroscopically monitor a sample of selected bright active galactic nuclei with large anticipated broad-line region (BLR) sizes adequate for spectroastrometric observations by the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We report the first results for five objects, IC 4329A, Mrk 335, Mrk 509, Mrk 1239, and PDS 456, among which Mrk 1239 and PDS 456 are for the first time spectroscopically monitored. We obtain multi-year monitoring data and perform multi-component spectral decomposition to extract the broad H$\beta$ profiles. We detect significant time lags between the H$\beta$ and continuum variations, generally obeying the previously established BLR size-luminosity relation. Velocity-resolved H$\beta$ time lags illustrate diverse, possibly evolving BLR kinematics. We further measure the H$\beta$ line widths from mean and rms spectra and the resulting virial products show good consistency among different seasons. Adopting a unity virial factor and the full width at half maximum of the broad H$\beta$ line from the mean spectrum as the measure of velocity, the obtained black hole mass averaged over seasons is $\log M_\bullet/M_\odot=8.02_{-0.14}^{+0.09}$, $6.92_{-0.12}^{+0.12}$, $8.01_{-0.25}^{+0.16}$, $7.44_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$, and $8.59_{-0.11}^{+0.07}$ for the five objects, respectively. The black hole mass estimations using other line width measures are also reported (up to the virial factors). For objects with previous RM campaigns, our mass estimates are in agreement with earlier results. In a companion paper, we will employ BLR dynamical modeling to directly infer the black hole mass and thereby determine the virial factors.

          Two-level System Loss: significant not only at Millikelvin

 - **Abstract**
 Tow-level system (TLS) loss in amorphous dielectric materials has been intensively studied at millikelvin temperatures due to its impact on superconducting qubit devices and incoherent detectors. However, the significance of TLS loss in superconducting transmission lines at liquid helium temperatures remains unclear. This study investigates TLS loss in amorphous $SiO_2$ at liquid helium temperatures (about 4 K) within a frequency range of 130-170 GHz, using niobium microstrip and coplanar waveguide resonators. Our results demonstrate notable power and temperature dependence of dielectric loss, with the dielectric loss and quasiparticle loss exchanging dominance at around 4 K. These findings are consistent with TLS models and provide crucial insights for the design of superconducting devices operating at liquid helium temperatures.

          Probing outbursts of the transient neutron star low mass X-ray binary Aql X-1 with NICER: a study of spectral evolution

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are useful to probe physical processes close to the NS and to constrain source parameters. Aql X-1 is a transient NS LMXB which frequently undergoes outbursts provides an excellent opportunity to study source properties and accretion mechanism in strong gravity regime over a wide range of accretion rates. In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral evolution of Aql X-1 using NICER observations during the source outbursts in 2019 and 2020. The NICER observations cover the complete transition of the source from its canonical hard state to soft state and back. The spectra extracted from most observations can be explained by a partially Comptonised accretion disc. We find that the system can be described by an accretion disk with an inner temperature of $\approx0.7$ keV and a Comptonising medium of thermal electrons at $\approx2$ keV, while the photon index is strongly degenerate with the covering fraction of the medium. We also find evidence of Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence emission in the spectra indicating reprocessing of the Comptonised photons. We observe an absorption column density higher than the Galactic column density for most of the observations indicating a significant local absorption. But for some of the observations in 2020 outburst, the local absorption is negligible.

          The white-light superflares from cool stars in GWAC triggers

 - **Abstract**
 M-type stars are the ones that flare most frequently, but how big their maximum flare energy can reach is still unknown. We present 163 flares from 162 individual M2 through L1-type stars that triggered the GWAC, with flare energies ranging from $10^{32.2}$ to $10^{36.4}$ erg . The flare amplitudes range from $\triangle G = 0.84$ to $\sim 10$ mag. Flare energy increases with stellar surface temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) but both $\triangle G$ and equivalent duration $\log_{10}(ED)$ seem to be independent of $T_{\rm eff}$. Combining periods detected from light curves of TESS and K2, spectra from LAMOST, SDSS and the 2.16 m Telescope, and the Gaia DR3 data, we found that these GWAC flare stars are young. For the stars that have spectra, we found that these stars are in or very near to the saturation region, and $\log_{10}(L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol})$ is lower for M7-L1 stars than for M2-M6 stars. We also studied the relation between GWAC flare bolometric energy $E_{\rm bol}$ and stellar hemispherical area $S$, and found that $\log_{10}E_{\rm bol}$ (in erg) increases with increasing $S$ (in cm$^2$), and the maximum flare energy $\log_{10}E_{\rm bol, max} \geqslant \log_{10}S + 14.25$. For M7-L1 stars, there seem to be other factors limiting their maximum flare energies in addition to stellar hemispherical area.

          TESS observations of non-Be fast rotators

 - **Abstract**
 The variability of fast-rotating Oe/Be stars has been reported in detail in recent years. However, much less known about the behaviour of fast-rotating OB stars without known decretion disks, and hence it is difficult to identify the commonalities and differences in the photometric variability of these two populations, especially with regards to their pulsational properties and their link with the presence of circumstellar material. Via an in-depth literature search, we identified a set of fast-rotating (v sin(i)>200 km/s) early B-type stars not known to have disks. TESS and Kepler light curves were built for 58 stars that appear isolated (no bright neighbour within 1 arcmin and no known companion) to avoid contamination of the light curves. Frequency spectra were calculated and then analysed to determine the noise level and the presence of significant signals above the noise. Red noise is detected in all targets, without obvious correlations between noise and stellar parameters. Long-term changes are much less frequent than in Be stars, with only 12% of our targets having the variability below 0.5/d dominating their frequency spectrum. In contrast, strong frequency groups are detected in about a third of targets, as in Be stars. These groups generally occur in pairs with harmonic frequencies, as is usually seen in Be stars, but with the first group more often displaying larger amplitudes. Finally, the most frequent variability is due to isolated frequencies in the 0.5-6./d range (which is found in two-thirds of cases and dominates the spectra in 42% of the sample). Higher-frequency signals (up to 40/d) are sometimes also detected but rarely (only 12% of stars) appear as the strongest ones of the frequency spectra. Overall, fast-rotating B-type stars, with or without disks, display similar photometric properties, except as regards their longer-term behaviour.

 - **Abstract**
 The fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) is a wide-field integral field unit (IFU) survey that uses an array of four 160 mm fixed telescopes with siderostats to minimize the number of moving parts. Individual telescope observes the science field or calibration field independently and is synchronized with the science exposure. We developed the LVM Acquisition and Guiding Package (LVMAGP) optimized telescope control software program for LVM observations, which can simultaneously control four focusers, three K-mirrors, one fiber selector, four mounts (siderostats), and seven guide cameras. This software is built on a hierarchical architecture and the SDSS framework and provides three key sequences: autofocus, field acquisition, and autoguide. We designed and fabricated a proto-model siderostat to test the telescope pointing model and LVMAGP software. The mirrors of the proto-model were designed as an isogrid open-back type, which reduced the weight by 46% and enabled reaching thermal equilibrium quickly. Additionally, deflection due to bolting torque, self-gravity, and thermal deformation was simulated, and the maximum scatter of the pointing model induced by the tilt of optomechanics was predicted to be $4'.4$, which can be compensated for by the field acquisition sequence. We performed a real sky test of LVMAGP with the proto-model siderostat and obtained field acquisition and autoguide accuracies of $0''.38$ and $1''.5$, respectively. It met all requirements except for the autoguide specification, which will be resolved by more precise alignment among the hardware components at Las Campanas Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the halo profiles outside the halo boundaries by solving for the matching profiles required by the halo model. In the halo model framework, the matter distribution in the universe can be decomposed into the spatial distribution of halos convolved with their internal structures. This leads to a set of linear equations in Fourier space which uniquely determines the optimal halo profiles for any given halo catalog. In this work, we construct three halo catalogs with different boundary definitions, and solve for the optimal profiles in each case using measurements of halo-matter and halo-halo power spectra. Our results show that for a given halo field, there is always a set of matching profiles to accurately reconstruct the input statistics of the matter field, even though it might be complex to model the profiles analytically. Comparing the solutions from different halo catalogs, we find their mass distributions inside the inner depletion radii are nearly identical, while they deviate from each other on larger scales, with a larger boundary resulting in a more extended profile. For the depletion radius based catalog, the numerical solution agrees well with the Einasto profile. Coupling the Einasto profile with the depletion catalog, the resulting halo model can simultaneously predict the halo-matter power spectra to $10\%$ and matter-matter power spectrum to $5\%$, improving over conventional models in both the interpretability and versatility.

 - **Abstract**
 NOTT (formerly Hi-5) is the L'-band (3.5-4.0~microns) nulling interferometer of Asgard, an instrument suite in preparation for the VLTI visitor focus. The primary scientific objectives of NOTT include characterizing (i) young planetary systems near the snow line, a critical region for giant planet formation, and (ii) nearby main-sequence stars close to the habitable zone, with a focus on detecting exozodiacal dust that could obscure Earth-like planets. In 2023-2024, the final warm optics have been procured and assembled in a new laboratory at KU Leuven. First fringes and null measurements were obtained using a Gallium Lanthanum Sulfide (GLS) photonic chip that was also tested at cryogenic temperatures. In this paper, we present an overall update of the NOTT project with a particular focus on the cold mechanical design, the first results in the laboratory with the final NOTT warm optics, and the ongoing Asgard integration activities. We also report on other ongoing activities such as the characterization of the photonic chip (GLS, LiNbO3, SiO), the development of the exoplanet science case, the design of the dispersion control module, and the progress with the self-calibration data reduction software.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.

 - **Abstract**
 We made use high-cadence observations from the $Insight$-HXMT and $NICER$ to scrutinize the spectral and timing evolution during the 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1820+070. It's hardness-intensity diagram (HID) displays a ''q''-like track including all the spectral states, along a unique loop in the hard state. The tracks observed in the HID is anticipated in the evolution of the components responsible for Compton and reflection emission. This is substantiated by the relationship between the X-ray luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ and photon index $\Gamma$, as well as the relationship between X-ray luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ and the ratio of Compton to disk luminosities $L_\mathrm{C}/L_\mathrm{D}$. Both of these relationships exhibit a pattern reminiscent of HID. During the hard state, the hardness (also $\Gamma$) is determined by either reflection component ($R_{f}>1$ ) or Compton component ($R_{f}<1$) depending on the value reflection fraction $R_{f}$. So the distinctive evolution of $R_{f}$ leads to the unique loop in the HID (also in the $L_\mathrm{X}$--$\Gamma$ plane) of hard state. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between frequency of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) ($\nu_{\mathrm{C,QPO}}$) and the optical depth of the Compton emission ($\tau$), and a positive correlation between $\nu_{\mathrm{C,QPO}}$ and $\Gamma$. These correlations strongly suggest a coupling between the QPO properties and the underlying process responsible for Comptonization.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate cosmological constraints on the holographic dark energy (HDE) using the state-of-the-art cosmological datasets: Planck CMB angular power spectra and weak lensing power spectra, Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) temperature power spectra, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from six-degree-field galaxy survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR12 & DR16) and the Cepheids-Supernovae measurement from SH0ES team (R22). We also examine the HDE model and $\Lambda$CDM with and without $N_{\rm eff}$ (effective number of relativistic species) being treated as a free parameter. We find that the HDE model can relieve the tensions of $H_0$ and $S_8$ to certain degrees. With ``Planck+ACT+BAO+RSD'' datasets, the constraints are $H_0 = 69.70 \pm 1.39\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8 = 0.823 \pm 0.011$ in HDE model, which brings down the Hubble tension down to $1.92\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.) and the $S_8$ tension to $1$-$2\sigma$ C.L. By adding the R22 data, their values are improved as $H_0 = 71.86 \pm 0.93 \,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8 = 0.813 \pm 0.010$, which further brings the Hubble tension down to $0.85\sigma$ C.L. and relieves the $S_{8}$ tension. We also quantify the goodness-of-fit of different models with Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and find that the HDE agrees with the observational data better than the $\Lambda$CDM and other extended models (treating $N_{\rm eff}$ as free for fitting).

 ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer has a history of record-breaking discoveries in astrophysics and significant advances in instrumentation. The next leap forward is its new visitor instrument, called Asgard. It comprises four natively collaborating instruments: HEIMDALLR, an instrument performing both fringe tracking and stellar interferometry simultaneously with the same optics, operating in the K band; Baldr, a Strehl optimizer in the H band; BIFROST, a spectroscopic combiner to study the formation processes and properties of stellar and planetary systems in the Y-J-H bands; and NOTT, a nulling interferometer dedicated to imaging nearby young planetary systems in the L band. The suite is in its integration phase in Europe and should be shipped to Paranal in 2025. In this article, we present details of the alignment and calibration unit, the observing modes, the integration plan, the software architecture, and the roadmap to completion of the project.

          Gaia DR3 asteroid reflectance spectra: L-type families, memberships, and ages

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. We want to assess the potential of Gaia spectra in identifying asteroid family members. Here, we focus on two L-type families, namely Tirela/Klumpkea and Watsonia. These families are known for their connection to Barbarian asteroids, which are potentially abundant in calcium-aluminum rich inclusions (CAIs). Our method is based (1) on a color taxonomy specifically built on Gaia data and (2) the similarity of spectra of candidate members with the template spectrum of a specific family. We identified objects in the halo of Tirela/Klumpkea, along with possible interlopers. We also found an independent group of eight asteroids erroneously linked to the family by the hierarchical clustering method (HCM). Consequently, the knowledge of the size distribution of the family has been significantly improved, with a more consistent shape at the larger end. The Watsonia family is a more intricate case, mainly due to its smaller size and the less marked difference between the spectral types of the background and of the family members. However, the spectral selection helps identify objects that were not seen by HCM, including a cluster separated from the family core by a resonance. For both families, the V-shape is better defined, leading to a revised age estimation based on the memberships established mainly from spectral properties. Our work demonstrates the advantage of combining the classical HCM approach to spectral properties obtained by Gaia for the study of asteroid families. Future data releases are expected to further expand the capabilities in this domain

          There is no disk mass budget problem of planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 The inferred dust masses from Class II protoplanetary disk observations are lower than or equal to the masses of the observed exoplanet systems. This poses the question of how planets form if their natal environments do not contain enough mass. This hypothesis has entered the literature as the "mass budget problem" of planet formation. We utilize numerical simulations of planet formation via pebble and gas accretion, including migration, in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk, while tracing the time evolution of the dust mass. As expected, we find that the presence of a giant planet in the disk can influence the evolution of the disk itself and prevent rapid dust mass loss by trapping the dust outside its orbit. Early formation is crucial for giant planet formation, as we found in our previous work; therefore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that planet formation has already occurred or is ongoing in Class II disks. Most importantly, we find that the optically thin dust mass significantly underestimates the total dust mass in the presence of a dust-trapping deep gap. We also show that the beam convolution would smear out the feature from a deep gap, especially if the planet forms in the inner disk. Such hidden dust mass, along with early planet formation, could be the answer to the hypothetical mass budget problem.

 - **Abstract**
 This work introduces an approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of 3D atmospheric simulations by integrating a machine-learned surrogate model into the OASIS global circulation model (GCM). Traditional GCMs, which are based on repeatedly numerically integrating physical equations governing atmospheric processes across a series of time-steps, are time-intensive, leading to compromises in spatial and temporal resolution of simulations. This research improves upon this limitation, enabling higher resolution simulations within practical timeframes. Speeding up 3D simulations holds significant implications in multiple domains. Firstly, it facilitates the integration of 3D models into exoplanet inference pipelines, allowing for robust characterisation of exoplanets from a previously unseen wealth of data anticipated from JWST and post-JWST instruments. Secondly, acceleration of 3D models will enable higher resolution atmospheric simulations of Earth and Solar System planets, enabling more detailed insights into their atmospheric physics and chemistry. Our method replaces the radiative transfer module in OASIS with a recurrent neural network-based model trained on simulation inputs and outputs. Radiative transfer is typically one of the slowest components of a GCM, thus providing the largest scope for overall model speed-up. The surrogate model was trained and tested on the specific test case of the Venusian atmosphere, to benchmark the utility of this approach in the case of non-terrestrial atmospheres. This approach yields promising results, with the surrogate-integrated GCM demonstrating above 99.0% accuracy and 101 factor GPU speed-up of the entire simulation compared to using the matched original GCM under Venus-like conditions.

 Asgard/NOTT is an ERC-funded project hosted at KU Leuven and is part of a new visitor instrumental suite, called Asgard, under preparation for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Leveraging nulling capabilities and the long VLTI baselines, it is optimized for high-contrast imaging of the snow line region around young nearby main-sequence stars. This will enable the characterization of the atmosphere of young giant exoplanets and warm/hot exozodiacal dust with spectroscopy in the L'-band (3.5-4.0$\mu$m). In this work, we present the first lab assembly of the instrument done at KU Leuven and the technical solutions to tackle the challenge of performing nulling in the mid-infrared despite the thermal background. The opto-mechanical design of the warm optics and the injection system for the photonic chip are described. The alignment procedure used to assemble the system is also presented. Finally, the first experimental results, including fringes and null measurements, are given and confirm the adequacy of the bench to test and optimize the Asgard/NOTT instrument.

 We report the discovery of a high velocity, very low-mass star or brown dwarf whose kinematics suggest it is unbound to the Milky Way. CWISE J124909.08+362116.0 was identified by citizen scientists in the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program as a high proper motion ($\mu$ $=$ 0''9/yr) faint red source. Moderate resolution spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES reveals it to be a metal-poor early L subdwarf with a large radial velocity ($-$103$\pm$10 km/s), and its estimated distance of 125$\pm$8 pc yields a speed of 456$\pm$27 km/s in the Galactic rest frame, near the local escape velocity for the Milky Way. We explore several potential scenarios for the origin of this source, including ejection from the Galactic center $\gtrsim$3 Gyr in the past, survival as the mass donor companion to an exploded white dwarf. acceleration through a three-body interaction with a black hole binary in a globular cluster, and accretion from a Milky Way satellite system. CWISE J1249+3621 is the first hypervelocity very low mass star or brown dwarf to be found, and the nearest of all such systems. It may represent a broader population of very high velocity, low-mass objects that have undergone extreme accelerations.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been recently discovered that a few super-Eddington sources undergoing black hole super-Eddington accretion exhibit X-ray reflection signatures. In such new systems, one expects that the coronal X-ray emissions are mainly reflected by optically thick super-Eddington winds instead of thin disks. In this paper, we conduct a series of general relativistic ray-tracing and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the X-ray reflection signatures, especially the characteristic Fe K$\alpha$ line, produced from super-Eddington accretion flows. In particular, we allow the photons emitted by a lamppost corona to be reflected multiple times in a cone-like funnel surrounded by fast winds. We find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile most sensitively depends on the wind kinematics, while its exact shape also depends on the funnel open angle and corona height. Furthermore, very interestingly, we find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line can have a prominent double-peak profile in certain parameter spaces even with a face-on orientation. Moreover, we compare the Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles produced from super-Eddington and thin disks and show that such lines can provide important insights into the understanding of black hole systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a systematic infrared (IR) census of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Milky Way, using data from the Palomar Gattini IR (PGIR) survey. R Coronae Borealis stars are dusty, erratic variable stars presumably formed from the merger of a He-core and a CO-core white dwarf (WD). PGIR is a 30 cm $J$-band telescope with a 25 deg$^{2}$ camera that surveys 18000 deg$^{2}$ of the northern sky ($\delta>-28^{o}$) at a cadence of 2 days. Using PGIR J-band lightcurves for $\sim$60 million stars together with mid-IR colors from WISE, we selected a sample of 530 candidate RCB stars. We obtained near-IR spectra for these candidates and identified 53 RCB stars in our sample. Accounting for our selection criteria, we find that there are a total of $\approx350^{+150}_{-100}$ RCB stars in the Milky Way. Assuming typical RCB lifetimes, this corresponds to an RCB formation rate of 0.8 - 5 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with observational and theoretical estimates of the He-CO WD merger rate. We searched for quasi-periodic pulsations in the PGIR lightcurves of RCB stars and present pulsation periods for 16 RCB stars. We also examined high-cadenced TESS lightcurves for RCB and the chemically similar, but dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars. We find that dLHdC stars show variations on timescales shorter than RCB stars, suggesting that they may have lower masses than RCB stars. Finally, we identified 3 new spectroscopically confirmed and 12 candidate Galactic DY Per type stars - believed to be colder cousins of RCB stars - doubling the sample of Galactic DY Per type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Scattering transforms are a new type of summary statistics recently developed for the study of highly non-Gaussian processes, which have been shown to be very promising for astrophysical studies. In particular, they allow one to build generative models of complex non-linear fields from a limited amount of data. In the context of upcoming cosmological surveys, the extension of these tools to spherical data is necessary. We develop scattering transforms on the sphere and focus on the construction of maximum-entropy generative models of astrophysical fields. The quality of the generative models, both statistically and visually, is very satisfying, which therefore open up a wide range of new applications for future cosmological studies.

          Detecting Gravitational Wave Anisotropies from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) permeating our galaxy. The origin of this background is still unknown. Indeed, while the gravitational wave emission from inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) is the primary candidate for its origin, several cosmological sources have also been proposed. One distinctive feature of SMBHB-generated backgrounds is the presence of GWB anisotropies stemming from the binaries distribution in the local Universe. However, none of the anisotropy searches performed to date reported a detection. In this work, we show that the lack of anisotropy detection is not currently in tension with a SMBHB origin of the background. We accomplish this by calculating the anisotropy detection probability of present and future PTAs. We find that a PTA with the noise characteristics of the NANOGrav 15-year data set had only a $~2\%-11\%$ probability of detecting SMBHB-generated anisotropies, depending on the properties of the SMBHB population. However, we estimate that for the IPTA DR3 data set these probabilities will increase to $~4\%-28\%$, putting more pressure on the SMBHB interpretation in case of a null detection. We also identify SMBHB populations that are more likely to produce detectable levels of anisotropies. This information could be used together with the spectral properties of the GWB to characterize the SMBHB population.

          The exact non-Gaussian weak lensing likelihood: A framework to calculate analytic likelihoods for correlation functions on masked Gaussian random fields

 - **Abstract**
 We present exact non-Gaussian joint likelihoods for auto- and cross-correlation functions on arbitrarily masked spherical Gaussian random fields. Our considerations apply to spin-0 as well as spin-2 fields but are demonstrated here for the spin-2 weak-lensing correlation function. We motivate that this likelihood cannot be Gaussian and show how it can nevertheless be calculated exactly for any mask geometry and on a curved sky, as well as jointly for different angular-separation bins and redshift-bin combinations. Splitting our calculation into a large- and small-scale part, we apply a computationally efficient approximation for the small scales that does not alter the overall non-Gaussian likelihood shape. To compare our exact likelihoods to correlation-function sampling distributions, we simulated a large number of weak-lensing maps, including shape noise, and find excellent agreement for one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional distributions. Furthermore, we compare the exact likelihood to the widely employed Gaussian likelihood and find significant levels of skewness at angular separations $\gtrsim 1^{\circ}$ such that the mode of the exact distributions is shifted away from the mean towards lower values of the correlation function. We find that the assumption of a Gaussian random field for the weak-lensing field is well valid at these angular separations. Considering the skewness of the non-Gaussian likelihood, we evaluate its impact on the posterior constraints on $S_8$. On a simplified weak-lensing-survey setup with an area of $10 \ 000 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$, we find that the posterior mean of $S_8$ is up to $2\%$ higher when using the non-Gaussian likelihood, a shift comparable to the precision of current stage-III surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of prior selection on the inferred mass and spin parameters of the neutron star-black hole merger GW230529\_181500. Specifically, we explore models motivated by astrophysical considerations, including massive binary and pulsar evolution. We examine mass and spin distributions of neutron stars constrained by radio pulsar observations, alongside black hole spin observations from previous gravitational wave detections. We show that the inferred mass distribution highly depends upon the spin prior. Specifically, under the most restrictive, binary stellar evolution models, we obtain narrower distributions of masses with a black hole mass of $4.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \,M_\odot$ and neutron star mass of $1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ where, somewhat surprisingly, it is the prior on component spins which has the greatest impact on the inferred mass distributions. Re-weighting using neutron star mass and spin priors from observations of radio pulsars, with black hole spins from observations of gravitational waves, yields the black hole and the neutron star masses to be $3.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \,M_\odot$ and $1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ respectively. The sequence of compact object formation -- whether the neutron star or the black hole formed first -- cannot be determined at the observed signal-to-noise ratio. However, there is no evidence that the black hole was tidally spun up.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive particles produced during inflation impact soft limits of primordial correlators. Searching for these signatures presents an exciting opportunity to uncover the particle spectrum in the inflationary epoch. We present non-perturbative methods to constrain intermediate-mass scalars ($0\leq m/H<3/2$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble scale) produced during inflation, which give rise to a power-law scaling in the squeezed primordial bispectrum. Exploiting the large-scale structure consistency relations and the separate universe approach, we derive models for the late-time squeezed matter bispectrum and collapsed matter trispectrum sourced by these fields. To validate our models, we run $N$-body simulations with the "Cosmological Collider" squeezed bispectrum for two different particle masses. Our models yield unbiased constraints on the amplitude of non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}^{\Delta}$, from the squeezed bispectrum and collapsed trispectrum deep into the non-linear regime ($k_{\rm max}\approx 2~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$). We assess the information content of these summary statistics, emphasizing the importance of sample variance cancellation in the matter sector. We also study the scale-dependent halo bias in our simulations. For mass-selected halos, the non-Gaussian bias estimated from our simulations agrees with predictions based on (i) separate universe simulations and (ii) universal mass functions. With further work, these results can be used to search for inflationary massive particle production with upcoming galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Coincident multi-messenger observation of cosmic sources can offer numerous benefits. One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of separate detectors by correlating their data and assuming a joint emission. We have formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of an astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\rm astro}$, relying on multi-messenger coincidences. We demonstrated this with candidate coincident gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos. Applying our method to the public data of candidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave triggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences, $p_{\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.9$. This marked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident.
