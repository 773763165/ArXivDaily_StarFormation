 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeology largely relies on precise ages of distant evolved stars in the Milky Way. Nowadays, asteroseismology can deliver ages for many red giants observed with high-cadence, high-precision photometric space missions. Our aim is to quantify age uncertainties of slowly-rotating red giants due to the cumulative effect of their fast rotation during core-hydrogen burning. Their rotation in earlier evolutionary phases caused mixing resulting in heavier helium cores and the prolongation of their main sequence. These rotational effects are usually ignored when age-dating red giants, despite our knowledge of fast rotation for stars with $M\ge1.3\,$M$_\odot$. We use a sample of 490 $\gamma$ Doradus pulsators with precise asteroseismic estimates of their internal rotation rate and with luminosity estimates from Gaia. For this sample, which includes stars rotating from nearly 0 to about 60% of the critical rate, we compute the cumulative effect on the age in their post-main sequence evolution caused by rotational mixing on the main sequence. We use stellar model grids with different physical prescriptions mimicking rotational mixing to assess systematic uncertainties on the age. With respect to non-rotating models, the sample of 490 stars, as red giant progenitors, reveals age differences up to 5% by the time they start hydrogen-shell burning when relying on the theory of rotationally induced diffusive mixing as included in the MIST isochrones. Using rotational mixing based on an advective-diffusive approach including meridional circulation leads to an age shift of 20% by the time of the TRGB. Age-dating of red giants is affected by the cumulative effect of rotational mixing during the main sequence. Such rotationally-induced age shifts should be taken into account in addition to other effects if the aim is to perform Galactic archaeological studies at the highest precision. (abridged)
#### Probability distributions of initial rotation velocities and  core-boundary mixing efficiencies of γ Doradus stars

 - **Abstract**
 The theory the rotational and chemical evolution is incomplete, thereby limiting the accuracy of model-dependent stellar mass and age determinations. The $\gamma$ Doradus pulsators are excellent points of calibration for the current state-of-the-art stellar evolution models, as their gravity modes probe the physical conditions in the deep stellar interior. Yet, individual asteroseismic modelling of these stars is not always possible because of insufficient observed oscillation modes. This paper presents a novel method to derive distributions of the stellar mass, age, core-boundary mixing efficiency and initial rotation rates for $\gamma$ Dor stars. We compute a grid of rotating stellar evolution models covering the entire $\gamma$ Dor instability strip. We then use the observed distributions of the luminosity, effective temperature, buoyancy travel time and near-core rotation frequency of a sample of 539 stars to assign a statistical weight to each of our models. This weight is a measure of how likely the combination of a specific model is. We then compute weighted histograms to derive the most likely distributions of the fundamental stellar properties. We find that the rotation frequency at zero-age main sequence follows a normal distribution, peaking around 25% of the critical Keplerian rotation frequency. The probability-density function for extent of the core-boundary mixing zone, given by a factor $f_{\rm CBM}$ times the local pressure scale height (assuming an exponentially decaying parameterisation) decreases linearly with increasing $f_{\rm CBM}$. Converting the distribution of fractions of critical rotation at the zero-age main sequence to units of d$^{-1}$, we find most F-type stars start the main sequence with a rotation frequency between 0.5 and 2 d$^{-1}$. Regarding the core-boundary mixing efficiency, we find that it is generally weak in this mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past several decades, conventional spectral analysis techniques of polluted white dwarfs have become powerful tools to learn about the geology and chemistry of extrasolar bodies. Despite their proven capabilities and extensive legacy of scientific discoveries, these techniques are however still limited by their manual, time-intensive, and iterative nature. As a result, they are susceptible to human errors and are difficult to scale up to population-wide studies of metal pollution. This paper seeks to address this problem by presenting cecilia, the first Machine Learning (ML)-powered spectral modeling code designed to measure the metal abundances of intermediate-temperature (10,000$\leq T_{\rm eff} \leq$20,000 K), Helium-rich polluted white dwarfs. Trained with more than 22,000 randomly drawn atmosphere models and stellar parameters, our pipeline aims to overcome the limitations of classical methods by replacing the generation of synthetic spectra from computationally expensive codes and uniformly spaced model grids, with a fast, automated, and efficient neural-network-based interpolator. More specifically, cecilia combines state-of-the-art atmosphere models, powerful artificial intelligence tools, and robust statistical techniques to rapidly generate synthetic spectra of polluted white dwarfs in high-dimensional space, and enable accurate ($\lesssim$0.1 dex) and simultaneous measurements of 14 stellar parameters -- including 11 elemental abundances -- from real spectroscopic observations. As massively multiplexed astronomical surveys begin scientific operations, cecilia's performance has the potential to unlock large-scale studies of extrasolar geochemistry and propel the field of white dwarf science into the era of Big Data. In doing so, we aspire to uncover new statistical insights that were previously impractical with traditional white dwarf characterisation techniques.
#### The Frequency and Mass-Ratio Distribution of Binaries in Clusters II:  radial segregation in the nearby dissolving open clusters Hyades and Praesepe

 - **Abstract**
 We have determined the mass functions, mass-ratio distribution functions and fractions of binary stars with mass ratios above particular thresholds for radially-separated populations of stars in the nearby open clusters Hyades and Praesepe. Radial mass segregation is detected, with the populations of stars within the tidal radii having much flatter mass functions than those outside the tidal radii. Within the tidal radii, the frequency of binary stars with mass ratio q > 0.5 is 50 - 75 per cent higher for Hyades and 5 - 30 per cent higher for Praesepe. We also, for the first time, detect mass-ratio radial segregation. Of the binaries for which q > 0.5, ~ 80 per cent of the inner Hyades population also have q > 0.75, while for the extra-tidal population, the ratio is ~ 50 per cent. For Praesepe, ~ 67 per cent of the inner sample have q > 0.75, and 35 - 45 per cent of the outer sample

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven models, which apply machine learning to infer physical properties from large quantities of data, have become increasingly important for extracting stellar properties from spectra. In general, these methods have been applied to data in one wavelength regime or another. For example, APOGEE Net has been applied to near-IR spectra from the SDSS-V APOGEE survey to predict stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) for all stars with Teff from 3,000 to 50,000 K, including pre-main sequence stars, OB stars, main sequence dwarfs, and red giants. The increasing number of large surveys across multiple wavelength regimes provides the opportunity to improve data-driven models through learning from multiple datasets at once. In SDSS-V, a number of spectra of stars will be observed not just with APOGEE in near-IR, but also with BOSS in optical regime. Here we aim to develop a complementary model, BOSS Net, that will replicate the performance of APOGEE Net in these optical data through label transfer. We further improve the model by extending it to brown dwarfs, as well as white dwarfs, resulting in a comprehensive coverage between 1700<Teff<100,000 K and 0<log g<10, to ensure BOSS Net can reliably measure parameters of most of the commonly observed objects within this parameter space. We also update APOGEE Net to achieve a comparable performance in the near-IR regime. The resulting models provide a robust tool for measuring stellar evolutionary states, and in turn, enable characterization of the star forming history of the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium is threaded by a hierarchy of filaments from large scales (~ 100 pc) to small scales (~ 0.1pc). The masses and lengths of these nested structures may reveal important constraints for cloud formation and evolution, but it is difficult to investigate from an evolutionary perspective using single observations. In this work, we extract simulated molecular clouds from the Cloud Factory galactic-scale ISM suite in combination with 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS to investigate how filamentary structure evolves over time. We produce synthetic dust continuum observations in three regions with a series of snapshots and use the Filfinder algorithm to identify filaments in the dust derived column density maps. When the synthetic filaments mass and length are plotted on an M-L plot, we see a scaling relation of $L\propto M^{0.45}$ similar to that seen in observations, and find that the filaments are thermally supercritical. Projection effects systematically affect the masses and lengths measured for the filaments, and are particularly severe in crowded regions. In the filament Mass-Length (M-L) diagram we identify three main evolutionary mechanisms: accretion, segmentation, and dispersal. In particular we find that the filaments typically evolve from smaller to larger masses in the observational M-L plane, indicating the dominant role of accretion in filament evolution. Moreover, we find a potential correlation between line mass and filament growth rate. Once filaments are actively star forming they then segment into smaller sections, or are dispersed by internal or external forces.

 - **Abstract**
 Young stellar clusters are predominantly the hub of star formation and hence, ideal to perform comprehensive studies over the least explored sub-stellar regime. Various unanswered questions like the mass distribution in brown dwarf regime and the effect of diverse cluster environment on brown dwarf formation efficiency still plague the scientific community. The nearby young cluster, IC 1396 with its feedback-driven environment, is ideal to conduct such study. In this paper we adopt a multi-wavelength approach, using deep Subaru HSC, Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, UKIDSS/2MASS photometry and machine learning techniques to identify the cluster members complete down to $\sim$ 0.03 M$_{\odot}$ in the central 22$^{\prime}$ area of IC 1396. We identify 458 cluster members including 62 brown dwarfs which are used to determine mass distribution in the region. We obtain a star-to-brown dwarf ratio of $\sim$ 6 for a stellar mass range 0.03 -- 1 M$_{\odot}$ in the studied cluster. The brown dwarf fraction is observed to increase across the cluster as radial distance from the central OB-stars increases. This study also compiles 15 young stellar clusters to check the variation of star-to-brown dwarf ratio relative to stellar density and UV flux ranging within 4-2500 stars pc$^{-2}$ and 0.7-7.3 G$_{0}$ respectively. The brown dwarf fraction is observed to increase with stellar density but the results about the influence of incident UV flux are inconclusive within this range. This is the deepest study of IC 1396 as of yet and it will pave the way to understand various aspects of brown dwarfs using spectroscopic observations in future.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the circumgalactic medium (CGM) for eight commonly-used cosmological codes in the AGORA collaboration. The codes are calibrated to use identical initial conditions, cosmology, heating and cooling, and star formation thresholds, but each evolves with its own unique code architecture and stellar feedback implementation. Here, we analyze the results of these simulations in terms of the structure, composition, and phase dynamics of the CGM. We show properties such as metal distribution, ionization levels, and kinematics are effective tracers of the effects of the different code feedback and implementation methods, and as such they can be highly divergent between simulations. This is merely a fiducial set of models, against which we will in the future compare multiple feedback recipes for each code. Nevertheless, we find that the large parameter space these simulations establish can help disentangle the different variables that affect observable quantities in the CGM, e.g., showing that abundances for ions with higher ionization energy are more strongly determined by the simulation's metallicity, while abundances for ions with lower ionization energy are more strongly determined by the gas density and temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 The 5:3 and 7:4 mean motion resonances of Neptune are at 42.3 and 43.7 au, respectively, and overlap with objects in the Classical trans-neptunian belt (Kuiper belt). We report the complete/partial lightcurves of 13 and 14 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the 5:3 and 7:4 resonances, respectively. We report a most likely contact binary in the 7:4 resonance, 2013 FR$_{28}$, with a periodicity of 13.97$\pm$0.04 h and a lightcurve amplitude of 0.94$\pm$0.02 mag. With a V-/U-shaped lightcurve, 2013 FR$_{28}$ has one of the largest well-sampled TNO amplitude observed with ground-based observations, comparable to the well-determined contact binary 2001 QG$_{298}$. 2013 FR$_{28}$ has a mass ratio q$\sim$1 with a density $\rho$$\sim$1 g cm$^{-3}$. We find several objects with large amplitudes and classify 2004 SC$_{60}$, 2006 CJ$_{69}$, and 2013 BN$_{82}$ as likely contact binaries, and 2001 QF$_{331}$, 2003 YW$_{179}$, and 2015 FP$_{345}$ as likely elongated objects. We observe the 17:9 resonant or classical object 2003 SP$_{317}$ that we classify as a likely contact binary. A lower estimate of 10-50% and 20-55% for the fraction of (nearly) equal-sized contact binaries is calculated in the 5:3 and 7:4 resonances, respectively. Surface colors of 2004 SC$_{60}$, 2013 BN$_{82}$, 2014 OL$_{394}$, and 2015 FP$_{345}$ have been obtained. Including these colors with ones from the literature reveals that elongated objects and contact binaries share the same ultra-red surface color, except Manw\"e-Thorondor and 2004 SC$_{60}$. Not only are the colors of the 7:4 and 5:3 TNOs similar to the Cold Classicals, but we demonstrate that the rotational properties of the 5:3 and 7:4 resonants are similar to those of the Cold Classicals, inferring a clear link between these sub-populations.

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the behavior of machine learning-based flare forecasting models deployed in a simulated operational environment. Using Georgia State University's Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares benchmark dataset (Angryk et al. 2020a,b), we examine the impacts of training methodology and the solar cycle on decision tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron performance. We implement our classifiers using three temporal training windows: stationary, rolling, and expanding. The stationary window trains models using a single set of data available before the first forecasting instance, which remains constant throughout the solar cycle. The rolling window trains models using data from a constant time interval before the forecasting instance, which moves with the solar cycle. Finally, the expanding window trains models using all available data before the forecasting instance. For each window, a number of input features (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 120) and temporal sizes (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 months) were tested. To our surprise, we found that for a 20-month window, skill scores were comparable regardless of the window type, feature count, and classifier selected. Furthermore, reducing the size of this window only marginally decreased stationary and rolling window performance. This implies that, given enough data, a stationary window can be chosen over other window types, eliminating the need for model retraining. Lastly, a moderately strong positive correlation was found to exist between a model's false positive rate and the solar X-ray background flux. This suggests that the solar cycle phase has a considerable influence on forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal interactions between moons and planets can have major effects on the orbits, spins, and thermal evolution of the moons. In the Saturn system, tidal dissipation in the planet transfers angular momentum from Saturn to the moons, causing them to migrate outwards. The rate of migration is determined by the mechanism of dissipation within the planet, which is closely tied to the planet's uncertain structure. We review current knowledge of giant planet internal structure and evolution, which has improved thanks to data from the \textit{Juno} and \textit{Cassini} missions. We discuss general principles of tidal dissipation, describing both equilibrium and dynamical tides, and how dissipation can occur in a solid core or a fluid envelope. Finally, we discuss the possibility of resonance locking, whereby a moon can lock into resonance with a planetary oscillation mode, producing enhanced tidal migration relative to classical theories, and possibly explaining recent measurements of moon migration rates.

 We present observations of the T8 dwarf 2MASS 0415-0935 with JWST's NIRSpec spectrograph using the G395H grating ($\sim$ 2.87 - 5.14 $\mu$m). We perform the first atmospheric retrieval analysis at the maximum spectral resolution of NIRSpec (R$\sim$2700) and combine the spectrum with previous observations to study the 0.9-20 $\mu$m spectral energy distribution. We obtain precise constraints on chemical abundances ($\sim$0.02 dex) for a number of species which complicate our understanding of disequilibrium chemistry, particularly for CO$_{2}$ and PH$_{3}$. Furthermore, we measure a $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio of $\sim 97^{+9}_{-8}$, making 2MASS 0415-0935 the coldest ($\sim 760$ K) substellar object outside of our solar system with a measured $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio. This work shows promise for similar observations with JWST to provide precise abundances of major chemical species as well as isotopologues, allowing for new tests of our understanding of the formation and atmospheres of substellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars are standard candles with characteristic photometric variability and serve as powerful tracers of Galactic structure, substructure, accretion history, and dark matter content. Here we report the discovery of distant RR Lyrae stars, including some of the most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo, with Galactocentric distances of approximately 300 kpc. We use time-series u*g'i'z' Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam photometry from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). We employ a template light curve fitting method based on empirical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 RR Lyrae data to identify RR Lyrae candidates in the NGVS data set. We eliminate several hundred suspected quasars and identify 180 RR Lyrae candidates, with heliocentric distances of approximately 20--300 kpc. The halo stellar density distribution is consistent with an r^(-4.09 +/- 0.10) power-law radial profile over most of this distance range with no signs of a break. The distribution of ab-type RR Lyrae in a period-amplitude plot (Bailey diagram) suggests that the mean metallicity of the halo decreases outwards. Compared to other recent RR Lyrae surveys, like Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS), and the Dark Energy Survey (DES), our NGVS study has better single-epoch photometric precision and a comparable number of epochs but smaller sky coverage. At large distances, our RR Lyrae sample appears to be relatively pure and complete, with well-measured periods and amplitudes. These newly discovered distant RR Lyrae stars are important additions to the few secure stellar tracers beyond 150 kpc in the Milky Way halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Microflares are energetically smaller versions of solar flares, demonstrating the same processes of plasma heating and particle acceleration. However, it remains unclear down to what energy scales this impulsive energy release continues, which has implications for how the solar atmosphere is heated. The heating and particle acceleration in microflares can be studied through their X-ray emission, finding predominantly thermal emission at lower energies; however, at higher energies it can be difficult to distinguish whether the emission is due to hotter plasma and/or accelerated elections. We present the first application of nested sampling to solar flare X-ray spectra, an approach which provides a quantitative degree of confidence for one model over another. We analyse NuSTAR X-ray observations of a small active region microflare (A0.02 GOES/XRS class equivalent) that occurred on 2021 November 17, with a new Python package for spectral fitting, sunkit-spex, to compute the parameter posterior distributions and the evidence of different models representing the higher energy emission as due to thermal or non-thermal sources. Calculating the Bayes factor, we show there is significantly stronger evidence for the higher energy microflare emission to be produced by non-thermal emission from flare accelerated electrons than by an additional hot thermal source. Qualitative confirmation of this non-thermal source is provided by the lack of hotter (10 MK) emission in SDO/AIA's EUV data. The nested sampling approach used in this paper has provided clear support for non-thermal emission at the level of 3x10$^{24}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in this tiny microflare.

 - **Abstract**
 The gamma-ray Fermi-LAT Galactic centre excess (GCE) has puzzled scientists for over 15 years. Despite ongoing debates about its properties, and especially its spatial distribution, its nature remains elusive. We scrutinize how the estimated spatial morphology of this excess depends on models for the Galactic diffuse emission, focusing particularly on the extent to which the Galactic plane and point sources are masked. Our main aim is to compare a spherically symmetric morphology - potentially arising from the annihilation of dark matter (DM) particles - with a boxy morphology - expected if faint unresolved sources in the Galactic bulge dominate the excess emission. Recent claims favouring a DM-motivated template for the GCE are shown to rely on a specific Galactic bulge template, which performs worse than other templates for the Galactic bulge. We find that a non-parametric model of the Galactic bulge derived from the VVV survey results in a significantly better fit for the GCE than DM-motivated templates. This result is independent of whether a GALPROP-based model or a more non-parametric ring-based model is used to describe the diffuse Galactic emission. This conclusion remains true even when additional freedom is added in the background models, allowing for non-parametric modulation of the model components and substantially improving the fit quality. When adopted, optimized background models provide robust results in terms of preference for a boxy bulge morphology of the GCE, regardless of the mask applied to the Galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We use an infrared dataset captured between 1984 and 2017 using several instruments and observatories to report five rare equatorial disturbances that completely altered the appearance of Jupiter's Equatorial Zone (EZ): the clearance of tropospheric clouds revealed a new 5-$\mu$m-bright band encircling the planet at the equator, accompanied by large 5-$\mu$m-bright filaments. Three events were observed in ground-based images in 1973, 1979 and 1992. We report and characterize for the first time the entire evolution of two new episodes of this unusual EZ state that presented their maximum 5-$\mu$m-brightness in December 1999 and February 2007, coinciding with a brown coloration south of the equator and with large bluish filaments and white plumes in the northern EZ at visible wavelengths. We characterize their typical infrared-bright lifetimes of 12-18 months, with possible periodicities of 6-8 or 13-14 years. We predict that a full-scale equatorial disturbance could occur in 2019-21.

 - **Abstract**
 Void size function (VSF) contains the information of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS), and can be used to derive the properties of dark energy and dark matter. We predict the VSFs measured from the spectroscopic galaxy survey operated by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and study the strength of cosmological constraint. We employ a high-resolution Jiutian simulation to get galaxy samples based on an improved semi-analytical model, and then generate a mock galaxy catalog of the CSST spectroscopic survey according to the detection sensitivity. We identify voids from this galaxy catalog using the watershed algorithm without assuming a spherical shape, and estimate the VSFs at different redshift bins from $z=0.5$ to 1.1. To obtain a reliable and accurate fitting result, we propose a void selection method based on the ellipticity, for comparing to the theoretical model with a linear underdensity threshold of void formation $\delta_{\rm v}$ assuming the spherical evolution. We assume $\delta_{\rm v}$ is redshift-dependent and set it as a free parameter in each redshift bin. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the VSFs from the selected voids can be well fitted by the theoretical model, and could accurately reserve the cosmological information. Based on our estimation, the VSF measurement of the CSST spectroscopic survey can constrain the cosmological parameters to a few percent level. The best-fit values of $\delta_{\rm v}$ are ranging from $\sim-0.4$ to $-0.1$ as the redshift increases from 0.5 to 1.1, which has a distinct difference from the theoretical calculation with a constant $\delta_{\rm v}\simeq-2.7$ assuming the spherical evolution. Our method can provide a good reference for void identification and selection in the VSF analysis of the spectroscopic galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Impacts from icy and rocky bodies have helped shape the composition of solar system objects, for example the Earth-Moon system, or the recent impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter. It is likely that such impacts also shape the composition of exoplanetary systems. Here we investigate how cometary impacts might affect the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters, which are prime targets for characterisation. We introduce a parametrised cometary impact model that includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup, which we couple with the 1D `radiative-convective' atmospheric model ATMO, including disequilibrium chemistry. We use this model to investigate a wide range of impactor masses and compositions, including those based on observations of Solar System comets, and interstellar ices (with JWST). We find that even a small impactor (R = 2.5 km) can lead to significant short-term changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including a factor $>10$ enhancement in H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ abundances, and atmospheric opacity more generally, and the near complete removal of observable hydrocarbons, such as CH$_4$, from the upper atmosphere. These effects scale with the change in atmospheric C/O ratio and metallicity. Potentially observable changes are possible for a body that has undergone significant/continuous bombardment, such that the global atmospheric chemistry has been impacted. Our works reveals that cometary impacts can significantly alter or pollute the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters. These changes have the potential to mute/break the proposed link between atmospheric C/O ratio and planet formation location relative to key snowlines in the natal protoplanetary disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion flows are fundamentally turbulent systems, yet are classically modelled with viscous theories only valid on length scales significantly greater than the typical size of turbulent eddies in the flow. We demonstrate that, while this will be a reasonable bulk description of the flow at large radii, this must break down as the flow approaches absorbing boundaries, such as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a black hole disc. This is because in a turbulent flow large velocity fluctuations can carry a fluid element over the ISCO from a finite distance away, from which it will not return, a process without analogy in conventional models. This introduces a non-zero directional bias into the velocity fluctuations in the near-ISCO disc. By studying reduced random walk problems, we derive a number of implications of the presence of an absorbing boundary in an accretion context. In particular, we show that the average velocity with which a typical fluid element crosses the ISCO is much larger than is assumed in traditional theories. This enhanced velocity modifies the thermodynamic properties of black hole accretion flows on both sides of the ISCO. In particular, thermodynamic quantities for larger ISCO stresses no longer display pronounced cusps at the ISCO in this new formalism, a result with relevance for a number of observational probes of the intra-ISCO region. Finally, we demonstrate that these extended models reproduce the trans-ISCO behaviour observed in GRMHD simulations of thin discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial abundances of light elements are sensitive to the physics of the early Universe and can directly constrain cosmological quantities, such as the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta_{10}$, the baryon density and the number of neutrino families. Deuterium is especially suited for these studies: its primordial abundance is sensitive and monotonically dependent on $\eta_{10}$, allowing an independent measurement of the cosmic baryon density that can be compared, for instance, against the Planck satellite data. The primordial deuterium abundance can be measured in high $H_I$ column density absorption systems towards distant quasars. We report here a new measurement, based on high-resolution ESPRESSO data, of the primordial $D_I$ abundance of a system at redshift $z \sim 3.572$, towards PKS1937-101. Using only ESPRESSO data, we find a D/H ratio of $2.638\pm0.128 \times 10^{-5}$, while including the available UVES data improves the precision, leading to a ratio of $2.608 \pm 0.102 \times 10^{-5}$. The results of this analysis agree with those of the most precise existing measurements. We find that the relatively low column density of this system ($\log{N_{\rm H_I}/ {\rm cm}^{-2}}\sim18 $) introduces modelling uncertainties, which become the main contributor to the error budget.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous red novae (LRNe) and their connection to common envelope events (CEE) remain elusive in astrophysics. Here, we present a radiation hydrodynamic model capable of simulating the light curves of material ejected during a CEE. For the first time, the radiation hydrodynamic model incorporates complete recombination physics for hydrogen and helium. The radiation hydrodynamic equations are solved with Guangqi. With time-independent ejecta simulations, we show that the peaks in the light curves are attributed to radiation-dominated ejecta, while the extended plateaus are produced by matter-dominated ejecta. To showcase our model's capability, we fit the light curve of AT2019zhd. The central mass object of $6M_{\odot}$ is assumed based on observations and scaling relations. Our model demonstrates that the ejecta mass of AT2019zhd falls within the range of $0.04M_{\odot}$ to $0.1M_{\odot}$. Additionally, we demonstrate that recombination energy and radiation force acceleration significantly impact the light curves, whereas dust formation has a limited effect during the peak and plateau phases.
#### Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the  Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing  of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories

 - **Abstract**
 Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the ``acceleration-plane analysis'' for a variety of samples and the ``stacked velocity profile analysis'' for a pure binary sample.
#### On the growth and evolution of low-mass planets in pressure bumps

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of protoplanetary discs have revealed dust rings which are likely due to the presence of pressure bumps in the disc. Because these structures tend to trap drifting pebbles, it has been proposed that pressure bumps may play an important role in the planet formation process. In this paper, we investigate the orbital evolution of a $0.1$ $M_\oplus$ protoplanet embedded in a pressure bump using 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary discs consisting of gas and pebbles. We examine the role of thermal forces generated by the pebble accretion-induced heat release, taking into account the feedback between luminosity and eccentricity. We also study the effect of the pebble-scattered flow on the planet's orbital evolution. Due to accumulation of pebbles at the pressure bump, the planet's accretion luminosity is high enough to induce significant eccentricity growth through thermal forces. Accretion luminosity is also responsible for vortex formation at the planet position through baroclinic effects, which cause the planet escape from the dust ring if dust feedback onto the gas is neglected. Including the effect of the dust back-reaction leads to weaker vortices, which enable the planet to remain close to the pressure maximum on an eccentric orbit. Simulations in which the planet mass is allowed to increase as a consequence of pebble accretion resulted in the formation of giant planet cores with mass in the range $5-20$ $M_\oplus$ over $\sim 2\times 10^4$ yrs. This occurs for moderate values of the Stokes number $St \approx 0.01$ such that the pebble drift velocity is not too high and the dust ring mass not too small. Our results suggest that pressure bumps mays be preferred locations for the formation of giant planets, but this requires a moderate level of grain growth within the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We make use of the Gaia-Unwise quasar catalogue, Quaia, to constrain the growth history out to high redshifts from the clustering of quasars and their cross-correlation with maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing convergence. Considering three tomographic bins, centered at redshifts $\bar{z}_i = [0.69, 1.59, 2.72]$, we reconstruct the evolution of the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8(z)$ over the last $\sim12$ billion years of cosmic history. In particular, we make one of the highest-redshift measurements of $\sigma_8$ ($\sigma_8(z=2.72)=0.22\pm 0.06$), finding it to be in good agreement (at the $\sim1\sigma$ level) with the value predicted by $\Lambda$CDM using CMB data from Planck. We also used the data to study the evolution of the linear quasar bias for this sample, finding values similar to those of other quasar samples, although with a less steep evolution at high redshifts. Finally, we study the potential impact of foreground contamination in the CMB lensing maps and, although we find evidence of contamination in cross-correlations at $z\sim1.7$ we are not able to clearly pinpoint its origin as being Galactic or extragalactic. Nevertheless, we determine that the impact of this contamination on our results is negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are important astrophysical objects not only as standard candles for the determination of the cosmic distance ladder but also as a test-bed for the stellar evolution theory, thanks to the connection between their pulsation (periods, amplitudes) and stellar (luminosity, mass, effective temperature, metallicity) parameters. We aim to unveil the nature of the Galactic DCEP OGLE-GD-CEP-0516 and other DCEPs showing an enhanced abundance of lithium in their atmospheres. We have collected a high-resolution spectrum for OGLE-GD-CEP-0516 with UVES@VLT. Accurate stellar parameters: effective temperature, gravity, micro- and macro-turbulence, radial velocity, and metal abundances were measured for this star, using spectral synthesis techniques based on LTE plane-parallel atmospheric model. We measured a chemical pattern with most elements under-abundant compared with the Sun, i.e. [Fe/H]\,=\,$-$0.54\,$\pm$\,0.16~dex, [C/H]\,=\,$-$0.45\,$\pm$\,0.05~dex, or [Mg/H]\,=\,$-$0.40\,$\pm$\,0.16~dex among others. In particular, we measured a lithium abundance A(Li)\,=\,3.06\,$\pm$\,0.10~dex for OGLE-GD-CEP-0516, which makes this object the sixth Li-rich object among the Milky Way DCEPs. Our results favour the scenario in which the six Galactic Li-rich DCEPs are first-crossing the instability strip having had slowly-rotating progenitors during their main sequence phase. This study explored the link between lithium abundance and the pulsation period in classical Cepheids. It found that brighter Cepheids, indicative of higher mass, show enhanced lithium abundance, contrary to predictions from evolutionary models considering rotation. Additionally, an analysis of lithium abundance versus [Fe/H] revealed a lack of significant correlation, contradicting expectations from galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models.

 - **Abstract**
 We use nearly two decades of helioseismic data obtained from the GONG (2002-2020) and HMI (2010-2020) ring-diagram pipelines to examine the temporal variations of the properties of individual equatorial Rossby modes with azimuthal orders in the range $6 \le m \le 10$. We find that the mode parameters obtained from GONG and HMI are consistent during the data overlapping period of 2010-2020. The power and the frequency of each mode exhibit significant temporal variations over the full observing period. Using the GONG data during solar cycles 23 and 24, we find that the mode power averaged over $6 \le m \le 10$ shows a positive correlation with the sunspot number ($0.42$), while the averaged frequency shift is anti-correlated ($-0.91$). The anti-correlation between the average mode power and frequency shift is $-0.44$.

 - **Abstract**
 The deposition of energy and momentum by supernova explosions has been subject to numerous studies in the past few decades. However, while there has been some work that focused on the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative stage of a supernova remnant (SNR), the late radiative stage and merging with the interstellar medium (ISM) have received little attention. Here, we use three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the evolution of SNRs during the radiative phase, considering a wide range of physical explosion parameters ($n_{\text{H, ISM}} \in \left[0.1, 100\right] \text{cm}^{-3}$ and $E_{\text{SN}} \in \left[1, 14\right]\times 10^{51} \text{erg}$). We find that the radiative phase can be subdivided in four stages: A pressure driven snowplow phase during which the hot overpressurized bubble gas is evacuated and pushed into the cold shell, a momentum conserving snowplow phase which is accompanied by a broadening of the shell, an implosion phase where cold material from the back of the shell is flooding the central vacuum and a final cloud phase, during which the imploding gas is settling as a central, compact overdensity. The launching timescale for the implosion ranges from a few 100 kyr to a few Myr, while the cloud formation timescale ranges from a few to about 10 Myr. The highly chemically enriched clouds can become massive ($M_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^3 - 10^4 \, \text{M}_{\odot}$) and self-gravitating within a few Myr after their formation, providing an attractive, novel pathway for supernova induced star and planet formation in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 The prototypical nova super-remnant (NSR) was uncovered around the most rapidly recurring nova (RN), M31N 2008-12a. Simulations of the growth of NSRs revealed that these large structures should exist around all novae, whether classical or recurrent. NSRs consist of large shell-like structures surrounding excavated cavities. Predictions, informed by these simulations, led to the discovery of an extended cavity coincident with the Galactic RN, RS Ophiuchi, in far-infrared archival IRAS images. We propose that this cavity is associated with RS Oph and is therefore evidence of another NSR to be uncovered.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitationally lensed quasar J014516.6-094517 at z=2.719 has been observed with the ESPRESSO instrument at the ESO VLT to obtain high-fidelity spectra of the two images A and B with a resolving power R=70000. At the redshifts under investigation (2.1 < z < 2.7), the Lyman forests along the two sightlines are separated by sub-kiloparsec physical distances and exhibit a strong correlation. We find that the two forests are indistinguishable at the present level of signal-to-noise ratio and do not show any global velocity shift, with the cross-correlation peaking at $\Delta v = 12 \pm 48$ m/s. The distribution of the difference in velocity of individual Lyman-$\alpha$ features is compatible with a null average and a mean absolute deviation of 930 m/s. Significant differences in NHI column density are not detected, putting a limit to the RMS fluctuation in the baryon density on $\leq 1$ proper kpc scales of $\Delta \rho / \rho < 3$%. On the other hand, metal lines show significant differences both in velocity structure and in column density. A toy model shows that the difference in velocity of the metal features between the two sightlines is compatible with the the motions of the baryonic component associated to dark matter halos of typical mass $M\simeq 2\times 10^{10} M_\odot$, also compatible with the observed incidence of the metal systems. The present observations confirm the feasibility of the Sandage test of the cosmic redshift drift with high-fidelity spectroscopy of the Lyman forest of distant, bright quasars, but also provide an element of caution about the intrinsic noise associated to the usage of metal features for the same purpose.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) marks a pivotal moment for precise atmospheric characterization of Y dwarfs, the coldest brown dwarf spectral type. In this study, we leverage moderate spectral resolution observations (R $\sim$ 2700) with the G395H grating of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) onboard of JWST to characterize the nearby (9.9 pc) Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 (WISE 1828). With the NIRSpec G395H 2.88-5.12 $\mathrm{\mu}$m spectrum, we measure the abundances of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S, NH$_3$, and H$_2$O, which are the major carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur bearing species in the atmosphere. Based on the retrieved volume mixing ratios with the atmospheric retrieval framework CHIMERA, we report that the C/O ratio is $0.45 \pm 0.01$, close to the solar C/O value of 0.55, and the metallicity to be +0.30 $\pm$ 0.02 dex. Comparison between the retrieval results with the forward modeling results suggests that the model bias for C/O and metallicity could be as high as 0.03 and 0.97 dex respectively. We also report a lower limit of the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio of $>40 $, being consistent with the nominal solar value of 90. Our results highlight the potential of JWST in measuring the C/O ratios down to percent-level precision and characterizing isotopologues of cold planetary atmospheres similar to WISE 1828.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the predictions of $\Lambda_s$CDM (a novel framework that postulates a rapid anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) vacua transition in the late Universe) on bound structures. In its simplest version, the cosmological constant, $\Lambda_s$, abruptly switches sign from negative to positive, attaining its present-day value at a redshift of ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$. The $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model emerges as a promising solution to major cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, as well as other less definite tensions. A key aspect of our investigation is examining the impact of the abrupt transition of the $\Lambda_s$CDM model on the formation and evolution of bound cosmic structures. We identify three primary influences: (i) the negative cosmological constant (AdS) phase for $z > z_\dagger$, (ii) the abrupt transition marked by a type II (sudden) singularity, leading to an abrupt increase in the universe's expansion rate at $z=z_\dagger$, and (iii) an increased expansion rate in the late universe under a positive cosmological constant for $z < z_\dagger$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the spherical collapse model, we investigate the non-linear evolution of bound cosmic structures within the $\Lambda_s$CDM framework. We find that the virialization process of cosmic structures, and consequently their matter overdensity, varies depending on whether the AdS-dS transition precedes or follows the turnaround. Specifically, structures virialize with either increased or reduced matter overdensity compared to the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model, contingent on the timing of the transition. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the sudden past singularity does not result in the dissociation of bound systems. Despite its profound nature, the singularity exerts only relatively weak effects on such systems, thereby reinforcing the model's viability in this context.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will set a new standard regarding data volume generated by an astronomical instrument, which is likely to challenge widely adopted data analysis tools that scale inadequately with the data size. This study aims to develop a new source detection and characterization method for massive radio astronomical datasets by adapting modern deep-learning object detection techniques. These approaches have proved their efficiency on complex computer vision tasks, and we seek to identify their specific strengths and weaknesses when applied to astronomical data. We introduce YOLO-CIANNA, a highly customized deep-learning object detector designed specifically for astronomical datasets. This paper presents the method and describes all the low-level adaptations required to address the specific challenges of radio-astronomical images. We demonstrate this method's capabilities using simulated 2D continuum images from the SKAO SDC1 dataset. Our method outperforms every other published result on the specific SDC1 dataset. Using the SDC1 metric, we improve the challenge-winning score by +139\% and the score of the only other post-challenge participation by +61\%. Our catalog has a detection purity of 94\% while detecting 40 to 60 \% more sources than previous top-score results. The trained model can also be forced to reach 99\% purity in post-process and still detect 10 to 30\% more sources than the other top-score methods. It is also capable of real-time detection, with a peak prediction speed of 500 images of 512x512 pixels per second on a single GPU. YOLO-CIANNA achieves state-of-the-art detection and characterization results on the simulated SDC1 dataset. The method is open source and included in the wider CIANNA framework. We provide scripts to train and apply this method to the SDC1 dataset in the CIANNA repository.
