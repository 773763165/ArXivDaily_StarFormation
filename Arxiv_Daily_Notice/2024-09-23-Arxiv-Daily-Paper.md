          Comment on "Quantum-Mechanical Suppression of Gas Accretion by Primordial Black Holes"

 - **Abstract**
 It was recently claimed (arXiv:2409.09081v1 [astro-ph.HE]) that accretion of ordinary matter on black holes of mass $(6\times 10^{14}-4\times10^{19})\,$g would be inhibited by quantum mechanical effects, namely the de Broglie wavelength of the electron being larger than the Schwarzschild radius. However the conclusion is based on considering accretion of a single atom over the age of the Universe. There is no suppression of the accretion rate per atom on such black holes.

          Acquiring the Lefschetz thimbles: efficient evaluation of the diffraction integral for lensing in wave optics

 - **Abstract**
 Evaluating the Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integral is essential in studying wave effects in astrophysical lensing, but is often intractable because of the highly oscillatory integrated. A recent breakthrough was made by exploiting the Picard-Lefschetz theory: the integral can be performed along the `Lefschetz thimbles' in the complex domain where the integrand is not oscillatory but rapidly converging. The application of this method, however, has been limited by both the unfamiliar concepts involved and the low numerical efficiency of the method used to find the Lefschetz thimbles. In this paper, we give simple examples of the Lefschetz thimbles and define the `flow lines' that facilitate the understanding of the concepts. Based on this, we propose new ways to obtain the Lefschetz thimbles with high numerical efficiency, which provide an effective tool for studying wave effects in astrophysical lensing.

          Stars or gas? Constraining the hardening processes of massive black-hole binaries with LISA

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.

          Running with the Bulls: The frequency of star-disc encounters in the Taurus star forming region

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets form in regions of enhanced stellar density, subjecting protoplanetary discs to gravitational perturbations from neighbouring stars. Observations in the Taurus star-forming have uncovered evidence of at least three recent, star-disc encounters that have truncated discs (HV/DO Tau, RW Aurigae, UX Tau), raising questions about the frequency of such events. We aim to assess the probability of observing truncating star-disc encounters in Taurus. We generate a physically motivated dynamical model including binaries and spatial-kinematic substructure to follow the historical dynamical evolution and stellar encounters in the Taurus star forming region. We track the star-disc encounters and outer disc radius evolution over the lifetime of Taurus. A quarter of discs are truncated below 30 au by dynamical encounters, but this truncation mostly occurs in binaries over the course of a few orbital periods, on a time-scale $\lesssim 0.1$ Myr. Nonetheless, some truncating encounters still occur up to the present age of Taurus. Strongly truncating encounters (ejecting $\gtrsim 10$ percent of the disc mass) occur at a rate $\sim 10$ Myr$^{-1}$, sufficient to explain the encounter between HV and DO Tau $\sim 0.1$ Myr ago. If encounters that eject only $\sim 1$ percent of the disc mass are responsible for RW Aurigae and UX Tau, then they are also expected with encounter rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{enc} \sim 100{-}200$ Myr$^{-1}$. However, the observed sample of recent encounters is probably incomplete, since these examples occurred in systems that are not consistent with random drawing from the mass function. One more observed example would statistically imply additional physics, such as replenishment of the outer disc material.

          Updated cosmological constraints in extended parameter space with Planck PR4, DESI BAO, and SN: dynamical dark energy, neutrino masses, lensing anomaly, and the Hubble tension
 - **Authors:** Shouvik Roy Choudhury, Teppei Okumura

 - **Abstract**
 We present the updated constraints on cosmological parameters in a 12 parameter cosmology extended with dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), effective number of neutrinos ($N_{\rm eff}$), scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), and running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). For 'CMB' data, we use the latest Planck PR4 (2020) HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods, Planck PR4+ACT DR6 lensing, and Planck 2018 lowl-$l$ TT likelihoods. Also, we use the latest DESI DR1 BAO likelihoods and SNeIa likelihoods from the Pantheon+ and DESY5 samples. We find: i) Contrary to the findings of DESI collaboration, we find that the CMB+BAO+Pantheon+ leads to the inclusion of cosmological constant within $2\sigma$, while CMB+BAO+DESY5 excludes the same at more than 2$\sigma$. Thus, the dynamical nature of dark energy cannot yet be considered a robust cosmological signature. As pointed out in earlier literature, the DESY5 SNe sample might have systematics which are driving the exclusion of cosmological constant. ii) We find that for certain data combinations lead to a 1$\sigma$+ detection of $\sum m_{\nu}$, and we get a posterior peak in all dataset combinations, which is an encouraging trend towards future detection. We also provide a robust bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.3$ eV (95%). Given the current uncertainty in determining the correct underlying cosmological model, we prescribe this bound for the cosmology and particle physics community. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe, we find that $A_{\rm lens}=1$ is included at 2$\sigma$ but not at $1\sigma$. This indicates that with Planck PR4 likelihoods, there is currently no lensing anomaly in a dynamical dark energy cosmology. iv) We find that even in this largely extended cosmology, the Hubble tension persists at the level of 3.2-3.9$\sigma$.

          High-contrast imager for complex aperture telescopes (HiCAT): 8. Dark zone demonstration with simultaneous closed-loop low-order wavefront sensing and control

 - **Abstract**
 We present recent laboratory results demonstrating high-contrast coronagraphy for the future space-based large IR/Optical/Ultraviolet telescope recommended by the Decadal Survey. The High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed aims to implement a system-level hardware demonstration for segmented aperture coronagraphs with wavefront control. The telescope hardware simulator employs a segmented deformable mirror with 37 hexagonal segments that can be controlled in piston, tip, and tilt. In addition, two continuous deformable mirrors are used for high-order wavefront sensing and control. The low-order sensing subsystem includes a dedicated tip-tilt stage, a coronagraphic target acquisition camera, and a Zernike wavefront sensor that is used to measure and correct low-order aberration drifts. We explore the performance of a segmented aperture coronagraph both in static operations (limited by natural drifts and instabilities) and in dynamic operations (in the presence of artificial wavefront drifts added to the deformable mirrors), and discuss the estimation and control strategies used to reach and maintain the dark-zone contrast using our low-order wavefront sensing and control. We summarize experimental results that quantify the performance of the testbed in terms of contrast, inner/outer working angle and bandpass, and analyze limiting factors.

          Combining statistical learning with deep learning for improved exoplanet detection and characterization

 - **Abstract**
 In direct imaging at high contrast, the bright glare produced by the host star makes the detection and the characterization of sub-stellar companions particularly challenging. In spite of the use of an extreme adaptive optics system combined with a coronagraphic mask to strongly attenuate the starlight contamination, dedicated post-processing methods combining several images recorded with the pupil tracking mode of the telescope are needed to reach the required contrast. In that context, we recently proposed to combine the statistics-based model of PACO with a deep learning approach in a three-step algorithm. First, the data are centered and whitened locally using the PACO framework to improve the stationarity and the contrast in a preprocessing step. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained in a supervised fashion to detect the signature of synthetic sources in the preprocessed science data. Finally, the trained network is applied to the preprocessed observations and delivers a detection map. A second network is trained to infer locally the photometry of detected sources. Both deep models are trained from scratch with a custom data augmentation strategy allowing to generate a large training set from a single spatio-temporo-spectral dataset. This strategy can be applied to process jointly the images of observations conducted with angular, and eventually spectral, differential imaging (A(S)DI). In this proceeding, we present in a unified framework the key ingredients of the deep PACO algorithm both for ADI and ASDI. We apply our method on several datasets from the the IRDIS imager of the VLT/SPHERE instrument. Our method reaches, in average, a better trade-off between precision and recall than the comparative algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 PLATO will begin observing stars in its Southern Field (LOPS2) after its launch in late 2026. By this time, TESS will have observed the stars in LOPS2 for at least four years. We find that by 2025, on average each star in the PLATO field will have been monitored for 330 days by TESS, with a subset of stars in the TESS continuous viewing zone having over 1000 days of monitoring. There are currently 96 known transiting exoplanets in the LOPS2 field, with 33 of these residing in multiplanet systems. The LOPS2 field also contains around 500 TESS planet candidate systems, over 1000 bright (V<13) eclipsing binary systems, 6 transiting brown dwarf systems, and 2 bright white dwarfs (G<13). We calculate TESS and PLATO sensitivities to detecting transits for the bright FGK stars that make up the PLATO LOPS2 P1 sample. We find that TESS should have discovered almost all transiting giant planets out to approximately 30 d within the LOPS2 field, and out to approximately 100 d for the regions of the LOPS2 field within the TESS CVZ ($\sim$20 per cent of the LOPS2 field). However, we find that for smaller radius planets in the range 1$-$4 R$_\oplus$ PLATO will have significantly better sensitivity, and these are likely to make up the bulk of new PLATO discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of over 5700 exoplanets has led to a boom in the field of exoplanet demographics over the past decade. Led by swaths of exoplanet discoveries from NASA's Kepler space mission, astronomers have been conducting statistical studies of the exoplanet population in search of trends in various planetary and host stellar parameters. These investigations are informing our understanding of how planets form and evolve, thus putting our solar system into a galactic context. In this chapter, we review many of the major features uncovered in the distributions of physical and orbital parameters of known exoplanets including the Radius Valley, the Neptunian Desert, the Peas in a Pod pattern, dynamical properties that point toward likely formation/migration mechanisms, as well as trends with host stellar parameters such as the time-evolution of exoplanetary systems and the search for planets within the Habitable Zone. The overarching theme is that exoplanetary systems exhibit an incredible diversity of planet properties and system architectures that do not exist within our own solar system. A promising future awaits the field of exoplanet demographics with increasingly deep investigations planned following the launch of numerous dedicated space telescopes over the coming years and decades.

          Diverging evolution of light pollution indicators: can the Globe at Night and VIIRS-DNB measurements be reconciled?

 - **Abstract**
 The radiance of nighttime artificial lights measured by the VIIRS-DNB instrument on board the satellite Suomi-NPP increases at an average rate ~2.2 %/yr worldwide, whereas the artificial radiance of the night sky deduced from the Globe at Night (GAN) unaided-eye observations of the number of visible stars is reported to increase at an average rate ~9.6 %/yr. The difference between these two estimates is remarkable. This raises the question of whether the diverging temporal evolution of these indicators could be due to changes in the spectral composition of outdoor artificial light, consequence of the current process of replacement of lighting technologies. This paper presents a model for evaluating the temporal rate of change of different light pollution indicators and applies it to the VIIRS-DNB vs GAN issue, based on available data. The results show that the reported difference could be explained by spectral changes alone, if the visual observations are made under scotopic adaptation in some specific transition conditions. In case of photopic adapted observers, however, reconciling these two measurement sets requires the existence of additional light sources that affect the Globe at Night observations but do not show up in the VIIRS-DNB data. The lumen emissions of these specific sources should increase at a rate 6 %/yr worlwide, adding to the estimated 3 %/yr of the remaining lights deduced from the VIIRS-DNB measurements corrected for spectral shift.

 - **Abstract**
 Real-time control (RTC) is pivotal for any Adaptive Optics (AO) system, including high-contrast imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar environments. It is the brain of the AO system, and what wavefront sensing and control (WFS\&C) techniques need to work with to achieve unprecedented image quality and contrast, ultimately advancing our understanding of exoplanetary systems in the context of high contrast imaging (HCI). Developing WFS\&C algorithms first happens in simulation or a lab before deployment on-sky. The transition to on-sky testing is often challenging due to the different RTCs used. Sharing common RTC standards across labs and telescope instruments would considerably simplify this process. A data architecture based on the interprocess communication method known as shared memory is ideally suited for this purpose. The CACAO package, an example of RTC based on shared memory, was initially developed for the Subaru-SCExAO instrument and now deployed on several benches and instruments. This proceeding discusses the challenges, requirements, implementation strategies, and performance evaluations associated with integrating a shared memory-based RTC. The Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory (SEAL) bench is a platform for WFS\&C development for large ground-based segmented telescopes. Currently, SEAL offers the user a non-real-time version of CACAO, a shared-memory based RTC package initially developed for the Subaru-SCExAO instrument, and now deployed on several benches and instruments. We show here the example of the SEAL RTC upgrade as a precursor to both RTC upgrade at the 3-m Shane telescopes at Lick Observatory (Shane-AO) and a future development platform for the Keck II AO. This paper is aimed at specialists in AO, astronomers, and WFS\&C scientists seeking a deeper introduction to the world of RTCs.

          Using Two-Frequency Dust Spectral Matching to Separate Galactic Synchrotron and Free-Free Temperature Foregrounds from the CMB

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a method for removing CMB and anomalous microwave emission (AME, or spinning dust) intensity signals at high to intermediate Galactic latitudes in temperature sky maps at frequencies roughly between 5 and 40 GHz. The method relies on the assumption of a spatially uniform combined dust (AME and thermal) rms spectral energy distribution for these regions, but is otherwise model independent. A difference map is produced from input maps at two different frequencies in thermodynamic temperature: the two frequencies are chosen such that the rms AME signal in the lower frequency (~5 - 40 GHz) map is equivalent to the thermal dust emission rms in the higher frequency (~95 - 230 GHz) map. Given the high spatial correlation between AME and thermal dust, the resulting difference map is dominated by synchrotron and free-free foreground components, and can thus provide useful insight into the morphology and possible spectral variations of these components at high latitudes. We show examples of these difference maps obtained with currently available WMAP and Planck data and demonstrate the efficacy of CMB and dust mitigation using this method. We also use these maps, in conjunction with Haslam 408 MHz and WHAM H-alpha observations, to form an estimate of the diffuse synchrotron spectral index in temperature on degree scales. The hybrid analysis approach we describe is advantageous in situations where frequency coverage is insufficient to break spectral degeneracies between AME and synchrotron.

 We present high-spatial-resolution (0.7 to 1.0 arcsec) submillimeter observations of continuum and molecular lines of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO toward 11 high-mass star-forming regions using the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA). A total of 19 separate cores from 9 high-mass star-forming regions are found to be line-rich, including high-, intermediate-, and low-mass line-rich cores. The three molecules are detected in these line-rich cores. We map the emission of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO in 9 high-mass star-forming regions. The spatial distribution of the three molecules is very similar and concentrated in the areas of intense continuum emission. We also calculate the rotation temperatures, column densities, and abundances of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption. The abundances relative to H2 and CH3OH, and line widths of the three molecules are significantly correlated. The abundances relative to H2, temperatures and line widths of the three molecules tend to be higher in cores with higher mass and outflows detected. The possible chemical links of the three molecules are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey) is a next-generation balloon/satellite experiment utilizing a LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber), to simultaneously target astrophysical observations of cosmic MeV gamma-rays and conduct an indirect dark matter search using antimatter. While LArTPCs are widely used in particle physics experiments, they have never been operated at balloon altitudes. An engineering balloon flight with a small-scale LArTPC (eGRAMS) was conducted on July 27th, 2023, to establish a system for safely operating a LArTPC at balloon altitudes and to obtain cosmic-ray data from the LArTPC. The flight was launched from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Taiki Aerospace Research Field in Hokkaido, Japan. The total flight duration was 3 hours and 12 minutes, including a level flight of 44 minutes at a maximum altitude of 28.9~km. The flight system was landed on the sea and successfully recovered. The LArTPC was successfully operated throughout the flight, and about 0.5 million events of the cosmic-ray data including muons, protons, and Compton scattering gamma-ray candidates, were collected. This pioneering flight demonstrates the feasibility of operating a LArTPC in high-altitude environments, paving the way for future GRAMS missions and advancing our capabilities in MeV gamma-ray astronomy and dark matter research.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur-bearing molecules are commonly detected in dense cores within star-forming regions, but the total sulfur budget is significantly low, when compared to the interstellar medium (ISM) value. The properties of sulfur-bearing molecules are not well understood due to the absence of large sample studies with uniform observational configurations. To deepen our understanding of this subject, we conducted a study using ALMA 870 \micron~observations of 11 massive protoclusters. By checking the spectra of 248 dense cores in 11 massive protoclusters, a total of 10 sulfur-bearing species (CS, SO, \htcs, NS, \sot, \ttso, \tfsot, \ttsot, \seoo, \octfs) were identified. The parameters including systemic velocities, line widths, gas temperatures, column densities, and abundances were derived. Our results indicate that SO appears to be more easily detected in a wider range of physical environments than \htcs, despite these two species show similarities in gas distributions and abundances. \tfsot~and \htcs~are good tracers of the temperature of sulfur-bearing species, in which \htcs~traces the outer warm envelope and \tfsot~is associated with high-temperature central-regions. High-mass star-forming feedback (outflow and other non-thermal motions) significantly elevates the sulfur-bearing molecular abundances and detection rates specifically for \sot~and SO. A positive correlation between the \sot~abundance increasing factor ($F$) and temperatures suggests that \sot~could serve as a sulfur reservoir on the grain mantles of dense cores and then can be desorbed from dust to gas phase as the temperature rises. This work shows the importance of a large and unbiased survey to understand the sulfur depletion in dense cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio burst (FRB) is a type of extragalactic radio signal characterized by millisecond duration, extremely high brightness temperature, and large dispersion measure. It remains a mystery in the universe. Advancements in instrumentation have led to the discovery of 816 FRB sources and 7622 bursts from 67 repeating FRBs now. This field is undergoing rapid development, rapidly advancing our understanding of the physics of FRBs as new observational data accumulates. The accumulation of data has also promoted our exploration of our universe. In this review, we summarize the statistical analysis and cosmological applications using large samples of FRBs, including the energy functions, the waiting time distributions of repeating FRBs, the probe of "missing baryons" and circumgalactic medium in the universe, measurements of cosmological parameters, exploration of the epoch of reionization history, and study of the gravitational lensing of FRBs.

 Sulfur-bearing species play critical roles in atmospheric physical-chemical processes, atmosphere-surface interactions, and the geological evolution of Venus. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of (1) Instrumental data on the abundance and speciation of sulfur in atmospheric and crustal materials, (2) the behavior of sulfur-bearing species in the mesosphere, clouds, and lower atmosphere, (3) chemical and mineralogical aspects of atmosphere-surface interactions, (4) the fate of sulfur during the formation, differentiation, and geological evolution of Venus, including volcanic degassing, gas-solid reactions at the surface, a putative aqueous period, and subsequent evolution. The chapter also outlines outstanding questions and discusses further exploration of Venus in the context of sulfur-relevant investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical spectra of the Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) object V4334 Sgr have shown a rapidly changing spectrum resulting from shocks in the outflow, which created a new bipolar nebula inside the old nebula. We see C II and C III emission lines emerging typical of a [WC 11-10]-type star. The strong increase of [O III] and [S III] emission lines indicate the possible onset of photoionisation in the new ejecta.

 - **Abstract**
 We live in an exoplanet revolution, with more than 5,000 exoplanets detected to date. Our ability to characterise individual exoplanets is constantly improving, with exquisite mass and radius measurements for an ever-growing sample of planets, complimented by atmospheric characterisation of lower and lower mass planets. This chapter outlines a complimentary set of observations that uniquely provide bulk elemental compositions for exoplanetary material. Absorption features from metals, including Mg, Fe, Si, O, Ca, Al, Ni and Ti in the white dwarf photosphere characterise the composition of accreted planetary material. These observations highlight the diversity in composition across exoplanetary systems including volatile content and probe key geological processes including the formation of iron cores. Thanks to the many white dwarfs identified by the space satellite {\it Gaia}, a revolution in the spectroscopic characterisation of white dwarfs is underway.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's icy moon Ganymede has a tenuous exosphere produced by sputtering and possibly sublimation of water ice. To date, only atomic hydrogen and oxygen have been directly detected in this exosphere. Here, we present observations of Ganymede's CO$_2$ exosphere obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. CO$_2$ gas is observed over different terrain types, mainly over those exposed to intense Jovian plasma irradiation, as well as over some bright or dark terrains. Despite warm surface temperatures, the CO$_2$ abundance over equatorial subsolar regions is low. CO$_2$ vapor has the highest abundance over the north polar cap of the leading hemisphere, reaching a surface pressure of 1 pbar. From modeling we show that the local enhancement observed near 12 h local time in this region can be explained by the presence of cold traps enabling CO$_2$ adsorption. However, whether the release mechanism in this high-latitude region is sputtering or sublimation remains unclear. The north polar cap of the leading hemisphere also has unique surface-ice properties, probably linked to the presence of the large atmospheric CO2 excess over this region. These CO2 molecules might have been initially released in the atmosphere after the radiolysis of CO$_2$ precursors, or from the sputtering of CO$_2$ embedded in the H$_2$O ice bedrock. Dark terrains (regiones), more widespread on the north versus south polar regions, possibly harbor CO$_2$ precursors. CO$_2$ molecules would then be redistributed via cold trapping on ice-rich terrains of the polar cap and be diurnally released and redeposited on these terrains. Ganymede's CO$_2$ exosphere highlights the complexity of surface-atmosphere interactions on Jupiter's icy Galilean moons.

 - **Abstract**
 Prompt emission of GRB 230812B stands out as one of the most luminous events observed by both the Fermi-GBM and LAT. Prompt emission spectral analysis (both time-integrated and resolved) of this burst supports an additional thermal component together with a non-thermal, indicating the hybrid jet composition. The spectral parameters alpha, Ep, and kT of the best-fit Band+Blackbody model show a tacking behaviour with the intensity. Further, the low energy afterglow emission is consistent with the synchrotron emission from the external forward shock in the ISM medium. LAT detected very high energy emission (VHE) deviating from the synchrotron mechanism, possibly originating from the Lorentz boosting of prompt emission photons by accelerated electrons in the external shock via Inverse Compton (IC) or Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) emission mechanisms. The comparison of the prompt and afterglow emission properties of this burst revealed that, unlike the bright prompt emission, the afterglow of GRB 230812B is fainter than the other SN-detected bright bursts (GRB 130427A and GRB 171010A) at a similar redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed by von Essen et al. (2020) based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere provides lessons for the search for life. The detection has survived all challenges and has acquired independent support from archival data from PVP. The presence of phosphine in Venus' oxidising environment is perplexing, and comprehensive studies rule out all known abiotic sources. More data is needed to understand the origin of phosphine, leading to JCMT-Venus, a long term atmospheric monitoring programme. This can find how phosphine varies in relation to other species providing clues to its origin. We present the latest JCMT-Venus results. The discovery and subsequent papers were explicit that they did not constitute evidence for life, only of phosphine. Media and public reaction to the discovery and its implications provide lessons for future life searches, as does the reaction of the scientific community. How this was handled by the team, media, and general public will be reviewed.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAHs-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative way is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated or deuteronated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out of plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes belonging to PAHs with single to multiple deuteration in the same ring are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. We found that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at 14-19 micron range, which does not overlap with the region attributed to C-Hoop modes. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to D/H in PAHs. In addition, new C-Hoop modes also appear due to the creation of new C-H bonds upon deuteration of duet, trio, and quartet C-H sites. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our analysis of MAXI J1813-095 during its hard state ``stalled'' outburst in 2018. This self-consistent analysis has been carried out using \NICER, \Swift, \Chandra, and {\NuSTAR} throughout seven observations of MAXI J1813-095. We find a relativistic iron line at $\sim$6.5 keV from the inner region of the accretion disk. Our results are consistent with a slightly truncated disk or non-truncated disk for an inner radius of $\sim$2$R_\mathrm{g}$ and minimum spin of $>$0.7 with a best value of $\sim0.9$, assuming $R_\mathrm{in}$ reaches the innermost stable circular orbit at $\it{L_\mathrm{x}}$ $\sim$ 1\% $\it{L_\mathrm{Edd}}$. We analyzed MAXI J1813-095 over its outburst employing a spectral model which self-consistently couples the seed disk photons to the Comptonization and reflection components, also inclusive of reflection Comptonization. The unique aspect of this work is a reflection fraction of order unity, which is significantly higher than previous studies of this source, and is a consequence of applying the self-consistent disk-Comptonization-reflection spectral model. Other key parameters such as inclination and inner radius are found to be consistent with other works. works.

 - **Abstract**
 The curvature perturbation in a model of constant-roll (CR) inflation is interpreted in view of the logarithmic duality discovered in Ref. [1] according to the $\delta N$ formalism. We confirm that the critical value $\beta:=\ddot{\varphi}/(H\dot{\varphi})=-3/2$ determining whether the CR condition is stable or not is understood as the point at which the dual solutions, i.e., the attractor and non-attractor solutions of the field equation, are interchanged. For the attractor-solution domination, the curvature perturbation in the CR model is given by a simple logarithmic mapping of a Gaussian random field, which can realise both the exponential tail (i.e., the single exponential decay) and the Gumbel-distribution-like tail (i.e., the double exponential decay) of the probability density function, depending on the value of $\beta$. Such a tail behaviour is important for, e.g., the estimation of the primordial black hole abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra hot Jupiters (gas giants, Teq>2000 K) are intriguing exoplanets due to their extreme atmospheres. Their torrid daysides can be characterised using ground-based high-resolution emission spectroscopy. We search for signatures of neutral and singly ionised iron (Fe I and Fe II) in the dayside of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-76 b, as these species were detected via transmission spectroscopy in this exoplanet. Furthermore, we aim to confirm the existence of a thermal inversion layer, which has been reported in previous studies, and attempt to constrain its properties. We observed WASP-76 b on four epochs with ESPRESSO at the VLT, at orbital phases shortly before and after the secondary transit, when the dayside is in view. We present the first analysis of high-resolution optical emission spectra for this exoplanet. We compare the data to synthetic templates from petitRADTRANS, using cross-correlation function techniques. We detect a blueshifted (-4.7+-0.3 km/s) Fe I emission signature on the dayside of WASP-76 b at 6.0-sigma. The signal is detected independently both before and after the eclipse, and blueshifted in both cases. The presence of iron emission features confirms the existence of a thermal inversion layer. Fe II was not detected, possibly because this species is located in the upper layers of the atmosphere, which are more optically thin. Thus the Fe II signature on the dayside of WASP-76 b is too weak to be detected with emission spectroscopy. We propose that the blueshifted Fe I signature is created by material rising from the hot spot to the upper layers of the atmosphere, and discuss possible scenarios related to the position of the hotspot. This work unveils some of the dynamic processes ongoing on the dayside of WASP-76 b through the analysis of the Fe I signature from its atmosphere, and complements previous knowledge obtained from transmission studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-radiative shocks accelerate particles and heat astrophysical plasmas. While supernova remnants are the most well-studied example, neutron star (NS) bow shocks are also non-radiative and Balmer-dominated. NS bow shocks are likely ubiquitous in the interstellar medium due to their large speeds imparted at birth, and they are thought to be a discrete source population contributing to the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum. To date, nine NS bow shocks have been directly observed in H$\alpha$ images. Most of these shocks have been characterized using narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging and slit spectroscopy, which do not resolve the multi-component velocity structure of the shocks and their spatial geometry. Here we present integral field spectroscopy of three NS bow shocks: J0742$-$2822, J1741$-$2054, and J2225$+$6535 (the Guitar Nebula). We measure the shock properties simultaneously in four dimensions: the 2D projected shock morphology, the radial velocity structure, and the H$\alpha$ flux. The broad-to-narrow line ratio ($I_{\rm b}/I_{\rm n}$) is inferred from radial velocity profiles, and for J1741$-$2054 the narrow line is detected in multiple regions of the shock. The inferred line ratios and widths suggest that NS bow shocks represent a low shock velocity regime in which electron-ion temperature equilibration is low, contrary to the trend seen in supernova remnants. While the low velocity regime is poorly captured by state-of-the-art simulations, these results may imply electron injection efficiency is lower for bow shocks than their counterparts in supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 High-cadence surveys of the sky are revealing that a large fraction of red-supergiant (RSG) stars, which are progenitors of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe), explode within circumstellar material (CSM). Such SNe II-P/CSM exhibit considerable diversity, with interaction signatures lasting from hours to days, potentially merging with the Type IIn subclass for which longer-duration interaction typically occurs. To tackle this growing sample of transients and to understand the pre-SN mass loss histories of RSGs, we train on the highest quality, spectropolarimetric observations of a young Type IIn SN taken to date: Those of SN1998S at ~5d after explosion. We design an approach based on a combination of radiation hydrodynamics with HERACLES and polarized radiative transfer with CMFGEN and LONG_POL. The adopted asymmetries are based on a latitudinal, depth- and time-independent, scaling of the density of 1D models of SNe II-P/CSM (e.g., model r1w6b with a `wind' mass-loss rate of 0.01Msun/yr used for SN2023ixf). For a pole-to-equator density ratio of five, we find that the polarization reaches, and then remains for days, at a maximum value of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8% as the CSM extent is changed from 6, to 8 and 10x10^14cm. The polarization is independent of wavelength away from funnel-shaped depolarizations within emission lines. Our models implicate a significant depolarization at line cores, which we use to constrain the interstellar polarization of SN1998S. Our 2D, prolate ejecta models with moderate asymmetry match well the spectropolarimetric observations of SN1998S at 5d, supporting a polarization level of about ~2%. This study provides a framework for interpreting future spectropolarimetric observations of SNe II-P/CSM and SNe IIn and fostering a better understanding of the origin of their pre-SN mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate mergers between star clusters embedded within their natal giant molecular cloud. We extract initial conditions from cloud-scale simulations of cluster formation and introduce different prescriptions for primordial binaries. We find that simulations that do not include primordial binaries result in a larger fraction of unbound stars than simulations which include a prescription for binaries based on observations. We also find a preferred direction of motion for stars that become unbound during the merger. Sub-cluster mergers within realistic gas environments promote binary disruption while mergers between idealized, gas-rich spherical clusters do not produce the same disruption. Binary systems with smaller semi-major axes are disrupted in simulations of sub-cluster mergers within their natal environment compared to simulations that do not include the realistic gas environment. We conclude that binary disruption and the production of an anisotropic distribution of unbound stars are the natural consequences of sub-cluster mergers during star cluster assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 Obtaining tight constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a key step in discriminating between different models for cosmic inflation. The constraining power from large-scale structure (LSS) measurements is expected to overtake that from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies with the next generation of galaxy surveys including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid. We consider whether Density-Split Clustering (DSC) can help improve PNG constraints from these surveys for local, equilateral and orthogonal types. DSC separates a surveyed volume into regions based on local density and measures the clustering statistics within each environment. Using the Quijote simulations and the Fisher information formalism, we compare PNG constraints from the standard halo power spectrum, DSC power spectra and joint halo/DSC power spectra. We find that the joint halo/DSC power spectra outperform the halo power spectrum by factors of $\sim$ 1.4, 8.8, and 3.6 for local, equilateral and orthogonal PNG, respectively. This is driven by the higher-order information that DSC captures on small scales. We find that applying DSC to a halo field does not allow sample variance cancellation on large scales by providing multiple tracers of the same volume with different local PNG responses. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier space analysis for DSC and study the impact of several modifications to the pipeline, such as varying the smoothing radius and the number of density environments and replacing random query positions with lattice points.

          Planet Mass and Metallicity: The Exoplanets and Solar System Connection

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical studies of giant planet formation suggest that substantial quantities of metals - elements heavier than hydrogen and helium - can be delivered by solid accretion during the envelope-assembly phase. This metal enhancement process is believed to diminish as a function of planet mass, leading to predictions for a mass-metallicity relationship. This picture is supported by the abundance of CH$_4$ in solar system giant planets, which is unaffected by condensation, unlike H$_2$O. However, all of the solar system giants exhibit some evidence for stratification of metals outside of their cores. In this context, two fundamental questions are whether metallicity of giant planets inferred from observations of the outer envelope layers represents their bulk metallicities, and if not, how are metals distributed within these planets. Comparing the mass-metallicity relationship inferred for solar system giants with various tracers of exoplanet metallicity has yielded a range of results. There is evidence of a solar-system-like mass-metallicity trend using bulk density estimates of exoplanets. However, transit-spectroscopy-based tracers of exoplanet metallicity, which probe only the outer layers of the envelope, are less clear about a mass-metallicity trend and radial composition gradients. The large number of known exoplanets enables statistical characterization. We develop a formalism for comparing both the metallicity inferred for the outer envelope and the metallicity inferred using the bulk density and show this combination may offer insights into metal stratification within planetary envelopes. Thus, future exoplanet observations with JWST and Ariel will be able to shed light on the conditions governing radial composition gradients in exoplanets and, perhaps, provide information about the factors controlling stratification and convection in our solar system gas giants.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase abundance ratios between \ce{C2H4O2} isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed towards a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated \ce{C2H4O2} abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption ($\sim$125--160~K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of COM production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.
