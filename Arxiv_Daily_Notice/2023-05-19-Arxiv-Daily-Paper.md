 - **Abstract**
 At 7.7 pc, the A-type star Fomalhaut hosts a bright debris disk with multiple radial components. The disk is eccentric and misaligned, strongly suggesting that it is sculpted by interaction with one or more planets. Compact sources are now being detected with JWST, suggesting that new planet detections may be imminent. However, to confirm such sources as companions, common proper motion with the star must be established, as with unprecedented sensitivity comes a high probability that planet candidates are actually background objects. Here, ALMA and Keck observations of Fomalhaut are found to show significant emission at the same sky location as multiple compact sources in JWST MIRI coronagraphic observations, one of which has been dubbed the "Great Dust Cloud" because it lies within the outer belt. Since the ground-based data were obtained between 6 to 18 years prior to the JWST observations, these compact sources are unlikely to be common proper motion companions to Fomalhaut. More generally, this work illustrates that images collected at a range of wavelengths can be valuable for rejecting planet candidates uncovered via direct imaging with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of deep, ground based U-band imaging with the Large Binocular Telescope of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field as part of the near-UV imaging program, UVCANDELS. We utilize a seeing sorted stacking method along with night-to-night relative transparency corrections to create optimal depth and optimal resolution mosaics in the U-band, which are capable of reaching point source magnitudes of AB 26.5 mag at 3 sigma. These ground based mosaics bridge the wavelength gap between the HST WFC3 F27W and ACS F435W images and are necessary to understand galaxy assembly in the last 9-10 Gyr. We use the depth of these mosaics to search for the presence of U-band intragroup light (IGrL) beyond the local Universe. Regardless of how groups are scaled and stacked, we do not detect any U-band IGrL to unprecedented U-band depths of 29.1-29.6 mag/arcsec2, which corresponds to an IGrL fraction of less than 1% of the total group light. This stringent upper limit suggests that IGrL does not contribute significantly to the Extragalactic Background Light at short wavelengths. Furthermore, the lack of UV IGrL observed in these stacks suggests that the atomic gas observed in the intragroup medium (IGrM) is likely not dense enough to trigger star formation on large scales. Future studies may detect IGrL by creating similar stacks at longer wavelengths or by pre-selecting groups which are older and/or more dynamically evolved similar to past IGrL observations of compact groups and loose groups with signs of gravitational interactions.
#### Low-period spacing core-helium burning giants: `hot subdwarf analogues'?

 - **Abstract**
 Global stellar oscillations probe the internal structure of stars. In low- to intermediate-mass red giants, these oscillations provide signatures from both the outer regions of the star as well as from the core. These signatures are imprinted in e.g. the frequency of maximum oscillation power, and in the differences in periods of non-radial oscillations (period spacings), respectively. In core helium burning giants with masses below about 1.7 solar masses, i.e. stars that have gone through a helium flash, the asymptotic period spacings take values of about 220 -350 s at frequency of maximum oscillation power of $\sim$30-50 $\mu$Hz. A set of stars with asymptotic period spacings lower than about 200 s at similar frequencies separations has recently been discovered by Elsworth and collaborators. In this work, we present a hypothesis for the formation scenario of these stars. We find that these stars can be the result of a mass-loss event at the end of the red-giant branch phase of stars massive enough to not have a degenerate core, i.e. one of the scenarios to form hot subdwarf stars. Therefore, these stars can be classified as `hot subdwarf analogues'. Interestingly, if mass loss continues gradually during the core helium burning phase, these stars turn hotter and denser, and could, therefore, be hot subdwarf progenitors as they shed more of their envelope.
#### HI Self-absorption toward the Cygnus X North: From Atomic Filament to  Molecular Filament

 - **Abstract**
 Using the HI self-absorption data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we perform a study of the cold atomic gas in the Cygnus-X North region. The most remarkable HI cloud is characterized by a filamentary structure, associated in space and in velocity with the principle molecular filament in the Cygnus-X North region. We investigate the transition from the atomic filament to the molecular filament. We find that the HII regions Cygnus OB2 and G081.920+00.138 play a critical role in compressing and shaping the atomic Cygnus-X North filament, where the molecular filament subsequently forms. The cold HI in the DR21 filament has a much larger column density (N(HI) $\sim$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$) than the theoretical value of the residual atomic gas ($\sim$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$), suggesting that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition is still in progress. The timescale of the HI-to-H$_2$ transition is estimated to be 3 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ yr, which approximates the ages of massive protostars in the Cygnus-X North region. This implies that the formation of molecular clouds and massive stars may occur almost simultaneously in the DR21 filament, in accord with a picture of rapid and dynamic cloud evolution.
#### Equilibrium dynamical models for the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has a complex dynamics driven by both internal and external processes. The external forces are due to tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way, while internally its dynamics mainly depends on the stellar, gas, and dark matter mass distributions. Despite the overall complexity of the system, very often simple physical models can give us important insights about the main driving factors. Here we focus on the internal forces and attempt to model the proper motions of $\sim10^6$ stars in the LMC as measured by Gaia Data Release 3 with an axisymmetric dynamical model, based on the Jeans equations. We test both cored and cusped spherical Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halos to fit the LMC gravitational potential. We find that this simple model is very successful at selecting a clean sample of genuine LMC member stars and predicts the geometry and orientation of the LMC with respect to the observer within the constraint of axisymmetry. Our Jeans dynamical models describe well the rotation profile and the velocity dispersion of the LMC stellar disc, however they fail to describe the motions of the LMC bar, which is a non-axisymmetric feature dominating the central region. We plan a triaxial Schwarzschild approach as a next step for the dynamical modelling of the LMC.
