 - **Abstract**
 Context. Upcoming space missions will provide us with surface-resolved NEA reflectance spectra. Neural networks are useful tools for analysing reflectance spectra and determining material composition with high precision and low processing time. Aims. We applied neural-network models on disk-resolved spectra of the Eros and Itokawa asteroids observed by the NEAR Shoemaker and Hayabusa spacecraft. With this approach, the mineral variations or intensity of space weathering can be mapped. Methods. We tested two types of convolutional neural networks. The first one was trained using asteroid reflectance spectra with known taxonomy classes. The other one used silicate reflectance spectra with assigned mineral abundances and compositions. Results. The reliability of the classification model depends on the resolution of reflectance spectra. Typical F1 score and Cohen's ${\kappa}_C$ values decrease from about 0.90 for high-resolution spectra to about 0.70 for low-resolution spectra. The predicted silicate composition does not strongly depend on spectrum resolution and coverage of the 2${\mu}$m band of pyroxene. The typical root mean square error is between 6 and 10 percentage points. For the Eros and Itokawa asteroids, the predicted taxonomy classes favour the S-type and the predicted surface compositions are homogeneous and correspond to the composition of L/LL and LL ordinary chondrites, respectively. On the Itokawa surface, the model identified fresh spots that were connected with craters or coarse-grain areas. Conclusions. The neural network models trained with measured spectra of asteroids and silicate samples are suitable for deriving surface silicate mineralogy with a reasonable level of accuracy. The predicted surface mineralogy is comparable to the mineralogy of returned samples measured in the laboratory. Moreover, the taxonomical predictions can point out locations of fresher areas.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolutionary path of the Fornax cluster galaxy NGC$~$1436, which is known to be currently transitioning from a spiral into a lenticular morphology. This galaxy hosts an inner star-forming disc and an outer quiescent disc, and we analyse data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey, ALMA, and the Fornax3D survey to study the interstellar medium and the stellar populations of both disc components. Thanks to the combination of high resolution and sensitivity of the MeerKAT data, we find that the $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ is entirely confined within the inner star-forming disc, and that its kinematics is coincident with that of the CO. The cold gas disc is now well settled, which suggests that the galaxy has not been affected by any environmental interactions in the last $\sim1~$Gyr. The star formation history derived from the Fornax3D data shows that both the inner and outer disc experienced a burst of star formation $\sim5$ Gyr ago, followed by rapid quenching in the outer disc and by slow quenching in the inner disc, which continues forming stars to this day. We claim that NGC$~$1436 has begun to effectively interact with the cluster environment 5$~$Gyr ago, when a combination of gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions caused the temporary enhancement of the star-formation rate. Furthermore, due to the weaker gravitational binding $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$ was stripped from the outer disc, causing its rapid quenching. At the same time, accretion of gas onto the inner disc stopped, causing slow quenching in this region.

 - **Abstract**
 We used high-resolution [C II] 158 $\mu$m mapping of two nebulae IC 59 and IC 63 from SOFIA/upGREAT in conjunction with ancillary data on the gas, dust, and polarization to probe the kinematics, structure, and magnetic properties of their photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). The nebulae are part of the Sh 2-185 H II region illuminated by the B0 IVe star $\gamma$ Cas. The velocity structure of each PDR changes with distance from $\gamma$ Cas, consistent with driving by the radiation. Based on previous FUV flux measurements of, and the known distance to $\gamma$ Cas along with the predictions of 3D distances to the clouds, we estimated the FUV radiation field strength (G0) at the clouds. Assuming negligible extinction between the star and clouds, we find their 3D distances from $\gamma$ Cas. For IC 63, our results are consistent with earlier estimates of distance from Andersson et al. (2013), locating the cloud at 2 pc from $\gamma$ Cas, at an angle of 58 to the plane of the sky, behind the star. For IC 59, we derive a distance of 4.5 pc at an angle of 70 in front of the star. We do not detect any significant correlation between the orientation of the magnetic field (Soam et al. 2017) and the velocity gradients of [C II] gas, indicating a moderate magnetic field strength. The kinetic energy in IC 63 is estimated to be order of ten higher than the magnetic energies. This suggests that kinetic pressure in this nebula is dominant.
#### Case A or Case B? The effective recombination coefficient in gas clouds  of arbitrary optical thickness

 - **Abstract**
 In calculations of the ionization state, one is often forced to choose between the Case A recombination coefficient $\alpha_{\rm A}$ (sum over recombinations to all hydrogen states) or the Case B recombination coefficient $\alpha_{\rm B}$ (sum over all hydrogen states except the ground state). If the cloud is optically thick to ionizing photons, $\alpha_{\rm B}$ is usually adopted on the basis of the "on-the-spot" approximation, wherein recombinations to the ground state are ignored because they produce ionizing photons absorbed nearby. In the opposite case of an optically thin cloud, one would expect the Case A recombination coefficient to better describe the effective recombination rate in the cloud. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the effective recombination coefficient in a gas cloud of arbitrary optical thickness which transitions from $\alpha_{\rm A}$ to $\alpha_{\rm B}$ as the optical thickness increases. The results can be readily implemented in numerical simulations and semi-analytical calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy cluster Zwicky 3146 is a sloshing cool core cluster at $z{=}0.291$ that in SZ imaging does not appear to exhibit significant pressure substructure in the intracluster medium (ICM). We perform a surface brightness fluctuation analysis via Fourier amplitude spectra on SZ (MUSTANG-2) and X-ray (XMM-Newton) images of this cluster. These surface brightness fluctuations can be deprojected to infer pressure and density fluctuations from the SZ and X-ray data, respectively. In the central region (Ring 1, $r < 100^{\prime\prime} = 440$ kpc, in our analysis) we find fluctuation spectra that suggest injection scales around 200 kpc ($\sim 140$ kpc from pressure fluctuations and $\sim 250$ kpc from density fluctuations). When comparing the pressure and density fluctuations in the central region, we observe a change in the effective thermodynamic state from large to small scales, from isobaric (likely due to the slow sloshing) to adiabatic (due to more vigorous motions). By leveraging scalings from hydrodynamical simulations, we find an average 3D Mach number $\approx0.5$. We further compare our results to other studies of Zwicky 3146 and, more broadly, to other studies of fluctuations in other clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Abridged - Stars with ZAMS masses between 140 and $260 M_\odot$ are thought to explode as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). During their thermonuclear runaway, PISNe can produce up to several tens of solar masses of radioactive nickel, resulting in luminous transients similar to some superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). Yet, no unambiguous PISN has been discovered so far. SN2018ibb is a H-poor SLSN at $z=0.166$ that evolves extremely slowly compared to the hundreds of known SLSNe. Between mid 2018 and early 2022, we monitored its photometric and spectroscopic evolution from the UV to the NIR with 2-10m class telescopes. SN2018ibb radiated $>3\times10^{51} \rm erg$ during its evolution, and its bolometric light curve reached $>2\times10^{44} \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at peak. The long-lasting rise of $>93$ rest-frame days implies a long diffusion time, which requires a very high total ejected mass. The PISN mechanism naturally provides both the energy source ($^{56}$Ni) and the long diffusion time. Theoretical models of PISNe make clear predictions for their photometric and spectroscopic properties. SN2018ibb complies with most tests on the light curves, nebular spectra and host galaxy, potentially all tests with the interpretation we propose. Both the light curve and the spectra require 25-44 $M_\odot$ of freshly nucleosynthesised $^{56}$Ni, pointing to the explosion of a metal-poor star with a He-core mass of 120-130 $M_\odot$ at the time of death. This interpretation is also supported by the tentative detection of [Co II]$\lambda$1.025$\mu$m, which has never been observed in any other PISN candidate or SLSN before. Powering by a central engine, such as a magnetar or a black hole, can be excluded with high confidence. This makes SN2018ibb by far the best candidate for being a PISN, to date.
#### A 3D physico-chemical model of a pre-stellar core. I. Environmental and  structural impact on the distribution of CH$_3$OH and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-stellar cores represent the earliest stage of the star- and planet-formation process. By characterizing the physical and chemical structure of these cores we can establish the initial conditions for star and planet formation and determine to what degree the chemical composition of pre-stellar cores is inherited to the later stages. A 3D MHD model of a pre-stellar core embedded in a dynamic star-forming cloud is post-processed using sequentially continuum radiative transfer, a gas-grain chemical model, and a line-radiative transfer model. Results are analyzed and compared to observations of CH$_3$OH and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ in L1544. Nine different chemical models are compared to the observations to determine which initial conditions are compatible with the observed chemical segregation in the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. The model is able to reproduce several aspects of the observed chemical differentiation in L1544. Extended methanol emission is shifted towards colder and more shielded regions of the core envelope while $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ emission overlaps with the dust continuum, consistent with the observed chemical structure. Increasing the strength of the interstellar radiation field or the cosmic-ray ionization rate with respect to the typical values assumed in nearby star-forming regions leads to synthetic maps that are inconsistent with the observed chemical structure. Our model shows that the observed chemical dichotomy in L1544 can arise as a result of uneven illumination due to the asymmetrical structure of the 3D core and the environment within which the core has formed. This highlights the importance of the 3D structure at the core-cloud transition on the chemistry of pre-stellar cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultracool stellar atmospheres show absorption by alkali resonance lines severely broadened by collisions with neutral perturbers. In the coolest and densest atmospheres, such as those of T dwarfs, Na I and K I broadened by molecular hydrogen and helium can come to dominate the entire optical spectrum. The effects of NaHe collision broadening are also central to understanding the opacity of cool DZ white dwarf stars. In order to be able to construct synthetic spectra of brown dwarfs and cool DZ white dwarfs, where helium density can reach several 10^21~cm-3 NaHe line profiles of the resonance lines have been computed over a wide range of densities and temperatures. Unified line profiles that are valid from the core to the far wings at high densities are calculated in the semiclassical approach using up-to-date molecular data including in particular electronic spin-orbit coupling from the sodium atom. We present a comprehensive study of Na-He collisional profiles at high density, and temperatures from 5000~K, the temperature prevailing in the atmosphere of ultra-cool DZ white dwarf stars, down to 1~K, the temperature in liquid helium clusters. Collision broadening and shift parameters within the impact approximation obtained in the semiclassical and quantum theory using our new accurate molecular data are presented.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernova explosions play a wide role in astrophysics by producing compact remnants (neutron stars, black holes) and the synthesis and injection of many heavy elements into their host Galaxy. Because they are produced in some of the most extreme conditions in the universe, they can also probe physics in extreme conditions (matter at nuclear densities and extreme temperatures and magnetic fields). To quantify the impact of supernovae on both fundamental physics and our understanding of the Universe, we must leverage a broad set of observables of this engine. In this paper, we study a subset of these probes using a suite of 1-dimensional, parameterized mixing models: ejecta remnants from supernovae, ultraviolet, optical and infra-red lightcurves, and transient gamma-ray emission. We review the other diagnostics and show how the different probes tie together to provide a more clear picture of the supernova engine.

 - **Abstract**
 There are no planets intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune in our Solar System, yet these objects are found around a substantial fraction of other stars. Population statistics show that close-in planets in this size range bifurcate into two classes based on their radii. It is hypothesized that the group with larger radii (referred to as "sub-Neptunes") is distinguished by having hydrogen-dominated atmospheres that are a few percent of the total mass of the planets. GJ 1214b is an archetype sub-Neptune that has been observed extensively using transmission spectroscopy to test this hypothesis. However, the measured spectra are featureless, and thus inconclusive, due to the presence of high-altitude aerosols in the planet's atmosphere. Here we report a spectroscopic thermal phase curve of GJ 1214b obtained with JWST in the mid-infrared. The dayside and nightside spectra (average brightness temperatures of 553 $\pm$ 9 and 437 $\pm$ 19 K, respectively) each show >3$\sigma$ evidence of absorption features, with H$_2$O as the most likely cause in both. The measured global thermal emission implies that GJ 1214b's Bond albedo is 0.51 $\pm$ 0.06. Comparison between the spectroscopic phase curve data and three-dimensional models of GJ 1214b reveal a planet with a high metallicity atmosphere blanketed by a thick and highly reflective layer of clouds or haze.
#### Jet-powered turbulence in common envelope evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a common envelope evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) spirals-in inside the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) star in a predetermined orbit. We find that the jets shed pairs of vortices in an expanding spiral pattern, inflate two expanding spirally-shaped low-density bubbles, one above and one below the equatorial plane, and deposit angular momentum to the envelope. In the simulation we do not include the gravity of the NS such that all effects we find are solely due to the jets that the spiralling-in NS launches. The angular momentum that the jets deposit to the envelope is of the same order of magnitude as the orbital angular momentum and has the same direction. The turbulence that the jets induce in the common envelope might play a role in transporting energy and angular momentum. The jet-deposited energy that is radiated away (a process not studied here) leads to a transient event that is termed common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) and might mimic an energetic core collapse supernova. The turbulence and the spiral pattern that we explore here might lead to bumps in the late light curve of the CEJSN when different segments of the ejected envelope collide with each other. This study emphasises the roles that jets can play in CEE (including jets launched by black hole companions) and adds to the rich variety of processes in CEJSN events.
#### 3D evolution of neutron star magnetic-fields from a realistic  core-collapse turbulent topology

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first 3D fully coupled magneto-thermal simulations of neutron stars (including the most realistic background structure and microphysical ingredients so far) applied to a very complex initial magnetic field topology in the crust, similar to what recently obtained by proto-neutron star dynamo simulations. In such configurations, most of the energy is stored in the toroidal field, while the dipolar component is a few percent of the mean magnetic field. This initial feature is maintained during the long-term evolution (1e6 yr), since the Hall term favours a direct cascade (compensating for Ohmic dissipation) rather than a strong inverse cascade, for such an initial field topology. The surface dipolar component, responsible for the dominant electromagnetic spin-down torque, does not show any increase in time, when starting from this complex initial topology. This is at contrast with the timing properties of young pulsars and magnetars which point to higher values of the surface dipolar fields. A possibility is that the deep-seated magnetic field (currents in the core) is able to self-organize in large scales (during the collapse or in the early life of a neutron star). Alternatively, the dipolar field might be lower than is usually thought, with magnetosphere substantially contributing to the observed high spin-down, via e.g., strong winds or strong coronal magnetic loops, which can also provide a natural explanation to the tiny surface hotspots inferred from X-ray data.
