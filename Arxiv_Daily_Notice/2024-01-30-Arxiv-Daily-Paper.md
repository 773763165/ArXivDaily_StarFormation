 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological observational programs often compare their data not only with $\Lambda$CDM, but also with dark energy (DE) models, whose time-dependent equations of state (EoS) differ from a cosmological constant. We identified a generic issue in the standard procedure of computing the expansion history for models with time-dependent EoS, which leads to bias in the interpretation of the results. In order to compute the evolution of models with time-dependent EoS parameter $w$ in a consistent manner, we introduce an enhanced computational procedure, which accounts for the correct choice of initial conditions in the respective backward-in-time and forward-in-time evolution of the equations of motion. We implement our enhanced procedure in an amended version of the code CLASS, where we focus on exemplary DE models which are based on the CPL parameterization, studying cases with monotonically increasing and decreasing $w$ over cosmic time. Our results reveal that a cosmological DE model with a decreasing $w$ of the form $w(a)=-0.9 + 0.1(1-a)$ could provide a resolution to the Hubble tension problem. Moreover, we find characteristic signatures in the late expansion histories of models, allowing a phenomenological discrimination of DE candidates. Finally, we argue that our enhanced scheme should be implemented as a novel consistency check for cosmological models within current Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) methods. Our enhanced computational procedure avoids the interpretational bias to which the standard procedure is unwittingly exposed. As a result, DE models can be better constrained. If implemented into MCMC codes, we expect that our scheme will contribute to providing a significant improvement in the determined accuracy of cosmological model parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological probes constructed in large-scale surveys are independent of the underlying theory of gravity, and their relativistic descriptions are indeed applicable to any theory of gravity. It was shown that the presence of fluctuations with wavelength much larger than the characteristic scales of the surveys has no impact on cosmological probes, if the matter content is adiabatic and the Einstein equations are used. In this paper we study the sensitivity of cosmological probes to infrared fluctuations in Horndeski theory. We find that the extra degree of freedom in the Horndeski scalar field can induce sensitivity to infrared fluctuations in the cosmological probes, even when the matter components are adiabatic on large scales. A generalized adiabatic condition including the extra dof, in contrast, guarantees that cosmological probes are devoid of infrared sensitivity, and this solution corresponds to the adiabatic modes \`a la Weinberg in Horndeski theory, which can be removed by a coordinate transformation in the infrared limit. We discuss the implications of our findings and the connections to the initial conditions.
#### $ω$ Centauri: A MUSE discovery of a counter-rotating core

 - **Abstract**
 $\omega$ Centauri is considered the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way and likely the former nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way. It is speculated to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) from several dynamical models. However, uncertainties regarding the location of the cluster center or the retention of stellar remnants limit the robustness of the IMBH detections reported so far. In this paper, we derive and study the stellar kinematics from the highest-resolution spectroscopic data yet, using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in the narrow field mode (NFM) and wide field mode (WFM). Our exceptional data near the center reveal for the first time that stars within the inner 20" ($\sim$0.5 pc) counter-rotate relative to the bulk rotation of the cluster. Using this dataset, we measure the rotation and line-of-sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD) profile out to 120$''$ with different centers proposed in the literature. We find that the velocity dispersion profiles using different centers match well with those previously published. Based on the counter--rotation, we determine a kinematic center and look for any signs of an IMBH using the high-velocity stars close to the center. We do not find any significant outliers $>$60 km/s within the central 20$''$, consistent with no IMBH being present at the center of $\omega$ Centauri. A detailed analysis of Jeans' modeling of the putative IMBH will be presented in the next paper of the series.
#### The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. III.  $\texttt{BTSbot}$: Automated Identification and Follow-up of Bright  Transients with Deep Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) aims to obtain a classification spectrum for all bright ($m_\mathrm{peak}\,\leq\,18.5\,$mag) extragalactic transients found in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey. BTS critically relies on visual inspection ("scanning") to select targets for spectroscopic follow-up, which, while effective, has required a significant time investment over the past $\sim5$ yr of ZTF operations. We present $\texttt{BTSbot}$, a multi-modal convolutional neural network, which provides a bright transient score to individual ZTF detections using their image data and 25 extracted features. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ is able to eliminate the need for daily human scanning by automatically identifying and requesting spectroscopic follow-up observations of new bright transient candidates. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ recovers all bright transients in our test split and performs on par with scanners in terms of identification speed (on average, $\sim$1 hour quicker than scanners). We also find that $\texttt{BTSbot}$ is not significantly impacted by any data shift by comparing performance across a concealed test split and a sample of very recent BTS candidates. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ has been integrated into Fritz and $\texttt{Kowalski}$, ZTF's first-party marshal and alert broker, and now sends automatic spectroscopic follow-up requests for the new transients it identifies. During the month of October 2023, $\texttt{BTSbot}$ selected 296 sources in real-time, 93% of which were real extragalactic transients. With $\texttt{BTSbot}$ and other automation tools, the BTS workflow has produced the first fully automatic end-to-end discovery and classification of a transient, representing a significant reduction in the human-time needed to scan. Future development has tremendous potential for creating similar models to identify and request follow-up observations for specific types of transients.
#### Entropy-calibrated stellar modeling: Testing and improving the use of  prescriptions for entropy of adiabatic convection

 - **Abstract**
 The modeling of convection is a long standing problem in stellar physics. Up-to-now, all ad hoc models rely on a free parameter alpha (among others) which has no real physical justification and is therefore poorly constrained. However, a link exists between this free parameter and the entropy of the stellar adiabat. Prescriptions, derived from 3D stellar atmospheric models, are available that provide entropy as a function of stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, chemical composition). This can provide constraints on alpha through the development of entropy-calibrated models. Several questions arise as these models are increasingly used. Which prescription should be used? How do uncertainties impact entropy-calibrated models? We aim to study the three existing prescriptions and determine which one should be used, and how. We implemented the entropy-calibration method into the stellar evolution code Cesam2k20 and performed comparisons with the Sun and the alpha Cen system. In addition, we used data from the CIFIST grid of 3D atmosphere models to evaluate the accuracy of the prescriptions. Of the three entropy prescriptions available, we determine which one best reproduces the entropies of the 3D models. We also demonstrate that the entropy obtained from this prescription should be corrected for the evolving chemical composition and for an entropy offset different between various EoS tables, following a precise procedure, otherwise classical parameters obtained from the models will be strongly biased. Finally, we also provide table with entropy of the adiabat of the CIFIST grid, as well as fits of these entropies. We performed a precise examination of entropy-calibrated modelling, and gave recommendations on which adiabatic entropy prescription to use, how to correct it and to implement the method into a stellar evolution code.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the scientific principles of anthropogenic climate change are well-established, existing calculations of the warming effect of carbon dioxide rely on spectral absorption databases, which obscures the physical foundations of the climate problem. Here we show how CO2 radiative forcing can be expressed via a first-principles description of the molecule's key vibrational-rotational transitions. Our analysis elucidates the dependence of carbon dioxide's effectiveness as a greenhouse gas on the Fermi resonance between the symmetric stretch mode $\nu_1$ and bending mode $\nu_2$. It is remarkable that an apparently accidental quantum resonance in an otherwise ordinary three-atom molecule has had such a large impact on our planet's climate over geologic time, and will also help determine its future warming due to human activity. In addition to providing a simple explanation of CO2 radiative forcing on Earth, our results may have implications for understanding radiation and climate on other planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) leads to asymmetric matter ejection and neutrino emission, that potentially accounts for the origin of neutron star (NS) kick. Asymmetric neutrino radiation fields are, in general, accompanied by large-scale inhomogeneous fluid distributions, in particular for electron-fraction ($Y_e$) distributions. Recently, it has also been revealed that lower $Y_e$ environments in proto-neutron star envelope can offer preferable conditions for collective neutrino oscillations. In this paper, we show that a dipole asymmetry of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC), one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes, can power a NS kick, and that it would generate a characteristic correlation between asymmetric distributions of heavy elements in the ejecta and the direction of NS kick. We strengthen our argument for the FFC-driven NS kick mechanism by performing axisymmetric neutrino transport simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We show that this mechanism can generate sufficient linear momentum of neutrinos to account for typical proper motions of NS. Although more detailed studies are necessary, the present study opens a new channel to give a natal NS kick.
#### Subgrid modeling of neutrino oscillations in astrophysics

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15247
 - **Abstract**
 Approximating neutrino oscillations as subgrid physics is an appealing prospect for simulators of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Because flavor instabilities quickly lead to quasisteady states in oscillation calculations, it is widely believed that flavor mixing can be approximated in astrophysical simulations by mapping unstable states onto the appropriate asymptotic ones. Subgrid models of this kind, however, are not self-consistent. The miscidynamic theory of quantum-coherent gases furnishes a subgrid model that is.

 - **Abstract**
 The lightcurves of asteroids are essential for determining their physical characteristics, including shape, spin, size, and surface composition. However, most asteroids are missing some of these basic physical parameters due to lack of photometric data. Although a few telescopes or surveys are specially designed for photometric lightcurve observations of asteroids, many ground-based and space-based sky surveys for hunting new exoplanets, transient events, etc., should capture numerous small Solar System objects. This will benefit the physical studies of these objects. In order to extract data of these moving objects from time-domain photometric surveys, we have developed a new method using the model tree algorithm in the field of machine learning. A dedicated module is built to automatically identify moving objects in dataset, and extract their photometric and astrometric data. As the first application of this novel method, we have analyzed data in five fields of the Yunnan-Hong Kong wide field photometric (YNHK) survey, from which 538 lightcurves of 211 asteroids are successfully extracted. Meanwhile, we also tested the method based on the data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and the result proves the reliability of our method. With derived lightcurves of 13 asteroids from the YNHK survey, we have determined their synodic spin periods, among which the periods of 4 asteroids are estimated for the first time. In future, we are going to apply this method to search for small objects in the outer part of the Solar System from the Chinese Space Station Telescope survey.

 - **Abstract**
 The timing properties of the Z-type low-mass X-ray binaries provide insights into the emission components involved in producing the unique Z-shaped track in the hardness-intensity diagrams of these sources. In this work, we investigate the AstroSat and NICER observations of the GX 340+0 covering the complete 'Z'-track from the horizontal branch (HB) to the extended flaring branch (EFB). For the first time, we present the Z-track as seen in soft X-rays using the AstroSat/SXT and NICER (the soft colour is defined as a ratio of 3-6 keV to 0.5-3 keV). The shape of the track is distinctly different in soft X-rays, strongly suggesting the presence of additional components active in soft X-rays. The detailed timing analysis revealed significant quasi-periodic oscillation throughout the HB and the normal branch (NB) using LAXPC and the first NICER detection of 33.1 +/- 1.1 Hz horizontal branch oscillation (HBO) in 3-6 keV. The oscillations at the HB/NB vertex are observed to have higher frequencies (41-52 Hz) than the HB oscillations (16-31 Hz) and NB oscillations (6.2-8 Hz) but significantly lower rms (~1.6%). The HB oscillation is also limited to the energy range of 3-20 keV, indicating an association of HBO origin with the non-thermal component. It is also supported by earlier studies that found the strongest X-ray polarisation during HB.
#### A transition discovered in the sub-critical regime of 1A 0535+262

 - **Abstract**
 We present NICER observations of accreting X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its faint state ($\lesssim 6\times10^{36}$ erg/s) observed in several type-I and II outbursts. We discovered a transition of temporal and spectral properties around the luminosity $L_{\rm t}=3.3\times10^{35}$ erg/s, below which spectra are relatively soft and the pulse profiles have only a narrow peak. The spectra are harder and a secondary hump gradually appears in pulse profiles when $L \gtrsim L_{\rm t}$. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for this transition, including different Comptonization seed photons, the disappearance of gas shocks on the neutron star surface, and the combination of plasma and vacuum polarization effects.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15438
 - **Abstract**
 The empirical relations between rotation period, chromospheric activity, and age can be used to estimate stellar age. To calibrate these relations, we present a catalog, including the masses and ages of 52,321 FGK dwarfs, 47,489 chromospheric activity index $logR^{+}_{HK}$, 6,077 rotation period $P_{rot}$ and variability amplitude $S_{ph}$, based on data from LAMOST DR7, Kepler and Gaia DR3. We find a pronounced correlation among $P_{rot}$, age, and [Fe/H] throughout the main-sequence phase for F dwarfs. However, the decrease of $logR^{+}_{HK}$ over time is not significant except for those with [Fe/H] $<$ $-$0.1. For G dwarfs, both $P_{rot}$ and $logR^{+}_{HK}$ are reliable age probes in the ranges $\sim$ 2-11 Gyr and $\sim$ 2-13 Gyr, respectively. K dwarfs exhibit a prominent decrease in $logR^{+}_{HK}$ within the age range of $\sim$ 3-13 Gyr when the relation of $P_{rot}-\tau$ is invalid. These relations are very important for promptly estimating the age of a vast number of stars, thus serving as a powerful tool in advancing the fields of exoplanet properties, stellar evolution, and Galactic-archaeology.
#### Muted Features in the JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectrum of Hot-Neptune  LTT 9779 b

 - **Abstract**
 The hot-Neptune desert is one of the most sparsely populated regions of the exoplanet parameter space, and atmosphere observations of its few residents can provide insights into how such planets have managed to survive in such an inhospitable environment. Here, we present transmission observations of LTT 9779 b, the only known hot-Neptune to have retained a significant H/He-dominated atmosphere, taken with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. The 0.6-2.85$\mu$m transmission spectrum shows evidence for muted spectral features, rejecting a perfectly flat line at >5$\sigma$. We explore water and methane-dominated atmosphere scenarios for LTT 9779 b's terminator, and retrieval analyses reveal a continuum of potential combinations of metallicity and cloudiness. Through comparisons to previous population synthesis works and our own interior structure modelling, we are able to constrain LTT 9779 b's atmosphere metallicity to 20-850x solar. Within this range of metallicity, our retrieval analyses prefer solutions with clouds at mbar pressures, regardless of whether the atmosphere is water- or methane-dominated -- though cloud-free atmospheres with metallicities >500x solar cannot be entirely ruled out. By comparing self-consistent atmosphere temperature profiles with cloud condensation curves, we find that silicate clouds can readily condense in the terminator region of LTT 9779 b. Advection of these clouds onto the day-side could explain the high day-side albedo previously inferred for this planet and be part of a feedback loop aiding the survival of LTT 9779 b's atmosphere in the hot-Neptune desert.
#### Spectroscopy evidence for a so far unknown young stellar cluster at the  Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disk has been a highly active star-forming region in the Milky Way for approximately the last 30 million years. Despite hosting prominent clusters like Arches, Quintuplet, and Nuclear Stellar, their combined mass is less than 10% of the expected stellar mass, leading to the "missing cluster problem." Various factors, including high stellar density and tidal forces, contribute to this absence of clusters. Traces of dissolving clusters may exist as co-moving groups of stars, shedding light on the region's star formation history. Our analysis, utilizing integral field spectroscopy and astrophotometric data, reveals a group of young stellar objects in the NSD sharing velocities and positions, potentially indicating remnants of dissolved clusters or stellar associations. This finding contributes valuable insights into the understanding of the missing clusters problem in the Galactic center.
#### Deep Learning for Gamma-Ray Bursts: A data driven event framework for  X/Gamma-Ray analysis in space telescopes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15632
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15632
 - **Abstract**
 This thesis comprises the first three chapters dedicated to providing an overview of Gamma Ray-Bursts (GRBs), their properties, the instrumentation used to detect them, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in the context of GRBs, including a literature review and future prospects. Considering both the current and the next generation of high X-ray monitors, such as Fermi-GBM and HERMES Pathfinder (an in-orbit demonstration of six 3U nano-satellites), the research question revolves around the detection of long and faint high-energy transients, potentially GRBs, that might have been missed by previous detection algorithms. To address this, two chapters introduce a new data-driven framework, DeepGRB. In Chapter 4, a Neural Network (NN) is described for background count rate estimation for X/gamma-ray detectors, providing a performance evaluation in different periods, including both solar maxima, solar minima periods, and one containing an ultra-long GRB. The application of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is performed for global and local feature importance analysis to better understand the behavior of the NN. Chapter 5 employs FOCuS-Poisson for anomaly detection in count rate observations and estimation from the NN. DeepGRB demonstrates its capability to process Fermi-GBM data, confirming cataloged events and identifying new ones, providing further analysis with estimates for localization, duration, and classification. The chapter concludes with an automated classification method using Machine Learning techniques that incorporates XAI for eventual bias identification.

 - **Abstract**
 Future observations of exoplanets will hopefully reveal detailed constraints on planetary compositions. Recently, we have developed and introduced chemcomp (Schneider & Bitsch 2021a), which simulates the formation of planets in viscously evolving protoplanetary disks by the accretion of pebbles and gas. The chemical composition of planetary building blocks (pebbles and gas) is traced by including a physical approach of the evaporation and condensation of volatiles at evaporation lines. We have now open-sourced the chemcomp code to enable comparisons between planet formation models and observational constraints by the community. The code can be found at https://github.com/AaronDavidSchneider/chemcomp, is easy to use (using configuration files) and comes with a detailed documentation and examples.
#### On the formation of compact-object binaries from binary-driven  hypernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) scenario of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), focusing on the binary stability during the supernova (SN) explosion. The BdHN progenitor is a binary comprised of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The core collapse of the CO leads to an SN explosion and a newborn NS ($\nu$NS) at its center. Ejected material accretes onto the NS and the $\nu$NS. BdHNe of type I have compact orbits of a few minutes, the NS reaches the critical mass, forming a black hole (BH), and the energy release is $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. BdHNe II have longer periods of tens of minutes to hours; the NS becomes more massive, remains stable, and the system releases $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg. BdHN III have longer periods, even days, where the accretion is negligible, and the energy released is $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. We assess whether the system remains gravitationally bound after the SN explosion, leading to an NS-BH in BdHN I, an NS-NS in BdHN II and III, or if the SN explosion disrupts the system. The existence of bound systems predicts an evolutionary connection between the long and short GRB populations. We determine the binary parameters for which the binary remains bound after the BdHN event. For these binaries, we derive fitting formulas of the numerical results for the main parameters, e.g., the mass loss, the SN explosion energy, orbital period, eccentricity, center-of-mass velocity, and the relation between the initial and final binary parameters, which are useful for outlined astrophysical applications.
#### Discovery of two warm mini-Neptunes with contrasting densities orbiting  the young K3V star TOI-815

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and characterization of two warm mini-Neptunes transiting the K3V star TOI-815 in a K-M binary system. Analysis of the spectra and rotation period reveal it to be a young star with an age of $200^{+400}_{-200}$Myr. TOI-815b has a 11.2-day period and a radius of 2.94$\pm$0.05$\it{R_{\rm\mathrm{\oplus}}}$ with transits observed by TESS, CHEOPS, ASTEP, and LCOGT. The outer planet, TOI-815c, has a radius of 2.62$\pm$0.10$\it{R_{\rm\mathrm{\oplus}}}$, based on observations of three non-consecutive transits with TESS, while targeted CHEOPS photometry and radial velocity follow-up with ESPRESSO were required to confirm the 35-day period. ESPRESSO confirmed the planetary nature of both planets and measured masses of 7.6$\pm$1.5 $\it{M_{\rm \mathrm{\oplus}}}$ ($\rho_\mathrm{P}$=1.64$^{+0.33}_{-0.31}$gcm$^{-3}$) and 23.5$\pm$2.4$\it{M_{\rm\mathrm{\oplus}}}$ ($\rho_\mathrm{P}$=7.2$^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$gcm$^{-3}$) respectively. Thus, the planets have very different masses, unlike the usual similarity of masses in compact multi-planet systems. Moreover, our statistical analysis of mini-Neptunes orbiting FGK stars suggests that weakly irradiated planets tend to have higher bulk densities compared to those suffering strong irradiation. This could be ascribed to their cooler atmospheres, which are more compressed and denser. Internal structure modeling of TOI-815b suggests it likely has a H-He atmosphere constituting a few percent of the total planet mass, or higher if the planet is assumed to have no water. In contrast, the measured mass and radius of TOI-815c can be explained without invoking any atmosphere, challenging planetary formation theories. Finally, we infer from our measurements that the star is viewed close to pole-on, which implies a spin-orbit misalignment at the 3$\sigma$ level.

 - **Abstract**
 Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the star and planet formation process is one of the fundamental tasks of astrophysics, requiring detailed knowledge of the physical conditions during the different phases of this process. During the earliest stages, i.e., concerning physical processes in molecular clouds and filaments, the column density N(H2), dust temperature T and dust emissivity index \b{eta} of these objects can be derived by adopting a modified blackbody fit of the far-infrared to (sub-)millimeter spectral energy distributions. However, this often applied method is based on various assumptions. In addition, the observational basis and required, but only assumed cloud properties, such as a limited wavelength-coverage of the spectral energy distribution and dust properties, respectively, may differ between different studies. We review the basic limitations of this method and evaluate their impact on the derived physical properties of the objects of interest, i.e., molecular clouds and filaments. We find that the highest uncertainty when applying this method is introduced by the often poorly constrained dust properties. Therefore, we propose to first derive the optical depth and subsequently the column density with the help of a suitable dust model as the optical depth can be obtained with high accuracy, especially at longer wavelengths. The method provides reliable results up to the high densities and corresponding optical depths observed in molecular clouds. Considering typically used observational data, i.e., measurements obtained with far-infrared instruments like Herschel/PACS, JCMT/SCUBA-2 and SOFIA/HAWC+, data at four wavelengths are sufficient to obtain accurate results. Furthermore, we find that the dust emissivity index \b{eta} derived with this method is not suitable as an indicator of dust grain size.

 - **Abstract**
 One of many ways for the James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to capture astronomical signals is the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Imaging mode. To make this data ready for analysis, the JWST standard reduction pipeline has three stages and many mandatory and optional steps to produce analysis-ready data. At the end of stage 3, there is a resampled 2-dimensional image for each band/wavelength, an estimated source catalog, and a source mask (segmentation image) locating these sources. This study focuses on enhancing this source mask part so that it can detect more point sources, previously cataloged after older missions, without spuriously "detecting" false positives. Combined use of the fraction of a resampled image and a derivative image seemed to improve the capability to detect unWISE catalog-located sources better than original segmentation images in 7 different real cases with the MIRI F770W filter. A few approaches are recommended to make better use of these value-sliced and derivative images.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the possibility of global anisotropy of the universe. We consider an altered FLRW metric in which there are different scale factors along the 3 different axes of space. We construct the corresponding altered Friedmann equations. We show that any initial anisotropies decrease into the future. At late times, the difference in Hubble parameters changes as $1/\sqrt{t}$ in a radiation dominated era and as $1/t$ in a matter dominated era. We use constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the level of anisotropies at early times. We also examine how the approach back in time to the singularity is radically altered; happening much more abruptly, as a function of density, in an anisotropic universe. We also mention improved bounds that can arise from measurements of primordial gravitons, WIMPs, and neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries accrete via Roche-lobe overflow from a stellar companion that is $\lesssim$ 1 M$_{\odot}$. The accretion disk in these systems can be externally illuminated by X-rays that are reprocessed by the accreting material into an emergent reflection spectrum comprised of emission lines superimposed onto the reprocessed continuum. Due to proximity to the compact object, strong gravity effects are imparted to the reflection spectrum that can be modeled to infer properties of the NS itself and other aspects of the accreting system. This short review discusses the field of reflection modeling in neutron star low-mass X-ray binary systems with the intention to highlight the work that was awarded the 2023 AAS Newton Lacy Pierce Prize, but also to consolidate key information as a reference for those entering this subfield.

 Here we present the current state of knowledge on the long-term evolution of Saturn's moon system due to tides within Saturn. First we provide some background on tidal evolution, orbital resonances and satellite tides. Then we address in detail some of the present and past orbital resonances between Saturn's moons (including the Enceladus-Dione and Titan-Hyperion resonances) and what they can tell us about the evolution of the system. We also present the current state of knowledge on the spin-axis dynamics of Saturn: we discuss arguments for a (past or current) secular resonance of Saturn's spin precession with planetary orbits, and explain the links of this resonance to the tidal evolution of Titan and a possible recent cataclysm in the Saturnian system. We also address how the moons' orbital evolution, including resonances, affects the evolution of their interiors. Finally, we summarize the state of knowledge about the Saturnian system's long-term evolution and discuss prospects for future progress.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the line-of-sight accelerations of 26 binary pulsars due to the Milky Way's gravitational potential, and produce a 3-dimensional map of the acceleration field of the Galaxy. Acceleration measurements directly give us the change in the line-of-sight velocity at present day, without requiring any assumptions inherent to kinematic modeling. We measure the Oort limit ($\rho_0=0.062\pm0.017$ \msun/pc$^3$) and the dark matter density in the midplane ($\rho_{0,\textrm{DM}}=-0.010\pm0.018$ \msun/pc$^3$); these values are similar to, but have smaller uncertainties than previous pulsar timing measurements of these quantities. Here, we provide for the first time, values for the Oort constants and the slope of the rotation curve from direct acceleration measurements. We find that $A=15.4\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc and $B=-13.1\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc (consistent with results from \textit{Gaia}), and the slope of the rotation curve near the Sun is $-2\pm5$ km/s/kpc. We show that the Galactic acceleration field is clearly asymmetric, but due to data limitations it is not yet clear which physical processes drive this asymmetry. We provide updated models of the Galactic potential that account for various sources of disequilibrium; these models are incompatible with commonly used kinematic potentials. This indicates that use of kinematically derived Galactic potentials in precision tests (e.g., in tests of general relativity with pulsar timing) may be subject to larger uncertainties than reported. The acceleration data indicates that the mass of the Galaxy within the Solar circle is $2.3 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, roughly twice as large as currently accepted models. Additionally, the residuals of the acceleration data compared to existing Galactic models have a dependence on radial position; this trend can be explained if the Sun has an additional acceleration away from the Galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract too much attention. Here we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6,602 targets, including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on \textit{Gaia} DR3 and SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2. The reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the quantile range of relative intensity ($1\%\sim99\%$). Five different methods, e.g., chi-square ($\chi^2$), cosine similarity (CS), machine learning (ML), equivalent width (EW), and line ratio (LR), are used in order to separate different stellar populations. The ML and $\chi^2$ provide the best and relatively consistent prediction of certain population. The derived lower limit of the RSG population is able to reach to the $\rm K_S$-band tip of red giant branch ($\rm K_S~$$\approx12.0$ mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about $10^{3.5}~L_{\sun}$, which corresponds to a stellar radius only about $100~R_{\sun}$. Given the mass-luminosity relation of $L/L_\sun =f(M/M_\sun)^3$ with $f\approx15.5\pm3$ and taking into account of the mass loss of faint RSGs up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about $6.1\pm0.4~M_\sun$, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of $8~M_\sun$ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence, indicating that the lower mass limit of RSG population is around $6~M_\sun$. However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have large impact on the stellar evolutionary and supernova models.
#### A field-level emulator for modeling baryonic effects across hydrodynamic  simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new and simple method to model baryonic effects at the field level relevant for weak lensing analyses. We analyze thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS project, each with different cosmology and strength of feedback, and we find that the cross-correlation coefficient between full hydrodynamic and N-body simulations is very close to 1 down to $k\sim10~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. This suggests that modeling baryonic effects at the field level down to these scales only requires N-body simulations plus a correction to the mode's amplitude given by: $\sqrt{P_{\rm hydro}(k)/P_{\rm nbody}(k)}$. In this paper, we build an emulator for this quantity, using Gaussian processes, that is flexible enough to reproduce results from thousands of hydrodynamic simulations that have different cosmologies, astrophysics, subgrid physics, volumes, resolutions, and at different redshifts. Our emulator is accurate at the percent level and exhibits a range of validation superior to previous studies. This method and our emulator enable field-level simulation-based inference analyses and accounting for baryonic effects in weak lensing analyses.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15981
 - **Abstract**
 A key feature of the Trappist-1 system is its monotonic decrease in bulk density with growing distance from the central star, which indicates an ice mass fraction that is zero in the innermost planets, b and c, and about 10\% in planets d through h. Previous studies suggest that the density gradient of this system could be due to the growth of planets from icy planetesimals that progressively lost their volatile content during their inward drift through the protoplanetary disk. Here we investigate the alternative possibility that the planets formed in a dry protoplanetary disk populated with pebbles made of phyllosilicates, a class of hydrated minerals with a water fraction possibly exceeding 10 wt\%. We show that the dehydration of these minerals in the inner regions of the disk and the outward diffusion of the released vapor up to the ice-line location allow the condensation of ice onto grains. Pebbles with water mass fractions consistent with those of planets d--h would have formed at the snow-line location. In contrast, planets b and c would have been accreted from drier material in regions closer to the star than the phyllosilicate dehydration line.

 - **Abstract**
 Starting from more than 11,200 short-period (less than 0.5 days) EW-type eclipsing binary candidates with the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) V-band light curves, we use MCMC and neural networks (NNs) to obtain the mass ratio ($q$), orbital inclination ($incl$), fill-out factor ($f$) and temperature ratio ($T_s/T_p$). After cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 database, the final sample contains parameters of 2,399 A-type and 8,712 W-type contact binaries (CBs). We present the distributions of parameters of these 11,111 short-period CBs. The mass ratio ($q$) and fill-out factor ($f$) are found to obey log-normal distributions, and the remaining parameters obey normal distributions. There is a significant period-temperature correlation of these CBs. Additionally, the temperature ratio (${T_s}$/${T_p}$) tends to increase as the orbital period decreases for W-type CBs. There is no significant correlation between them for A-type CBs. The mass ratio and fill-out factor ($q-f$) diagram suggest there is no significant correlation between these two parameters. A clear correlation exists between the mass ratio and radius ratio. The radius ratio increases with the mass ratio. Moreover, the deep fill-out CBs tend to fall on the upper boundary of the $q$$-$${R_s}$/${R_p}$ distribution, while the shallow fill-out CBs fall on the lower boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the phase-resolved spectral results of the first Galactic Pulsating Ultra-Luminous X-ray source (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124, modeling at its 2017-2018 outburst peak using data collected by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). The broad energy coverage of Insight-HXMT allows us to obtain more accurate spectral continuum to reduce the coupling of broad iron line profiles with other components. We use three different continuum spectrum models but obtain similar iron line results. For the first time, we detected the pulse characteristics of the broad iron line in a PULX. The variation in width and intensity of this iron line with $\sigma \sim 1.2-1.5$\,keV has a phase offset of about 0.25 from the pulse phase. We suggest that the uneven irradiation of the thick inner disk by the accretion column produces the modulated variation of the broad iron line. In addition, the non-pulsed narrow line is suggested to come from the outer disk region.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of the three 13C isotopologs of HCCNC and HNCCC toward TMC-1 using the QUIJOTE line survey. In addition, the D species has also been detected for these two isomers of HCCCN, whereas the 15N isotopolog was only detected for HCCNC. Using high-J lines of HCCNC and HNCCC, we were able to derive very precise rotational temperatures, column densities, and subsequently the isotopic abundance ratios. We found that 12C/13C is around 90 for the three possible substitutions in both isomers. These results are slightly different from what has been found for the most abundant isomer HCCCN, for which abundances of 105, 95, and 66 were found for each one of the three possible positions of 13C. The H/D abundance ratio was found to be 31+/-4 for HCCNC and of 53+/-6 for HNCCC. The latter is similar to the H/D abundace ratio derived for HCCCN (59). The 14N/15N isotopic abundance ratio in HCCNC is 243+/-24.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun has been observed through a telescope for four centuries. However, its study made a prodigious leap at the end of the nineteenth century with the appearance of photography and spectroscopy, then at the beginning of the following century with the invention of the coronagraph and monochromatic filters, and finally in the second half of the twentieth century with the advent of space exploration (satellites, probes). This makes it possible to observe the radiations hidden by the Earth's atmosphere (Ultra Violet, X-rays, $\gamma$) and to carry out ''in situ'' measurements in the solar environment. This article retraces the major stages of this fantastic epic in which renowned scientists such as Janssen, Deslandres, d'Azambuja, Lyot and Dollfus entered the scene, giving the Paris-Meudon Observatory a pioneering role in the history of solar physics until 1960. After this golden age, space exploration required large resources shared between nations, which could no longer be implemented within teams or even individual institutes. The development of numerical simulation, a new research tool, also required the pooling of supercomputers.

 - **Abstract**
 Alpha Centauri is a triple stellar system, and it contains the closest star to Earth (Proxima Centauri). Over the last decades, the stars in Alpha Cen and their orbits have been investigated in great detail. However, the possible scenarios for planet formation and evolution in this triple stellar system remain to be explored further. First, we present a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the circumstellar discs in the binary Alpha Cen AB. Then, we compute stability maps for the planets within Alpha Cen obtained through N-body integrations. Last, we estimate the radial velocity (RV) signals of such planets. We find that the circumstellar discs within the binary cannot exceed 3 au in radius and that the available dust mass to form planets is about 30 $M_\oplus$. Planets around A and B are stable if their semimajor axes are below 3 au, while those around C are stable and remain unperturbed by the binary AB. For rocky planets, the planetary mass has only a mild effect on the stability. Therefore, Alpha Cen could have formed and hosted rocky planets around each star, which may be detected with RV methods in the future. The exoplanetary hunt in this triple stellar system must continue.

 - **Abstract**
 SS 433 is a microquasar, a stellar binary system with collimated relativistic jets. We observed SS 433 in gamma rays using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), finding an energy-dependent shift in the apparent position of the gamma-ray emission of the parsec-scale jets. These observations trace the energetic electron population and indicate the gamma rays are produced by inverse-Compton scattering. Modelling of the energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology constrains the location of particle acceleration and requires an abrupt deceleration of the jet flow. We infer the presence of shocks on either side of the binary system at distances of 25 to 30 parsecs and conclude that self-collimation of the precessing jets forms the shocks, which then efficiently accelerate electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 Most old supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way have not yet been identified. Considering their large potential number and the sufficient momentum-energy transfer to the interstellar medium (ISM), they are a key part of our understanding of the overall role of SNRs in the ISM. Here we report our discovery of an expanding molecular shell identified by CO line observations, namely G16.11-0.51. It covers a known SNR, specifically G16.0-0.5, and is larger in size, i.e. 0.56 deg over 0.20 deg. Based on its spatial and kinematic structures, weak nonthermal radio-continuum emission, and derived physical properties, we suggest that it is an old SNR. At a systemic velocity of +41.3 km s^-1, the best estimated kinematic distance of G16.11-0.51 is ~3.2 kpc, implying its radius of about 15.6 pc. The age of G16.11-0.51 is estimated to be greater than ~10^5 yr, and, in a dense molecular environment, it has formed dense and thin shell layers. The kinetic energy of the expanding molecular gas of G16.11-0.51 is about 6.4x10^49 erg, accounting for approximately six percent of the initial SN explosion energy. Although old SNRs have essentially become cold and hard to detect, our discovery suggests that they can be found by searching for CO line emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 The equilibrium resulting in a recombining plasma with arbitrary metallicity Z, heated by a mean radiation field E as well as by sound waves dissipation due to thermal conduction, dynamic and bulk viscosity is analyzed. Generally, the heating by acoustic waves dissipation induces drastic changes in the range of temperature where the thermochemical equilibrium may exist. An additional equilibrium state appears which is characterized by a lower ionization and higher gas pressure than the equilibrium resulting when the wave dissipation is neglected. The above effects are sensibly to the values of the gas parameters as well as the wavelength and intensity of the acoustic waves. Implications in the interstellar gas, in particular, in the high velocity clouds are outlined.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an alternative method for the calculation of sky maps from data taken with gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast to the established method of smoothing the 2D histogram of reconstructed event directions with a static kernel, we apply a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) where the kernel size of each gamma-ray candidate is related to its estimated direction uncertainty. Exploiting this additional information implies a gain in resulting image quality, which is validated using both simulations and data. For the tested simulation and analysis configuration, the achieved improvement can only be matched with the classical approach by removing events with lower reconstruction quality, reducing the data set by a considerable amount.
#### The jet and resolved features of the central supermassive black hole of  M 87 observed with EHT in 2017-- Comparison with the GMVA 86 GHz results

 - **Abstract**
 M 87 is the best target for studying black hole accretion and jet formation. Reanalysis of the EHT public data at 230 GHz shows a core-knots structure at the center and jet features (Miyoshi et al. 2022a). We here compare this with the new results of GMVA at 86 GHz showing a spatially resolved central core (Lu et al. 2023a). There are similarities and differences between the two. At 86 GHz,"two bright regions" are seen on the ring in the core."Core-Knot-Westknot", triple structure in the 230 GHz image shows apparent appearance of two peaks similar to the "two bright regions" when convolved with the GMVA beam. This similarity suggests that both frequencies reveal the same objects in the core area. Protrusions are observed on both the south and north sides of the core at both frequencies, becoming prominent and wing-like at 230 GHz. The 86 GHz image shows a triple ridge jet structure, while the 230 GHz image shows only a bright central ridge with two roots. Both frequencies show a shade between the core and the central ridge. To detect the faint features from the EHT2017 data, we found that the use of all baseline data is essential. Using all including the ultrashort baseline data, revealed the jet and faint structures. Without the ultrashort baselines, these structures were not detectable. The lack of detection of any faint structures other than the ring in the M 87 data by the EHTC is presumably due to the exclusion of ultrashort baselines from their analysis.

 We present a comprehensive characterization of the evolved thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star R Hydrae, building on the techniques applied in Stellar Evolution in Real Time I (Moln\'ar et al. 2019) to T Ursae Minoris. We compute over 3000 theoretical TP-AGB pulse spectra using MESA and GYRE and combine these with classical observational constraints and nearly 400 years of measurements of R Hya's period evolution to fit R Hya's evolutionary and asteroseismic features. Two hypotheses for the mode driving R Hya's period are considered. Solutions that identify this as the fundamental mode (FM) as well as the first overtone (O1) are consistent with observations. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find that R Hya is most likely driven by the FM and currently occupies the ``power down'' phase of an intermediate pulse (TP ~ 9-16). We predict that its pulsation period will continue to shorten for millennia. Using supplementary calculations from the Monash stellar evolution code, we also find that R Hya is likely to have undergone third dredge-up in its most recent pulse. The MESA+GYRE model grid used in this analysis includes exact solutions to the adiabatic equations of stellar oscillation for the first 10 radial-order pressure modes for every time step in every evolutionary track. The grid is fully open-source and packaged with a data visualization application. This is the first publicly available grid of TP-AGB models with seismology produced with MESA.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting cosmic gamma rays at high rates is the key to time-resolve the acceleration of particles within some of the most powerful events in the universe. Time-resolving the emission of gamma rays from merging celestial bodies, apparently random bursts of gamma rays, recurring novas in binary systems, flaring jets from active galactic nuclei, clocking pulsars, and many more became a critical contribution to astronomy. For good timing on account of high rates, we would ideally collect the naturally more abundant, low energetic gamma rays in the domain of one giga electronvolt in large areas. Satellites detect low energetic gamma rays but only in small collecting areas. Cherenkov telescopes have large collecting areas but can only detect the rare, high energetic gamma rays. To detect gamma rays with lower energies, Cherenkov-telescopes need to increase in precision and size. But when we push the concept of the --far/tele-- seeing Cherenkov telescope accordingly, the telescope's physical limits show more clearly. The narrower depth-of-field of larger mirrors, the aberrations of mirrors, and the deformations of mirrors and mechanics all blur the telescope's image. To overcome these limits, we propose to record the --full/plenum-- Cherenkov-light field of an atmospheric shower, i.e. recording the directions and impacts of each individual Cherenkov photon simultaneously, with a novel class of instrument. This novel Cherenkov plenoscope can turn a narrow depth-of-field into the perception of depth, can compensate aberrations, and can tolerate deformations. We design a Cherenkov plenoscope to explore timing by detecting low energetic gamma rays in large areas.

 - **Abstract**
 The exoplanet diversity has been linked to the disc environment in which they form, where the host star metallicity and the formation pathways play a crucial role. In the context of the core accretion paradigm, the initial stages of planet formation require the growth of dust material from micrometre size to planetesimal size bodies before core accretion can kick in. Although numerous studies have been conducted on planetesimal formation, it is still poorly understood how this process takes place in low metallicity stellar environments. We explore planetesimals formation in stellar environments primarily with low metallicity. We performed global 1D viscous disc evolution simulations including grain growth, evaporation and condensation of chemical species at ice lines. We followed the formation of planetesimals during disc evolution and tested different metallicities, disc sizes and turbulent viscosity strengths. We find that at solar and sub-solar metallicities, there is a significant enhancement in the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratios at the ice lines but this leads to planetesimal formation only at the water ice line. In our simulations, [Fe/H] = -0.6 is the lowest limit of metallicity for planetesimal formation where a few Earth masses of planetesimals could form. For such extreme disc environments, large discs are more conducive than small discs for forming large amounts of planetesimals at a fixed metallicity, because the pebble flux can be maintained for a longer time resulting in a longer and more efficient planetesimal formation phase. At lower metallicities, planetesimal formation is less supported in quiescent discs compared to turbulent discs, because the pebble flux can be maintained for a longer time. The amount of planetesimals formed at sub-solar metallicities in our simulations places a limit on core sizes that could possibly only result in the formation of super-Earths.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the Gaseous Dynamical Friction (GDF) force experienced by massive perturbers on elliptical Keplerian orbits. In this paper, we investigate the density wake morphology, dynamical friction force, and secular orbital evolution for massive single perturbers as well as equal mass binaries embedded in an homogenous, static background flow. In all cases, the rate-of-change in semi-major axis is found to be negative (as expected), whereas the rate-of-change in eccentricity is negative for strictly-subsonic trajectories and positive for strictly-supersonic trajectories. Transonic orbits can experience both positive and negative torques during the course of an orbit, with some growing in eccentricity and others circularising. We observe all initial orbits becoming highly supersonic and eccentric (over sufficiently long timescales) due to a relentless semi-major axis decay increasing the Mach number and subsequent eccentricity driving. We compare our findings to previous studies for rectilinear and circular motion, while also making our data for orbital decay available.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Planet-disk interactions play a crucial role in the understanding of planet formation and disk evolution. There are multiple numerical tools available to simulate these interactions, including the often-used FARGO code and its variants. Many of the codes were extended over time to include additional physical processes with a focus on their accurate modeling. Aims: We introduce FargoCPT, an updated version of FARGO incorporating other previous enhancements to the code, to provide a simulation environment tailored to study interactions between stars, planets, and disks, ensuring accurate representation of planet systems, hydrodynamics, and dust dynamics with a focus on usability. Methods: The radiation-hydrodynamics part of FargoCPT uses a second-order upwind scheme in 2D polar coordinates supporting multiple equations of state, radiation transport, heating and cooling, and self-gravity. Shocks are considered using artificial viscosity. Integration of the N-body system is achieved by leveraging the REBOUND code. The dust module utilizes massless tracer particles, adapting to drag laws for the Stokes and Epstein regimes. Moreover, FargoCPT provides mechanisms to simulate accretion onto the stars and planets. Results: The code has been tested in practice by its use in various publications. Additionally, it comes with an automated test suite to test the physics modules. Conclusions: FargoCPT offers a unique set of simulation capabilities within the current landscape of publicly available planet-disk interaction simulation tools. Its structured interface and underlying technical updates are intended to assist researchers in the ongoing exploration of planet formation.
#### Astrophysical Equation-of-State Constraints on the Color-Superconducting  Gap

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\mu = 2.6~\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\Delta$ of $457~\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and $216~\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions. This constraint may be strengthened by future astrophysical measurements as well as by future advances in high density QCD calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 We seek to understand the evolution of Wolf-Rayet central stars by comparing the diffuse X-ray emission from their wind-blown bubbles with that from their hydrogen-rich counterparts with predictions from hydrodynamical models. We simulate the dynamical evolution of heat-conducting wind-blown bubbles using a post-AGB-model of 0.595~Msun, allowing for variations of its evolutionary timescale and wind power. For Wolf-Rayet central stars, the wind is hydrogen-poor, more dense, and slower compared to O-type central stars. We use the CHIANTI software to compute the X-ray properties of bubble models along the evolutionary paths and explicitly allow for non-equilibrium ionisation of key chemical elements. A sample of 12 planetary nebulae with diffuse X-ray emission -- seven harbouring an O-type and five a Wolf-Rayet nucleus -- is used to test the bubble models. The properties of most hydrogen-rich bubbles (X-ray temperature, X-ray luminosity, size) and their central stars (photon and wind luminosity) are fairly well represented by bubble models of our 0.595~Msun AGB remnant. The bubble evolution of Wolf-Rayet objects is different, thanks to the high radiation cooling of their carbon- and oxygen-rich winds. The bubble formation is delayed, and eventually, evaporation begins, leading to chemically stratified bubbles. The bubbles of the youngest Wolf-Rayet objects appear chemically uniform, the chemically stratified bubbles of the evolved Wolf-rayet objects have excessively low characteristic temperatures that cannot be explained by our modelling. The formation of nebulae with O-type nuclei follows mainly a single path, but the formation pathways leading to the Wolf-Rayet-type objects appear diverse.

 - **Abstract**
 Almost all current and future high-contrast imaging instruments will use a Pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) as a primary or secondary wavefront sensor. The main issue with the PWFS is its nonlinear response to large phase aberrations, especially under strong atmospheric turbulence. Most instruments try to increase its linearity range by using dynamic modulation, but this leads to decreased sensitivity, most prominently for low-order modes, and makes it blind to petal-piston modes. In the push toward high-contrast imaging of fainter stars and deeper contrasts, there is a strong interest in using the PWFS in its unmodulated form. Here, we present closed-loop lab results of a nonlinear reconstructor for the unmodulated PWFS of the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) system based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that our nonlinear reconstructor has a dynamic range of >600 nm root-mean-square (RMS), significantly outperforming the linear reconstructor that only has a 50 nm RMS dynamic range. The reconstructor behaves well in closed loop and can obtain >80% Strehl at 875 nm under a large variety of conditions and reaches higher Strehl ratios than the linear reconstructor under all simulated conditions. The CNN reconstructor also achieves the theoretical sensitivity limit of a PWFS, showing that it does not lose its sensitivity in exchange for dynamic range. The current CNN's computational time is 690 microseconds, which enables loop speeds of >1 kHz. On-sky tests are foreseen soon and will be important for pushing future high-contrast imaging instruments toward their limits.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistically energetic, non-thermal population of electrons can give rise to unique CMB spectral distortion signatures which can be significantly different from thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal or $y$-distortion. These signatures depend upon the spectrum of non-thermal electrons, therefore, a detection can inform us about the existence and abundance of non-thermal electrons in our universe. Using public CMB maps and data, we derive upper limits on non-thermal $y$-parameter for a relativistic, power-law electron distribution. With future CMB experiments, we may be in a position to detect or put significantly tighter constraints on these signals which can affect our understanding of non-thermal electron distributions in our universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) observations of the $\beta$ Pictoris system. We detect an infrared excess from the central unresolved point source from 5 to 7.5 $\mu$m which is indicative of dust within the inner $\sim$7 au of the system. We perform PSF subtraction on the MRS data cubes and detect a spatially resolved dust population emitting at 5 $\mu$m. This spatially resolved hot dust population is best explained if the dust grains are in the small grain limit (2$\pi$a$\ll$$\lambda$). The combination of unresolved and resolved dust at 5 $\mu$m could suggest that dust grains are being produced in the inner few au of the system and are then radiatively driven outwards, where the particles could accrete onto the known planets in the system $\beta$ Pic b and c. We also report the detection of an emission line at 6.986 $\mu$m that we attribute to be [Ar II]. We find that the [Ar II] emission is spatially resolved with JWST and appears to be aligned with the dust disk. Through PSF subtraction techniques, we detect $\beta$ Pic b at the 5$\sigma$ level in our MRS data cubes and present the first mid-IR spectrum of the planet from 5 to 7 $\mu$m. The planet's spectrum is consistent with having absorption from water vapor between 5 and 6.5 $\mu$m. We perform atmosphere model grid fitting on spectra and photometry of $\beta$ Pic b and find that the planet's atmosphere likely has a sub-stellar C/O ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand its evolution and the effects of its eruptive events, the Sun is permanently monitored by multiple satellite missions. The optically-thin emission of the solar plasma and the limited number of viewpoints make it challenging to reconstruct the geometry and structure of the solar atmosphere; however, this information is the missing link to understand the Sun as it is: a three-dimensional evolving star. We present a method that enables a complete 3D representation of the uppermost solar layer (corona) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. We use a deep learning approach for 3D scene representation that accounts for radiative transfer, to map the entire solar atmosphere from three simultaneous observations. We demonstrate that our approach provides unprecedented reconstructions of the solar poles, and directly enables height estimates of coronal structures, solar filaments, coronal hole profiles, and coronal mass ejections. We validate the approach using model-generated synthetic EUV images, finding that our method accurately captures the 3D geometry of the Sun even from a limited number of 32 ecliptic viewpoints ($|\text{latitude}| \leq 7^\circ$). We quantify uncertainties of our model using an ensemble approach that allows us to estimate the model performance in absence of a ground-truth. Our method enables a novel view of our closest star, and is a breakthrough technology for the efficient use of multi-instrument datasets, which paves the way for future cluster missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is an important component of exoplanets, with its distribution, i.e., whether at the surface or deep inside, fundamentally influencing the planetary properties. The distribution of water in most exoplanets is determined by yet-unknown partitioning coefficients at extreme conditions. Our new first-principles molecular dynamics simulations reveal that water strongly partitions into iron over silicate at high pressures and thus would preferentially stay in a planet's core. Furthermore, we model planet interiors by considering the effect of water on density, melting temperature, and water partitioning. The results shatter the notion of water worlds as imagined before: the majority of the bulk water budget (even more than 95%) can be stored deep within the core and the mantle, and not at the surface. For planets more massive than ~6 Earth's mass and Earth-size planets (of lower mass and small water budgets), the majority of water resides deep in the cores of planets, Whether water is assumed to be at the surface or at depth can affect the radius by up to 25% for a given mass. This has drastic consequences for the inferred water distribution in exoplanets from mass-radius data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) aboard AstroSat has good sensitivity to Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), with close to 600 detections including about 50 discoveries undetected by other missions. However, CZTI was not designed to be a GRB monitor and lacks localisation capabilities. We introduce a new method of localising GRBs using "shadows" cast on the CZTI detector plane due to absorption and scattering by satellite components and instruments. Comparing the observed distribution of counts on the detector plane with simulated distributions with the AstroSat Mass Model, we can localise GRBs in the sky. Our localisation uncertainty is defined by a two-component model, with a narrow Gaussian component that has close to 50% probability of containing the source, and the remaining spread over a broader Gaussian component with an 11.3 times higher $\sigma$. The width ($\sigma$) of the Gaussian components scales inversely with source counts. We test this model by applying the method to GRBs with known positions and find good agreement between the model and observations. This new ability expands the utility of CZTI in the study of GRBs and other rapid high-energy transients.
