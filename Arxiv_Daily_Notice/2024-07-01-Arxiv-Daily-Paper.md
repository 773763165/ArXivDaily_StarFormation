 - **Abstract**
 Wide-Area Linear Optical Polarimeter (WALOP)-South is the first wide-field and survey-capacity polarimeter in the optical wavelengths. On schedule for commissioning in 2024, it will be mounted on the 1 m SAAO telescope in Sutherland Observatory, South Africa to undertake the PASIPHAE sky survey. PASIPHAE program will create the first polarimetric sky map in the optical wavelengths, spanning more than 2000 square degrees of the southern Galactic region. The innovative design of WALOP-South will enable it to measure the linear polarization (Stokes parameters $q$ and $u$), in a single exposure, of all sources in a field of view (FoV) of $35\times35$ arcminutes-squared in the SDSS-r broadband and narrowband filters between 500-750 nm with 0.1 % polarization accuracy. The unique goals of the instrument place very stringent systems engineering goals, including on the performance of the optical, polarimetric, optomechanical, and electronic subsystems. All the subsystems have been designed carefully to meet the overall instrument performance goals. As of May 2024, all the instrument optical and mechanical subsystems have been assembled and are currently getting tested and integrated. The complete testing and characterization of the instrument in the lab is expected to be completed by August 2024. In this paper, we will present (a) the design and development of the entire instrument and its major subsystems, focusing on the opto-mechanical design which has not been reported before, and (b) assembly and integration of the instrument in the lab and early results from lab characterization of the instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses of mm-wavelength protoplanetary disk observations have revealed several emission excesses on the previously identified dust rings, referred to as dust shoulders. The prevalence of dust shoulders suggests that they trace a common but unclear mechanism. In this work, we combine 3D, multifluid hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer calculations to explain the formation of dust shoulders. We find that the ring-shoulder pairs can result from the 3D planet-disk interactions with massive, gap-opening planets. The key driver is the dust filtration effect at the local pressure maximum due to planet-driven outward gas flows. Our work provides a possible explanation for the outer dust shoulders in recent super-resolution analyses of ALMA observations. It also provides insights into the formation of the inner dust shoulder in the PDS 70 disk and highlights the role of 3D effects in planet-disk interaction studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be sources of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and potential emitters of UHE neutrinos. The upcoming and current radio neutrino detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) are projected to reach the required sensitivities to search for these neutrinos. In particular, in conjunction with the next-generation of gravitational wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), GW-triggered stacking searches can be performed with the UHE neutrino detectors. In this work, we explore the prospects of such searches by implementing in our analysis an upper distance limit based on the sky-localization capabilities of the GW detectors from which meaningful triggers can be collected. We find that if each GW burst is associated with a total isotropic-equivalent energy of $\sim 10^{50} - 10^{51}$ erg emitted in UHE neutrinos, along with a corresponding beaming fraction of $1$\%, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 Radio have a large probability ($\sim 99$\%) to detect a coincident neutrino event using the joint combination of CE+ET in a timescale of less than 15 years of operation for our fiducial choice of parameters. In case of nondetections, the parameter spaces can be constrained at $3\sigma$ level in similar timescales of operation. We also highlight and discuss the prospects of such joint radio neutrino detector network, their importance, and their role in facilitating synergic GW and neutrino observations in the next era of multimessenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast and accurate approximations of gas cooling and heating functions are needed for hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We use machine learning to analyze atomic gas cooling and heating functions in the presence of a generalized incident local radiation field computed by Cloudy. We characterize the radiation field through binned radiation field intensities instead of the photoionization rates used in our previous work. We find a set of 6 energy bins whose intensities exhibit relatively low correlation. We use these bins as features to train machine learning models to predict Cloudy cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity. We compare the relative SHAP importance of the features. From the SHAP analysis, we identify a feature subset of 3 energy bins ($0.5-1, 1-4$, and $13-16 \, \mathrm{Ry}$) with the largest importance and train additional models on this subset. We compare the mean squared errors and distribution of errors on both the entire training data table and a randomly selected 20% test set withheld from model training. The machine learning models trained with 3 and 6 bins, as well as 3 and 4 photoionization rates, have comparable accuracy everywhere. We conclude that 3 energy bins (or 3 analogous photoionization rates: molecular hydrogen photodissociation, neutral hydrogen HI, and fully ionized carbon CVI) are sufficient to characterize the dependence of the gas cooling and heating functions on our assumed incident radiation field model.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of 505 cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the first 34 months of observations of SDSS-V. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to aid with the identification of CV candidates among the over 2 million SDSS-V spectra obtained with the BOSS spectrograph. The CNN reduced the number of spectra that required visual inspection to $\simeq2$ per cent of the total. We identified 779 CV spectra among the CNN-selected candidates, plus an additional 37 CV spectra that the CNN misclassified, but that were found serendipitously by human inspection of the data. Analysing the SDSS-V spectroscopy and ancillary data of the 505 CVs in our sample, we report 62 new CVs, spectroscopically confirm 243 and refute 13 published CV candidates, and we report 68 new or improved orbital periods. We discuss the completeness and possible selection biases of the machine learning methodology, as well as the effectiveness of targeting CV candidates within SDSS-V. Finally, we re-assess the space density of CVs, and find $1.3\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$.

          ZTF SN Ia DR2: The secondary maximum in Type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves have a secondary maximum that exists in the $r$, $i$, and near-infrared filters. The secondary maximum is relatively weak in the $r$ band, but holds the advantage that it is accessible, even at high redshift. We used Gaussian Process fitting to parameterise the light curves of 893 SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility's (ZTF) second data release (DR2), and we were able to extract information about the timing and strength of the secondary maximum. We found $>5\sigma$ correlations between the light curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(g)$) and the timing and strength of the secondary maximum in the $r$ band. Whilst the timing of the secondary maximum in the $i$ band also correlates with $\Delta m_{15}(g)$, the strength of the secondary maximum in the $i$ band shows significant scatter as a function of $\Delta m_{15}(g)$. We found that the transparency timescales of 97 per cent of our sample are consistent with double detonation models, and that SNe Ia with small transparency timescales ($<$ 32 d) reside predominantly in locally red environments. We measured the total ejected mass for the normal SNe Ia in our sample using two methods, and both were consistent with medians of $1.3\ \pm \ 0.3$ and $1.2\ \pm\ 0.2$ solar masses. We find that the strength of the secondary maximum is a better standardisation parameter than the SALT light curve stretch ($x_1$). Finally, we identified a spectral feature in the $r$ band as Fe II, which strengthens during the onset of the secondary maximum. The same feature begins to strengthen at $<$ 3 d post maximum light in 91bg-like SNe. Finally, the correlation between $x_1$ and the strength of the secondary maximum was best fit with a broken line, with a split at $x_1^0\ =\ -0.5\ \pm\ 0.2$, suggestive of the existence of two populations of SNe Ia.

          Direct low-energy trajectories to Near-Earth Objects

 - **Abstract**
 Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids, comets and meteoroids in heliocentric orbits with perihelion below 1.3 au. Similarly to the population of the Main Asteroid Belt, NEOs are primordial bodies and their study can improve our understanding of the origins of the Solar System. With a catalog of over 30~000 known asteroids and approximately 100 listed short-period comets, the NEO population represents an inventory of exploration targets reachable with significantly lower cost than the objects of the Main Asteroid Belt. In addition, the materials present in these bodies could be used to resupply spacecraft en route to other destinations. The trajectories of past missions to NEOs have been designed with the patched-conics technique supplemented by impulsive and/or low-thrust maneuvers and planetary gravity assist. The transfer times range from some months to a few years, and the close-approach speeds relative to the target have been as high as 10 km/s. The design technique described in this work leverages the invariant structures of the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) to connect the vicinity of the Earth with NEOs in low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbits. The fundamental building blocks are periodic orbits around the collinear points L$_1$ and L$_2$ of the Sun-Earth CR3BP. These orbits are used to generate paths that follow the associated hyperbolic invariant manifolds, exit the sphere of influence of the Earth and reach NEOs on nearby orbits. The strategy is simple, can be applied to depart either a libration point orbit or the vicinity of the Earth, and offers attractive performance features.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS), a possible photodissociation fragment of CS$_2$, has a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Interpretations of CS fluorescence emissions in ultraviolet observations of comets have, to-date, relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations for CS fluorescence efficiencies that can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to $v = 8$ and rotational states up to $N = 100$. A new set of band transition rates is produced through benchmarking comparisons to laboratory electron impact experiments, and subsequently utilized in the fluorescence calculations. We confirm historical reports of the ultraviolet $(0,0)$ band fluorescence efficiency, and conclude that blends and an expanded rovibrational structure have little impact on the fluorescence properties. Combined, the present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emissions in cometary observations with e.g., IUE and HST. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of comet Bradfield show favorable agreement with the theoretical models. We expand the model to the time-domain, and find that thermalization of the ground state and/or `hot' initial distributions of CS lead to noticable changes in the shape of the $(0,0)$ band. The impact on existing sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS observations, and new connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks are discussed. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio continuum and radio recombination line observations of the inner degree of the galactic center reveal a rich collection of thermal and nonthermal radio structures: (a) A network of linear filaments that are oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane constitute the major portion of the radio Arc at l~ 0.2°. These filaments have nonthermal characteristics, show polarized emission at 6, 3 and 2 cm, are organized over a 100 pc scale, and have a flat spectrum. (b) A number of thread-like filaments are situated asymmetrical with respect to the galactic plane and appear to be isolated unlike the linear filaments which are grouped together. The polarization and spectra of these so called "threads" are not yet known. (c) A network of arched filamentary structures that is disorganized in its appearance constitutes the curved portion of the Arc. Radio recombination line emission from these filaments indicates a thermal character for the emission. (d) A very steep-spectrum ridge of emission is seen to emerge from Sgr A. (e) The relative location of Sgr A East, West, a cluster of HII regions and the 50 km/s molecular cloud are discussed. Comparisons of the low and high-frequency maps show clearly that Sgr A East lies behind Sgr A West.

 - **Abstract**
 Young associations record complete histories of star forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older ($\tau > 100$ Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25-40 Myr), Cinyras (28-43 Myr), and Cupavo (54-80 Myr). With $9552 \pm 960$ stars in Orpheus, $3872 \pm 455$ stars in Cinyras, and $8794 \pm 1827$ stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multi-origin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a Cosmic Microwave Background experiment located in the Atacama Desert in Chile. SO consists of three small aperture telescopes (SATs) and one large aperture telescope (LAT) with a total of 60,000 detectors in six frequency bands. As an observatory, SO encompasses hundreds of hardware components simultaneously running at different readout rates, all separate from its 60,000 detectors on-sky and their metadata. We provide an overview of commissioning SO's data acquisition software system for SAT-MF1, the first SAT deployed to the Atacama site. Additionally, we share insights from deploying data access software for all four telescopes, detailing how performance limitations affected data loading and quality investigations, which led to site-compatible software improvements.

          A lensed FRB candidate in the first CHIME/FRB Catalogue and its potential implications

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are immensely energetic radio pulses with durations of milliseconds. Given their high all-sky rate, the probability of an FRB being lensed by an intervening massive object is non-negligible. In this study, we search for possible lensing candidates within the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB catalogue using an autocorrelation algorithm and verification through signal simulations. We identify FRB 20190308C as a lensed candidate with a significance of 3.4 sigma. Furthermore, we constrain the mass of the lensing object using the Chang-Refsdal lens model, based on the flux ratio and time delay between the substructures of FRB 20190308C. Future long-term and high-precision observations are expected to reveal more lensed FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Multipole expansions have been often used for extracting cosmological information from anisotropic quantities in observation. However, which basis of the expansion is best suited to quantify the anisotropies is not a trivial question in any summary statistics. In this paper, using the Fisher matrix formalism, we investigate the information content in multipole moments of the power spectra of galaxy density and intrinsic ellipticity fields in linear theory from the Alcock-Paczynski effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). We consider two expansion schemes, the associated Legendre basis as well as the standard Legendre basis conventionally used in literature. We find that the information in the multipoles of the intrinsic alignment (IA) power spectra in the associated Legendre basis converges more slowly to that in the full 2D power spectra than in the Legendre basis. This trend is particularly significant when we consider a high number density sample. In this high number density case, we show that the errors on the Hubble parameter obtained from the multipoles of the IA cross- and auto-power spectra in the associated Legendre basis are respectively about $6 \%$ and $10 \%$ larger than the full 2D case even when we use multipoles up to $\ell = 6$. Our results demonstrate that the choice of basis is arbitrary but changes the information content encoded in multipoles depending on the sample and statistics under consideration.

 - **Abstract**
 The present work aims to determine the source regions of carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CI, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB, or C-ungrouped). We studied 38 individual asteroid families, including young and old ones, and determined their contributions to the NEO populations at metre and kilometre sizes using collisional and orbital models. Our models are in agreement with spectroscopic observations of NEOs, cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, statistics of bolides, infrared emission from dust bands, composition of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), or abundance of extraterrestrial helium-3. We identified the Veritas, Polana and Eos families as the primary sources of CM/CR, CI and CO/CV/CK chondrites, respectively. Substantial contributions are also expected from CM-like König and CI-like Clarissa, Misa and Hoffmeister families. The source regions of kilometre-sized bodies are generally different. The Adeona family is by far the main source of CM-like NEOs, whereas the Polana (low-i) and Euphrosyne (high-i) families are at the origin of most CI-like NEOs. The Polana family is the likely source of both Ryugu and Bennu. We were able to link spectroscopically and dynamically several NEOs to the Baptistina family. Finally, it appears that the pre-atmospheric flux of carbonaceous chondrites at metre sizes is about the same as that of ordinary chondrites. Given the difference in fall statistics between the two groups (80\% versus 4.4\%), this implies either substantial atmospheric fragmentation of carbonaceous bodies at the level of ${\sim}0.5\,{\rm MPa}$, or destruction by thermal cracking and water desorption. The source regions of most meteorites and kilometre-sized NEOs have now been determined; including some minor classes like enstatite chondrites and achondrites (Nysa, Hungaria), acapulcoites/lodranites (Iannini).

 - **Abstract**
 In the early universe, strong large scale random flows prevail, and when these flows collide it produces sheets and filaments for the conventional particle dark matter model. However, for wave dark matter, the sheets and filaments are parallelly modulated by fine-scale and large-amplitude interference fringes. These long fine fringes tend to be unstable initially and subsequently deform and collapse to form halos of various sizes, perhaps down to proto-globular cluster scales. This work aims to investigate the instability of such fringes. Two colliding streams of quantum waves result in a standing density wave. By contrast, two colliding beams in classical collisionless fluid systems often give rise to beam instability, characterized by unstable oscillations with a complex frequency. Will the quantum standing density wave be subject to a similar instability? In fact, such unstable oscillations have never been observed in conventional quantum mechanical systems. This study discovers that periodic fringes can indeed undergo unstable oscillations or beam instability. The presence of any local density null in the background density that fails the Madelung formulation is shown to be the necessary condition for unstable oscillations. We establish a phase diagram to distinguish between beam instability, Jeans instability, and stable oscillation through theoretical calculations and computer simulations. Roughly speaking, Jeans instability almost always occurs for long-wave density perturbations; beam instability on the other hand always occurs when the density wave is aligned with the beam direction and moreover the period of the density wave is twice the period of background density; lastly, both instabilities diminish for a very low background density. We have engaged in Blocks theorem extensively in the analysis.

 C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$, as unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules, are important for forming large organic molecules in the interstellar medium. We present mapping observations of C$_4$H ($N$=9$-8$) lines, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ($J_{Ka,Kb}$=2$_{1,2}$-1$_{0,1}$) %at 85338.894 MHz and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J$=1$-0$) %at 86754.2884 MHz toward 19 nearby cold molecular cores in the Milky Way with the IRAM 30m telescope. C$_4$H 9--8 was detected in 13 sources, while $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ was detected in 18 sources. The widely existing C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ molecules in cold cores provide material to form large organic molecules. Different spatial distributions between C$_4$H 9--8 and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ 2--1 were found. The relative abundances of these three molecules were obtained under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with a fixed excitation temperature. The abundance ratio of C$_4$H to $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ranged from 0.34 $\pm$ 0.09 in G032.93+02 to 4.65 $\pm$ 0.50 in G008.67+22. A weak correlation between C$_4$H/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance ratios was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.46, which indicates that there is no tight astrochemical connection between C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a class of intense celestial events that can be standardized for measuring cosmological parameters, bridging the gap between type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we discuss the cosmological applications of SLSNe from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our estimation suggests that SLSNe rate is biased tracing the cosmic star formation rate, exhibiting a factor of $(1+z)^{1.2}$. We futher predict that CSST is poised to observe $\sim 360$ SLSNe in the 10 square degrees ultra-deep field survey within a span of 2.5 years. A stringent constraint on cosmological parameters can be derived from their peak-color relationship. CSST is anticipated to uncover a substantial number of SLSNe, contributing to a deeper understanding of their central engines and shedding light on the nature of dark energy at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 PDS~70 is a protoplanetary system that hosts two actively accreting gas giants, namely PDS~70b and PDS~70c. The system has a $\sim$60--100 au dusty ring that has been resolved by ALMA, along with circumplanetary disks around the two gas giants. Here we report the first JVLA Q (40--48 GHz), Ka (29--37 GHz), K (18--26 GHz), and X (8--12 GHz) bands continuum observations, and the complementary ALMA Bands 3 ($\sim$98 GHz) and 4 ($\sim$145 GHz) observations towards PDS~70. The dusty ring appears azimuthally asymmetric in our ALMA images. We obtained firm detections at Ka and K bands without spatially resolving the source; we obtained a marginal detection at Q band, and no detection at X band. The spectral indices ($\alpha$) are 5$\pm$1 at 33--44 GHz and 0.6$\pm$0.2 at 22--33 GHz. At 10--22 GHz, the conservative lower limit of $\alpha$ is 1.7. The 33--44 GHz flux density is likely dominated by the optically thin thermal emission of grown dust with $\gtrsim$1 mm maximum grain sizes, which may be associated with the azimuthally asymmetric substructure induced by planet-disk interaction. Since PDS~70 was not detected at X band, we found it hard to explain the low spectral index at 22--33 GHz only with free-free emission. Hence, we attribute the dominant emission at 22--33 GHz to the emission of spinning nanometer-sized dust particles, while free-free emission may partly contribute to emission at this frequency range. In some protoplanetary disks, the emission of spinning nanometer-sized dust particles may resemble the 20--50 GHz excess in the spectra of millimeter-sized dust. The finding of strong continuum emission of spinning nanometer-sized particles can complicate the procedure of constraining the properties of grown dust. Future high-resolution, multi-frequency JVLA/ngVLA and SKA observations may shed light on this issue.

 - **Abstract**
 The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84°12'5.61" S and longitude 60°41'59.61" E, is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.

 - **Abstract**
 The asteroid (142) Polana is classified as a B-type asteroid located in the inner Main Belt. This asteroid is the parent of the New Polana family, which has been proposed to be the likely source of primitive near-Earth asteroids such as the B-type asteroid (101955) Bennu. To investigate the compositional correlation between Polana and Bennu at the 3-micron band and their aqueous alteration histories, we analyzed the spectra of Polana in the ~2.0-4.0-micron spectral range using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. Our findings indicate that Polana does not exhibit discernable 3-micron hydrated mineral absorption (within 2 sigma), which is in contrast to asteroid Bennu. Bennu displayed a significant 3-micron absorption feature similar to CM- and CI-type carbonaceous chondrites. This suggests two possibilities: either Bennu did not originate from the New Polana family parented by asteroid Polana or the interior of Bennu's parent body was not homogenous, with diverse levels of aqueous alteration. Several explanations support the latter possibility, including heating due to shock waves and pressure, which could have caused the current dehydrated state of Bennu's parent body.

 - **Abstract**
 XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) is an astronomical satellite with the capability of high-resolution spectroscopy with the X-ray microcalorimeter, Resolve, and wide field-of-view imaging with the CCD camera, Xtend. The Xtend consists of the mirror assembly (XMA: X-ray Mirror Assembly) and detector (SXI: Soft X-ray Imager). The components of SXI include CCDs, analog and digital electronics, and a mechanical cooler. After the successful launch on September 6th, 2023 (UT) and subsequent critical operations, the mission instruments were turned on and set up. The CCDs have been kept at the designed operating temperature of $-110^\circ$C ~after the electronics and cooling system were successfully set up. During the initial operation phase, which continued for more than a month after the critical operations, we verified the observation procedure, stability of the cooling system, all the observation options with different imaging areas and/or timing resolutions, and operations for protection against South Atlantic Anomaly. We optimized the operation procedure and observation parameters including the cooler settings, imaging areas for the specific modes with higher timing resolutions, and event selection algorithm. We summarize our policy and procedure of the initial operations for SXI. We also report on a couple of issues we faced during the initial operations and lessons learned from them.

 - **Abstract**
 Xtend is one of the two telescopes onboard the X-ray imaging and spectroscopy mission (XRISM), which was launched on September 7th, 2023. Xtend comprises the Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), an X-ray CCD camera, and the X-ray Mirror Assembly (XMA), a thin-foil-nested conically approximated Wolter-I optics. A large field of view of $38^{\prime}\times38^{\prime}$ over the energy range from 0.4 to 13 keV is realized by the combination of the SXI and XMA with a focal length of 5.6 m. The SXI employs four P-channel, back-illuminated type CCDs with a thick depletion layer of 200 $\mu$m. The four CCD chips are arranged in a 2$\times$2 grid and cooled down to $-110$ $^{\circ}$C with a single-stage Stirling cooler. Before the launch of XRISM, we conducted a month-long spacecraft thermal vacuum test. The performance verification of the SXI was successfully carried out in a course of multiple thermal cycles of the spacecraft. About a month after the launch of XRISM, the SXI was carefully activated and the soundness of its functionality was checked by a step-by-step process. Commissioning observations followed the initial operation. We here present pre- and post-launch results verifying the Xtend performance. All the in-orbit performances are consistent with those measured on ground and satisfy the mission requirement. Extensive calibration studies are ongoing.

          Water Evolution & Inventories of Super-Earths Orbiting Late M-Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths orbiting M-dwarf stars may be the most common habitable planets in the Universe. However, their habitability is threatened by intense irradiation from their host stars, which drives the escape of water to space and can lead to surface desiccation. We present simulation results of a box model of water cycling between interior and atmosphere and loss to space, for terrestrial planets of mass 1--8 $M_\oplus$ orbiting in the habitable zone of a late M-dwarf. Energy-limited loss decreases with planetary mass, while diffusion-limited loss increases with mass. Depending on where it orbits in the habitable zone, a 1 $M_\oplus$ planet that starts with 3--8 Earth Oceans can end up with an Earth-like surface of oceans and exposed continents; for an 8 $M_\oplus$ super-Earth, that range is 3--12 Earth Oceans. Planets initialized with more water end up as waterworlds with no exposed continents, while planets that start with less water have desiccated surfaces by 5 Gyr. Since the mantles of terrestrial planets can hold much more water than is currently present in Earth's atmosphere, none of our simulations result in Dune planets -- such planets may be less common than previously thought. Further, more water becomes sequestered within the mantle for larger planets. A super-Earth at the inner edge of the habitable zone tends to end up as either a waterworld or with a desiccated surface; only a narrow range of initial water inventory yields an Earth-like surface.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide Field Imager (WFI), one of two instruments on ESA's next large X-ray mission Athena, is designed for imaging spectroscopy of X-rays in the range of 0.2 to 15 keV with a large field of view and high count rate capability. The focal plane consists of back-illuminated DEPFET (Depleted p-channel field effect transistor) sensors that have a high radiation tolerance and provide a near Fano-limited energy resolution. To achieve this, a very low noise readout is required, about 3 electrons ENC at beginning of life is foreseen. This makes the device very susceptible to any radiation induced worsening of the readout noise. The main mechanism of degradation will be the increase of dark current due to displacement damage caused primarily by high energy protons. To study the expected performance degradation, a prototype detector module with fully representative pixel layout and fabrication technology was irradiated with 62.4 MeV protons at the accelerator facility MedAustron in Wiener Neustadt. A total dose equivalent to 3.3 $\mathrm{10^{9}}$ 10-MeV protons/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ was applied in two steps. During, in-between and after the irradiations the detector remained at the operating temperature of 213 K and was fully biased and operated. Data was recorded to analyze the signal of all incident particles. We report on the increase of dark current after the irradiation and present the current related damage rate at 213 K. The effect of low temperature annealing at 213 K , 236 K, 253 K, 273 K, and 289 K is presented.

          Reionization Parameter Inference from 3D Minkowski Functionals of the 21 cm Signals

 - **Abstract**
 The Minkowski Functionals (MFs), a set of topological summary statistics, have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information. We investigate the prospect of constraining the reionization parameters using the MFs of the 21 cm brightness temperature field from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Realistic effects, including thermal noise, synthesized beam, and foreground avoidance, are applied to the mock observations from the radio interferometric array experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We demonstrate that the MFs of the 21 cm signal measured with SKA-Low can be used to distinguish different reionization models, whereas the MF measurement with a HERA-like array cannot be made accurately enough. We further forecast the accuracies with which the MF measurements can place constraints on reionization parameters, using the standard MCMC analysis for parameter inference based on forward modeling. We find that for SKA-Low observation, MFs provide unbiased estimations of the reionization parameters with accuracies comparable to the power spectrum (PS) analysis. Furthermore, joint constraints using both MFs and PS can improve the constraint accuracies by up to $30\%$ compared to those with the PS alone. Nevertheless, the constraint accuracies can be degraded if the EoR window is shrunk with strong foreground avoidance. Our analysis demonstrates the promise of MFs as a set of summary statistics that extract complementary information from the 21 cm EoR field to the two-point statistics, which suggests a strong motivation for incorporating the MFs into the data analysis of future 21 cm observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Earth binary asteroid Didymos was the target of a planetary defense demonstration mission DART in September 2022. The smaller binary component, Dimorphos, was impacted by the spacecraft in order to measure momentum transfer in kinetic impacts into rubble piles. DART and associated Earth-based observation campaigns have provided a wealth of scientific data on the Didymos-Dimorphos binary. DART revealed a largely oblate and ellipsoidal shape of Dimorphos before the impact, while the post-impact observations suggest that Dimorphos now has a prolate shape. Here we add those data points to the known properties of small binary asteroids and propose new paradigms of the radiative binary YORP (BYORP) effect as well as tidal dissipation in small binaries. We find that relatively spheroidal bodies like Dimorphos made of small debris may experience a weaker and more size-dependent BYORP effect than previously thought. This could explain the observed values of period drift in several well-characterized binaries. We also propose that energy dissipation in small binaries is dominated by relatively brief episodes of large-scale movement of (likely surface) materials, rather than long-term steady-state tidal dissipation. We propose that one such episode was triggered on Dimorphos by the DART impact. Depending on the longevity of this high-dissipation regime, it is possible that Dimorphos will be more dynamically relaxed in time for the Hera mission than it was in the weeks following the impact.

          The Solar System could have formed in a low-viscosity disc: A dynamical study from giant planet migration to the Nice model

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of low-viscosity protoplanetary discs (PPDs), the formation scenarios of the Solar System should be revisited. In particular, the Jupiter-Saturn pair has been shown to lock in the 2:1 mean motion resonance while migrating generally inwards, making the Grand Tack scenario impossible. We explore what resonant chains of multiple giant planets can form in a low-viscosity disc, and whether these configurations can evolve into forming the Solar System in the post gas disc phase. We used hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration of the giant planets in a disc with viscosity $\alpha=10^{-4}$. After a transition phase to a gas-less configuration, we studied the stability of the obtained resonant chains through their interactions with a disc of leftover planetesimals by performing N-body simulations using rebound. The gaps open by giant planets are wider and deeper for lower viscosity, reducing the damping effect of the disc and thus weakening resonant chains. Exploring numerous configurations, we found five stable resonant chains of four or five planets. In a thin PPD, the four giant planets revert their migration and migrate outwards. After disc dispersal, under the influence of a belt of planetesimals, some resonant chains undergo an instability phase while others migrate smoothly over a billion years. For three of our resonant chains, about 1% of the final configurations pass the four criteria to fit the Solar System. The most successful runs are obtained for systems formed in a cold PPD with a massive planetesimal disc. This work provides a fully consistent study of the dynamical history of the Solar System's giant planets, from the protoplanetary disc phase up to the giant planet instability. Although building resonant configurations is difficult in low-viscosity discs, we find it possible to reproduce the Solar System from a cold, low-viscosity protoplanetary disc.
