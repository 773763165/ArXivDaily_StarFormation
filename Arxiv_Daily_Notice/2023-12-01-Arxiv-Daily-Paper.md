#### Accurate halo mass functions from the simplest excursion set theory
 - **Authors:** M. Sten Delos

 - **Abstract**
 Excursion set theory is a powerful and widely used tool for describing the distribution of dark matter haloes, but it is normally applied with simplifying approximations. We use numerical sampling methods to study the mass functions predicted by the theory without approximations. With a spherical top-hat window and a constant $\delta=1.5$ threshold, the theory accurately predicts mass functions with the $M_{200}$ mass definition, both unconditional and conditional, in simulations of a range of matter-dominated cosmologies. For $\Lambda$CDM at the present epoch, predictions lie between the $M_\mathrm{200m}$ and $M_\mathrm{200c}$ mass functions. In contrast, with the same window function, a nonconstant threshold based on ellipsoidal collapse predicts uniformly too few haloes. This work indicates a new way to simply and accurately evaluate halo mass functions, clustering bias, and assembly histories for a range of cosmologies. We provide a simple fitting function that accurately represents the predictions of the theory for a wide range of parameters.
#### Filament formation due to diffusive instabilities in dusty  protoplanetary disks
 - **Authors:** Konstantin Gerbig, Min-Kai Lin (ASIAA, NCTS Physics Division), Marius Lehmann

 - **Abstract**
 We report the finding of a new, local diffusion instability in a protoplanetary disk, which can operate in a dust fluid, subject to mass diffusion, shear viscosity, and dust-gas drag, provided diffusivity, viscosity, or both decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing dust surface mass density. We devise a vertically averaged, axisymmetric hydrodynamic model to describe a dense, mid-plane dust layer in a protoplanetary disk. The gas is modeled as a passive component, imposing an effective, diffusion-dependent pressure, mass diffusivity, and viscosity onto the otherwise collisionless dust fluid, via turbulence excited by the gas alone, or dust and gas in combination. In particular, we argue that such conditions are met when the dust-gas mixture generates small-scale turbulence through the streaming instability, as supported by recent measurements of dust mass diffusion slopes in simulations. We hypothesize that the newly discovered instability may be the origin of filamentary features, almost ubiquitously found in simulations of the streaming instability. In addition, our model allows for growing oscillatory modes, which operate in a similar fashion as the axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings. However, it remains speculative if the required conditions for such modes can be met in protoplanetary disks.
#### Echoes in the Noise: Posterior Samples of Faint Galaxy Surface  Brightness Profiles with Score-Based Likelihoods and Priors

 - **Abstract**
 Examining the detailed structure of galaxy populations provides valuable insights into their formation and evolution mechanisms. Significant barriers to such analysis are the non-trivial noise properties of real astronomical images and the point spread function (PSF) which blurs structure. Here we present a framework which combines recent advances in score-based likelihood characterization and diffusion model priors to perform a Bayesian analysis of image deconvolution. The method, when applied to minimally processed \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} (\emph{HST}) data, recovers structures which have otherwise only become visible in next-generation \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (\emph{JWST}) imaging.
#### Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA: Spiral Accretion into  the High-mass Protostellar Core G336.01-0.82

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18006
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18006
 - **Abstract**
 We observed the high-mass star-forming core G336.01-0.82 at 1.3 mm and 0.05'' (~150 au) angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. These high-resolution observations reveal two spiral streamers feeding a circumstellar disk at opposite sides in great detail. Molecular line emission from CH$_3$OH shows velocity gradients along the streamers consistent with infall. Similarly, a flattened envelope model with rotation and infall implies a mass larger than 10 M$_\odot$ for the central source and a centrifugal barrier of 300 au. The location of the centrifugal barrier is consistent with local peaks in the continuum emission. We argue that gas brought by the spiral streamers is accumulating at the centrifugal barrier, which can result in future accretion burst events. A total high infall rate of ~$4\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is derived by matching models to the observed velocity gradient along the streamers. Their contribution account for 20-50% the global infall rate of the core, indicating streamers play an important role in the formation of high-mass stars.
#### Towards out-of-distribution generalization in large-scale astronomical  surveys: robust networks learn similar representations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18007
 - **Abstract**
 The generalization of machine learning (ML) models to out-of-distribution (OOD) examples remains a key challenge in extracting information from upcoming astronomical surveys. Interpretability approaches are a natural way to gain insights into the OOD generalization problem. We use Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure metric of neural network representations, to examine the relationship between representation similarity and performance of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CAMELS Multifield Dataset. We find that when models are robust to a distribution shift, they produce substantially different representations across their layers on OOD data. However, when they fail to generalize, these representations change less from layer to layer on OOD data. We discuss the potential application of similarity representation in guiding model design, training strategy, and mitigating the OOD problem by incorporating CKA as an inductive bias during training.
#### Active learning meets fractal decision boundaries: a cautionary tale  from the Sitnikov three-body problem

 - **Abstract**
 Chaotic systems such as the gravitational N-body problem are ubiquitous in astronomy. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly deployed to predict the evolution of such systems, e.g. with the goal of speeding up simulations. Strategies such as active Learning (AL) are a natural choice to optimize ML training. Here we showcase an AL failure when predicting the stability of the Sitnikov three-body problem, the simplest case of N-body problem displaying chaotic behavior. We link this failure to the fractal nature of our classification problem's decision boundary. This is a potential pitfall in optimizing large sets of N-body simulations via AL in the context of star cluster physics, galactic dynamics, or cosmology.
#### Learning an Effective Evolution Equation for Particle-Mesh Simulations  Across Cosmologies

 - **Abstract**
 Particle-mesh simulations trade small-scale accuracy for speed compared to traditional, computationally expensive N-body codes in cosmological simulations. In this work, we show how a data-driven model could be used to learn an effective evolution equation for the particles, by correcting the errors of the particle-mesh potential incurred on small scales during simulations. We find that our learnt correction yields evolution equations that generalize well to new, unseen initial conditions and cosmologies. We further demonstrate that the resulting corrected maps can be used in a simulation-based inference framework to yield an unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. The model, a network implemented in Fourier space, is exclusively trained on the particle positions and velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a technique for measuring focus errors in a cryogenic, wide-field, near-infrared space telescope. The measurements are made with a collimator looking through a large vacuum window, with a reflective cold filter to reduce background thermal infrared loading on the detectors and optics. For the $300\textrm{ mm}$ diameter aperture $f/3$ space telescope, SPHEREx, we achieve a focus position measurement with $\sim \! 5\textrm{ }\mu \textrm{m statistical}$ and $\sim \! 15 \textrm{ }\mu \textrm{m systematic}$ error.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astronomical experiments are designed to achieve multiple scientific goals, from studies of galaxy evolution to cosmic acceleration. These goals require data of many different classes of night-sky objects, each of which has a particular set of observational needs. These observational needs are typically in strong competition with one another. This poses a challenging multi-objective optimization problem that remains unsolved. The effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a valuable paradigm for training autonomous systems has been well-demonstrated, and it may provide the basis for self-driving telescopes capable of optimizing the scheduling for astronomy campaigns. Simulated datasets containing examples of interactions between a telescope and a discrete set of sky locations on the celestial sphere can be used to train an RL model to sequentially gather data from these several locations to maximize a cumulative reward as a measure of the quality of the data gathered. We use simulated data to test and compare multiple implementations of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for the task of optimizing the schedule of observations from the Stone Edge Observatory (SEO). We combine multiple improvements on the DQN and adjustments to the dataset, showing that DQNs can achieve an average reward of 87%+-6% of the maximum achievable reward in each state on the test set. This is the first comparison of offline RL algorithms for a particular astronomical challenge and the first open-source framework for performing such a comparison and assessment task.
#### Detecting Biosignatures in Nearby Rocky Exoplanets using High-Contrast  Imaging and Medium-Resolution Spectroscopy with Extremely Large Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 In the upcoming decades, one of the primary objectives in exoplanet science is to search for habitable planets and signs of extraterrestrial life in the universe. Signs of life can be indicated by thermal-dynamical imbalance in terrestrial planet atmospheres. O$_2$ and CH$_4$ in the modern Earth's atmosphere are such signs, commonly termed biosignatures. These biosignatures in exoplanetary atmospheres can potentially be detectable through high-contrast imaging instruments on future extremely large telescopes (ELTs). To quantify the signal-to-noise ($S/N$) ratio with ELTs, we select up to 10 nearby rocky planets and simulate medium resolution (R $\sim$ 1000) direct imaging of these planets using the Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (ELT/METIS, 3-5.6 $\mu$m) and the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral field spectrograph (ELT/HARMONI, 0.5-2.45 $\mu$m). We calculate the $S/N$ for the detection of biosignatures including CH$_4$, O$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$. Our results show that GJ 887~b has the highest detection $S/N$ for biosignatures and Proxima Cen b exhibits the only detectable CO$_2$ among the targets for ELT/METIS direct imaging. We also investigate the TRAPPIST-1 system, the archetype of nearby transiting rocky planet systems, and compare the biosignature detection $S/N$ of transit spectroscopy with JWST versus direct spectroscopy with ELT/HARMONI. Our findings indicate JWST is more suitable for detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of transiting planet systems such as TRAPPIST-1 that are relatively further away and have smaller angular separations than more nearby non-transiting planets.
#### Comet 81P/Wild 2: A Record of the Solar System's Wild Youth

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Stardust mission returned rocky material from the coma of comet 81P/Wild 2 (pronounced "Vilt 2") to Earth for laboratory study on January 15, 2006. Comet Wild 2 contains volatile ices and likely accreted beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was expected that the Wild 2 samples would contain abundant primordial molecular cloud material--interstellar and circumstellar grains. Instead, the interstellar component of Wild 2 was found to be very minor, and nearly all of the returned particles formed in broad and diverse regions of the solar nebula. While some characteristics of the Wild 2 material are similar to primitive chondrites, its compositional diversity testifies to a very different origin and evolution history than asteroids. Comet Wild 2 does not exist on a continuum with known asteroids. Collisional debris from asteroids is mostly absent in Wild 2, and it likely accreted dust from the outer and inner Solar System (across the putative gap created by a forming Jupiter) before dispersal of the solar nebula. Comets are a diverse set of bodies, and Wild 2 may represent a type of comet that accreted a high fraction of dust processed in the young Solar System.
#### Phenomenology of a vector-field-induced (and possibly parity breaking)  compensated isocurvature perturbation

 - **Abstract**
 It is natural to wonder whether there may be observational relics of new fundamental fields, beyond the inflaton, in large scale structure. Here we discuss the phenomenology of a model in which compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) arise through the action of a primordial vector field that displaces dark matter relative to baryons. The model can be tested best by kinematic-Sunyaev-Zeldovich tomography, which involves the cross-correlation of cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys, with next-generation observatories. There are also signatures of the vectorial nature of the new field that may be detectable in forthcoming galaxy surveys, but the galaxy survey cannot alone indicate the presence of a CIP. Models that induce a parity breaking four-point correlation in the galaxy distribution are also possible.
#### An Optical Search for New Outbursting Low Mass X-Ray Binaries

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18150
 - **Abstract**
 Transient Low-Mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are discovered largely by X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitors. The X-ray outburst is also accompanied by an optical brightening, which empirically can precede detection of X-rays. Newly sensitive optical synoptic surveys may offer a complementary pathway for discovery, and potential for insight into the initial onset and propagation of the thermal instability that leads to the ionization of the accretion disk. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream to perform a comprehensive search at optical wavelengths for previously undiscovered outbursting LMXBs. Our pipeline first crossmatches the positions of the alerts to cataloged X-ray sources, and then analyzes the 30-day lightcurve of matched alerts by thresholding on differences with an 8-day exponentially weighted moving average. In addition to an nineteen month-long live search, we ran our pipeline over four years of ZTF archival data, recovering 4 known LMXBs. We also independently detected an outburst of MAXI J1957+032 in the live search and found the first outburst of Swift J1943.4+0228, an unclassified X-ray transient, in 10 years. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the Galactic LMXB population, we estimate that 29% of outbursting LMXBs are detectable by ZTF and that 4.4% of LMXBs would be present in the crossmatched X-ray catalogs, giving an estimated Galactic population of $3390^{+3980}_{-1930}$. We estimate that our current pipeline can detect 1.3% of all outbursting LMXBs, including those previously unknown, but that Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be able to detect 43% of outbursting LMXBs.
#### New Eruptive YSOs from SPICY and WISE

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18187
 - **Abstract**
 This work presents four high-amplitude variable YSOs ($\simeq$ 3 mag at near- or mid-IR wavelengths) arising from the SPICY catalog. Three outbursts show a duration that is longer than 1 year, and are still ongoing. And additional YSO brightened over the last two epochs of NEOWISE observations and the duration of the outburst is thus unclear. Analysis of the spectra of the four sources confirms them as new members of the eruptive variable class. We find two YSOs that can be firmly classified as bona fide FUors and one object that falls in the V1647 Ori-like class. Given the uncertainty in the duration of its outburst, an additional YSO can only be classified as a candidate FUor. Continued monitoring and follow-up of these particular sources is important to better understand the accretion process of YSOs.

 - **Abstract**
 Sky survey telescopes play a critical role in modern astronomy, but misalignment of their optical elements can introduce significant variations in point spread functions, leading to reduced data quality. To address this, we need a method to obtain misalignment states, aiding in the reconstruction of accurate point spread functions for data processing methods or facilitating adjustments of optical components for improved image quality. Since sky survey telescopes consist of many optical elements, they result in a vast array of potential misalignment states, some of which are intricately coupled, posing detection challenges. However, by continuously adjusting the misalignment states of optical elements, we can disentangle coupled states. Based on this principle, we propose a deep neural network to extract misalignment states from continuously varying point spread functions in different field of views. To ensure sufficient and diverse training data, we recommend employing a digital twin to obtain data for neural network training. Additionally, we introduce the state graph to store misalignment data and explore complex relationships between misalignment states and corresponding point spread functions, guiding the generation of training data from experiments. Once trained, the neural network estimates misalignment states from observation data, regardless of the impacts caused by atmospheric turbulence, noise, and limited spatial sampling rates in the detector. The method proposed in this paper could be used to provide prior information for the active optics system and the optical system alignment.
#### MBH binary intruders: triple systems from cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole (MBH) binaries can form following a galaxy merger, but this may not always lead to a MBH binary merger within a Hubble time. The merger timescale depends on how efficiently the MBHs lose orbital energy to the gas and stellar background, and to gravitational waves (GWs). In systems where these mechanisms are inefficient, the binary inspiral time can be long enough for a subsequent galaxy merger to bring a third MBH into the system. In this work, we identify and characterize the population of triple MBH systems in the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We find a substantial occurrence rate of triple MBH systems: in our fiducial model, 22% of all binary systems form triples, and $>70$% of these involve binaries that would not otherwise merge by $z=0$. Furthermore, a significant subset of triples (6% of all binaries, or more than a quarter of all triples) form a triple system at parsec scales, where the three BHs are most likely to undergo a strong three-body interaction. Crucially, we find that the rate of triple occurrence has only a weak dependence on key parameters of the binary inspiral model (binary eccentricity and stellar loss-cone refilling rate). We also do not observe strong trends in the host galaxy properties for binary versus triple MBH populations. Our results demonstrate the potential for triple systems to increase MBH merger rates, thereby enhancing the low-frequency GW signals detectable with pulsar timing arrays and with LISA.
#### The distribution of volatile elements during rocky planet formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18262
 - **Abstract**
 Core segregation and atmosphere formation are two of the major processes that redistribute the volatile elements-hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S)-in and around rocky planets during their formation. The volatile elements by definition accumulate in gaseous reservoirs and form atmospheres. However, under conditions of early planet formation, these elements can also behave as siderophiles (i.e., iron-loving) and become concentrated in core-forming metals. Current models of core formation suggest that metal-silicate reactions occurred over a wide pressure, temperature, and compositional space to ultimately impose the chemistries of the cores and silicate portions of rocky planets. Additionally, the solubilities of volatile elements in magmas determine their transfer between the planetary interiors and atmospheres, which has recently come into sharper focus in the context of highly irradiated, potentially molten exoplanets. Recently, there has been a significant push to experimentally investigate the metal-silicate and magma-gas exchange coefficients for volatile elements over a wide range of conditions relevant to rocky planet formation. Qualitatively, results from the metal-silicate partitioning studies suggest that cores of rocky planets could be major reservoirs of the volatile elements though significant amounts will remain in mantles. Results from solubility studies imply that under oxidizing conditions, most H and S are sequestered in the magma ocean, while most N is outgassed to the atmosphere, and C is nearly equally distributed between the atmosphere and the interior. Under reducing conditions, nearly all N dissolves in the magma ocean, the atmosphere becomes the dominant C reservoir, while H becomes more equally distributed between the interior and the atmosphere, and S remains dominantly in the interior.
#### 2D disc modelling of the JWST line spectrum of EX Lupi

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a number of new theoretical approaches and improvements to the thermo-chemical disc modelling code ProDiMo to better predict and analyse the JWST line spectra of protoplanetary discs. We develop a new line escape probability method for disc geometries, a new scheme for dust settling, and discuss how to apply UV molecular shielding factors to photorates in 2D disc geometry. We show that these assumptions are crucial for the determination of the gas heating/cooling rates and discuss how they affect the predicted molecular concentrations and line emissions. We apply our revised 2D models to the protoplanetary disc around the T Tauri star EX Lupi in quiescent state. We calculate infrared line emission spectra between 5 and 20 mic by CO, H2O, OH, CO2, HCN, C2H2 and H2, including lines of atoms and ions, using our full 2D predictions of molecular abundances, dust opacities, gas and dust temperatures. We develop a disc model with a slowly increasing surface density structure around the inner rim that can simultaneously fit the spectral energy distribution, the overall shape of the JWST spectrum of EX Lupi, and the main observed molecular characteristics in terms of column densities, emitting areas and molecular emission temperatures, which all result from one consistent disc model. The spatial structure of the line emitting regions of the different molecules is discussed. High abundances of HCN and C2H2 are caused in the model by stellar X-ray irradiation of the gas around the inner rim.
#### AESTRA: Deep Learning for Precise Radial Velocity Estimation in the  Presence of Stellar Activity

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity interferes with precise radial velocity measurements and limits our ability to detect and characterize planets, particularly Earth-like planets. We introduce \aestra (Auto-Encoding STellar Radial-velocity and Activity), a deep learning method for precise radial velocity measurements. It combines a spectrum auto-encoder, which learns to create realistic models of the star's rest-frame spectrum, and a radial-velocity estimator, which learns to identify true Doppler shifts in the presence of spurious shifts due to line-profile variations. Being self-supervised, \aestra does not need "ground truth" radial velocities for training, making it applicable to exoplanet host stars for which the truth is unknown. In tests involving 1,000 simulated spectra, \aestra can detect planetary signals as low as 0.1 m/s even in the presence of 3 m/s of activity-induced noise and 0.3 m/s of photon noise per spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 The BRIght Target Explorer (BRITE) mission collects photometric time series in two passbands aiming to investigate stellar structure and evolution. Since their launches in the years 2013 and 2014, the constellation of five BRITE nano-satellites has observed a total of more than 700 individual bright stars in 64 fields. Some targets have been observed multiple times. Thus, the total time base of the data sets acquired for those stars can be as long as nine years. Our aim is to provide a complete description of ready-to-use BRITE data, to show the scientific potential of the BRITE-Constellation data by identifying the most interesting targets, and to demonstrate and encourage how scientists can use these data in their research. We apply a decorrelation process to the automatically reduced BRITE-Constellation data to correct for instrumental effects. We perform a statistical analysis of the light curves obtained for the 300 stars observed in the first 14 fields during the first ~2.5 years of the mission. We also perform cross-identification with the International Variable Star Index. We present the data obtained by the BRITE-Constellation mission in the first 14 fields it observed from November 2013 to April 2016. We also describe the properties of the data for these fields and the 300 stars observed in them. Using these data, we detected variability in 64% of the presented sample of stars. Sixty-four stars or 21.3% of the sample have not yet been identified as variable in the literature and their data have not been analysed in detail. They can therefore provide valuable scientific material for further research. All data are made publicly available through the BRITE Public Data Archive and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate new evolutionary models of rotating primordial very massive stars, with initial mass from ${100\,M_{\odot}}$ to ${200\,M_{\odot}}$, for two values of the initial metallicity ${Z=0}$ and ${Z=0.0002}$. For the first time in this mass range, we consider stellar rotation and pulsation-driven mass loss, along with radiative winds. The models evolve from the zero-age main sequence, until the onset of pair instability. We discuss the main properties of the models during their evolution and then focus on the final fate and the possible progenitors of jet-driven events. All tracks that undergo pulsational-pair instability produce successful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the collapsar framework, while those that collapse directly to black holes (BH) produce jet-driven supernova events. In these latter cases, the expected black hole mass changes due to the jet propagation inside the progenitor, resulting in different models that should produce BH within the pair-instability black-hole mass gap. Successful GRBs predicted here from zero-metallicity and very metal-poor progenitors may be bright enough to be detected even up to redshift ${\sim20}$ using current telescopes such as the Swift-BAT X-ray detector and the JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to investigate the potential Hubble tension, we compile a catalogue of 216 measurements of the Hubble--Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ between 2012 and 2022, which includes 109 model-independent measurements and 107 $\Lambda$CDM model-based measurements. Statistical analyses of these measurements show that the deviations of the results with respect to the average $H_0$ are far larger than expected from their error bars if they follow a Gaussian distribution. We find that $x\sigma $ deviation is indeed equivalent in a Gaussian distribution to $x_{\rm eq}\sigma$ deviation in the frequency of values, where $x_{\rm eq}=0.72x^{0.88}$. Hence, a tension of 5$\sigma$, estimated between the Cepheid-calibrated type Ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 3$\sigma$ tension in equivalent terms of a Gaussian distribution of frequencies. However, this recalibration should be independent of the data whose tension we want to test. If we adopt the previous analysis of data of 1976-2019, the equivalent tension is reduced to $2.25\sigma$. Covariance terms due to correlations of measurements do not significantly change the results. Nonetheless, the separation of the data into two blocks with $H_0<71$ and $H_0\ge 71$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ finds compatibility with a Gaussian distribution for each of them without removing any outlier. These statistical results indicate that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ remains prevalent over the past decade, dominated by systematic errors in the methodologies of CMB and local distance ladder analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the potential for dark matter (DM) annihilation within brown dwarfs (BDs), investigating an unconventional mechanism for neutrino production. Motivated by the efficient accumulation of DM particles in BDs through scattering interactions, we focus on a mass range of 1 GeV to 100 TeV, considering DM annihilation channels $\chi \chi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu} \nu \bar{\nu}$ through long-lived mediators. Using ten years of IceCube data, we assess the detection capability of local BDs and exclude DM-nucleon scattering with cross sections as low as a few times $10^{-39}~\rm cm^{2}$. In this case, high-energy neutrinos provide more stringent constraints on DM scattering cross section than gamma rays.

 - **Abstract**
 TCP J18224935-2408280 was reported to be in outburst on 2021 May 19. Follow-up spectroscopic observations confirmed that the system was a symbiotic star. We present optical spectra obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope during 2021-22. The early spectra were dominated by Balmer lines, He I lines and high ionization lines such as He II. In the later observations, Raman scattered O VI was also identified. Outburst in the system started as a disc instability, and later the signature of enhanced shell burning and expansion of photospheric radius of the white dwarf was identified. Hence we suggest this outburst is of combination nova type. The post-outburst temperature of the hot component remains above 1.5 x 10$^5$ K indicating a stable shell burning in the system for a prolonged time after the outburst. Based on our analysis of archival multiband photometric data, we find that the system contains a cool giant of M1-2 III spectral type with a temperature of $\sim$ 3600K and a radius of $\sim$ 69 R$_\odot$. The pre- and post-outburst light curve shows a periodicity of 631.25 $\pm$ 2.93 d; we consider this as the orbital period.
#### Weighing neutrinos with Lyman-$α$ observations

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive neutrinos has still not been revealed by the cosmological data. We consider a novel method based on the two-point line-of-sight correlation function of high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to achieve this end in the paper. We adopt semi-analytic models of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds for the study. We employ Fisher matrix technique to show that it is possible to achieve a scenario in which the covariance of the two-point function nearly vanishes for both the spectroscopic noise and the signal. We analyze this near 'zero noise' outcome in detail to argue it might be possible to detect neutrinos of mass range $m_\nu \simeq 0.05 \hbox{--}0.1 \, \rm eV$ with signal-to-noise of unity with a single QSO line of sight. We show that this estimate can be improved to SNR $\simeq 3\hbox{--}6$ with data along multiple line of sights within the redshift range $z \simeq 2 \hbox{--} 2.5$. Such data sets already exist in the literature. We further carry out principal component analysis of the Fisher matrix to study the degeneracies of the neutrino mass with other parameters. We show that Planck priors lift the degeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters. However, the prospects of the detection of neutrino mass are driven by the poorly-determined parameters characterizing the ionization and thermal state of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The impact of stellar feedback on the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS law), which relates star formation rate (SFR) to surface gas density, is a topic of ongoing debate. The interpretation of individual cloud observations is challenging due to the various processes at play simultaneously and inherent biases. Therefore, a numerical investigation is necessary to understand the role of stellar feedback and identify observable signatures. Aims. We investigate the role of stellar feedback on the KS law, aiming to identify distinct signatures that can be observed and analysed. Methods. We analyse MHD numerical simulations of a $10^4\,M_{\odot}$ cloud evolving under different feedback prescriptions. The set of simulations contains four types of feedback: with only protostellar jets, with ionising radiation from massive stars $(>8\,M_{\odot})$, with both of them and without any stellar feedback. To compare these simulations with the existing observational results, we analyse their evolution by adopting the same techniques applied in observational studies. Then, we simulate how the same analyses would change if the data were affected by typical observational biases. Conclusions. The presence of stellar feedback strongly influences the KS relation and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$). Its impact is primarily governed by its influence on the cloud's structure. Although the $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ measured in our clouds results to be higher than what is usually observed in real clouds, upon applying prescriptions to mimic observational biases we recover good agreement with the expected values. Therefore, we can infer that observations tend to underestimate the total SFR. Moreover, this likely indicates that the physics included in our simulations is sufficient to reproduce the basic mechanisms contributing to set $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$.
#### Experimental study of the binding energy of NH3 on different types of  ice and its impact on the snow line of NH3 and H2O

 - **Abstract**
 N-bearing molecules (like N2H+ or NH3) are excellent tracers of high-density, low-temperature regions like dense cloud cores and could shed light into snowlines in protoplanetary disks and the chemical evolution of comets. However, uncertainties exist about the grain surface chemistry of these molecules -- which could play an important role in their formation and evolution. This study explores experimentally the behaviour of NH$_3$ on surfaces mimicking grains under interstellar conditions alongside other major interstellar ice components (ie. H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$). We performed co-deposition experiments using the Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) setup VENUS (VErs des NoUvelles Syntheses) of NH$_3$ along with other adsorbates (here, H$_2$O, $^{13}$CO and CO$_2$) and performed Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Temperature Programmed-During Exposure Desorption (TP-DED) experiments. We obtained binding Energy (BE) distribution of NH$_3$ on Crystalline Ice(CI) and compact-Amorphous Solid Water (c-ASW) by analyses of the TPD profiles of NH3 on the substrates. We observe a significant delay in the desorption and a decrease in the desorption rate of NH$_3$ when H$_2$O is introduced into the co-deposited mixture of NH$_3$-$^{13}$Co or NH$_3$-CO$_2$, absent without H$_2$O. Secondly, H$_2$O traps nearly 5-9 per cent of the co-deposited NH3, released during water's amorphous-to-crystalline phase change. Thirdly, for CI, we obtained a BE distribution between 3780K-4080K, and c-ASW between 3780K-5280K -- using a pre-exponential factor A = 1.94$\times 10^{15}$/s. We conclude that NH$_3$ behaviour is significantly influenced by the presence of H$_2$O due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, in line with quantum calculations. This interaction preserves NH$_3$ on grain surfaces to higher temperatures making it available to the central protostar in protoplanetary disks. It also explains why NH$_3$ freeze out in pre-stellar cores is efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we report on activities focusing on improving the observation strategy of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Global Observing System (VGOS). During six dedicated 24-hour Research and Development (R&D) sessions conducted in 2022, the effectiveness of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based scheduling approach with observation times as short as 5-20 seconds was explored. The sessions utilized a full 8 Gbps observing mode and incorporated elements such as dedicated calibration scans, a VGOS frequency source-flux catalog, improved sky-coverage parameterization, and more. The number of scans scheduled per station increased by 2.34 times compared to operational VGOS-OPS sessions, resulting in a 2.58 times increase in the number of observations per station. Remarkably, the percentage of successful observations per baseline matched the fixed 30-second observation approach employed in VGOS-OPS, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SNR-based scheduling approach. The impact on the geodetic results was examined based on statistical analysis, revealing a significant improvement when comparing the VGOS-R\&D program with VGOS-OPS. The formal errors in estimated station coordinates decreased by 50 %. The repeatability of baseline lengths improved by 30 %, demonstrating the enhanced precision of geodetic measurements. Furthermore, Earth orientation parameters exhibited substantial improvements, with a 60 % reduction in formal errors, 27 % better agreement w.r.t. IVS-R1/R4, and 13 % better agreement w.r.t. IERS EOP 20C04. Overall, these findings strongly indicate the superiority of the VGOS-R&D program, positioning it as a role model for future operational VGOS observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing has a unique advantage for detecting dark objects in the Milky Way, such as free floating planets, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. Most microlensing surveys focus towards the Galactic bulge, where higher stellar density leads to a higher event rate. However, microlensing events in the Galactic plane are closer, and take place over longer timescales. This enables a better measurement of the microlensing parallax, which serves as an independent constraint on the mass of the dark lens. In this work, we systematically searched for microlensing events in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 17 from 2018--2023 in the Galactic plane region $|b| < 20^\circ$. We find 124 high-confidence microlensing events and 54 possible events. In the event selection, we use the efficient \texttt{EventFinder} algorithm to detect microlensing signals, which could be used for large datasets such as future ZTF data releases or data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). With detection efficiencies of ZTF fields from catalog-level simulations, we calculate the mean Einstein timescale to be $\langle t_\mathrm{E}\rangle = 51.7 \pm 3.3$ days, smaller than previous results of the Galactic plane to within 1.5-$\sigma$. We calculate optical depths and event rates, which we interpret with caution due to the use of visual inspection in creating our final sample. With two years of additional ZTF data in DR17, we have more than doubled the amount of microlensing events (60) found in the three-year DR5 search and found events with longer Einstein timescales than before.
#### Scaling K2 VII: Evidence for a high occurrence rate of hot sub-Neptunes  at intermediate ages

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA K2 mission obtained high precision time-series photometry for four young clusters, including the near-twin 600-800 Myr-old Praesepe and Hyades clusters. Hot sub-Neptunes are highly prone to mass-loss mechanisms, given their proximity to the the host star and the weakly bound gaseous envelopes, and analyzing this population at young ages can provide strong constraints on planetary evolution models. Using our automated transit detection pipeline, we recover 15 planet candidates across the two clusters, including 10 previously confirmed planets. We find a hot sub-Neptune occurrence rate of 79-107% for GKM stars in the Praesepe cluster. This is 2.5-3.5 sigma higher than the occurrence rate of 16.54+1.00-0.98% for the same planets orbiting the ~3-9 Gyr-old GKM field stars observed by K2, even after accounting for the slightly super-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]~0.2 dex) of the Praesepe cluster. We examine the effect of adding ~100 targets from the Hyades cluster, and extending the planet parameter space under examination, and find similarly high occurrence rates in both cases. The high occurrence rate of young, hot sub-Neptunes could indicate either that these planets are undergoing atmospheric evolution as they age, or that planetary systems that formed when the Galaxy was much younger are substantially different than from today. Under the assumption of the atmospheric mass-loss scenario, a significantly higher occurrence rate of these planets at the intermediate ages of Praesepe and Hyades appears more consistent with the core-powered mass loss scenario sculpting the hot sub-Neptune population, compared to the photoevaporation scenario.
#### Compton scattering of electrons in the intergalactic medium

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the distribution and implications of cosmic ray electrons within the intergalactic medium (IGM). Utilizing a synthesis model of the extragalactic background, we evolve the spectrum of Compton-included cosmic rays. The energy density distribution of cosmic ray electrons peaks at redshift $z \approx2$, and peaks in the $\sim$MeV range. The fractional contribution of cosmic ray pressure to the general IGM pressure progressively increases toward lower redshift. At mean density, the ratio of cosmic ray electron to thermal pressure in the IGM $ P_{\rm CRe} / P_{\rm th}$ is 0.3% at $z=2$, rising to 1.0% at $z=1$, and 1.8% at $z=0.1$. We compute the linear Landau damping rate of plasma oscillations in the IGM caused by the $\sim$MeV cosmic ray electrons, and find it to be of order $\sim 10^{-6}\,\rm s^{-1}$ for wavenumbers $1.2\lesssim ck/\omega_{\rm p}\lesssim 5$ at $z=2$ and mean density (where $\omega_{\rm p}$ is the plasma frequency). This strongly affects the fate of TeV $e^+e^-$ pair beams produced by blazars, which are potentially unstable to oblique instabilities involving plasma oscillations with wavenumber $ck/\omega_{\rm p}\approx\sec\theta$ ($\theta$ being the angle between the beam and wave vector). Linear Landau damping is at least thousands of times faster than either pair beam instability growth or collisional effects; it thus turns off the pair beam instability except for modes with very small $\theta$ ($ck/\omega_{\rm p}\rightarrow 1$, where linear Landau damping is kinematically suppressed). This leaves open the question of whether the pair beam instability is turned off entirely, or can still proceed via the small-$\theta$ modes.

 - **Abstract**
 We reconstruct the dark matter density field from spatially overlapping spectroscopic and photometric redshift catalogs through a forward modelling approach. Instead of directly inferring the underlying density field, we find the best fitting initial Gaussian fluctuations that will evolve into the observed cosmic volume. To account for the substantial uncertainty of photometric redshifts we employ a differentiable continuous Poisson process. In the context of the upcoming Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), we find improvements in cosmic structure classification equivalent to 50-100\% more spectroscopic targets by combining relatively sparse spectroscopic with dense photometric samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Chromospheric differential rotation is a key component in comprehending the atmospheric coupling between the chromosphere and the photosphere at different phases of the solar cycle. In this study, we therefore utilize the newly calibrated multidecadal Ca II K spectroheliograms (1907-2007) from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) to investigate the differential rotation of the solar chromosphere using the technique of image cross-correlation. Our analysis yields the chromospheric differential rotation rate $\Omega (\theta) = (14.61\pm 0.04 - 2.18\pm 0.37\sin^2{\theta} - 1.10 \pm 0.61\sin^4{\theta})^\circ{\rm /day}$. These results suggest the chromospheric plages exhibit an equatorial rotation rate 1.59% faster than the photosphere when compared with the differential rotation rate measured using sunspots and also a smaller latitudinal gradient compared to the same. To compare our results to those from other observatories, we have applied our method on a small sample of Ca II K data from Rome, Meudon, and Mt. Wilson observatories, which support our findings from KoSO data. Additionally, we have not found any significant north-south asymmetry or any systematic variation in chromospheric differential rotation over the last century.
