 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has been a matter of debate for decades. The challenges in understanding the SMC chemical evolution are related to a very slow star formation rate (SFR) combined with bursts triggered by the multiple interactions between the SMC and the Large Magellanic Cloud, a significant (~0.5 dex) metallicity dispersion for the SMC cluster population younger than about 7.5 Gyr, and multiple chemical evolution models tracing very different paths through the observed age-metallicity relation of the SMC. There is no doubt that these processes were complex. Therefore, a step-by-step strategy is required in order to better understand the SMC chemical evolution. We adopted an existing framework to split the SMC into regions on the sky, and we focus on the west halo in this work, which contains the oldest and most metal-poor stellar populations and is moving away from the SMC, that is, in an opposite motion with respect to the Magellanic Bridge. We present a sample containing ~60% of all west halo clusters to represent the region well, and we identify a clear age-metallicity relation with a tight dispersion that exhibits a 0.5 dex metallicity dip about 6 Gyr ago. We ran chemical evolution models and discuss possible scenarios to explain this metallicity dip, the most likely being a major merger accelerating the SFR after the event. This merger should be combined with inefficient internal gas mixing within the SMC and different SFRs in different SMC regions because the same metallicity dip is not seen in the AMR of the SMC combining clusters from all regions. We try to explain the scenario to better understand the SMC chemo-dynamical history.

 - **Abstract**
 This study uses archival high frequency continuum data to expand the search for Hypercompact HII regions and determine the conditions at which they appear, as this stage high mass star formation is short-lived and rare. We use 23 GHz continuum data taken towards methanol masers, which are an excellent signpost for very young embedded high-mass protostars. We have searched for high-frequency, optically thick radio sources to identify HC HII region candidates. The data cover 128 fields that include 141 methanol masers identified by the Methanol Multibeam (MMB) survey. We have detected 68 high-frequency radio sources and conducted a multi-wavelength analysis to determine their nature. This has identified 49 HII regions, 47 of which are embedded in dense clumps fourteen of which do not have a 5 GHz radio counterpart. We have identified 13 methanol maser sites that are coincident with radio sources that have a steep positive spectral index. The majority of these are not detected in the mid-infrared and have been classified as protostellar or young stellar objects in the literature and we therefore consider to be good HC HII region candidates, however, further work and higher resolution data are needed to confirm these candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present in this paper a public data release of an unprecedentedly-large set of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) neutrino emission models, comprising one hundred detailed 2D-axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations evolved out to as late as ~5 seconds post-bounce and spanning a extensive range of massive-star progenitors. The motivation for this paper is to provide a physically and numerically uniform benchmark dataset to the broader neutrino detection community to help it characterize and optimize subsurface facilities for what is likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime galactic supernova burst event. With this release we hope to 1) help the international experiment and modeling communities more efficiently optimize the retrieval of physical information about the next galactic core-collapse supernova, 2) facilitate the better understanding of core-collapse theory and modeling among interested experimentalists, and 3) help further integrate the broader supernova neutrino community.

 - **Abstract**
 We compile a catalog of 598 highly probable and 79 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates to date. We matched distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compared to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantified contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we studied the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, the search for radio technosignatures has focused on sky location as a primary discriminant between technosignature candidates and anthropogenic radio frequency interference (RFI). In this work, we investigate the possibility of searching for technosignatures by identifying the presence and nature of intensity scintillations arising from the turbulent, ionized plasma of the interstellar medium (ISM). Past works have detailed how interstellar scattering can both enhance and diminish the detectability of narrowband radio signals. We use the NE2001 Galactic free electron density model to estimate scintillation timescales to which narrowband signal searches would be sensitive, and discuss ways in which we might practically detect strong intensity scintillations in detected signals. We further analyze the RFI environment of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) with the proposed methodology and comment on the feasibility of using scintillation as a filter for technosignature candidates.
#### Laboratory and astronomical discovery of the cyanovinyl radical H2CCCN

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first laboratory and interstellar detection of the alpha-cyano vinyl radical (H2CCCN). This species was produced in the laboratory by an electric discharge of a gas mixture of vinyl cyanide, CH2CHCN, and Ne, and its rotational spectrum was characterized using a Balle-Flygare narrowband-type Fourier-transform microwave spectrometer operating in the frequency region of 8-40 GHz. The observed spectrum shows a complex structure due to tunneling splittings between two torsional sublevels of the ground vibronic state, 0+ and 0-, derived from a large-amplitude inversion motion. In addition, the presence of two equivalent hydrogen nuclei makes necessary to discern between ortho- and para-H2CCCN. A least squares analysis reproduces the observed transition frequencies with a standard deviation of ca. 3 kHz. Using the laboratory predictions, this radical is detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 using the Yebes 40m telescope and the QUIJOTE line survey. The 404-303 and 505-404 rotational transitions, composed of several hyperfine components, were observed in the 31.0-50.4 GHz range. Adopting a rotational temperature of 6K we derive a column density of (1.4+/-0.2)e11 cm-2 and (1.1+/-0.2)e11 cm-2 for ortho-H2CCCN and para-H2CCCN, respectively. The reactions C + CH3CN, and perhaps also N + CH2CCH, emerge as the most likely routes to H2CCCN in TMC-1.

 - **Abstract**
 GJ 367 is a bright (V $\approx$ 10.2) M1 V star that has been recently found to host a transiting ultra-short period sub-Earth on a 7.7 hr orbit. With the aim of improving the planetary mass and radius and unveiling the inner architecture of the system, we performed an intensive radial velocity follow-up campaign with the HARPS spectrograph -- collecting 371 high-precision measurements over a baseline of nearly 3 years -- and combined our Doppler measurements with new TESS observations from sectors 35 and 36. We found that GJ 367 b has a mass of $M_\mathrm{b}$ = 0.633 $\pm$ 0.050 M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_\mathrm{b}$ = 0.699 $\pm$ 0.024 R$_{\oplus}$, corresponding to precisions of 8% and 3.4%, respectively. This implies a planetary bulk density of $\rho_\mathrm{b}$ = 10.2 $\pm$ 1.3 g cm$^{-3}$, i.e., 85% higher than Earth's density. We revealed the presence of two additional non transiting low-mass companions with orbital periods of $\sim$11.5 and 34 days and minimum masses of $M_\mathrm{c}\sin{i_\mathrm{c}}$ = 4.13 $\pm$ 0.36 M$_{\oplus}$ and $M_\mathrm{d}\sin{i_\mathrm{d}}$ = 6.03 $\pm$ 0.49 M$_{\oplus}$, respectively, which lie close to the 3:1 mean motion commensurability. GJ 367 b joins the small class of high-density planets, namely the class of super-Mercuries, being the densest ultra-short period small planet known to date. Thanks to our precise mass and radius estimates, we explored the potential internal composition and structure of GJ 367 b, and found that it is expected to have an iron core with a mass fraction of 0.91$^{+0.07}_{-0.23}$. How this iron core is formed and how such a high density is reached is still not clear, and we discuss the possible pathways of formation of such a small ultra-dense planet.
#### MINDS. Abundant water and varying C/O across the disk of Sz 98 as seen  by JWST/MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 MIRI/MRS on board the JWST allows us to probe the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Here we examine the disk around the classical T Tauri star Sz 98, which has an unusually large dust disk in the millimetre with a compact core. We focus on the H$_2$O emission through both its ro-vibrational and pure rotational emission. Furthermore, we compare our chemical findings with those obtained for the outer disk from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. In order to model the molecular features in the spectrum, the continuum was subtracted and LTE slab models were fitted. The spectrum was divided into different wavelength regions corresponding to H$_2$O lines of different excitation conditions, and the slab model fits were performed individually per region. We confidently detect CO, H$_2$O, OH, CO$_2$, and HCN in the emitting layers. The isotopologue H$^{18}_2$O is not detected. Additionally, no other organics, including C$_2$H$_2$, are detected. This indicates that the C/O ratio could be substantially below unity, in contrast with the outer disk. The H$_2$O emission traces a large radial disk surface region, as evidenced by the gradually changing excitation temperatures and emitting radii. The OH and CO$_2$ emission are relatively weak. It is likely that H$_2$O is not significantly photodissociated; either due to self-shielding against the stellar irradiation, or UV-shielding from small dust particles. The relative emitting strength of the different identified molecular features point towards UV-shielding of H$_2$O in the inner disk of Sz 98, with a thin layer of OH on top. The majority of the organic molecules are either hidden below the dust continuum, or not present. In general, the inferred composition points to a sub-solar C/O ratio (<0.5) in the inner disk, in contrast with the larger than unity C/O ratio in the gas in the outer disk found with ALMA.
