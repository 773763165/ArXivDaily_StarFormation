 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have found evidence for parity violation in the BOSS spectroscopic galaxy survey, with statistical significance as high as $7\sigma$. These analyses assess the significance of the parity-odd four-point correlation function (4PCF) with a statistic called $\chi^2$. This statistic is biased if the parity-even eight-point correlation function (8PCF) of the data differs from the mock catalogs. We construct new statistics $\chi^2_\times$, $\chi^2_{\mathrm{null}}$ that separate the parity violation signal from the 8PCF bias term, allowing them to be jointly constrained. Applying these statistics to BOSS, we find that the parity violation signal ranges from $0$ to $2.5\sigma$ depending on analysis choices, whereas the 8PCF bias term is $\sim 6\sigma$. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for parity violation in BOSS. Our new statistics can be used to search for parity violation in future surveys, such as DESI, without 8PCF biases.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources like neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ for eccentric and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.

          Rest-Frame Optical Spectroscopy of Ten z $\sim$ 2 Weak Emission-Line Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared spectroscopy of ten weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) at redshifts of $z\sim2$, obtained with the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope. WLQs are an exceptional population of type 1 quasars that exhibit weak or no broad emission lines in the ultraviolet (e.g., the C IV $\lambda 1549$ line), and they display remarkable X-ray properties. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\rm 1.7 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value $0.5)$ for our sources. We confirm the previous finding that WLQ H$\beta$ lines, as a major low-ionization line, are not significantly weak compared to typical quasars. The most prominent feature of the WLQ optical spectra is the universally weak/absent [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission. They also display stronger optical Fe II emission than typical quasars. Our results favor the super-Eddington accretion scenario for WLQs, where the weak lines are a result of a soft ionizing continuum; the geometrically thick inner accretion disk and/or its associated outflow is responsible for obscuring the nuclear high-energy radiation and producing the soft ionizing continuum. We also report candidate extreme [O III] outflows (blueshifts of $\approx 500$ and $\rm 4900 km s^{-1}$) in one object.

          Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17SWex Intermediate-Mass Star-Forming Region

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability within the M17 Southwest Extension (M17 SWex), using 3.5 years of monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and 9 years from the NEOWISE mission at mid-infrared (mid-IR). Our study encompasses observations of 147 bright sub-mm peaks identified within our deep JCMT co-added map as well as 156 YSOs in NEOWISE W1 and 179 in W2 that were previously identified in Spitzer surveys. We find three robust sub-mm variables: two are candidate YSOs and one is a likely extragalactic source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 47 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This is similar to what has previously been observed for low-mass YSO variability within the Gould Belt. However, we observe less overall variability in M17SWex at both the sub-mm and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower fraction is due to the greater distance to M17 SWex. Our findings showcase the utility of multi-wavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Precision measurements of the beam pattern response are needed to predict the response of a radio telescope. Mapping the beam of a low frequency radio array presents a unique challenge and science cases such as the observation of the 21\,cm line at high redshift have demanding requirements. Drone-based systems offer the unique potential for a measurement which is entirely under experimenter control, but progress has been paced by practical implementation challenges. Previously, a prototype drone system, called the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO), demonstrated good performance in making a complete hemispherical beam measurement. This paper reports updates to the system focusing on performance of a new drone platform, minimizing interference from the drone, and a new transmitter.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical processes taking place on ice-grain mantles are pivotal to the complex chemistry of interstellar environments. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic effects of an amorphous solid water (ASW) surface on the reaction between ammonia (NH$_3$) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) to form aminomethanol (NH$_2$CH$_2$OH) using density functional theory. We identified potential catalytic sites based on the binding energy distribution of NH$_3$ and H$_2$CO reactants, on a set-of-clusters surface model composed of 22 water molecules and found a total of 14 reaction paths. Our results indicate that the catalytic sites can be categorized into four groups, depending on the interactions of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino group with the ice surface in the reactant complex. A detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism using Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate and reaction force analysis revealed three distinct chemical events for this reaction: formation of the C--N bond, breaking of the N--H bond, and formation of the O--H hydroxyl bond. Depending on the type of catalytic site, these events can occur within a single, concerted, albeit asynchronous, step, or can be isolated in a step-wise mechanism, with the lowest overall transition state energy observed at 1.3 kcal mol$^{-1}$. A key requirement for the low-energy mechanism is the presence of a pair of dangling OH bonds on the surface, found at 5\% of the potential catalytic sites on an ASW porous surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, progress in observational capabilities, combined with theoretical advancements, have transformed our comprehension of the physics and chemistry during planet formation. Despite these important steps forward, open questions persist on the chemical and physical evolution of solids in their journey from the collapsing molecular cores to disks and planetary bodies. This chapter is a repository of such burning questions. It has the ambition to identify the most promising avenues for future research based on current observational and modeling opportunities.

          Inferring IGM parameters from the redshifted 21-cm Power Spectrum using Artificial Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 The high redshift 21-cm signal promises to be a crucial probe of the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Understanding the connection between the observed 21-cm power spectrum and the physical quantities intricately associated with the IGM is crucial to fully understand the evolution of our Universe. In this study, we develop an emulator using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the 21-cm power spectrum from a given set of IGM properties, namely, the bubble size distribution and the volume averaged ionization fraction. This emulator is implemented within a standard Bayesian framework to constrain the IGM parameters from a given 21-cm power spectrum. We compare the performance of the Bayesian method to an alternate method using ANN to predict the IGM parameters from a given input power spectrum, and find that both methods yield similar levels of accuracy, while the ANN is significantly faster. We also use this ANN method of parameter estimation to predict the IGM parameters from a test set contaminated with noise levels expected from the SKA-LOW instrument after 1000 hours of observation. Finally, we train a separate ANN to predict the source parameters from the IGM parameters directly, at a redshift of $z=9.1$, demonstrating the possibility of a non-analytic inference of the source parameters from the IGM parameters for the first time. We achieve high accuracies, with R2-scores ranging between $0.898-0.978$ for the ANN emulator and between $0.966-0.986$ and $0.817-0.981$ for the predictions of IGM parameters from 21-cm power spectrum and source parameters from IGM parameters, respectively. The predictions of the IGM parameters from the Bayesian method incorporating the ANN emulator leads to tight constraints with error bars around $\pm{0.14}$ on the IGM parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes in recent years offering valuable insights into cosmic expansion. These predominantly extragalactic transients encode information on the expansion of the Universe through their dispersion measure, reflecting interactions with the intervening medium along the line of sight. In this study, we introduce a novel method for reconstructing the late-time cosmic expansion rate and estimating the Hubble constant, solely derived from FRBs measurements coupled with their redshift information while employing Artificial Neural Networks. Our approach yields a Hubble constant estimate of $H_0 = 67.3\pm6.6\rm \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$. With a dataset comprising 23 localised data points, we demonstrate a precision of $\sim10\%$. However, our forecasts using simulated datasets indicate that in the future it could be possible to achieve precision comparable to the SH0ES collaboration or the Planck satellite. Our findings underscore the potential of FRBs as alternative, independent tools for probing cosmic dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Long wavelength infrared (8-13 $\mu$m) spectroscopy is invaluable for detecting molecular features in the atmospheres of gas giant and terrestrial exoplanets. The nulling-optimized mid-infrared camera (NOMIC) on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) has a low resolution (R$\sim$200) germanium grism that was previously installed but has not been characterized and commissioned for scientific observations. Using a 1.27 mm slit and broadband filter in combination with the grism, the infrared window between 8-13 $\mu$m can be captured. We describe initial on sky testing of the LBTI/NOMIC grism mode with adaptive optics to study standard stars and binaries. We discuss the impact of observational strategy and telluric calibration on the spectral reduction process. We infer the impact of existing mid-infrared detectors on NOMIC's spectroscopic mode and discuss requirements to enable higher resolution 8-13 $\mu$m spectroscopy on current and future facilities.

          Quasi-periodic oscillations of flare loops and slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C-class flare

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic oscillations in solar flaring emission have been observed over the past few decades. To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the quasi-periodic oscillations remain unknown. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits both the long-duration quasi-periodic intensity oscillations of flare loops and the quasi-periodic slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C9.1-class flare (SOL2015-03-15-T01:15), using the observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The high-temperature flare loops rooted in the straight part of ribbons display a "bright-dim" intensity oscillation, with a period of about 4.5 minutes. The oscillation starts just after the flare onset and lasts over 3 hours. Meanwhile, the substructures within the ribbon tip display the quasi-periodic slipping motion along the ribbon at 1400 Åimages which has a similar periodicity to the stationary intensity oscillation of the flare loops in the straight part of the flare ribbons. We suggest that the quasi-periodic pattern is probably related to the loop-top dynamics caused by the reconnection outflow impinging on the flare loops.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.

 - **Abstract**
 We report an observation of ultra-high energy (UHE) gamma rays from the Galactic Center region, using seven years of data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. The HAWC data are best described as a point-like source (HAWC J1746-2856) with a power-law spectrum ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}E=\phi(E/26 \,\text{TeV})^{\gamma}$), where $\gamma=-2.88 \pm 0.15_{\text{stat}} - 0.1_{\text{sys}} $ and $\phi=1.5 \times 10^{-15}$ (TeV cm$^{2}$s)$^{-1}$ $\pm\, 0.3_{\text{stat}}\,^{+0.08_{\text{sys}}}_{-0.13_{\text{sys}}}$ extending from 6 to 114 TeV. We find no evidence of a spectral cutoff up to $100$ TeV using HAWC data. Two known point-like gamma-ray sources are spatially coincident with the HAWC gamma-ray excess: Sgr A$^{*}$ (HESS J1745-290) and the Arc (HESS J1746-285). We subtract the known flux contribution of these point sources from the measured flux of HAWC J1746-2856 to exclude their contamination and show that the excess observed by HAWC remains significant ($>$5$\sigma$) with the spectrum extending to $>$100 TeV. Our result supports that these detected UHE gamma rays can originate via hadronic interaction of PeV cosmic-ray protons with the dense ambient gas and confirms the presence of a proton PeVatron at the Galactic Center.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a sample of K giant from Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release 8 and a sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3, we investigate the compositions of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and Virgo Over-density (VOD) and their collective contribution to the tilt and triaxiality of the stellar halo ($r\,\textless\,40\,{\rm kpc}$) as well as two breaks at $\approx15\,{\rm kpc}$ and 30\,kpc. We apply the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to divide the stellar halo into the isotropic component and the radially biased anisotropic component, namely Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), and find that both HAC and VOD are dominated by the GSE debris stars with weights of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and $0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, respectively. In addition, using the K giants with orbital parameters, we identify the member stars of known substructures, including GSE, Sagittarius (Sgr), Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Thamnos, Pontus, Wukong, and Metal-weak Thick Disk (MWTD), to probe the compositions of low-eccentricity stars in the HAC and VOD regions. In density fittings of the RRL sample, we note that the absence of HAC and VOD has a weak effect on the shape of halo. Finally, we find that the radially biased anisotropic halo contributes majorly to the stellar halo that can be modelled with a tilted triaxial ellipsoid and a doubly broken power law with breaking radii at $18.08^{+2.04}_{-3.22}\,{\rm kpc}$ and $33.03^{+1.30}_{-1.21}\,{\rm kpc}$. This has important significance for understanding the status of large diffuse over-densities in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIb supernovae are important subclass of stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe), which show H lines only at early times. Their progenitors are believed to contain a low-mass H envelope before explosion. This work reports the discovery of a progenitor candidate in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images for the Type IIb SN~2017gkk. With detailed analysis of its spectral energy distribution and local environment, we suggest that the progenitor is most likely a yellow supergiant with significant circumstellar extinction and has an initial mass of about 16 $M_\odot$, effective temperature log($T_{\rm eff}/K)=3.72\pm0.08$ and luminosity log($L/L_{\odot})=5.17\pm0.04$. This progenitor is not massive enough to strip envelope through stellar wind, and it supports an interacting binary progenitor channel and adds to the growing list of direct progenitor detections for Type~IIb SNe. Future late-time observations will confirm whether this progenitor candidate has disappeared and reveal the putative binary companion that has survived the explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We give here new O-C diagrams of the two classical Cepheids RY Cas and V Lac, established on a large basis of times of maximum of light, which covers more than a century. These two Cepheids present a variation of their period for which it is possible to calculate an annual rate. This rate equals +1.86 s/yr for RY Cas and -0.81 s/yr for V Lac. Based on these two new O-C diagrams neither of them seems to show any association to a binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent convection models treat stellar convection more physically than standard mixing-length theory by including non-local effects. We recently successfully applied the Kuhfuss version to convective cores in main sequence stars. Its usefulness for convective envelopes remains to be tested. The solar convective envelope constitutes a viable test bed for investigating the usefulness of the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model. We used the one-dimensional stellar evolution code GARSTEC to calculate a standard solar model with the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model, and compared it to helioseismic measurements and a solar model using standard mixing-length theory. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the additional free parameters of the convection model on the solar structure. The 1-equation Kuhfuss model reproduces the sound-speed profile and the lower boundary of the convective region less well than the mixing-length model, because the inherent non-local effects overestimate the amount of convective penetration below the Schwarzschild boundary. We trace this back to the coupling of the temperature gradient to the convective flux in the 1-equation version of the Kuhfuss theory. The temperature stratification of the solar convective envelope is not well modelled by the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model, and the more complex 3-equation version is needed to improve the modelling of convection in the envelopes of 1D stellar evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has announced the detection of almost 100 binary black holes so far, which have been used in several studies to infer the features of the underlying binary black hole population. From these, it is possible to predict the overall gravitational-wave (GW) fractional energy density contributed by black holes throughout the Universe, and thus estimate the gravitational-wave background (GWB) spectrum emitted in the current GW detector band. These predictions are fundamental in our forecasts for background detection and characterization, with both present and future instruments. The uncertainties in the inferred population strongly impact the predicted energy spectrum, and in this paper we present a new, flexible method to quickly calculate the energy spectrum for varying black hole population features such as the mass spectrum and redshift distribution. We implement this method in an open-access package, popstock, and extensively test its capabilities. Using popstock, we investigate how uncertainties in these distributions impact our detection capabilities and present several caveats for background estimation. In particular, we find that the standard assumption that the background signal follows a 2/3 power-law at low frequencies is both waveform and mass-model dependent, and that the signal power-law is likely shallower than previously modelled, given the current waveform and population knowledge.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most powerful explosive events in the universe. LHAASO recently observed the most luminous one: GRB 221009A, and unveiled its TeV light curve. The light curve exhibits a distinct jet break at around 670 seconds, enabling the derivation of the viewing angle based on the smoothness of the jet break. We constructed two models with or without considering the high-latitude radiation, where the viewing angle was treated as a free parameter, to fit the TeV light curve. We obtained the viewing angles being 9.4 $\times 10^{-4}$ radians and 5.9 $\times 10^{-3}$ radians, respectively. These values closely resemble an on-axis scenario, given the opening angle is 1.4 $\times 10^{-2}$ radians.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate two widely recognized Interacting Dark Energy(IDE) models and assess their compatibility with observational data, focusing on the growth rate of matter perturbations. We explore IDE models with different equations of state(EoS) parameters for Dark Energy (DE), including the CPL parameterization and a constant value for $w_{\mathrm{de}}$. To constrain the parameters of the IDE models using background data, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) analysis. Our results show that both IDE-I and IDE-II models are Compatible with observational data, although with slight variations influenced by the homogeneity or clustering of DE. Following that, we investigate the growth of matter perturbations and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis utilizing both the background and growth rate data. The growth rate in IDE models exhibits deviations compared to the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ model due to the impact of homogeneity or clustering of DE, as well as the selection of the EoS parameter. However, we find that the IDE models show good compatibility with the growth rate data. Furthermore, we explore how the clustering or homogeneity of DE and the selection of the EoS parameter affect the evolution of the relative difference in the growth rate of IDE models, $\Delta f$, in comparison to the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ model. Lastly, we employ the AIC and BIC criteria to evaluate and identify the best model that is compatible with the observational data. The selection of the model depends on the homogeneity or clustering of DE, the EoS parameter, and the dataset used. Overall, the IDE-I and IDE-II models exhibit agreement with the data, with slight deviations depending on specific scenarios and parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that binaries with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy transfers are advantageous for lunar exploration missions due to low fuel consumption and extended launch periods. This paper is devoted to the classification of interior transit orbits and their application on low-energy transfer in the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body problem (PBCR4BP). First, the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are introduced to generate the interior transit orbits. The number of periapses about the Moon is selected as the classification parameter and mapped into the LCSs, achieving clear classification boundaries. Then, the evolution laws of the classifications with respect to energy and solar gravity perturbation are discussed and summarized. Construction strategies for low-energy transfer are proposed based on the classifications and their evolution laws. Numerical simulation of the transfer trajectories verifies the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. The dynamical behaviors and transfer characteristics of transit orbits and their families are revealed, and a direct link between transit orbit families and low-energy transfers is finally established.

 - **Abstract**
 Voids are dominant features of the cosmic web. We revisit the cosmological information content of voids and connect void properties with the parameters of the background universe. We combine analytical results with a suite of large n-body realizations of large-scale structure in the quasilinear regime to measure the central density and radial outflow of voids. These properties, estimated from multiple voids that span a range of redshifts, provide estimates of the Hubble parameter, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. The analysis assumes access to the full phase-space distribution of mass within voids, a dataset that is not currently observable. The observable properties of the largest void in the universe may also test models. The suite of large n-body realizations enables construction of lightcones reaching $\sim$3,000 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Based on these lightcones, we show that large voids similar to those observed are expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO shift parameter from cosmological simulations. In particular, we generate a suite of $1000$ accurate effective field-level bias based Ly$\alpha$ forest simulations of volume $V=(1 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm Gpc})^3$ at $z=2$, both in real and redshift space, calibrated upon two fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. To measure the BAO, we stack the three-dimensional power spectra of the $1000$ different realizations, compute the average, and use a model accounting for a proper smooth-peak component decomposition of the power spectrum, to fit it via an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme estimating the covariance matrices directly from the simulations. We report the BAO shift parameters to be $\alpha=0.997^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ and $\alpha=0.990^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$ in real and redshift space, respectively. We also measure the bias $b_{\rm lya}$ and the BAO broadening parameter $\Sigma_{\rm nl}$, finding $b_{\rm lya}=-0.1786^{+0.0001}_{-0.0001}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=3.87^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$ in real space, and $b_{\rm lya}=-0.073^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=6.55^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$ in redshift space. Moreover, we measure the linear Kaiser factor $\beta_{\rm lya}=0.68^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$ from the isotropic redshift space fit. Overall, we find evidence for a negative shift of the BAO peak at the $\sim 3\sigma$ and $\sim 3.3\sigma$ level in real and redshift space, respectively. This result is qualitatively in agreement with measurements from other cosmological tracers in underdense regions, such as the cosmic void distribution. This work sets new important theoretical constraints, in the light of ongoing and upcoming Ly$\alpha$ forest spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, PFS, and WEAVE-QSO.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past two decades, photonics have been developed as technological solutions for astronomical instrumentation for, e.g., near-infrared spectroscopy and long baseline interferometry. With increasing instrument capabilities, large quantities of high precision optical components are required to guide, manipulate, and analyze the light from astronomical sources. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and fiber-based devices offer enormous potential for astronomical instrumentation, as they can reduce the amount of bulky free-space optics and pave the way for innovative solutions. Astrophotonic devices are particularly interesting for interferometry due to their compact design on the centimeter scale, even for a large number of telescope inputs. Already, astrophotonic components are integrated in high-end instruments at the VLTI and at the CHARA Array. Photonic beam combiners at wavelengths from visible to mid-infrared have been fabricated using lithographic techniques or ultrafast-laser inscription, with several components tested on-sky. This paper will provide a glimpse into the growing field of astrophotonics, its current status and potential for new technologies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of diffuse ultraviolet emission in the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II obtained with the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. With a spatial resolution of 1.2 to 1.6 arcsec, these are the highest resolution UV observations of the galaxy to date. We find that diffuse emission accounts for 70.6 % (58.1 %) of the total FUV(NUV) emission, respectively. We perform a UV-IR correlation study of the diffuse emission in this galaxy using infrared observations from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory for selected locations, free of detectable bright point sources. The strongest positive correlation between FUV and IR is observed at 70 micron for high HI density locations, indicating that warm dust grains dominate the IR emission, in agreement with earlier studies, while NUV is better correlated with 160 micron emission associated with cold dust grains. Low HI density regions or cavities, do not show any significant UV-IR correlation except at 160 micron, implying either the presence of colder dust grains in cavities, being irradiated by the general radiation field, or insufficient amount of dust. The dust scattering contribution in high HI density regions, estimated using a single scattering model with foreground dust clouds with LMC reddening, gives best-fit albedo and asymmetry factor values of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions for LMC dust. Our model derived scattering optical depths in the FUV range from 0.02 to 0.12, implying the medium is optically thin. Therefore, in high HI density regions, dust scattering can be one the sources of the observed diffuse UV emission, apart from possible contributions from molecular hydrogen fluorescence, However, the diffuse UV component in HI cavities can only be explained via other mechanisms, such as two photon emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We study penetration of interstellar cosmic rays (CRs) into molecular clouds surrounded by nonuniform diffuse envelopes. The present work generalizes our earlier model of CR self-modulation (Ivlev et al. 2018, Dogiel et al. 2018), in which the value for the envelope's gas density where CRs excite MHD waves was treated as a free parameter. Now, we investigate the case where the density monotonically increases toward the center. Assuming that CRs are relativistic, we obtain a universal analytical solution which does not depend on the particular shape of gas distribution in the envelope, and self-consistently derive boundaries of the diffusion zone formed within the envelope, where CRs are scattered at the self-excited waves. The values of the gas density at the boundaries are found to be substantially smaller than those assumed in the earlier model, which leads to a significantly stronger modulation of penetrating CRs. We compute the impact of CR self-modulation on the gamma-ray emission, and show that the results of our theoretical model are in excellent agreement with recent observations of nearby giant molecular clouds by Yang et al. (2023).

 - **Abstract**
 Lambda- Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) has been successful at explaining the large-scale structures in the universe but faces severe issues on smaller scales when compared to observations. Introducing self-interactions between dark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in the LambdaCDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large scales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions between dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity bound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium. In this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a single parameter, the inverse scattering length gamma. In this work, we set bounds on gamma by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at direct detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The exclusion limits on gamma are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits on the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from astrophysics and N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN 1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN 1a are and possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength study on three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi stellar objects (QSOs) selected based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties in publicly available surveys and then identified with dedicated spectroscopic observations. These are among the radio-brightest QSOs currently known at $z>5.5$, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}>100$. In this work we present their identification and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on the detection in public surveys as well as dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties, in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in order to accurately characterise these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source, at $z=5.61$, that presents clear blazars properties (strong and flat radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model, as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and the accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.2$. With this work we increase the number of very-high redshift radio-powerful QSOs characterised with multi-wavelength observations, essential in order to understand the evolution and the properties of this still poorly constrained class of sources.

 - **Abstract**
 H II regions are the signposts of massive ($M\geq\,8\,M_\odot$) star-forming sites in our Galaxy. It has been observed that the ionizing photon rate inferred from the radio continuum emission of H II regions is significantly lower ($\sim$ 90%) than that inferred from far-infrared fluxes measured by IRAS. This discrepancy in the ionizing photon rates may arise due to there being significant amounts of dust within the H II regions or the presence of extended emission that is undetected by high-resolution radio interferometric observations. Here, we study a sample of eight compact and ultracompact H II regions with extended emission to explore its role in resolving the discrepancy. We have used observations at the uGMRT (1.25-1.45 GHz) and data from the GLOSTAR survey (4-8 GHz) to estimate the ionizing photon rate from the radio continuum emission. We have also estimated the ionizing photon rate from the infrared luminosity by fitting a spectral energy distribution function to the infrared data from the GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, and Hi-GAL surveys. The excellent sensitivity of the radio observations to extended emission allows us to investigate the actual fraction of ionizing photons that are absorbed by dust in compact and ultracompact H II regions. Barring one source, we find a direct association between the radio continuum emission from the compact and diffuse components of the H II region. Our study shows that the ionizing photon rates estimated using the radio and infrared data are within reasonable agreement (5-28%) if we include the extended emission. We also find multiple candidate ionizing stars in all our sources, and the ionizing photon rates from the radio observations and candidate stars are in reasonable agreement.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, automated stellar parameter determination has become commonplace. Nevertheless, spectral classification still offers a quick and useful alternative for obtaining parameter estimates for large samples of spectra of varying quality. We present a new atlas of stellar spectra covering the B-type range, with the intention of providing detailed classification criteria valid for modern spectra and improving the grid of reliable standards. This new grid will be used in future works to provide classification criteria beyond the classical classification range and addressing, in particular, the use of Gaia/RVS spectra. We analysed historical standards by means of multiple high-resolution spectra, marking out problematic cases and complementing the grid with a new set of reliable comparators. We then elaborated on a new set of classification criteria based on high-quality R=4000 spectra. Our new classification grid is much thicker than any previous set of standards, presenting a high degree of self-consistency. Although it is based entirely on morphological criteria, the grid demonstrates a much better correlation with different physical parameters. The new grid can be used to study classification criteria in other spectral ranges, providing a valuable tool for the study of B-type stars that covers a very wide range of temperatures, luminosities, and stellar masses. The very process of classification also offers valuable insights into stellar evolution.

 This paper provides an update on the coronal mass ejection (CME) catalog maintained at the CDAW Data Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (this https URL). This is version 2 (v2) of the Catalog that has been made as the default version as of May 1, 2024. The new features of the Catalog v2 are (i) online measurement tool, (ii) combination JavaScript movies from the STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions, and (iii) insertion of newly identified CMEs for the period 1996 to 2004. The CME identification was revisited resulting in a set of $\sim$3000 new CMEs added to the Catalog. A vast majority of these CMEs are weak and narrow. The resulting statistical properties of CMEs are not significantly different from those reported using version 1.

 The Asgard instrument suite proposed for the ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) brings with it a new generation of instruments for spectroscopy and nulling. Asgard will enable investigations such as measurement of direct stellar masses for Galactic archaeology and direct detection of giant exoplanets to probe formation models using the first nulling interferometer in the southern hemisphere. We present the design and implementation of the Astralis-built Heimdallr, the beam combiner for fringe tracking and stellar interferometry in K band, as well as Solarstein, a novel implementation of a 4-beam telescope simulator for alignment and calibration. In this update, we verify that the Heimdallr design is sufficient to perform diffraction-limited beam combination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Solarstein presents an interface comparable to the VLTI with co-phased, equal intensity beams, enabling alignment and calibration for all Asgard instruments. In doing so, we share techniques for aligning and implementing large instruments in bulk optics.

 We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy-flux spectra and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma. In particular, we (i) construct the associated mathematical formulation, (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether the observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii) provide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical input plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case-study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for a SEP event observed on April 17, 2021, by the PSP/ISOIS instrument suite onboard PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of $\sim 1$ MeV and $ \sim 5 \cdot 10^{-7} $ cm$^{-3}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) The third data release of Gaia, has provided stellar parameters, metallicity [M/H], [{\alpha}/Fe], individual abundances, broadening parameter from its RVS spectra for about 5.6 million objects thanks to the GSP-Spec module. The catalogue publishes the radial velocity of 33 million sources. We took advantage of the intersections between Gaia RVS and Gaia-ESO to compare their stellar parameters, abundances and radial and rotational velocities. We aimed at verifying the overall agreement between the two datasets, considering the various calibrations and the quality-control flag system suggested for the Gaia GSP-Spec parameters. For the targets in common between Gaia RVS and Gaia-ESO, we performed several statistical checks on the distributions of their stellar parameters, abundances and velocities of targets in common. For the Gaia surface gravity and metallicity we considered both the uncalibrated and calibrated values. We find an excellent agreement between the Gaia and Gaia-ESO radial velocities given the uncertainties affecting each dataset. Less than 25 of ~2100 Gaia-ESO spectroscopic binaries are flagged as non-single stars by Gaia. The temperature scales are in good agreement. The calibrated GSP-Spec gravity should be preferred. We note that the quality (accuracy, precision) of the GSP-Spec parameters degrades quickly for objects fainter than G~11. We find that the somewhat imprecise GSP-Spec abundances due to its medium-resolution spectroscopy over a short wavelength window and the faint G regime of the sample under study can be counterbalanced by working with averaged quantities. We studied some properties of the open-cluster population: our combined sample traces very well the radial [Fe/H] and [Ca/Fe] gradients, the age-metallicity relations in different radial regions, and it places the clusters in the thin disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate deviations from the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model in the late universe ($z \lesssim 2.5$) using the Gaussian Processes method, with minimal assumptions. Our goal is to understand where exploring new physics in the late universe is most relevant. We analyze recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SN), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. By examining reconstructions of the dimensionless parameter $\delta(z)$, which measures deviations of the Hubble parameter from the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM predictions, we identify intriguing features at low ($z \lesssim 0.5$) and high ($z \gtrsim 2$) redshifts. Deviations from the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model were not significant between $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim2$. Using the combined CC+SN+BAO dataset, we gain insights into dark energy (DE) dynamics, resembling characteristics of omnipotent DE, extending beyond quintessence and phantom models. DE exhibits n-quintessence traits for $z\gtrsim2$, transitioning with a singularity around $z\sim2$ to usual phantom traits in $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$. DE characteristics differ between scenarios ($H_0$-SH0ES and $H_0$-$\Lambda$\&CMB), with $H_0$-SH0ES leaning towards phantom traits and $H_0$-$\Lambda$\&CMB towards quintessence. We suggest exploring new physics at $z\lesssim0.5$ and $1.5\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, particularly around $z = 2$, to understand cosmological tensions such as $H_0$ and $S_8$.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. We find that critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9\% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 = 10$--20~au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$~Myr~pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.

          Limitations and rotation of the two-armed phase spiral in the Milky Way stellar disc

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The Milky Way's history of recent disturbances is vividly demonstrated by a structure in the vertical phase-space distribution known as the Gaia phase spiral. A one-armed phase spiral has been seen widely across the Milky Way disc, while a two-armed one has only been observed in the solar neighbourhood. Aims: This study aims to determine the properties of the two-armed phase spiral and to put it in a Galactic context, with the ultimate goal of understanding the structure and history of the Milky Way disc. Methods: The Gaia DR3 data is used to trace and characterise the two-armed phase spiral. Special focus is put on the phase spiral's spatial distribution, rotational behaviour, and chemical characteristics. To quantify the properties of the phase spiral we use a model that fits a spiral pattern to the phase space distribution of the stars. Results: We find that the two-armed phase spiral is detectable only within a narrow range of galactocentric distances and angular momenta in the solar neighbourhood, $R = 8 \pm 0.5 $ kpc, $L_Z = 1450 \pm 50$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. Outside this region, the phase spiral is one-armed. The two-armed phase spiral rotates with the phase angle, like the one-armed phase spiral, and changes axis ratio with phase angle. Additionally, stars within the phase-space overdensity caused by the two-armed phase spiral pattern have slightly higher mean metallicity than stars in the underdense regions of the pattern at equivalent galactocentric distances, angular momenta, and vertical orbit extents. Conclusions: The two-armed phase spiral rotates with phase angle and its effect can be seen in metallicity, like the one-armed phase spiral. However, the limited range over which it can be found, and its variation in shape are quite different from the one-armed version, suggesting it is a much more localised phenomenon in the Galactic disc.

          2D BAO vs 3D BAO: solving the Hubble tension with alternative cosmological models

 - **Abstract**
 Ordinary 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data are model-dependent, requiring the assumption of a cosmological model to calculate comoving distances during data reduction. Throughout the present-day literature, the assumed model is $\Lambda$CDM. However, this assumption can be inadequate when analyzing alternative cosmologies, potentially biasing the Hubble constant ($H_0$) low, thus contributing to the Hubble tension. To address this issue, we use model-independent 2D BAO data and compare the results to those obtained using 3D BAO data. As a concrete example, we investigate the cosmological models provided by bimetric gravity, a modified theory of gravity that transitions from a negative cosmological constant in the early universe to a positive one in the late universe. By combining 2D BAO data with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernovae data, we find that the inverse distance ladder in this theory yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = (71.0 \pm 0.9) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, consistent with the SH0ES local distance ladder measurement of $H_0 = (73.0 \pm 1.0) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Replacing 2D BAO with 3D BAO results in $H_0 = (68.6 \pm 0.5) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the inverse distance ladder. We conclude that the choice of BAO data significantly impacts the Hubble tension, with ordinary 3D BAO data exacerbating the tension, while 2D BAO data provides results consistent with the local distance ladder.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4--4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the $Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\nu$ and its derivative $\dot{\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\dot{\nu} = -7.3(1.2)\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm Hz\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power $\dot{E}=2.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\dot{E}$ in general.

 - **Abstract**
 Various scenarios of cosmic inflation enhance the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at frequencies detectable by the LISA detector. We develop tools for a template-based analysis of the SGWB and introduce a template databank to describe well-motivated signals from inflation, prototype their template-based searches, and forecast their reconstruction with LISA. Specifically, we classify seven templates based on their signal frequency shape, and we identify representative fundamental physics models leading to them. By running a template-based analysis, we forecast the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the template parameters of representative benchmark signals, with and without galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We identify the parameter regions that can be probed by LISA within each template. Finally, we investigate how our signal reconstructions shed light on fundamental physics models of inflation: we discuss their impact for measurements of \emph{e.g.,} ~the couplings of inflationary axions to gauge fields; the graviton mass during inflation; the fluctuation seeds of primordial black holes; the consequences of excited states during inflation, and the presence of small-scale spectral features.

          Impact of LRG1 and LRG2 in DESI 2024 BAO data on dark energy evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggest a preference for a dynamic dark energy model over a cosmological constant. This conclusion emerges from the combination of DESI's BAO data with observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and various type Ia supernova (SN Ia) catalogues. The deviation observed in the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) reflects a departure from the standard cosmological model. Testing this deviation involves examining the consistency between cosmological parameters derived from early and late-time observations. Specifically, we focus on the matter density parameter $\omega_m = \Omega_mh^2$ and introduce ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$ to assess consistency, which is defined as the ratio of $\omega_m$ values constrained by high and low-redshift measurements. This ratio serves as a metric for quantifying deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we find that the DESI BAO+CMB yields ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)=1.0171\pm0.0066$. Upon excluding the LRG1 and LRG2 data in DESI BAO, this ratio adjusts to ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)=1.0100\pm0.0082$. This shift, corresponding to a change from $2.6\sigma$ to $1.2\sigma$, indicates that the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model is predominantly driven by these two samples from the DESI BAO measurements. To substantiate this conclusion, we utilized two cosmological model-independent methods to reconstruct the cosmic expansion history. Both reconstructions of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ indicate that the evolving features of dark energy are determined by the combined LRG1 and LRG2 data. Therefore, different methods have reached the same conclusion, namely the importance of accurately measuring the BAO feature in LRG1 and LRG2 data.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological information is usually extracted from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest correlations using only either large-scale information interpreted through linear theory or using small-scale information interpreted by means of expensive hydrodynamical simulations. A complete cosmological interpretation of the 3D correlations at all measurable scales is challenged by the need of more realistic models including the complex growth of non-linear small scales that can only be studied within large hydrodynamical simulations. Past work were often limited by the trade off between the simulated cosmological volume and the resolution of the low-density intergalactic medium from which the Lyman-$\alpha$ signal originates. We conduct a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium, including one of the largest Lyman-$\alpha$ simulations ever performed in terms of volume (640 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$), alongside simulations in smaller volumes with resolutions up to 25 $h^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}$. We compare the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra predicted by those simulations to different non-linear models. The inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ bias and RSD parameters, $b_\alpha$ and $\beta_\alpha$ are in remarkable agreement with those measured in SDSS and DESI data. We find that, contrary to intuition, the convergence of large-scale modes of the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra, which determines $\beta_\alpha$, is primarily influenced by the resolution of the simulation box through mode coupling, rather than the box size itself. Finally, we study the BAO signal encoded in the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra. For the first time with a hydrodynamical simulation, we clearly detect the BAO signal, however we only marginally detect its damping, associated with the non-linear growth of the structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarfs (sdO/B) are the stripped helium cores of red giants formed by binary interactions. Close hot subdwarf binaries with massive white dwarf companions have been proposed as possible progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). If the supernova is triggered by stable mass transfer from the helium star, the companion should survive the explosion and should be accelerated to high velocities. The hypervelocity star US 708 is regarded as the prototype for such an ejected companion. To find more of those objects we conducted an extensive spectroscopic survey. Candidates for such fast stars have been selected from the spectroscopic database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and several ground-based proper motion surveys. Follow-up spectroscopy has been obtained with several 4m- to 10m-class telescopes. Combining the results from quantitative spectroscopic analyses with space-based astrometry from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) we determined the atmospheric and kinematic parameters of 53 fast hot subdwarf stars. None of these stars is unbound to the Galaxy, although some have Galactic restframe velocities close to the Galactic escape velocity. 21 stars are apparently single objects, which crossed the Galactic disc within their lifetimes in the sdO/B stage and could be regarded as potential candidates for the SN Ia ejection scenario. However, the properties of the full sample are more consistent with a pure old Galactic halo population. We therefore conclude that the fast sdO/B stars we found are likely to be extreme halo stars.

          Implications of the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections for the strength of solar cycle 25

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the relative strength of solar cycle (SC) 25 with respect to SCs 23 and 24 based on the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We make use of the halo CME database (this https URL) to compare the halo CME abundance during the first four years in each of SCs 23 to 25. The main result is that in several aspects such as the abundance, occurrence rate, source locations, and halo heights, halo CMEs are similar between SCs 24 and 25 but different from SC 23. This result follows from the fact that weaker cycles have low heliospheric total pressure, whose backreaction on CMEs allows them to expand more and hence enhancing the chance of becoming a halo. The solar cycle variation of halo CME properties is consistent with the precursor-based cycle prediction methods that indicate SC 25 is similar to or only slightly stronger than SC 24.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift blazars are the most powerful extragalactic astrophysical sources ever detected in the high-energy gamma-ray band. In this study, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of the high-redshift blazar B3 1343+451 based on 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2022 June 6 (MJD 54686-59733). We extract a seven-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1--500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of $>4.32\times10^{-7} \rm ph \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$. The highest seven day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches $(8.06\pm0.56)\times10^{-7} \rm erg \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}$ on MJD = 56,177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the $\gamma$-ray spectrum is better reproduced if we assume that the dissipation region of the jet, $R_{\rm diss}$, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford--Payne process.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares commonly have a hot onset precursor event" (HOPE), detectable from soft X-ray observations. Detecting this requires subtraction of pre-flare fluxes from the non-flaring Sun prior to the event, fitting an isothermal emission model to the flare excess fluxes by comparing the GOES passbands at 1-8 A and 0.5-4 A, and plotting the timewise evolution of the flare emission in a diagram of temperature \textit{vs} emission measure. The HOPE then appears as an initial "horizontal branch" in this diagram. It precedes the non-thermal impulsive phase of the flare and thus the flare peak in soft X-rays as well. We use this property to define a "flare anticipation index" (FAI), which can serve as an alert for observational programs aimed at solar flares based on near-real-time soft X-ray observations. This FAI gives lead times of a few minutes and produces very few false positive alerts even for flare brightenings too weak to merit NOAA classification.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and future experiments observing the cosmic microwave background require a detailed understanding of optical performance at cryogenic temperatures. Pre-deployment analysis of optics can be performed in custom-engineered cryogenic test beds, such as Mod-Cam, a first light camera for the CCAT project. This work presents studies of the mechanical and thermal performance of CryoSim, a model of a generic cylindrical 4-K cryostat cooled with a commercial pulse tube cryocooler that can be used to characterise optical components and full reimaging optical systems. CryoSim is extensively parametrised, allowing the joint analysis and optimisation of mechanical and thermal performance via finite element methods. Results from this model are validated against measured cooldown data of the Mod-Cam cryostat. Due to the extensive parametrisation of the model, significant modifications of the cryostat geometry may be implemented to be representative of any system the scientific community may desire, and validation of thermal and mechanical performance can be carried out rapidly.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce COBRA (Cosmology with Optimally factorized Bases of Radial Approximants), a novel framework for rapid computation of large-scale structure observables. COBRA separates scale dependence from cosmological parameters in the linear matter power spectrum while also minimising the number of necessary basis terms $N_b$, thus enabling direct and efficient computation of derived and nonlinear observables. Moreover, the dependence on cosmological parameters is efficiently approximated using radial basis function interpolation. We apply our framework to decompose the linear matter power spectrum in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario, as well as by adding curvature, dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos, covering all redshifts relevant for Stage IV surveys. With only a dozen basis terms $N_b$, COBRA reproduces exact Boltzmann solver calculations to $\sim 0.1\%$ precision, which improves further to $0.02\%$ in the pure $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Using our decomposition, we recast the one-loop redshift space galaxy power spectrum in a separable minimal-basis form, enabling $\sim 4000$ model evaluations per second at $0.02\%$ precision on a single thread. This constitutes a considerable improvement over previously existing methods (e.g., FFTLog) opening a window for efficient computations of higher loop and higher order correlators involving multiple powers of the linear matter power spectra. The resulting factorisation can also be utilised in clustering, weak lensing and CMB analyses. Our implementation will be made public upon publication.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling observations of the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic, obtained in 2023 January with the MIRI MRS on board JWST, reveals significant differences compared with that obtained with the IRS on board Spitzer. The bright 5 - 15 $\mu$m continuum excess modeled using a $\sim$600 K black body has disappeared. The previously prominent 18 and 23 $\mu$m crystalline forsterite emission features, arising from cold dust ($\sim$100 K) in the Rayleigh limit, have disappeared and been replaced by very weak features arising from the hotter 500 K dust population. Finally, the shape of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature has changed, consistent with a shift in the temperature of the warm dust population from $\sim$300 K to $\sim$500 K and an increase in the crystalline fraction of the warm, silicate dust. Stellar radiation pressure may have blown both the hot and the cold crystalline dust particles observed in the Spitzer spectra out of the planetary system during the intervening 20 years between the Spitzer and JWST observations. These results indicate that the $\beta$ Pic system has a dynamic circumstellar environment, and that periods of enhanced collisions can create large clouds of dust that sweep through the planetary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Co-orbital objects, also known as trojans, are frequently found in simulations of planetary system formation. In these configurations, a planet shares its orbit with other massive bodies. It is still unclear why there have not been any co-orbitals discovered thus far in exoplanetary systems or even pairs of planets found in such a 1:1 mean motion resonance. Reconciling observations and theory is an open subject in the field. The main objective of the TROY project is to conduct an exhaustive search for exotrojans using diverse observational techniques. In this work, we analyze the radial velocity time series informed by transits, focusing the search around low-mass stars. We employed the alpha-test method on confirmed planets searching for shifts between spectral and photometric mid-transit times. This technique is sensitive to mass imbalances within the planetary orbit, allowing us to identify non-negligible co-orbital masses. Among the 95 transiting planets examined, we find one robust exotrojan candidate with a significant 3-sigma detection. Additionally, 25 exoplanets show compatibility with the presence of exotrojan companions at a 1-sigma level, requiring further observations to better constrain their presence. For two of those weak candidates, we find dimmings in their light curves within the predicted Lagrangian region. We established upper limits on the co-orbital masses for either the candidates and null detections. Our analysis reveals that current high-resolution spectrographs effectively rule out co-orbitals more massive than Saturn around low-mass stars. This work points out to dozens of targets that have the potential to better constraint their exotrojan upper mass limit with dedicated radial velocity observations. We also explored the potential of observing the secondary eclipses of the confirmed exoplanets to enhance the exotrojan search.
