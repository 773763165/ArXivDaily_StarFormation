 - **Abstract**
 Tuning into the bass notes of the large-scale structure requires careful attention to geometrical effects arising from wide angles. The spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis provides a harmonic-space coordinate system that fully accounts for all wide-angle effects. To demonstrate the feasibility of the SFB power spectrum, in this paper we validate our SFB pipeline by applying it to lognormal, and both complete and realistic EZmock simulations that were generated for eBOSS DR16 LRG sample. We include redshift space distortions and the local average effect (aka integral constraint). The covariance matrix is obtained from 1000 EZmock simulations, and inverted using eigenvalue decomposition.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present two examples of recent investigations that we have undertaken, applying Machine Learning (ML) neural networks (NN) to image datasets from outer planet missions to achieve feature recognition. Our first investigation was to recognize ice blocks (also known as rafts, plates, polygons) in the chaos regions of fractured ice on Europa. We used a transfer learning approach, adding and training new layers to an industry-standard Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) to recognize labeled blocks in a training dataset. Subsequently, the updated model was tested against a new dataset, achieving 68% precision. In a different application, we applied the Mask R-CNN to recognize clouds on Titan, again through updated training followed by testing against new data, with a precision of 95% over 369 images. We evaluate the relative successes of our techniques and suggest how training and recognition could be further improved. The new approaches we have used for planetary datasets can further be applied to similar recognition tasks on other planets, including Earth. For imagery of outer planets in particular, the technique holds the possibility of greatly reducing the volume of returned data, via onboard identification of the most interesting image subsets, or by returning only differential data (images where changes have occurred) greatly enhancing the information content of the final data stream.
#### An infrared FWHM-$K_2$ correlation to uncover highly-reddened quiescent  black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Among the sample of Galactic transient X-ray binaries (SXTs) discovered to date, ~70 have been proposed as candidates to host a black hole. Yet, only 19 have been dynamically confirmed. Such a reliable confirmation requires phase-resolved spectroscopy of their companion stars, generally feasible when the system is in a quiescent state. However, since most of the SXT population lies in the Galactic Plane, strongly affected by interstellar extinction, their optical brightness during quiescence usually falls beyond the capabilities of the current instrumentation ($R\gtrsim22$). To overcome these limitations and, thus, increase the number of confirmed Galactic black holes, a correlation between the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\alpha$ line and the semi-amplitude of the donor's radial velocity curve ($K_2$) was presented in the past. Here, we extend the FWHM-$K_2$ correlation to the near-infrared (NIR), exploiting disc lines such as He I $\lambda$10830, Pa$\gamma$ and Br$\gamma$, in a sample of dynamically confirmed black-hole SXTs. We obtain $K_2 = 0.22(3) ~\textrm{FWHM}$, in good agreement with the optical correlation derived using H$\alpha$. The similarity of the two correlations seems to imply that the widths of H$\alpha$ and the NIR lines are consistent in quiescence. When combined with information on orbital periods, the NIR correlation will allow us to constrain the mass of the compact object of systems in quiescence by using single-epoch spectroscopy. We anticipate that this new correlation will give access to highly-reddened black-hole SXTs, which cannot be otherwise studied at optical wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of gaps or regions of small numbers of stars in the main sequence of the Hertzsprung Russell Diagram (HRD) of star clusters has been reported in literature. This is interesting and significant as it could be related to star formation and/or rapid evolution or instabilities. In this paper, using Gaia DR3 photometry and confirmed membership data, we explore the HRD of nine open clusters with reported gaps, identify them and assess their importance and spectral types.
#### Kepler Bonus: Light Curves of Kepler Background Sources

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's \textit{Kepler} primary mission observed about 116 $deg^2$ in the sky for 3.5 consecutive years to discover Earth-like exoplanets. This mission recorded pixel cutouts, known as Target Pixel Files (TPFs), of over $200,000$ targets selected to maximize the scientific yield. The Kepler pipeline performed aperture photometry for these primary targets to create light curves. However, hundreds of thousands of background sources were recorded in the TPFs and have never been systematically analyzed. This work uses the Linearized Field Deblending (LFD) method, a Point Spread Function (PSF) photometry algorithm, to extract light curves. We use Gaia DR3 as input catalog to extract $606,900$ light curves from long-cadence TPFs. $406,548$ are new light curves of background sources, while the rest are Kepler's targets. These light curves have comparable quality as those computed by the Kepler pipeline, with CDPP values $<100$ ppm for sources $G<16$. The light curve files are available as high-level science products at MAST. Files include PSF and aperture photometry, and extraction metrics. Additionally, we improve the background and PSF modeling in the LFD method. The LFD method is implemented in the \texttt{Python} library \texttt{psfmachine}. We demonstrate the advantages of this new dataset with two examples; deblending of contaminated false positive Kepler Object of Interest identifying the origin of the transit signal; and the changes in estimated transit depth of planets using PSF photometry which improves dilution when compared to aperture photometry. This new nearly unbiased catalog enables further studies in planet search, occurrence rates, and other time-domain studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheric dynamics of tidally-locked hot Jupiters is dominated by the equatorial winds. Understanding the interaction between global circulation and chemistry is crucial in atmospheric studies and interpreting observations. Two-dimensional (2D) photochemical transport models shed light on how the atmospheric composition depends on circulation. In this paper, we introduce the 2D photochemical transport model, VULCAN 2D, which improves on the pseudo-2D approaches by allowing for non-uniform zonal winds. We extensively validate our VULCAN 2D with analytical solutions and benchmark comparisons. Applications to HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b reveal distinct characteristics in horizontal transport-dominated and vertical mixing-dominated regimes. Motivated by the inferred carbon-rich atmosphere by Giacobbe et al. (2021), we find that HD 209458 b with super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) exhibits pronounced C2H4 absorption on the morning limb but not on the evening limb, owing to horizontal transport from the nightside. We discuss when a pseudo-2D approach is a valid assumption and its inherent limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of horizontal transport in transmission observations and its impact on the morning-evening limb asymmetry with synthetic spectra, highlighting the need to consider global transport when interpreting exoplanet atmospheres.
#### Formation of giant planets around intermediate-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 To understand giant planet formation, we need to focus on host stars close to $1.7\ \rm M_{\odot}$, where the occurrence rate of these planets is the highest. In this initial study, we carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling to investigate the trends and optimal conditions for the formation of giant planets around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planets are more likely to form in systems with a larger initial disk radius; higher disk gas accretion rate; pebbles of $\sim$ millimeter in size; and birth location of the embryo at a moderate radial distance of $\sim 10$ AU. We also conduct a population synthesis study of our model and find that the frequency of giant planets and super-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass. This contrasts the observational peak at $1.7\ \rm M_{\odot}$, stressing the need for strong assumptions on stellar mass dependencies in this range. Investigating the combined effect of stellar mass dependent disk masses, sizes, and lifetimes in the context of planet population synthesis studies is a promising avenue to alleviate this discrepancy. The hot-Jupiter occurrence rate in our models is $\sim 0.7{-}0.8\%$ around $1\ \rm M_{\odot}$ - similar to RV observations around Sun-like stars, but drastically decreases for higher mass stars.
#### SVR Algorithm as a Tool for More Optimal Intergalactic Medium Simulation  in the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 All kinds of simulations of the intergalactic medium, such as hydrodynamic simulation, N-body simulation, numerical and semi-numerical simulation, etc., have been used to realize the history of this medium. One of these simulations is 21SSD, which is specifically focused on the epoch of reionization. This simulation deepens our understanding of the physics behind the intergalactic medium by considering the free parameters related to the Wouthuysen-Field coupling fluctuations and X-ray and Lyman line transfers in the intergalactic medium, and by presenting the plots of the power spectrum, brightness temperature, etc. in different redshifts. However, due to many physical phenomena that play significant roles in this epoch, simulations of the intergalactic medium are usually extremely complex, time-consuming, and require very powerful hardware. In this work, by using the Support Vector Regression algorithm and based on the 21SSD simulation datasets, we have tried to make the machine fully understand the brightness temperature changes in terms of redshift for different astrophysical free parameters values. At first, we trained the machine with the results of the 21SSD simulation. Then, the machine was able to predict the brightness temperature in terms of redshift with very high accuracy for other interval coefficients. Although we have used this algorithm to estimate the brightness temperature, it seems that this algorithm can be easily used for other parts of cosmology and astrophysics. With its help, it is possible to save time and obtain results with extraordinary accuracy similar to complex simulations, even with normal hardware.
#### The Golden Meteorite Fall: Fireball Trajectory, Orbit and Meteorite  Characterization

 - **Abstract**
 The Golden (British Columbia, Canada) meteorite fall occurred on Oct 4, 2021 at 0534 UT with the first recovered fragment (1.3 kg) landing on an occupied bed. The meteorite is an unbrecciated, low-shock (S2) ordinary chondrite of intermediate composition, typed as an L/LL5. From noble gas measurements the cosmic ray exposure age is 25 Ma while gas retention ages are all >2 Ga. Short-lived radionuclides and noble gas measurements of the pre-atmospheric size overlap with estimates from infrasound and lightcurve modelling producing a preferred pre-atmospheric mass of 70-200 kg. The orbit of Golden has a high inclination (23.5 degs) and is consistent with delivery from the inner main belt. The highest probability (60%) of an origin is from the Hungaria group. We propose that Golden may originate among the background S-type asteroids found interspersed in the Hungaria region. The current collection of 18 L and LL chondrite orbits shows a strong preference for origins in the inner main belt, suggesting multiple parent bodies may be required to explain the diversity in CRE ages and shock states.
#### Full Shape Cosmology Analysis from BOSS in configuration space using  Neural Network Acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a new wave of full modeling analyses have emerged within the Large-Scale Structure community, leading mostly to tighter constraints on the estimation of cosmological parameters, when compared with standard approaches used over the last decade by collaboration analyses of stage III experiments. However, the majority of these full-shape analyses have primarily been conducted in Fourier space, with limited emphasis on exploring the configuration space. Investigating n-point correlations in configuration space demands a higher computational cost compared to Fourier space because it typically requires an additional integration step. This can pose a limitation when using these approaches, especially when considering higher-order statistics. One avenue to mitigate the high computation time is to take advantage of neural network acceleration techniques. In this work, we present a full shape analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III/BOSS in configuration space using a neural network accelerator. We show that the efficacy of the pipeline is enhanced by a time factor $10^{3}$ without sacrificing precision, making it possible to reduce the error associated with the surrogate modeling to below $10^{-2}$ percent which is compatible with the precision required for current stage IV experiments such as DESI. We find $\Omega_m=0.286\pm 0.009$, $H_0=68.8\pm 1.2$ $\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s^{-1}}\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$ and $A_s \times 10^9 =2.09 ^{+0.25}_{-0.29}$. Our results on public BOSS data are in good agreement with BOSS official results and compatible with other independent full modeling analyses. We explore relaxing the prior on $\omega_b$ and varying $n_s$, without significant changes in the mean values of the cosmological parameters posterior distributions, but enlarging their widths. Finally, we explore the information content of the multipoles when constraining cosmological parameters.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17860
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17860
 - **Abstract**
 We obtain the median, arithmetic mean, and the weighted mean-based central estimates for the distance to M87 using all the measurements collated in De Grijs et al (2020). We then reconstruct the error distribution for the residuals of the combined measurements and also splitting them based on the tracers used. We then checked for consistency with a Gaussian distribution and other symmetric distributions such as Cauchy, Laplacian, and Students-$t$ distributions. We find that when we analyze the combined data, the weighted mean-based estimates show a poor agreement with the Gaussian distribution, indicating that there are unaccounted systematic errors in some of the measurements. Therefore, the median-based estimate for the distance to M87 would be the most robust. This median-based distance modulus to M87 is given by $31.08 \pm 0.09$ mag and $31.07 \pm 0.09$ mag, with and without considering measurements categorized as "averages", respectively. This estimate agrees with the corresponding value obtained in DeGrijs et al (2020) to within $1\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 This study delves into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in the field of astronomy literature. To enhance the zero-shot recognition capabilities of LLMs for astronomical named entities, we propose a strategy called Prompt-NER. Prompt-NER includes five prompt elements: Task Descriptions, Entity Definitions, Task Emphasis, Task Examples, and Second Conversation. To assess the effectiveness of the Prompt-NER strategy, we utilize three representative LLMs (Claude-2, GPT-3.5, and LLaMA-2-70b) to identify telescope and celestial object named entities in astronomical literature. Our experiments are conducted based on two distinct datasets. The first dataset comprises 30 original PDF documents, which we split into paragraphs in sequential order, resulting in a second dataset consisting of 30 paragraph collections. Additionally, we incorporate 30 astronomical telegrams to diversify our experiments and assess the performance of LLMs based on Prompt-NER on concise, complete texts. Our experimental results indicate that the Prompt-NER strategy enables LLMs to effectively accomplish NER tasks in the field of astronomy, even without prior astronomical knowledge during training. We carefully analyze the experimental results, including the mechanism of different prompt elements and the influence of different features of long and short texts on their respective experimental results. This research provides experience for zero-shot NER tasks in astronomical literature and suggests future work in this area.
#### Constraining the growth rate on linear scales by combining SKAO and DESI  surveys

 - **Abstract**
 In the pursuit of understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe, the synergy between complementary cosmological surveys has proven to be a powerful tool. Using multiple tracers of the large-scale structure can significantly improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. We explore the potential of combining the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectroscopic surveys to enhance precision on the growth rate of cosmic structures. We employ a multitracer Fisher analysis to estimate precision on the growth rate when using pairs of mock surveys that are based on SKAO and DESI specifications. The pairs are at both low and high redshifts. For SKA-MID, we use the HI galaxy and the HI intensity mapping samples. In order to avoid the complexities and uncertainties at small scales, we confine the analysis to scales where linear perturbations are reliable. The consequent loss of signal in each individual survey is mitigated by the gains from the multi-tracer. After marginalising over cosmological and nuisance parameters, we find a significant improvement in the precision on the growth rate.
#### The role of turbulence in high-mass star formation: Subsonic and  transonic turbulence are ubiquitously found at early stages

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Traditionally, supersonic turbulence is considered to be one of the most likely mechanisms to slow down the gravitational collapse in dense clumps, thereby enabling the formation of massive stars. However, several recent studies have raised differing points of view based on observations carried out with sufficiently high spatial and spectral resolution. These studies call for a re-evaluation of the role turbulence plays in massive star-forming regions. Aims. Our aim is to study the gas properties, especially the turbulence, in a sample of massive star-forming regions with sufficient spatial and spectral resolution, which can both resolve the core fragmentation and the thermal line width. Methods. We observed NH3 metastable lines with the Very Large Array (VLA) to assess the intrinsic turbulence. Results. Analysis of the turbulence distribution histogram for 32 identified NH3 cores reveals the presence of three distinct components. Furthermore, our results suggest that (1) sub- and transonic turbulence is a prevalent (21 of 32) feature of massive star-forming regions and those cold regions are at early evolutionary stage. This investigation indicates that turbulence alone is insufficient to provide the necessary internal pressure required for massive star formation, necessitating further exploration of alternative candidates; and (2) studies of seven multi-core systems indicate that the cores within each system mainly share similar gas properties and masses. However, two of the systems are characterized by the presence of exceptionally cold and dense cores that are situated at the spatial center of each system. Our findings support the hub-filament model as an explanation for this observed distribution
#### Radio outburst from a massive (proto)star. II. A portrait in space and  time of the expanding radio jet from S255 NIRS3

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that the accretion process in star formation may occur through accretion outbursts. This phenomenon has also now been detected in a few young massive (proto)stars (>8 Msun). The recent outburst at radio wavelengths of the massive (proto)star S255 NIRS3 has been interpreted by us as expansion of a thermal jet, fed by the infalling material. To follow up on our previous study and confirm our interpretation, we monitored the source for more than 1 yr in six bands from 1.5 GHz to 45.5 GHz and, after ~1.5 yr, with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at two epochs, which made it possible to detect the proper motions of the jet lobes. The prediction of our previous study is confirmed by the new results. The radio jet is found to expand, while the flux, after an initial exponential increase, appears to stabilise and eventually decline. The radio flux measured during our monitoring is attributed to a single NE lobe, However, from 2019 a second lobe has been emerging to the SW, probably powered by the same accretion outburst, although with a delay of at least a couple of years. Flux densities at >6 GHz were satisfactorily fitted with a jet model, whereas those below 6 GHz are clearly underestimated by the model. This indicates that non-thermal emission becomes dominant at long wavelengths. Our results suggest that thermal jets can be a direct consequence of accretion events, when yearly flux variations are detected. The end of the accretion outburst is mirrored in the radio jet, as ~1 yr after the onset of the radio outburst, the inner radius of the jet began to increase while the jet mass stopped growing, as expected if the powering mechanism of the jet is quenched. Our findings support a tight connection between accretion and ejection in massive stars, consistent with a formation process involving a disk-jet system similar to that of low-mass stars.
#### LHAASO J2108+5157 as a Molecular Cloud Illuminated by a Supernova  Remnant

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18007
 - **Abstract**
 The search for Galactic PeVatrons - astrophysical accelerators of cosmic rays to PeV energies - has entered a new phase in recent years with the discovery of the first Ultra-High-Energy (UHE, $E>100$ TeV) gamma-ray sources by the HAWC and LHAASO experiments. Establishing whether the emission is leptonic or hadronic in nature, however, requires multiwavelength data and modelling studies. Among the currently known UHE sources, LHAASO J2108+5157 is an enigmatic source without clear association to a plausible accelerator, yet spatially coincident with molecular clouds. We investigate the scenario of a molecular cloud illuminated by cosmic rays accelerated in a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) as an explanation for LHAASO J2108+5157. We aim to constrain the required properties of the SNR as well as which of the clouds identified in the vicinity is the most likely association. We use a model for cosmic ray acceleration in SNRs, their transport through the interstellar medium and subsequent interaction with molecular material, to predict the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The parameter space of SNR properties is explored to find the most plausible parameter combination that can account for the gamma-ray spectrum of LHAASO J2108+5157. In the case that a SNR is illuminating the cloud, we find that it must be young ($<10$ kyr) and located within $40-60$ pc of the cloud. A SN scenario with a low Sedov time is preferred, with a maximum proton energy of 3 PeV assumed. No SNRs matching these properties are currently known, although an as yet undetected SNR remains feasible. The galactic CR sea is insufficient to solely account for the observed flux, such that a PeVatron accelerator must be present in the vicinity.
#### The impact of convective criteria on the properties of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 We study the differences between models computed with Ledoux and Schwarzschild criteria on the internal structure, evolutionary track in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), lifetimes, evolution of the surface abundances and velocities, and masses of the He and CO cores. We investigate the consequences on the nature of the supernova (SN) progenitors and the type of SN events, as well as on the yields of light elements. We also study the impact on the outputs of population synthesis models. Models with initial masses between 7 and 120 M$_\odot$ at solar metallicity ($Z$=0.014) and with an initial rotation equal to 0 or 0.4 times the critical velocity at the zero-age main sequence were computed with either the Schwarzschild or the Ledoux criterion until the end of the C-burning phase. Models with initial masses between 15 and 32 M$_\odot$ computed with the Schwarzschild criterion show larger intermediate convective zones attached to the H-burning shell than models computed with the Ledoux criterion. Their CO cores and outer convective zones in the red supergiant (RSG) phase are also smaller. This impacts many outputs of stars during the core He-burning phase. Schwarzschild models have smaller CO cores and outer convective zones in the RSG phase, and their blue-to-red supergiant ratio is much higher than for Ledoux models. They also produce longer crossings of the Hertzsprung gap and favour blue loops. The upper luminosity of RSGs is little affected by the change in the convective criterion. The maximum luminosity of RSG progenitors for type II-P SN events is lowered from 5.2 to 4.95 when the Ledoux criterion is used instead of the Schwarzschild criterion in non-rotating models. The Schwarzschild criterion predicts longer-lasting, less nitrogen-enriched, and faster-rotating Cepheids. Rotational mixing decreases the differences between Schwarzschild and Ledoux models.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the detectability of single-event coalescing black hole binaries with total mass of $100-600 M_{\odot}$ at cosmological distances ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 20$) with the next generation of terrestrial gravitational wave observatories, specifically Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Our ability to observe these binaries is limited by the low-frequency performance of the detectors. Higher-order Multipoles of the gravitational wave signal are observable in these systems, and detection of such multipoles serves to both b the mass range over which black hole binaries are observable and improve the recovery of their individual masses and redshift. For high redshift systems of $\sim 200 M_{\odot}$ we will be able to confidently infer that the redshift is at least $z=12$, and for systems of $\sim 400 M_{\odot}$ we can infer a minimum redshift of at least $z=8$. We discuss the impact that these observations will have in narrowing uncertainties on the existence of the pair-instability mass-gap, and their implications on the formation of the first stellar black holes that could be seeds for the growth of supermassive black holes powering high-$z$ quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 Future generation of astronomical imaging spectrometers are targeting the far infrared wavelengths to close the THz astronomy gap. Similar to lens antenna coupled Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), lens absorber coupled MKIDs are a candidate for highly sensitive large format detector arrays. However, the latter is more robust to misalignment and assembly issues at THz frequencies due to its incoherent detection mechanism while requiring a less complex fabrication process. In this work, the performance of such detectors is investigated. The fabrication and sensitivity measurement of several lens absorber coupled MKID array prototypes operating at 6.98 and 12 THz central frequencies is on-going.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the dynamics of globular clusters assume different values of bar parameters (mass, velocity, size) and analyse the results of orbit classifications over the range of the chosen values. It is also a usual thing that a spherical bulge component is converted into the bar to obtain a non-axisymmetric potential from an axisymmetric one. The choice of bar parameters and the way the bar is converted from the bulge introduce systematics into the orbit classifications that we explore in the present study. We integrate orbits of 30 bulge globular clusters residing in the inner area of the Galaxy ($R \lesssim 5$ kpc) backwards in time for three different potentials, two of which are obtained by fitting the rotation curve, and one is taken from the surrogate $N$-body model representing our Galaxy. We analyse each orbit in terms of dominant frequencies obtained from its coordinate spectra. We find that the bar pattern speed is a key factor in orbital classification. With an increase of it, frequencies deviate more and more from the "bar" frequency ratio 2:1. The mass and size of the bar play a smaller role. We also find that, in the $N$-body potential, the fraction of orbits that follow the bar is higher than in those obtained from fitting the rotation curve.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present the cloud population extracted from M51, following the application of our new high-resolution dust extinction technique to the galaxy (Faustino Vieira et al. 2023). With this technique, we are able to image the gas content of the entire disc of M51 down to 5 pc (0.14"), which allows us to perform a statistical characterisation of well-resolved molecular cloud properties across different large-scale dynamical environments and with galactocentric distance. We find that cloud growth is promoted in regions in the galaxy where shear is minimised; i.e. clouds can grow into higher masses (and surface densities) inside the spiral arms and molecular ring. We do not detect any enhancement of high-mass star formation towards regions favourable to cloud growth, indicating that massive and/or dense clouds are not the sole ingredient for high-mass star formation. We find that in the spiral arms there is a significant decline of cloud surface densities with increasing galactocentric radius, whilst in the inter-arm regions they remain relatively constant. We also find that the surface density distribution for spiral arm clouds has two distinct behaviours in the inner and outer galaxy, with average cloud surface densities at larger galactocentric radii becoming similar to inter-arm clouds. We propose that the tidal interaction between M51 and its companion (NGC 5195) - which heavily affects the nature of the spiral structure - might be the main factor behind this.
#### Effects of general relativity on habitable zone particles under the  presence of an inner perturber around solar-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the role of the general relativity (GR) on the nodal librations of test particles located at the Habitable Zone (HZ) around a solar-mass star, which evolve under the influence of an eccentric planetary-mass perturber with a semimajor axis of 0.1 au. Based on a secular Hamiltonian up to quadrupole level, we derive analytical criteria that define the nodal libration region of a HZ particle as a function of its eccentricity $e_2$ and inclination $i_2$, and the mass $m_1$ and the eccentricity $e_1$ of the perturber. We show that a HZ particle can experience nodal librations with orbital flips or purely retrograde orbits for any $m_1$ and $e_1$ by adopting a suitable combination of $e_2$ and $i_2$. For $m_1 <$ 0.84 M$_\textrm{Jup}$, the greater the $m_1$ value, the smaller the $e_2$ value above which nodal librations are possible for a given $e_1$. For $m_1 >$ 0.84 M$_{\textrm{Jup}}$, a HZ test particle can undergo nodal librations for any $e_2$ and appropriate values of $e_1$ and $i_2$. The same correlation between $m_1$ and $e_2$ is obtained for nodal librations with orbital flips, but a mass limit for $m_1$ of 1.68 M$_{\textrm{Jup}}$ is required in this case. Moreover, the more massive the inner perturber, the greater the nodal libration region associated with orbital flips in the ($e_1$, $i_2$) plane for a given value of $e_2$. Finally, we find good agreements between the analytical criteria and results from N-body simulations for values of $m_1$ ranging from Saturn-like planets to super-Jupiters.
