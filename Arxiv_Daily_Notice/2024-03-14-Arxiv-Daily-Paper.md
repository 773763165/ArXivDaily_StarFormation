 - **Abstract**
 Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6,061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 +/- 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 +/- 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 +/- 0.02 and 0.88 +/- 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3,558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light curve and stamp classifiers), but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82 +/- 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs with a F, G or K type companion represent the last common ancestor for a plethora of exotic systems throughout the galaxy, though to this point very few of them have been fully characterised in terms of orbital period and component masses, despite the fact several thousand have been identified. Gaia data release 3 has examined many hundreds of thousands of systems, and as such we can use this, in conjunction with our previous UV excess catalogues, to perform spectral energy distribution fitting in order to obtain a sample of 206 binaries likely to contain a white dwarf, complete with orbital periods, and either a direct measurement of the component masses for astrometric systems, or a lower limit on the component masses for spectroscopic systems. Of this sample of 206, four have previously been observed with Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopically in the ultraviolet, which has confirmed the presence of a white dwarf, and we find excellent agreement between the dynamical and spectroscopic masses of the white dwarfs in these systems. We find that white dwarf plus F, G or K binaries can have a wide range of orbital periods, from less than a day to many hundreds of days. A large number of our systems are likely post-stable mass transfer systems based on their mass/period relationships, while others are difficult to explain either via stable mass transfer or standard common envelope evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the MWISP survey at an angular resolution of about $50''$. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, shows that molecular gas in the $\rm 8^{\circ}\times4^{\circ}$ region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ data, a total of 263 $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures are identified in the whole region, and 88\% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of $\rm 729^{+45}_{-45}~pc$ for the GMC complex. The total mass of the GMC Complex traced by $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ are $1.1\times10^5~M_\odot$, $4.3\times10^4~M_\odot$, and $8.4\times10^3~M_\odot$, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4\%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3\%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (e.g., greater velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, and more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are a promising probe to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$) directly. To use LSNe Ia for cosmography, a time-delay measurement between the multiple images, a lens-mass model, and a mass reconstruction along the line of sight are required. In this work, we present the machine learning network LSTM-FCNN which is a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and a fully-connected neural network (FCNN). The LSTM-FCNN is designed to measure time delays on a sample of LSNe Ia spanning a broad range of properties, which we expect to find with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and for which follow-up observations are planned. With follow-up observations in $i$ band (cadence of one to three days with a single-epoch $5\sigma$ depth of 24.5 mag), we reach a bias-free delay measurement with a precision around 0.7 days over a large sample of LSNe Ia. The LSTM-FCNN is far more general than previous machine learning approaches such as the Random Forest (RF), where a RF has to be trained for each observational pattern separately, and yet the LSTM-FCNN outperforms the RF by a factor of roughly three. Therefore, the LSTM-FCNN is a very promising approach to achieve robust time delays in LSNe Ia, which is important for a precise and accurate constraint on $H_0$

 - **Abstract**
 Yellow supergiants (YSGs) are rare and poorly understood, and studying them is critical to constraining massive star evolution. We obtained flux-calibrated Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) high-resolution spectra of 40 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); this sample likely contains post-red supergiants (RSGs). Fitting these data with ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we determined fundamental parameters for these stars. We measure the first spectroscopic luminosities for YSGs above 20 $M_\odot$, providing us a novel probe of the luminosity-to-mass ratio. Many stars in our sample appear to have anomalously high surface gravities, despite being confirmed LMC supergiants. We manually inspected our data finding evidence for binary companions and ongoing mass loss. Our work demonstrates the valuable role of high-resolution spectroscopy in interpreting the evolutionary status of cool supergiants.
#### Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE). I.  Early ALMA Survey: observations and massive data reduction

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Recent molecular surveys have revealed a rich gas organization of sonic-like fibers in all kind of environments prior to the formation of low- and high-mass stars. This paper introduces the EMERGE project aiming to investigate whether complex fiber arrangements could explain the origin of high-mass stars and clusters. We analyzed the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey including 7 star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/2/3/4 South, L1641N, NGC2023, and Flame Nebula) homogeneously surveyed in both molecular lines (N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, HNC J=1-0, plus HC3N J=10-9) and 3mm-continuum using a combination of interferometric ALMA mosaics and IRAM-30m single-dish (SD) maps. Based on our low-resolution (SD) observations, we describe the global properties of our sample covering a wide range of physical conditions including low-, intermediate, and high-mass star-forming regions in different evolutionary stages. Their comparison with ancillary YSO catalogs denotes N$_2$H$^+$ as the best proxy for the dense, star-forming gas in our targets showing a constant star formation efficiency and a fast time evolution of <1 Myr. While apparently clumpy and filamentary in our SD data, all targets show a much more complex fibrous substructure at the enhanced resolution of our ALMA+IRAM-30m maps. A large number of filamentary features at sub-parsec scales are clearly recognized in the high-density gas traced by N$_2$H$^+$ directly connected to the formation of individual protostars. This complex gas organization appears to extend further into the more diffuse gas traced by HNC. This paper presents the EMERGE Early ALMA survey including a first data release of continuum maps and spectral products for this project to be analysed in future papers of this series. A first look at these results illustrates the need of advanced data combination techniques to investigate the intrinsic multi-scale, gas structure of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $<$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($< 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 GW170817 represents the first observed binary neutron star merger event by humanity. The observation of GW170817 has identified the correlation between Kilonova, gravitational wave and short GRB. The shocks from GW170817 have the capacity to inject significant thermal and kinetic energies into the interstellar medium and evolve for over a million years. In this letter, we adopt the special relativity fluid dynamics equations to simulate the evolution of the GW170817 remnant over a span of one million years. Our simulations yield the evolution profiles of the velocity, density, mass, radius, luminosity, and energies of the remnant. We estimate that the GW170817 remnant will reach the average maximum luminosity $ 2.56\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$at approximately $3.96\times 10^4$ yr. At the end of the cooling stage, the contaminated radius and mass are $48.35$ pc and $2.25\times 10^4 M_{\odot}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 As the most ancient branch of astronomy, astrometry has been developed for thousands of years. However, it has only recently become possible to utilize astrometry for the detection of exoplanets. Gaia, an astrometric surveyor of 1 billion stars, is capable of measuring the position of stars with a precision as high as 20 $\mu$as. Gaia is expected to discover more than 10,000 exoplanets by the end of its mission, surpassing the productivity of most exoplanet surveys. In this chapter, I will introduce different techniques used to achieve high-precision astrometry. Subsequently, I will explore how both relative and absolute astrometry can be employed to detect exoplanets. Finally, I will present the detection limit of the Gaia astrometric survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the three-dimensional power spectrum (P3D) of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest using the complete extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey data release 16 (eBOSS DR16). This sample consists of 205,012 quasar spectra in the redshift range 2 <= z <= 4 at an effective redshift z=2.334. We propose a pair-count spectral estimator in configuration space, weighting each pair by exp(ikr), for wave vector k and pixel pair separation r, effectively measuring the anisotropic power spectrum without the need for fast Fourier transforms. This accounts for the window matrix in a tractable way, avoiding artifacts found in Fourier-transform based power spectrum estimators due to the sparse sampling transverse to the line-of-sight of Ly-$\alpha$ skewers. We extensively test our pipeline on two sets of mocks: (i) idealized Gaussian random fields with a sparse sampling of Ly-$\alpha$ skewers, and (ii) log-normal LyaCoLoRe mocks including realistic noise levels, the eBOSS survey geometry and contaminants. On eBOSS DR16 data, the Kaiser formula with a non-linear correction term obtained from hydrodynamic simulations yields a good fit to the power spectrum data in the range 0.02 <= k <= 0.35 h/Mpc at the 1-2 sigma level with a covariance matrix derived from LyaCoLoRe mocks. We demonstrate a promising new approach for full-shape cosmological analyses of Ly-$\alpha$ forest data from cosmological surveys such as eBOSS, the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and future surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph, WEAVE-QSO and 4MOST.
#### Excited-State OH Masers in the Water Fountain Source IRAS 18460-0151

 - **Abstract**
 Water fountain objects are generally defined as "evolved stars with low to intermediate initial mass accompanied by high-velocity molecular jets detectable in the 22.235 GHz H$_2$O maser line". They are the key objects of understanding the morphological transitions of circumstellar envelopes during the post asymptotic giant branch phase. Masers are useful tools to trace the kinematic environments of the circumstellar envelopes. In this letter we report the discovery of exceptionally uncommon excited-state hydroxyl (ex-OH) masers at 4660 and 6031 MHz toward the water fountain source IRAS 18460-0151. These are the brightest ex-OH masers discovered in late-type objects to date. To the best of our knowledge, prior to the current work, no evolved stellar object has been observed in the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line. The ground-state hydroxyl (g-OH) masers at 1612 and 1665 MHz are also observed. The velocity components of the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line and the much weaker 1665 MHz g-OH maser line all can be seen in the 1612 MHz g-OH maser line profile. The blue-shifted components of the three masers are more intense than the red-shifted ones, in contrast to the ex-OH maser line at 6031 MHz. The relevance of the behaviors of the ex-OH masers to the circumstellar environments is unclear.
#### Positive Lynden-Bell derivative as a ticket to the bar trap?

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08326
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08326
 - **Abstract**
 We have translated the results of $N$-body simulations of one barred model into the language of action variables and frequencies. Using this language, we analysed the behaviour of all orbits in the model on a large time scale at the stage of a mature bar. We show that the orbits join the bar while preserving their adiabatic invariant, which takes into account the 3D structure of the orbits. This allows us to apply the concept of the Lynden-Bell derivative for each of these orbits and trace how the sign of the derivative changes, i.e. how asynchronous changes in angular momentum $L_z$ and orbital precession rate $\Omega_\mathrm{pr}$ (normal orbital mode) change to synchronous (abnormal mode). The transition to the abnormal mode occurs when $\Omega_\mathrm{pr}$ reaches the angular velocity of the pattern $\Omega_\mathrm{p}$, after which the orbit becomes stuck in the bar trap. All this happens against the background of secular changes in actions ($L_z$ decreases, $J_\mathrm{R}$ and $J_z$ increase). At the same time, corotation particles near two stable Lagrange points are also subject to secular changes in their actions. They increase $L_z$ and drift to the periphery, shifting corotation outwards. We also show that a change in the orbital mode from normal to abnormal and the trapping of orbits in a bar is possible only when the bar speed decreases with time, regardless of what is causing the bar to slow down. Our findings clarify and expand the picture of bar formation and evolution in numerical models.
#### Feasibility of detecting shadows in disks induced by infall

 - **Abstract**
 Observations performed with high-resolution imaging techniques revealed the existence of shadows in circumstellar disks that can be explained by the misalignment of an inner with respect to an outer disk. The cause of misalignment, however, is still debated. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of observing shadows induced by one prominent scenario that may lead to misalignment, which involves the late infall of material onto a protostellar system. In particular, we use previously performed hydrodynamical simulations of such events, and generate flux maps in the visible, near-infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter wavelength range using Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Based on that, we derive synthetic observations of these systems performed with the instruments SPHERE/VLT and ALMA, which we use as a basis for our subsequent analysis. We find that near-infrared observations with SPHERE are particularly well suited for detecting shadows via direct imaging alongside other features such as gaps, arcs, and streamers. On the contrary, performing a shadow detection based on reconstructed ALMA observations is very challenging due to the high sensitivity that is required for this task. Thus, in cases that allow for a detection, sophisticated analyses may be needed, for instance by the utilization of carefully constructed azimuthal profiles, aiding the search for potentially shallow shadows. Lastly, we conclude that late infall-induced disk misalignment offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of shadows that are observed in various systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the insterstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves towards fragmentation inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C-C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.
#### Metallicities for more than 10 million stars derived from Gaia BP/RP  spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The third Gaia Data Release, which includes BP/RP spectra for 219 million sources, has opened a new window in the exploration of the chemical history and evolution of the Milky Way. The wealth of information encapsulated in these data is far greater than their low resolving power (R=50) at first glance would suggest, as shown in many studies. We zero in on the use of this data for the purpose of the detection of ''new'' metal-poor stars, which are hard to find yet essential for understanding - among other - several aspects of the origin of the Galaxy, star formation and the creation of the elements. Aims. We strive to refine a metal-poor candidate selection method which was developed with simulated Gaia BP/RP spectra, with an ultimate objective of providing the community with both a recipe to select stars for medium/high resolution observations and a catalogue of stellar metallicities. Methods. We used a datased comprised of GALAH DR3 and SAGA database stars in order to verify and adjust to real world data our selection method. For that purpose, we used dereddening as a mean to tackle the issue of extinction, and then we applied our fine-tuned method to select metal-poor candidates, which we thereafter observed and analysed. Results. We were able to infer metallicities for GALAH DR3 and SAGA stars - with color excesses up to E(B-V)<1.5 - with an uncertainty of 0.36 dex, which is good enough for the purpose of identifying new metal-poor stars. Further, we selected 26 metal-poor candidates - via our method - for observations. As spectral analysis showed, 100% of them had [Fe/H]<-2.0, 57% had [Fe/H]<-2.5 and 8% had [Fe/H]<-3.0. We inferred metallicities for these stars with an uncertainty of 0.31 dex, as was proven when comparing to the spectroscopic [Fe/H]. Finally, we assembled a catalogue of metallicities for 10 861 062 stars.
#### What Does the Large Magellanic Cloud Look Like? It Depends on [M/H] and  Age

 - **Abstract**
 We offer a new way to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud through stellar mono-abundance and mono-age-mono-abundance maps. These maps are based on $\gtrsim 500\,000$ member stars with photo-spectroscopic [M/H] and age estimates from Gaia DR3 data, and they are the first area-complete, metallicity- and age-differentiated stellar maps of any disk galaxy. Azimuthally averaged, these maps reveal a surprisingly simple picture of the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy. For any [M/H] below -0.1 dex, the LMC's radial profile is well described by a simple exponential, but with a scale length that steadily shrinks towards higher metallicities, from nearly 2.3~kpc at [M/H]$=-1.8$ to only 0.75~kpc at [M/H]$=-0.25$. The prominence of the bar decreases dramatically with [M/H], making it barely discernible at [M/H]$\lesssim -1.5$. Yet, even for metal-rich populations, the bar has little impact on the azimuthally averaged profile of the mono-abundance components. Including ages, we find that the scale length is a greater function of age than of metallicity, with younger populations far more centrally concentrated. At old ages, the scale length decreases with increasing metallicity; at young ages, the scale-length is independent of metallicity. These findings provide quantitative support for a scenario where the LMC built its stellar structure effectively outside in.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio spikes are short lived, narrow bandwidth features in low frequency solar radio observations. The timing of their occurrence and the number of spikes in a given observation is often unpredictable. The high temporal and frequency of resolution of modern radio telescopes such as NenuFAR mean that manually identifying radio spikes is an arduous task. Machine learning approaches to data exploration in solar radio data is on the rise. Here we describe a convolutional neural network to identify the per pixel location of radio spikes as well as determine some simple characteristics of duration, spectral width and drift rate. The model, which we call SpikeNet, was trained using an Nvidia Tesla T4 16GB GPU with ~100000 sample spikes in a total time of 2.2 hours. The segmentation performs well with an intersection over union in the test set of ~0.85. The root mean squared error for predicted spike properties is of the order of 23%. Applying the algorithm to unlabelled data successfully generates segmentation masks although the accuracy of the predicted properties is less reliable, particularly when more than one spike is present in the same 64 X 64 pixel time-frequency range. We have successfully demonstrated that our convolutional neural network can locate and characterise solar radio spikes in a number of seconds compared to the weeks it would take for manual identification.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of micrometeorites in mid-Ordovician limestones and Earth's impact craters indicate that our planet witnessed a massive infall of ordinary L chondrite material 466 million years (My) ago (Heck et al. 2017, Schmieder & Kring 2020, Kenkmann 2021) that may have been at the origin of the first major mass extinction event (Schmitz et al. 2019). The breakup of a large asteroid in the main belt is the likely cause of this massive infall. In modern times, material originating from this breakup still dominates meteorite falls (>20% of all falls) (Swindle et al. 2014). Here, we provide spectroscopic observations and dynamical evidence that the Massalia collisional family is the only plausible source of this catastrophic event and of the most abundant class of meteorites falling on Earth today. It is suitably located in the inner belt, at low-inclination orbits, which corresponds to the observed distribution of L-chondrite-like near-Earth objects (NEOs) and of interplanetary dust concentrated at 1.4 degrees (Sykes 1990, Reach et al. 1997).

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of bright shooting stars and their meteorite samples is among the most ancient astronomy-related questions that at larger scales has human consequences [1-3]. As of today, only ${\sim}\,6\%$ of meteorite falls have been firmly linked to their sources (Moon, Mars, and asteroid (4) Vesta [4-6]). Here, we show that ${\sim}\,70\%$ of meteorites originate from three recent breakups of $D > 30\,{\rm km}$ asteroids that occurred 5.8, 7.5 and less than ${\sim}\,40$ million years ago. These breakups, including the well-known Karin family [7], took place in the prominent yet old Koronis and Massalia families and are at the origin of the dominance of H and L ordinary chondrites among meteorite falls. These young families distinguish themselves amidst all main belt asteroids by having a uniquely high abundance of small fragments. Their size-frequency distribution remains steep for a few tens of millions of years, exceeding temporarily the production of metre-sized fragments by the largest old asteroid families (e.g., Flora, Vesta). Supporting evidence includes the existence of associated dust bands [8-10], the cosmic-ray exposure ages of H-chondrite meteorites [11,12], or the distribution of pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites [13-15].
#### Narrowly-Banded Spectra with Peak Frequency Around 1 GHz of FRB  20201124A: Implications for Energy Function and Radiation Physics

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation physics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains an open question. Current observations have discovered that narrowly-banded bursts of FRB 20201124A are active in 0.4-2 GHz and their spectral peak frequency ($\nu^{\rm obs}_{p}$) are mostly toward $\sim 1$ GHz. Utilizing a sample of 1268 bursts of FRB 20201124A detected with the FAST telescope, we show that the $1\sigma$ spectral regime of 71.4\% events (in-band bursts) is within the FAST bandpass. Their intrinsic burst energies ($E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}$) and spectral widths ($\sigma_s^{\rm obs}$) are well measured by fitting the spectral profile with a Gaussian function. The derived $E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}$ and $\sigma_s^{\rm obs}$ distributions are log-normal and centering at $\log E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}/{\rm erg}=37.2~ (\sigma=0.76)$ and $\log \sigma_s^{\rm obs}/{\rm GHz}=-1.16~ (\sigma=0.17)$. Our Monte Carlo simulation analysis infers its intrinsic $\nu_p$ distribution as a normal function centered at $\nu_{p,c}=1.16$ GHz ($\sigma=0.22$) and its intrinsic energy function as $\Phi(E)\propto E^{-0.60}e^{-E/E_c}$ with $E_c=9.49 \times 10^{37}$ erg. We compare these results with that of typical repeating FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B that are active over a broad frequency range at several specific frequencies and discuss possible observational biases on the estimation of the event rate and energy function. Based on these results, we argue that FRB 20201124A likely occurs in a fine-tuned plasma for maser radiations at a narrow frequency range, while FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B could involve clumpy plasma conditions that make maser emission around several specific frequencies in a broad range.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial tensor modes can induce Cosmic Microwave Background spectral distortions during horizon re-entry. We investigate a specific mechanism proposed for this purpose, characterized by the coupling of an SU(2) gauge field to an axion undergoing a momentary stage of rapid evolution during inflation. Examining also the scalar perturbations produced by this model, we find that spectral distortions from the scalar modes significantly dominate those arising from the tensors. This holds true also for an earlier version of the model based on a U(1) gauge field. The scalar-induced distortions might be observed in future experiments, and the current COBE/FIRAS constraints already limit the parameter space of these models. Additionally, we find that delaying the onset of fast roll in the SU(2) scenario (to enhance the modes at the scales relevant for spectral distortions, while respecting the CMB constraints at larger scales) poses a greater challenge compared to the U(1) case. We propose a way to control the axion speed by varying the size of its coupling to the gauge fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Earth-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth's finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. Herein, this paper investigates the effect of Earth's oblateness, also known as the $J_{2}$ effect, on orbiters in Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the $J_{2}$ effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to the mission's advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in existing space-VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the $J_{2}$ effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we have demonstrated how the $J_{2}$ effect leads to modest increase in shorter baseline coverage, filling gaps in the $(u,v)$ plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the $J_{2}$ effect on the $(u,v)$ plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing $(u,v)$ coverage using the $J_{2}$ affected and invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and SgrA* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long term orbital stability on longer baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an analytical description of the galaxy bispectrum covariance and the power spectrum-bispectrum cross-covariance in redshift space that captures the dominant non-Gaussian contributions. The Gaussian prediction for the variance of the halo bispectrum monopole significantly underestimates numerical estimates particularly for squeezed triangles, that is bispectrum triangular configurations where one side is much smaller than the other two, whereas the effect is relatively less important when considering the quadrupole. We propose an expression for the missing non-Gaussian contribution valid in the squeezed limit that requires an accurate modeling of the bispectrum alone. We validate our model against the numerical covariance estimated from a large suite of mock catalogs and find that it accurately predicts the variance as well as the dominant off-diagonal terms. We also present an expression for the cross-covariance between power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles and likewise find it to provide a good description of the numerical results.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e < m_\phi < 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.
#### Limits on the OH Molecule in the Smith High Velocity Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We have used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for the OH molecule at several locations in the Smith Cloud, one of the most prominent of the high-velocity clouds that surround the Milky Way. Five positions with a high HI column density were selected as targets for individual pointings, along with a square degree around a molecular cloud detected with the Planck telescope near the tip of the Smith Cloud. Gas in the Galactic disk with similar values of $N_{HI}$ has detectable OH emission. Although we found OH at velocities consistent with the foreground Aquila molecular cloud, nothing was found at the velocity of the Smith Cloud to an rms level of 0.7 mK (T$_b$) in a 1 km $s^1$ channel. The three positions that give the strictest limits on OH are analyzed in detail. Their combined data imply a $5\sigma$ limit on $N(H_2) / N_{HI} \leq 0.03$ scaled by a factor dependent on the OH excitation temperature and background continuum $T_{ex}/(T_{ex}-T_{bg})$. There is no evidence for far-infrared emission from dust within the Smith Cloud. These results are consistent with expectations for a low-metallicity diffuse cloud exposed to the radiation field of the Galactic halo rather than a product of a galactic fountain.
