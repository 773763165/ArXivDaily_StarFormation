#### Absence of Small Dust Cloud Particles Transiting the White Dwarf  J0328-1219

 - **Abstract**
 The transiting dust clouds that orbit the white dwarf J0328-1219 are devoid of small particles (< 0.1 micron). Observations show that fade amount doesn't depend on wavelength. This finding resembles a similar observation for white dwarf WD 1145+017, but the explanations for an absence of small particles in the two white dwarf systems may differ due to their different distances from the star.

 - **Abstract**
 Using JWST observations of a primary transit and two secondary eclipses for GJ 1214b, we determine an eccentricity that is more precise than a decade of HARPS data, which enables us to measure the stellar density to 2.62%. Coupled with a prior on the stellar mass from a dynamically calibrated K-$M_*$ relation, we determine $R_*$ to 1.13% -- 3 times more precise than any other published analysis of this system. Then, using the bolometric flux from an SED model, we determine $T_{\rm eff}$ to 1.39% -- 40% more precise than systematic floors from spectroscopy. Within the global model, these also improve the planetary radius and insolation. This is a proof of concept for a new method to determine accurate $R_*$ and $T_{\rm eff}$ to a precision currently achieved for only a small number of low-mass stars. By applying our method to all high signal-to-noise planetary transits and occultations, we can expand the sample of precisely measured stars without assuming tidal circularization and calibrate new relations to improve our understanding of all low-mass stars.
#### Every Datapoint Counts: Stellar Flares as a Case Study of Atmosphere  Aided Studies of Transients in the LSST Era

 - **Abstract**
 Due to their short timescale, stellar flares are a challenging target for the most modern synoptic sky surveys. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a project designed to collect more data than any precursor survey, is unlikely to detect flares with more than one data point in its main survey. We developed a methodology to enable LSST studies of stellar flares, with a focus on flare temperature and temperature evolution, which remain poorly constrained compared to flare morphology. By leveraging the sensitivity expected from the Rubin system, Differential Chromatic Refraction can be used to constrain flare temperature from a single-epoch detection, which will enable statistical studies of flare temperatures and constrain models of the physical processes behind flare emission using the unprecedentedly high volume of data produced by Rubin over the 10-year LSST. We model the refraction effect as a function of the atmospheric column density, photometric filter, and temperature of the flare, and show that flare temperatures at or above ~4,000K can be constrained by a single g-band observation at airmass X > 1.2, given the minimum specified requirement on single-visit relative astrometric accuracy of LSST, and that a surprisingly large number of LSST observations is in fact likely be conducted at X > 1.2, in spite of image quality requirements pushing the survey to preferentially low X. Having failed to measure flare DCR in LSST precursor surveys, we make recommendations on survey design and data products that enable these studies in LSST and other future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Very recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band ever from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent constraints on an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity (QG) theories. Our results show that the 95% confidence level lower limits on the QG energy scales are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1}>10$ times of the Planck energy $E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2}>6\times10^{-8}E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively. Our limits on the quadratic LIV case improve previous best bounds by factors of 5--7.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia-ESO Survey is an European Southern Observatory (ESO) public spectroscopic survey that targeted $10^5$ stars in the Milky Way covering the major populations of the disk, bulge and halo. The observations were made using FLAMES on the VLT obtaining both UVES high ($R\sim47,000$) and GIRAFFE medium ($R\sim20,000$) resolution spectra. The analysis of the Gaia-ESO spectra was the work of multiple analysis teams (nodes) within five working groups (WG). The homogenisation of the stellar parameters within WG11 (high resolution observations of FGK stars) and the homogenisation of the stellar parameters within WG10 (medium resolution observations of FGK stars) is described here. In both cases, the homogenisation was carried out using a bayesian Inference method developed specifically for the Gaia-ESO Survey by WG11. The WG10 homogenisation primarily used the cross-match of stars with WG11 as the reference set in both the stellar parameter and chemical abundance homogenisation. In this way the WG10 homogenised results have been placed directly onto the WG11 stellar parameter and chemical abundance scales. The reference set for the metal-poor end was sparse which limited the effectiveness of the homogenisation in that regime. For WG11, the total number of stars for which stellar parameters were derived was 6,231 with typical uncertainties for Teff, log g and [Fe/H] of 32~K, 0.05 and 0.05 respectively. One or more chemical abundances out of a possible 39 elements were derived for 6,188 of the stars. For WG10, the total number of stars for which stellar parameters were derived was 76,675 with typical uncertainties for Teff, log g and [Fe/H] of 64~K, 0.15 and 0.07 respectively. One or more chemical abundances out of a possible 30 elements were derived for 64,177 of the stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Statistical analysis of samples of the orbits of celestial bodies is complicated by the fact that the Keplerian orbit is a multidimensional object, the coordinate representation of which nonlinearly depends on the choice of orbital elements. In this work, using the construction of the Fr\'echet mean, concepts of mean orbit and dispersion of the orbit family are introduced, consistent with the distance function on the orbit set. The introduced statistical characteristics serve as analogs of sample mean and variance of a one-dimensional random variable. Exact formulas for calculating the elements of mean orbits and dispersion quantities with respect to two metrics on the orbit space are derived. For a large sample of meteoroid orbits from the Geminid stream, numerical simulations of orbit evolution over 20,000 years in the past are conducted. By analyzing the dependency of statistical characteristics on time, estimates for the age of the stream and the gas outflow velocity are obtained under the assumption of the birth of the Geminids due to the rapid destruction of the cometary nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Abstract abridged. Eclipsing binary systems provide the opportunity to measure the fundamental parameters of their component stars in a stellar-model-independent way. This makes them ideal candidates for testing and calibrating theories of stellar structure and (tidal) evolution. Even without spectroscopic follow-up there is often enough information in their photometric time series to warrant analysis, especially if there is an added value present in the form of intrinsic variability, such as pulsations. Our goal is to implement and validate a framework for the homogeneous analysis of large numbers of eclipsing binary light curves, such as the numerous high-duty-cycle observations from space missions like TESS. The aim of this framework is to be quick and simple to run and to limit the user's time investment when obtaining, amongst other parameters, orbital eccentricities. We developed a new and fully automated methodology for the analysis of eclipsing binary light curves with or without additional intrinsic variability. Our method includes a fast iterative pre-whitening procedure. Orbital and stellar parameters are measured under the assumption of spherical stars of uniform brightness. We tested our methodology in two settings: a set of synthetic light curves with known input and the catalogue of Kepler eclipsing binaries. The synthetic tests show that we can reliably recover the frequencies and amplitudes of the sinusoids included in the signal as well as the input binary parameters. Recovery of the tangential component of eccentricity is the most accurate and precise. Kepler results confirm a robust determination of orbital periods, with 80.5% of periods matching the catalogued ones. We present the eccentricities for this analysis and show that they broadly follow the theoretically expected pattern as a function of the orbital period.

 - **Abstract**
 The circular orbits and elliptical orbits of moving objects in a gravitational field are essential information in astronomy. There have been many methods developed in the literature and textbooks to describe these orbits. In this report, I propose to use the vis-viva equation to construct a complex function to store the state of a moving object in elliptical orbits such that one can calculate its near future numerically. This state function is constructed by splitting its momentum into real and imaginary parts with one perpendicular to the radius of the mass center and the other parallel. This idea is inspired by the wavefunctions of electrons of hydrogen atoms in quantum mechanics. The equations are derived for one-body problems. Two-body problems can be constructed with subsets of one-body problems with the same center of mass, but different effective mass pinned there, which is significantly different from existing methods and provides the same results.

 - **Abstract**
 Since galaxy distribution reconstruction effectively reduces non-Gaussian terms in the power spectrum covariance matrix, it has attracted interest not only for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals but also for various cosmological signal analyses. To this end, this paper presents a novel theoretical model that addresses infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, including 1-loop corrections. In particular, we discuss the importance of incorporating non-perturbative effects arising from IR contributions into the displacement vector $\VEC{s}$ used for reconstruction. Consequently, post-reconstruction nonlinear damping of BAO can be described by a single two-dimensional Gaussian function. This is a phenomenon not observed when $\VEC{s}$ is considered to at a linear order in the Zel'dovich approximation. Furthermore, we confirm that the cross-power spectrum of the pre- and post-reconstruction density fluctuations lacks IR effect cancellations, and shows an exponential decay in both the cross-power spectrum and the associated shot-noise term.

 - **Abstract**
 We report sub-pc-scale observations of the 321-GHz H$_2$O emission line in the radio galaxy NGC 1052. The H$_2$O line emitter size is constrained in $< 0.6$ milliarcsec distributed on the continuum core component. The brightness temperature exceeding $10^6$ K and the intensity variation indicate certain evidence for maser emission. The maser spectrum consists of redshifted and blueshifted velocity components spanning $\sim 400$ km s$^{-1}$, separated by a local minimum around the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Spatial distribution of maser components show velocity gradient along the jet direction, implying that the population-inverted gas is driven by the jets interacting with the molecular torus. We identified significant change of the maser spectra between two sessions separated by 14 days. The maser profile showed a radial velocity drift of $127 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ implying inward gravitational acceleration at 5000 Schwarzschild radii. The results demonstrate feasibility of future VLBI observations to resolve the jet-torus interacting region.

 - **Abstract**
 In this fourth paper from the AGORA Collaboration, we study the evolution down to redshift $z=2$ and below of a set of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way mass galaxy by eight of the leading hydrodynamic simulation codes. We also compare this CosmoRun suite of simulations with dark matter-only simulations by the same eight codes. We analyze general properties of the halo and galaxy at $z=4$ and 3, and before the last major merger, focusing on the formation of well-defined rotationally-supported disks, the mass-metallicity relation, the specific star formation rate, the gas metallicity gradients, and the non-axisymmetric structures in the stellar disks. Codes generally converge well to the stellar-to-halo mass ratios predicted by semi-analytic models at $z\sim$2. We see that almost all the hydro codes develop rotationally-supported structures at low redshifts. Most agree within 0.5 dex with the observed MZR at high and intermediate redshifts, and reproduce the gas metallicity gradients obtained from analytical models and low-redshift observations. We confirm that the inter-code differences in the halo assembly history reported in the first paper of the collaboration also exist in CosmoRun, making the code-to-code comparison more difficult. We show that such differences are mainly due to variations in code-dependent parameters that control the time-stepping strategy of the gravity solver. We find that variations in the early stellar feedback can also result in differences in the timing of the low-redshift mergers. All the simulation data down to $z=2$ and the auxiliary data will be made publicly available.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06235
 - **Abstract**
 By means of N-body simulations, we study early structure formation in the presence of a scaling distribution of cosmic string loops. Cosmic string loops dominate the high redshift halo mass function while the fluctuations seeded by the standard structure formation scenario dominate structure at low redshifts. In our study, the effects of the cosmic string loops are taken into account by displacing the dark matter particles and their velocities at the initial time of the simulation by amounts determined by the analytical analysis which makes use of the Zeldovich approximation. We find that the resulting halo mass function is to a good approximation given by the sum of the analytically determined cosmic string halo mass function and the halo mass function obtained from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar abundances for a large number of stars are key information for the study of Galactic formation history. Large spectroscopic surveys such as DESI and LAMOST take median-to-low resolution ($R\lesssim5000$) spectra in the full optical wavelength range for millions of stars. However, line blending effect in these spectra causes great challenges for the elemental abundances determination. Here we employ the DD-PAYNE, a data-driven method regularised by differential spectra from stellar physical models, to the DESI EDR spectra for stellar abundance determination. Our implementation delivers 15 labels, including effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity $\log g$, microturbulence velocity $v_{\rm mic}$, and abundances for 12 individual elements, namely C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni. Given a spectral signal-to-noise ratio of 100 per pixel, internal precision of the label estimates are about 20 K for $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.05 dex for $\log~g$, and 0.05 dex for most elemental abundances. These results are agree with theoretical limits from the Cr\'amer-Rao bound calculation within a factor of two. The Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage that contributes the majority of the accreted halo stars are discernible from the disk and in-situ halo populations in the resultant [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Al/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance spaces. We also provide distance and orbital parameters for the sample stars, which spread a distance out to $\sim$100 kpc. The DESI sample has a significant higher fraction of distant (or metal-poor) stars than other existed spectroscopic surveys, making it a powerful data set to study the Galactic outskirts. The catalog is publicly available.

 The work presented forms a part of the IASc-INSA-NASI Summer Research Fellowship (SRFP) project on the physical & chemical properties of planetary nebulae. Spectral observations of NGC3242 recorded using the VBT Observatory (IIA), Kavalur (TN) for orthogonal slit positions are used for the study. The spectral data were reduced and analyzed using the IRAF data analysis package following the standard procedure to obtain the one dimensional spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Minkowski tensors are comprehensive shape descriptors that robustly capture n-point information in complex random geometries and that have already been extensively applied in the Euclidean plane. Here, we devise a novel framework for Minkowski tensors on the sphere. We first advance the theory by introducing irreducible Minkowski tensors, which avoid the redundancies of previous representations. We, moreover, generalize Minkowski sky maps to the sphere, i.e., a concept of local anisotropy, which easily adjusts to masked data. We demonstrate the power of our new procedure by applying it to simulations and real data of the Cosmic Microwave Background, finding an anomalous region close to the well-known Cold Spot. The accompanying open-source software, litchi, used to generate these maps from data in the HEALPix-format is made publicly available to facilitate broader integration of Minkowski maps in other fields, such as fluid demixing, porous structures, or geosciences more generally.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our optical photometric observations of the 2022 eruption of the recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) using 49,152 data points over 70 d following the optical peak. We have also analyzed its soft X-ray (0.3--1 keV) light curve by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. During the 2022 eruption, the optical plateau stage started 13.8--15.0 d and ended 23.8--25.0 d after the optical peak. The soft X-ray stage started 14.6--15.3 d and ended 38.7--39.5 d after the optical peak. Both stages started later and had shorter durations, and the soft X-ray light curve peaked earlier and was less luminous compared to those during the U Sco 2010 eruption. These points suggest that there were differences in the envelope mass between the different cycles of the nova eruption. Furthermore, we have analyzed the optical eclipses during the 2022 eruption. The primary eclipse was first observed 10.4--11.6 d after the optical peak, earlier than the beginning of the optical plateau stage. This sequence of events can be explained by the receding ejecta photosphere associated with the expanding nova ejecta. We have determined the ingress and egress phases of the primary eclipses and estimated the outer radius of the optical light source centered at the white dwarf (WD). During the optical plateau stage, the source radius remained $\sim$1.2 times larger than the Roche volume radius of the primary WD, being close to the L1 point. When the optical plateau stage ended, the source radius drastically shrank to the tidal truncation radius within a few orbital periods. This previously unresolved phenomenon can be interpreted as a structural change in U Sco where the temporarily expanded accretion disk due to the nova wind returned to a steady state.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly a hundred progenitor-less, thin stellar streams have been discovered in the Milky Way, thanks to Gaia and related surveys. Most streams are believed to have formed from star clusters and it was recently proposed that extended star clusters -- rich in stellar-mass black holes (BHs) -- are efficient in creating streams. To understand the nature of stream progenitors better, we quantify the differences between streams originating from star clusters with and without BHs using direct $N$-body models and a new model for the density profiles of streams based on time-dependent escape rates from clusters. The QSG (Quantifying Stream Growth) model facilitates the rapid exploration of parameter space and provides an analytic framework to understand the impact of different star cluster properties and escape conditions on the structure of streams. Using these models it is found that, compared to streams from BH-free clusters on the same orbit, streams of BH-rich clusters: (1) are approximately five times more massive; (2) have a peak density three times closer to the cluster 1 Gyr post-dissolution (for orbits of Galactocentric radius > 10 kpc), and (3) have narrower peaks and more extended wings in their density profile. We discuss other observable stream properties that are affected by the presence of BHs in their progenitor cluster, namely the width of the stream, its radial offset from the orbit, and the properties of the gap at the progenitor's location. Our results provide a step towards using stellar streams to constrain the BH content of dissolved (globular) star clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 High-contrast eclipsing binaries with low mass M-dwarf secondaries are precise benchmark stars to build empirical mass-radius relationships for fully convective low-mass ($\rm M_{*} < 0.35\,M_{\rm sun}$) dwarf stars. The contributed light of the M-dwarf in such binaries is usually much less than one~per~cent at optical wavelengths. This enables the detection of circumbinary planets from precise radial velocity measurements. High-resolution cross-correlation techniques are typically used to detect exoplanet atmospheres. One key aspect of these techniques is the post-processing, which includes the removal of telluric and spectral lines of the host star. We introduce the application of such techniques to optical high-resolution spectra of the circumbinary planet-host TOI-1338/BEBOP-1, turning it effectively into a double-lined eclipsing binary. By using simulations, we further explore the impact of post-processing techniques for high-contrast systems. We detect the M-dwarf secondary with a significance of 11-$\sigma$ and measure absolute dynamical masses for both components. Compared to previous model-dependent mass measurements, we obtain a four times better precision. We further find that the post-processing results in negligible systematic impact on the radial velocity precision for TOI-1338/BEBOP-1 with more than $96.6\,$per~cent (1-$\sigma$) of the M-dwarf's signal being conserved. We show that these methods can be used to robustly measure dynamical masses of high-contrast single-lined binaries providing important benchmark stars for stellar evolution particularly near the bottom of the main sequence. We also demonstrate how to retrieve the phase curve of an exoplanet with high-resolution spectroscopy using our data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new three-dimensional (3D) interstellar extinction maps in the $V$ and Gaia $G$ filters within 2 kpc of the Sun, a 3D differential extinction (dust spatial distribution density) map along the lines of sight in the same space, a 3D map of variations in the ratio of the extinctions in the $V$ and Gaia $G$ filters within 800 pc of the Sun, and a 2D map of total Galactic extinction through the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic space for Galactic latitudes $|b|>13^{\circ}$. The 3D maps have a transverse resolution from 3.6 to 11.6 pc and a radial resolution of 50 pc. The 2D map has an angular resolution of 6.1 arcmin. We have produced these maps based on the Gaia DR3 parallaxes and Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, SkyMapper, 2MASS, and WISE photometry for nearly 100 million stars. We have paid special attention to the space within 200 pc of the Sun and high Galactic latitudes as regions where the extinction estimates have had a large relative uncertainty so far. Our maps estimate the extinction within the Galactic dust layer from the Sun to an extended object or through the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic space with a precision $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V})=0.06$ mag. This gives a high relative precision of extinction estimates even at high Galactic latitudes, where, according to our estimates, the median total Galactic extinction through the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic objects is $A_\mathrm{V}=0.12\pm0.06$ mag. We have shown that the presented maps are among the best ones in data amount, space size, resolution, precision, and other properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Cool gaseous exoplanets ($1.75\ R_\oplus < R_\text{p} < 3\ R_\text{J}$, $200$ K $<T_\text{eq} < 1000$~K) are an as-yet understudied population, with great potential to expand our understanding of planetary atmospheres and formation mechanisms. In this paper, we outline the basis for a homogeneous survey of cool gaseous planets with Twinkle, a 0.45-m diameter space telescope with simultaneous spectral coverage from 0.5-4.5~$\mu$m, set to launch in 2025. We find that Twinkle has the potential to characterise the atmospheres of 36 known cool gaseous exoplanets (11~sub-Neptunian, 11~Neptunian, 14~Jovian) at an SNR $\geq$ 5 during its 3-year primary mission, with the capability of detecting most major molecules predicted by equilibrium chemistry to > $5\sigma$ significance. We find that an injected mass-metallicity trend is well-recovered, demonstrating Twinkle's ability to elucidate this fundamental relationship into cool regime. We also find Twinkle will be able to detect cloud layers at 3$\sigma$ or greater in all cool gaseous planets for clouds at $\leq$ 10 Pa pressure level, but will be insensitive to clouds deeper than $10^4$ Pa in all cases. With these results we demonstrate the capability of the Twinkle mission to greatly expand the current knowledge of cool gaseous planets, enabling key insights and constraints to be obtained for this poorly-charted region of exoplanet parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Globular clusters are considered key objects for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. In this sense, their characterisation in terms of their chemical and orbital parameters can provide constraints to the chemical evolution models of the Galaxy. Aims. We use the heavy element abundances of globular clusters to trace their overall behaviour in the Galaxy, aiming to analyse potential relations between the hot H-burning and s-process elements. Methods. We measured the content of Cu I and s- and r-process elements (Y II, Ba II, La II, and Eu II) in a sample of 210 giant stars in 18 Galactic Globular Clusters from high-quality UVES spectra. The clusters span a large metallicity range, and the sample is the largest uniformly analysed for what concerns heavy elements in Globular Clusters. Results. Cu abundances did not show considerable spread in the sample nor correlation with Na, meaning that the Na nucleosynthesis process does not affect the Cu abundance. Most GCs closely follow the Cu, Y, Ba, La, and Eu field stars' distribution, revealing a similar chemical evolution. The Y abundances in mid-metallicity regime GCs (-1.10 dex <[Fe/H]<-1.80 dex) display a mildly significant correlation with the Na abundance, which should be further investigated. Finally, we did not find any significant difference between the n-capture abundances among GCs with Galactic and extragalactic origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Light echoes of debris disks around active stars can reveal disk structure and composition even when disks are not spatially resolved. Unfortunately, distinguishing reflected light from quiescent starlight and unexpected post-peak flare structure is challenging, especially for edge-on geometries where the time delay between observed flare photons and light scattered from the near side of the disk is short. Here, we take advantage of the fact that scattered light from a dusty disk is polarized, depending on the location of the scattering site and the orientation of the disk relative to a distant observer. Filtering reflected light into its polarized components allows echoes to stand out in predictable ways. We test this idea with a simple model for a disk around an active M dwarf. Our results demonstrate that the use of polarimetric data of flaring stars can significantly enhance echo signals relative to starlight and yield more robust and accurate fits to disk parameters compared to analyses based on the total intensity alone.
#### Time resolved spectroscopy of a GRS 1915+105 flare during its unusual  low state using AstroSat

 - **Abstract**
 Since its discovery in 1992, GRS 1915+105 has been among the brightest sources in the X-ray sky. However, in early 2018, it dimmed significantly and has stayed in this faint state ever since. We report on AstroSat and NuSTAR observation of GRS 1915+105 in its unusual low/hard state during 2019 May. We performed time-resolved spectroscopy of the X-ray flares observed in this state and found that the spectra can be fitted well using highly ionised absorption models. We further show that the spectra can also be fitted using a highly relativistic reflection dominated model, where for the lamp post geometry, the X-ray emitting source is always very close to the central black hole. For both interpretations, the flare can be attributed to a change in the intrinsic flux, rather than dramatic variation in the absorption or geometry. These reflection dominated spectra are very similar to the reflection dominated spectra reported for Active Galactic Nuclei in their low flux states.
#### Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in  Radiative Hybrid Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index, $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$ consistent with the current Planck data. Our findings show that the abundance of PBHs are correlated to the dark fermion mass $m_N$ and peak in the GW spectrum. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, and CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass $m \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV, we obtain PBHs of around $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ with peak frequency $f$ $\sim$ $0.1$ Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be the possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis.
