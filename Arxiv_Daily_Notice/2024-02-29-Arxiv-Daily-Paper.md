 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we derive observational constraints on an anisotropic $w$CDM model from observational data including Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs), Cosmic Chronometer (CC), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae, and SH0ES Cepheid host distance anchors. We find that anisotropy is of the order $10^{-13}$, and its presence in the $w$CDM model reduces $H_0$ tension by $\sim 2\sigma$ and $\sim 1\sigma$ in the analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP and BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES data combinations, respectively. In both analyses, the quintessence form of dark energy is favored at 95\% CL.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of Cerberus, an extremely red object detected with the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) observations in the F1000W filter of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The object is detected at S/N~6, with F1000W~27 mag, and it is extremely faint in both the NIRCam data gathered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, JADES, with ~30.5 mag $5\sigma$ upper limits in individual bands, as well as in the MIDIS F560W ultra deep data ($\sim$29 mag, $5\sigma$). Analyzing the spectral energy distribution built with individual (low S/N) optical-to-mid-infrared filters and (S/N~5) stacks, we discuss the possible nature of this red NIRCam-dark source using a battery of codes. We discard the possibility of Cerberus being a Solar System body based on the $<$0.016" proper motion in the 1-year apart JADES and MIDIS observations. A sub-stellar Galactic nature is deemed unlikely, given that the Cerberus' relatively flat NIRCam-to-NIRCam and very red NIRCam-to-MIRI flux ratios are not consistent with any brown dwarf model. The extragalactic nature of Cerberus offers 3 possibilities: (1) A $z\sim0.4$ galaxy with strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; the very low inferred stellar mass, $\mathrm{M}_\star=10^{5-6}$ M$_\odot$, makes this possibility highly improbable. (2) A dusty galaxy at $z\sim4$ with an inferred stellar mass $\mathrm{M}_\star\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$. (3) A galaxy with observational properties similar to those of the reddest little red dots discovered around $z\sim7$, but Cerberus lying at $z\sim15$, presenting a spectral energy distribution in the rest-frame optical dominated by emission from a dusty torus or a dusty starburst.
#### The Sun Remains Relatively Refractory Depleted: Elemental Abundances for  17,412 Gaia RVS Solar Analogs and 50 Planet Hosts

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundances of stars, particularly the refractory elements (e.g., Fe, Si, Mg), play an important role in connecting stars to their planets. Most Sun-like stars do not have refractory abundance measurements since obtaining a large sample of high-resolution spectra is difficult with oversubscribed observing resources. In this work we infer abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mn, Cr, Si, Fe, Ni, Mg, V, Ca, Ti, Al, and Y for solar analogs with Gaia RVS spectra (R=11,200) using the Cannon, a data-driven method. We train a linear model on a reference set of 34 stars observed by Gaia RVS with precise abundances measured from previous high resolution spectroscopic efforts (R > 30,000--110,000). We then apply this model to several thousand Gaia RVS solar analogs. This yields abundances with average upper limit precisions of 0.04--0.1 dex for 17,412 stars, 50 of which are identified planet (candidate) hosts. We subsequently test the relative refractory depletion of these stars with increasing element condensation temperature compared to the Sun. The Sun remains refractory depleted compared to other Sun-like stars regardless of our current knowledge of the planets they host. This is inconsistent with theories of various types of planets locking up or sequestering refractories. Furthermore, we find no significant abundance differences between identified close-in giant planet hosts, giant planet hosts, and terrestrial/small planet hosts and the rest of the sample within our precision limits. This work demonstrates the utility of data-driven learning for future exoplanet composition and demographics studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 15 years of eclipse timings of the polar V808 Aur. The rapid ingress/egress of the white dwarf and bright accretion region provide timings as precise as a few tenths of a second for rapid cadence photometric data. We find that between 2015 and 2018, the eclipse timings deviated from a linear ephemeris by more than 30 s. The rapid timing change is consistent with the periastron passage of a planet in an eccentric orbit about the polar. The best fit orbital period is 11$\pm 1$ yr and we estimate a projected mass of $Msin(i)=6.8\pm 0.7$ Jupiter masses. We also show that the eclipse timings are correlated with the brightness of the polar with a slope of 1.1 s/mag. This is likely due to the change in the geometry of the accretion curtains as a function of the mass transfer rate in the polar. While an eccentric planet offers an excellent explanation to the available eclipse data for V808 Aur, proposed planetary systems in other eclipsing polars have often struggled to accurately predict future eclipse timings.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the medium resolution spectrograph X-shooter, spectra of 235 OB and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in sub-solar metallicity environments have been secured. [...]This second paper focuses on the optical observations of 232 Magellanic Clouds targets. It describes the uniform reduction of the UVB (300 - 560 nm) and VIS (550 - 1020 nm) XShootU data as well as the preparation of advanced data products [...] . The data reduction of the raw data is based on the ESO CPL X-shooter pipeline. We paid particular attention to the determination of the response curves [...] We implemented slit-loss correction, absolute flux calibration, (semi-)automatic rectification to the continuum, and a correction for telluric lines. The spectra of individual epochs were corrected for the barycentric motion, re-sampled and co-added, and the spectra from the two arms were merged into a single flux calibrated spectrum covering the entire optical range with maximum signal-to-noise ratio. [...] We provide three types of data products: (i) two-dimensional spectra for each UVB and VIS exposure; (ii) one-dimensional UVB and VIS spectra before and after response-correction, as well as after applying various processing, including absolute flux calibration, telluric removal, normalisation and barycentric correction; and (iii) co-added flux-calibrated and rectified spectra over the full optical range, for which all available XShootU exposures were combined. For many of the targets, the final signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element is above 200 in both the UVB and the VIS co-added spectra. The reduced data and advanced scientific data products will be made available to the community upon publication of this paper. [...]
#### Meridional Circulation Streamlined

 - **Abstract**
 Time-dependent meridional circulation and differential rotation in radiative zones are central open issues in stellar evolution theory. We streamline this challenging problem using the 'downward control principle' of atmospheric science, under a geostrophic f-plane approximation. New insights emerge from this simplified approach, using pressure as the vertical coordinate. We recover the known stellar physics result that the steady-state meridional circulation decays on the length scale (N/f sqrt(Pr))H, assuming molecular viscosity is the dominant drag mechanism. Prior to steady-state, the meridional circulation and the zonal wind (differential rotation) spread together via radiative diffusion, under thermal wind balance. The corresponding (4th-order) hyperdiffusion process is reasonably well approximated by regular (2nd-order) diffusion on scales of order a pressure scale-height. We derive an inhomogeneous diffusion (equiv. advection-diffusion) equation for the zonal flow which admits closed-form time-dependent solutions in a finite depth domain, allowing rapid prototyping of the meridional circulation pattern. In the weak drag limit, we find that the time to rotational steady-state can be longer than the Eddington-Sweet time and be instead determined by the longer drag time. Unless strong enough drag operates, the internal rotation of main-sequence stars may thus never reach steady-state. Streamlined meridional circulation solutions provide leading-order internal rotation profiles for studying the role of fluid/MHD instabilities (or waves) in redistributing angular momentum in the radiative zones of stars. Despite clear geometrical limitations and simplifying assumptions, one might expect our thin-layer geostrophic approach to offer qualitatively useful results to understand deep meridional circulation in stars.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17116
 - **Abstract**
 In this article I summarize the current state of knowledge about the composition of Titan's atmosphere, and our current understanding of the suggested chemistry that leads to that observed composition. I begin with our present knowledge of the atmospheric composition, garnered from a variety of measurements including Cassini-Huygens, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and other ground and space-based telescopes. This review focuses on the typical vertical profiles of gases at low latitudes, rather than global and temporal variations. The main body of the paper presents a chemical description of how complex molecules are believed to arise from simpler species, considering all known 'stable' molecules - those that have been uniquely identified in the neutral atmosphere. The last section of the paper is devoted to the gaps in our present knowledge of Titan's chemical composition and how further work may fill those gaps.

 - **Abstract**
 The XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP) is designed to study diffuse X-ray emissions from the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as well as emissions from the foreground solar wind charge exchange (SWCX). This paper reports an all-sky survey of spectral feature intensities corresponding to the O VII, O VIII, and iron L-shell (Fe-L) emissions. These intensities are derived from 5418 selected XMM-Newton observations with long exposure times and minimal contamination from point or extended sources. For 90% of the measured intensities, the values are within $\approx$ 2-18 photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (line unit; L.U.), $\approx$ 0-8 L.U., and $\approx$ 0-9 L.U., respectively. We report long-term variations in O VII and O VIII intensities over 22 years, closely correlating with the solar cycle and attributed to SWCX emissions. These variations contribute $\sim30\%$ and $\sim20\%$ to the observed intensities on average and peak at $\approx$ 4 L.U. and $\approx$ 1 L.U. during solar maxima. We also find evidence of short-term and spatial variations in SWCX, indicating the need for a more refined SWCX model in future studies. In addition, we present SWCX- and absorption-corrected all-sky maps for a better view of the MW hot gas emission. These maps show a gradual decrease in oxygen intensity moving away from the Galactic center and a concentration of Fe-L intensity in the Galactic bubbles and disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the conditional occurrences between three planetary types: super-Earths (m sin i $<$ 10 M$_\oplus$, P $<$ 100 days), warm Jupiters (m sin i $>$ 95 $M_\oplus$, 10 $<$ P $<$ 100 days), and cold Jupiters (m sin i $>$ 95 M$_\oplus$, P $>$ 400 days) for sun-like stars. We find that while the occurrence of cold Jupiters in systems with super-Earths is $22.2\substack{+8.3\\-5.4}$$\%$, compared to $10$$\%$ for the absolute occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, the occurrence of super-Earths in systems with cold Jupiters is $66.0\substack{+18.0\\-16.0}$$\%$, compared to $30$$\%$ for the absolute occurrence rate of super-Earths for sun-like stars. We find that the enhancement of super-Earths in systems with cold Jupiters is evident for sun-like stars, in agreement with several previous studies. We also conduct occurrence studies between warm Jupiters and super-Earths, and between warm Jupiters and cold Jupiters, to consolidate our methods. We conduct an independent observational test to study the effects of cold Jupiters against the inner multiplicity using the well-established giant planet host star metallicity correlation for all transiting planets found to date. The conditional occurrences we find here can be used to constrain the validity of various planetary formation models. The extremely interesting correlations between the super-Earths, cold Jupiters, and warm Jupiters can also be used to understand the formation histories of these planetary types.
#### The Optical to Infrared $0.6-5.3\,{\rm μm}$ Dust Extinction Law of  the Milky Way with JWST NIRSpec: Westerlund 2

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar extinction law is important for interpreting observations and inferring the properties of interstellar dust grains. Based on the 993 prism/CLEAR spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we investigate $0.6-5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$ interstellar dust extinction law. We propose a pair method to obtain the reddening curves based only on JWST observed spectra. Most of the high extinction sources are toward the young star cluster Westerlund 2. The infrared (IR) $1.0-5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$ reddening curves agree with the power-law $A_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$ well. We determine an average value of $\alpha=1.98\pm0.15$, which is consistent with the average value of the Galaxy. We find that $\alpha$ may be variable and independent of $R_{\rm V}$. With the derived $\alpha$, we convert the reddening curves into the extinction curves and establish the non-parameterized $\alpha$-dependent extinction curves in the wavelength range of $0.6-5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$. At $\lambda<1\,{\rm \mu m}$, the derived extinction law is not well described by the parameterized power-law type curve. Our non-parameterized $\alpha$-dependent extinction curves are suitable for the extinction correction of JWST-based photometry and spectra measurements at $0.6-5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$. We also provide the extinction coefficients for the JWST NIRCam bandpasses with different $\alpha$.
#### A chemodynamical analysis of bright metal-poor stars from the HESP-GOMPA  survey -- Indications of a non-prevailing site for light r-process elements

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17250
 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the detailed chemical abundances for a sample of 11 metal-poor, very metal-poor and extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] = -1.65 to [Fe/H] = -3.0) as part of the HESP-GOMPA (Galactic survey Of Metal Poor stArs) survey. The abundance determinations encompass a range of elements, including C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, and Ba, with a subset of the brighter objects allowing for the measurement of additional key elements. Notably, the abundance analysis of a relatively bright highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star (SDSS J0019+3141) exhibits a predominantly main r-process signature and variations in the lighter r-process elements. Moreover, successful measurements of thorium in this star facilitate stellar age determinations. We find a consistent odd-even nucleosynthesis pattern in these stars, aligning with expectations for their respective metallicity levels, thus implicating Type II supernovae as potential progenitors. From the interplay between the light and heavy r-process elements, we infer a diminishing relative production of light r-process elements with increasing Type II supernova contributions, challenging the notion that Type II supernovae are the primary source of these light r-process elements in the early Milky Way. A chemodynamical analysis based on Gaia astrometric data and our derived abundances indicates that all but one of our program stars are likely to be of accreted origin. Additionally, our examination of alpha-poor stars underscores the occurrence of an early accretion event from a satellite on a prograde orbit, similar to that of the Galactic disc.
#### New method for estimating molecular cloud distances based on Gaia,  2MASS, and the TRILEGAL galaxy model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17276
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method for estimating the distances of molecular clouds traced by CO line emission. Stars from 2MASS and Gaia EDR3 are selected as on-cloud stars when they are projected on a cloud. The background on-cloud stars have redder colors on average than the foreground stars. Instead of searching for stars projected away from the cloud, we employed the TRILEGA galaxy model to mimic the stellar population without cloud extinction along the sightline toward the cloud. Our method does not require an exact boundary of a cloud. The boundaries are highly variable and depend on the sensitivity of the molecular line data. For each cloud, we compared the distributions of on-cloud stars to the TRILEGAL stellar populations in the diagram of $J-K_s$ color versus distance. The intrinsic $J-K_s$ colors of main-sequence and evolved stars from TRILEGAL were considered separately, and they were used as the baseline for subtracting the observed $J-K_s$ colors. The baseline-corrected $J-K_s$ color was deployed with the Bayesian analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to determine the distance at which the $J-K_s$ color jump is largest. This method was successfully applied to measure the distances of 27 molecular clouds, which were selected from previously published cloud samples. By replacing TRILEGAL with the GALAXIA galaxy model, we were able to measure the distances for 21 of the 27 clouds. The distances of the 21 clouds based on the GALAXIA model agree well with those based on the TRILEGAL model. The distances of the 27 clouds estimated by this method are consistent with previous estimates. We will apply this new method to a larger region of the gaseous galactic plane, in particular, for the inner galactic region, where a region free of CO emission is hard to separate from the crowded field of clouds.
#### Distribution of number of peaks within a long gamma-ray burst

 - **Abstract**
 The variety of long duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB) light curves (LCs) encode a wealth of information on how LGRB engines release energy following the collapse of the progenitor star. Attempts to characterise GRB LCs focused on a number of properties, such as the minimum variability timescale, power density spectra (both ensemble average and individual), or with different definitions of variability. In parallel, a characterisation as a stochastic process was pursued by studying the distributions of waiting times, peak flux, fluence of individual peaks within GRB time profiles. Yet, the question remains as to whether the diversity of profiles can be described in terms of a common stochastic process. Here we address this issue by studying for the first time the distribution of the number of peaks in a GRB profile. We used four different GRB catalogues: CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT, BeppoSAX/GRBM, and Insight-HXMT. The statistically significant peaks were identified by means of well tested algorithm MEPSA and further selected by applying a set of thresholds on signal-to-noise ratio. We then extracted the corresponding distributions of number of peaks per GRB. Among the different models considered (power-law, simple or stretched exponential) only a mixture of two exponentials models all the observed distributions, suggesting the existence of two distinct behaviours: (i) an average number of 2.1+-0.1 peaks per GRB ("peak poor") and accounting for about 80% of the observed population of GRBs; (ii) an average number of 8.3+-1.0 peaks per GRB ("peak rich") and accounting for the remaining 20% of the observed population. We associate the class of peak-rich GRBs with the presence of sub-second variability, which seems to be absent among peak-poor GRBs. The two classes could result from two different regimes through which GRB engines release energy or through which energy is dissipated into gamma-rays.
#### On the Impact and Utility of Single-Exomoon Modeling for Multi-Moon  Systems

 - **Abstract**
 The search for exomoons in time-domain photometric data has to-date generally consisted of fitting transit models that are comprised of a planet hosting a single moon. This simple model has its advantages, but it may not be particularly representative, as most of the major moons in our Solar System are found in multi-moon satellite systems. It is critical that we investigate, then, the impact of applying a single-moon model to systems containing multiple moons, as there is the possibility that utilizing an inaccurate or incomplete model could lead to erroneous conclusions about the system. To that end, in this work we produce a variety of realistic multi-moon light curves, perform standard single-moon model selection, and analyze the impacts that this model choice may have on the search for exomoons. We find that the number of moons in a system fit with a single-moon model generally has little impact on whether we find evidence for a moon in that system, and other system attributes are individually not especially predictive. However, the model parameter solutions for the moon frequently do not match any real moon in the system, instead painting a picture of a ``phantom'' moon. We find no evidence that multi-moon systems yield corresponding multi-modal posteriors. We also find a systematic tendency to overestimate planetary impact parameter and eccentricity, to derive unphysical moon densities, and to infer potentially unphysical limb darkening coefficients. These results will be important to keep in mind in future exomoon search programs.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-1518b, a hot Jupiter around a late A-type star, is one of the few planetary systems that transit the edge of the stellar surface (the impact parameter $b\sim0.9 $) among hot Jupiters around hot stars (Cabot et al. 2021). The high rotation speed of the host star ($\sim85$ km s$^{-1}$) and the nearly polar orbit of the planet ($\sim 120$ deg) may cause a nodal precession. In this study, we report the nodal precession undergone by TOI-1518\,b. This system is the fourth planetary system in which nodal precession is detected. We investigate the time change in $b$ from the photometric data of TOI-1518 acquired in 2019 and 2022 with TESS and from the spectral transit data of TOI-1518b obtained in 2020 with two high-dispersion spectrographs; CARMENES and EXPRES. We find that the value of $b$ is decreasing with $db/dt=-0.0116\pm0.0036$\,year$^{-1}$, indicating that the transit trajectory is moving toward the center of the stellar surface. We also estimate the minimum value of the quadrupole mass moment of TOI-1518 $J_{2,\mathrm{min}}=4.41\times 10^{-5}$ and the logarithm of the Love number of TOI-1518 $\log{k_2}= -2.17\pm 0.33$ from the nodal precession.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), expressed as DL(z) = (1 + z)2DA(z), plays an important role in modern cosmology. In this paper, we propose a new method of testing CDDR using strongly lensed gravitational wave (SLGW) signals. Under the geometric optics approximation, we calculate the gravitational lens effects of two lens models, the point mass and singular isothermal sphere. We use functions of {\eta}1(z) = 1 + {\eta}0z and {\eta}2(z) = 1 + {\eta}0z=(1 + z) to parameterize the deviation of CDDR. By reparameterizing the SLGW waveform with CDDR and the distance-redshift relation, we include the deviation parameters {\eta}0 of CDDR as waveform parameters. We evaluate the ability of this method by calculating the parameter estimation of simulated SLGW signals from massive binary black holes. We apply the Fisher information matrix and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to calculate parameter estimation. We find that with only one SLGW signal, the measurement precision of {\eta}0 can reach a considerable level of 0.5-1.3% for {\eta}1(z) and 1.1-2.6% for {\eta}2(z), depending on the lens model and parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cygnus region, which contains massive molecular and atomic clouds and young stars, is a promising Galactic neutrino source candidate. Cosmic rays transport in the region can produce neutrinos and $\gamma$-rays. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected an ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray bubble (Cygnus Bubble) in this region. Using publicly available track events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in 7 years of full detector operation, we conduct searches for correlated neutrino signals from the Cygnus Bubble with neutrino emission templates based on LHAASO $\gamma$-ray observations. No significant signals were found for any employed templates. With the 7 TeV $\gamma$-ray flux template, we set a flux upper limit of 90% confidence level (C.L.) for the neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble to be $5.7\times10^{-13}\, \mathrm{TeV}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 5 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the results of a search for radio pulsars in five supernova remnants (SNRs) with FAST. The observations were made using the 19-beam receiver in the Snapshot mode. The integration time for each pointing is 10 min. We discovered a new pulsar PSR J1845$-$0306 which has a spin period of 983.6 ms and a dispersion measure of 444.6$\pm$2.0 cm$^{-3}$ pc in observations of SNR G29.6+0.1. To judge the association between the pulsar and the SNR, further verification is needed. We also re-detected some known pulsars in the data from SNRs G29.6+0.1 and G29.7$-$0.3. No pulsars were detected in observations of other three SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Many barriers prevent dust to form planetesimals via coagulation in protoplanetary discs, such as bouncing, collisional fragmentation or aeolian erosion. Modelling dust and the different phenomena that can alter its evolution is therefore needed. Multiple solutions have been proposed, but still need to be confirmed. Aims: In this paper, we explore the role aeolian erosion plays in the evolution of dust. Methods: We use a monodisperse model to account for dust growth and fragmentation, implemented in a 1D model to compute the evolution of single grains and a 3D SPH code to compute the global evolution of dust and gas. We test the erosion model in our code and ensured it matches previous results. Results: With a model of disc reproducing observations, we show with both 1D and 3D studies that erosion is not significant during the evolution of dust when we take fragmentation into consideration. With a low-viscosity disc, fragmentation is less of a problem, but grain growth is also less important, preventing the formation of large objects anyway. In dust traps, close to the star, erosion is also not impactful, even when fragmentation is turned off. Conclusions: We show in this paper that aeolian erosion is negligible when radial drift, fragmentation and dust traps are taken into account and does not alter the dust evolution in the disc. However, it can have an impact on later stages, i.e. when the streaming instability forms large clumps close to the star, or when planetesimals are captured.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the thousands of planets in orbit around stars known to date, the mechanisms of planetary formation, migration, and atmospheric loss remain unresolved. In this work, we confirm the planetary nature of a young Saturn-size planet transiting a solar-type star every 8.03 d, TOI-1135\,b. The age of the parent star is estimated to be in the interval of 125--1000 Myr based on various activity and age indicators, including its stellar rotation period of 5.13\,$\pm$\,0.27 d and the intensity of photospheric lithium. We obtained follow-up photometry and spectroscopy, including precise radial velocity measurements using the CARMENES spectrograph, which together with the TESS data allowed us to fully characterise the parent star and its planet. As expected for its youth, the star is rather active and shows strong photometric and spectroscopic variability correlating with its rotation period. We modelled the stellar variability using Gaussian process regression. We measured the planetary radius at 9.02\,$\pm$\,0.23 R$_\oplus$ (0.81\,$\pm$\,0.02 R$_{\mathrm{Jup}}$) and determined a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $<$\,51.4 M$_\oplus$ ($<$\,0.16 \,M$_{\rm{Jup}}$) on the planetary mass by adopting a circular orbit. Our results indicate that TOI-1135\,b is an inflated planet less massive than Saturn or Jupiter but with a similar radius, which could be in the process of losing its atmosphere by photoevaporation. This new young planet occupies a region of the mass-radius diagram where older planets are scarse, and it could be very helpful to understanding the lower frequency of planets with sizes between Neptune and Saturn.

 - **Abstract**
 A detailed interpretation of the detected emission lines of environments in which propyne (or methyl acetylene, CH$_3$CCH) is observed requires a knowledge of its collisional rate coefficients with the most abundant species in the interstellar medium, He or H$_2$. We present the first three-dimensional potential energy surface (3D-PES) for the CH$_3$CCH-He molecular complex, study the dynamics of the collision, and report the first set of rate coefficients for temperatures up to 100 K for the collisional excitation of the lowest 60 ortho rotational levels and 60 para rotational levels of CH$_3$CCH by He atoms. We computed the 3D-PES with the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster with single-, double-, and perturbative triple-excitation method, in conjunction with the augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set (CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ). The 3D-PES was fitted to an analytical function. Scattering computations of pure rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_3$CCH by collision with He atoms were performed and the state-to-state cross sections were computed using the close coupling method for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$ and with the coupled states approximation at higher energy for both ortho and para symmetries of CH$_3$CCH. The PES obtained is caracterized by a large anisotropy and a potential well depth of 51.04 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the collisional cross sections, we determined quenching rate coefficients for kinetic temperatures up to 100 K. A strong even $\Delta j$ propensity rule at almost all collision energies exists for CH$_3$CCH-He complex. To evaluate the impact of rate coefficients in the analysis of observations, we carried out non-LTE radiative transfer computations of the excitation temperatures and we demonstrate that LTE conditions are typically not fulfilled for the propyne molecule.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid and accurate evaluation of the nonlinear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters and redshift is of fundamental importance in cosmology. Analytic approximations provide an interpretable solution, yet current approximations are neither fast nor accurate relative to black-box numerical emulators. We use symbolic regression to obtain simple analytic approximations to the nonlinear scale, $k_\sigma$, the effective spectral index, $n_{\rm eff}$, and the curvature, $C$, which are required for the halofit model. We then re-optimise the coefficients of halofit to fit a wide range of cosmologies and redshifts. We then again exploit symbolic regression to explore the space of analytic expressions to fit the residuals between $P(k)$ and the optimised predictions of halofit. All methods are validated against $N$-body simulations. Our symbolic expressions for $k_\sigma$, $n_{\rm eff}$ and $C$ have root mean squared fractional errors of 0.8%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, for redshifts below 3 and a wide range of cosmologies. The re-optimised halofit parameters reduce the root mean squared fractional error from 3% to below 2% for wavenumbers $k=9\times10^{-3}-9 \, h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. We introduce syren-halofit (symbolic-regression-enhanced halofit), an extension to halofit containing a short symbolic correction which improves this error to 1%. Our method is 2350 and 3170 times faster than current halofit and hmcode implementations, respectively, and 2680 and 64 times faster than EuclidEmulator2 (which requires running class) and the BACCO emulator. We obtain comparable accuracy to EuclidEmulator2 and the BACCO emulator when tested on $N$-body simulations. Our work greatly increases the speed and accuracy of symbolic approximations to $P(k)$, making them significantly faster than their numerical counterparts without loss of accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern galaxy surveys demand extensive survey volumes and resolutions surpassing current dark matter-only simulations' capabilities. To address this, many methods employ effective bias models on the dark matter field to approximate object counts on a grid. However, realistic catalogs necessitate specific coordinates and velocities for a comprehensive understanding of the Universe. In this research, we explore sub-grid modeling to create accurate catalogs, beginning with coarse grid number counts at resolutions of approximately $5.5,h^{-1}$ Mpc per side. These resolutions strike a balance between modeling nonlinear damping of baryon acoustic oscillations and facilitating large-volume simulations. Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ALPT) is utilized to model the dark matter field and motions, replicating the clustering of a halo catalog derived from a massive simulation at $z=1.1$. Our approach involves four key stages: Tracer Assignment: Allocating dark matter particles to tracers based on grid cell counts, generating additional particles to address discrepancies. Attractor Identification: Defining attractors based on particle cosmic web environments, acting as gravitational focal points. Tracer Collapse: Guiding tracers towards attractors, simulating structure collapse. Redshift Space Distortions: Introducing redshift space distortions to simulated catalogs using ALPT and a random dispersion term. Results demonstrate accurate reproduction of monopoles and quadrupoles up to wave numbers of approximately $k=0.6,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This method holds significant promise for galaxy surveys like DESI, EUCLID, and LSST, enhancing our understanding of the cosmos across scales.

 - **Abstract**
 While gravitational lens inversion holds great promise to reveal the structure of the light-deflecting mass distribution, both light and dark, the existence of various kinds of degeneracies implies that care must be taken when interpreting the resulting lens models. This article illustrates how thinking in terms of the projected potential helps to gain insight into these matters. Additionally it is shown explicitly how, when starting from a discretised version of the projected potential of one particular lens model, the technique of quadratic programming can be used to create a multitude of equivalent lens models that preserve all or a subset of lens properties. This method is applied to a number of scenarios, showing the lack of grasp on the mass outside the strong lensing region, revisiting mass redistribution in between images and applying this to a recent model of the SDSS J1004+4112 cluster, as well as illustrating the generalised mass sheet degeneracy and source-position transformation. In the case of J1004 we show that this mass redistribution did not succeed at completely eliminating a dark mass clump recovered by GRALE near one of the quasar images.

 We report the discovery and characterization of three giant exoplanets orbiting solar-analog stars, detected by the \tess space mission and confirmed through ground-based photometry and radial velocity (RV) measurements taken at La Silla observatory with \textit{FEROS}. TOI-2373\,b is a warm Jupiter orbiting its host star every $\sim$ 13.3 days, and is one of the two most massive known exoplanet with a precisely determined mass and radius around a star similar to the Sun, with an estimated mass of m$_p$ = $9.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\,M_{\mathrm{jup}}$, and a radius of $r_p$ = $0.93^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\,R_{\mathrm{jup}}$. With a mean density of $\rho = 14.4^{+0.9}_{-1.0}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$, TOI-2373\,b is among the densest planets discovered so far. TOI-2416\,b orbits its host star on a moderately eccentric orbit with a period of $\sim$ 8.3 days and an eccentricity of $e$ = $0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. TOI-2416\,b is more massive than Jupiter with $m_p$ = 3.0$^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\,M_{\mathrm{jup}}$, however is significantly smaller with a radius of $r_p$ = $0.88^{+0.02}_{-0.02},R_{\mathrm{jup}}$, leading to a high mean density of $\rho = 5.4^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$. TOI-2524\,b is a warm Jupiter near the hot Jupiter transition region, orbiting its star every $\sim$ 7.2 days on a circular orbit. It is less massive than Jupiter with a mass of $m_p$ = $0.64^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\,M_{\mathrm{jup}}$, and is consistent with an inflated radius of $r_p$ = $1.00^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,R_{\mathrm{jup}}$, leading to a low mean density of $\rho = 0.79^{+0.08}_{-0.08}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$. The newly discovered exoplanets TOI-2373\,b, TOI-2416\,b, and TOI-2524\,b have estimated equilibrium temperatures of $860^{+10}_{-10}$ K, $1080^{+10}_{-10}$ K, and $1100^{+20}_{-20}$ K, respectively, placing them in the sparsely populated transition zone between hot and warm Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will revolutionize Time Domain Astronomy by detecting millions of transients. In particular, it is expected to increment the number of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) of a factor of 100 compared to existing samples up to z~1.2. Such a high number of events will dramatically reduce statistical uncertainties in the analysis of SNIa properties and rates. However, the impact of all other sources of uncertainty on the measurement must still be evaluated. The comprehension and reduction of such uncertainties will be fundamental both for cosmology and stellar evolution studies, as measuring the SNIa rate can put constraints on the evolutionary scenarios of different SNIa progenitors. We use simulated data from the DESC Data Challenge 2 (DC2) and LSST Data Preview 0 (DP0) to measure the SNIa rate on a 15 deg2 region of the Wide-Fast-Deep area. We select a sample of SN candidates detected on difference images, associate them to the host galaxy, and retrieve their photometric redshifts (z-phot). Then, we test different light curves classification methods, with and without redshift priors. We discuss how the distribution in redshift measured for the SN candidates changes according to the selected host galaxy and redshift estimate. We measure the SNIa rate analyzing the impact of uncertainties due to z-phot, host galaxy association and classification on the distribution in redshift of the starting sample. We found a 17% average lost fraction of SNIa with respect to the simulated sample. As 10% of the bias is due to the uncertainty on the z-phot alone (which also affects classification when used as a prior), it results to be the major source of uncertainty. We discuss possible reduction of the errors in the measurement of the SNIa rate, including synergies with other surveys, which may help using the rate to discriminate different progenitor models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a polarimetric study from our new high-sensitivity L-band (0.8--1.7 GHz) observation of Pictor A with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We confirm the presence of the radio jet extending from the nucleus to the western hotspot of this source. Additionally, we show the radio emission expected to be coincident with previously observed X-ray emission in the radio lobes, confirming that the emission mechanism is of inverse Compton origin, as suggested by a previous study. Our spectropolarimetric analysis using the RM-Synthesis technique reveals a relatively uniform mean RM distribution across the lobes of Pictor A, with most lines-of-sight exhibiting single-peaked Faraday spectra. However, a number of the lines-of-sight exhibit single peaked spectra with a wide base or multiple peaks, suggesting the presence of multiple Faraday components or a Faraday thick structure along Pictor A's lines-of-sight. We also confirm the asymmetry in RM variability and depolarization between the two lobes of this source which were reported in a previous study.
#### Testing approximate infrared scattering radiative-transfer methods for  hot Jupiter atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 The calculation of internal atmospheric (longwave) fluxes is a key component of any model of exoplanet atmospheres that requires radiative-transfer (RT) calculations. For atmospheres containing a strong scattering component such as cloud particles, most 1D multiple-scattering RT methods typically involve numerically expensive matrix inversions. This computational bottleneck is exacerbated when multitudes of RT calculations are required, such as in general circulation models (GCMs) and retrieval methods. In an effort to increase the speed of RT calculations without sacrificing too much accuracy, we investigate the applicability of approximate longwave scattering methods developed for the Earth science community to hot Jupiter atmospheres. We test the absorption approximation (AA) and variational iteration method (VIM) applied to typical cloudy hot Jupiter scenarios, using 64 stream DISORT calculations as reference solutions. We find the four-stream VIM variant is a highly promising method to explore using for hot Jupiter GCM and retrieval modelling, showing excellent speed characteristics, with typical errors $\sim$1\% for outgoing fluxes and within $\sim$50\%, but with larger errors in the deep cloud layer test case, for vertical heating rates. Other methods explored in this study were found to typically produce similar error characteristics in vertical heating rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise Doppler studies of extrasolar planets require fine-grained control of observational cadence, i.e. the timing of and spacing between observations. We present a novel framework for scheduling a set of Doppler campaigns with different cadence requirements at the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO). For a set of observing programs and allocated nights on an instrument, our software optimizes the timing and ordering of ~1000 observations within a given observing semester. We achieve a near-optimal solution in real-time using a hierarchical Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework. Our scheduling formulation optimizes over the roughly 10^3000 possible orderings. A top level optimization finds the most regular sequence of allocated nights by which to observe each host star in the request catalog based on a frequency specified in the request. A second optimization scheme minimizes the slews and downtime of the instrument. We have assessed our algorithms performance with simulated data and with the real suite of Doppler observations of the California Planet Search in 2023.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a recent Pantheon+SH0ES compilation of Type Ia Supernova distance measurements at low-redshift, i.e., $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.10$, in order to investigate the directional dependency of the deceleration parameter ($q_0$) in different patches ($60^{\circ}$ size) across the sky, as a probe of the statistical isotropy of the Universe. We adopt a cosmographic approach to compute the cosmological distances, fixing $H_0$ and $M_B$ to reference values provided by the collaboration. By looking at 500 different patches randomly taken across the sky, we find a maximum $\sim 3\sigma$ CL anisotropy level for $q_0$, whose direction points orthogonally to the CMB dipole axis, i.e., $(RA^{\rm SN},DEC^{\rm SN}) = (267^{\circ},6^{\circ})$ vs $(RA^{\rm CMB},DEC^{\rm CMB}) = (167^{\circ},-7^{\circ})$. We assessed the statistical significance of those results, finding that such a signal is expected due to the limitations of the observational sample. These results support that there is no significant evidence for a departure from the cosmic isotropy assumption, one of the pillars of the standard cosmological model.
