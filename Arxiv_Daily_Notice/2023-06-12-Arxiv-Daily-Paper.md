 - **Abstract**
 Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs can only be implemented successfully if proper work-life balance is possible in Heliophysics (and in STEM field in general). One of the core issues stems from the culture of "work-above-life" associated with mission concepts, development, and implementation but also the expectations that seem to originate from numerous announcements from NASA (and other agencies). The benefits of work-life balance are well documented; however, the entire system surrounding research in Heliophysics hinders or discourages proper work-life balance. For example, there does not seem to be attention paid by NASA Headquarters (HQ) on the timing of their announcements regarding how it will be perceived by researchers, and how the timing may promote a culture where work trumps personal life. The same is true for remarks by NASA HQ program officers during panels or informal discussions, where seemingly innocuous comments may give a perception that work is expected after "normal" work hours. In addition, we are calling for work-life balance plans and implementation to be one of the criteria used for down-selection and confirmation of missions (Key Decision Points: KDP-B, KDP-C).

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disk winds launched close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are a viable mechanism to provide feedback between the SMBH and the host galaxy. We aim to characterize the X-ray properties of the inner accretion disk wind of the nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) PG 1126-041, and to study its connection with the ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing wind. We perform spectroscopic analysis of eight XMM-Newton observations of PG 1126-041 taken between 2004 and 2015, using both phenomenological models and the most advanced accretion disk wind models available. For half of the dataset, we can compare the X-ray analysis results with the results of quasi-simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopic UV observations taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The X-ray spectra of PG 1126-041 are complex and absorbed by ionized material which is highly variable on multiple time scales, sometimes as short as 11 days. Accretion disk wind models can account for most of the X-ray spectral complexity of PG 1126-041, with the addition of massive clumps, represented by a partially covering absorber. Variations in column density ($N_H \sim 5-20 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) of the partially covering absorber drive the observed X-ray spectral variability of PG 1126-041. The absorption from the X-ray partially covering gas and from the blueshifted C IV troughs appear to vary in a coordinated way. The line of sight toward PG 1126-041 offers a privileged view through a highly dynamic nuclear wind originating on inner accretion disk scales, making the source a very promising candidate for future detailed studies of the physics of accretion disk winds around SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 To fully take advantage of the data provided by large-scale structure surveys, we need to quantify the potential impact of baryonic effects, such as feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation, on cosmological observables. In simulations, feedback processes originate on scales that remain unresolved. Therefore, they need to be sourced via subgrid models that contain free parameters. We use machine learning to calibrate the AGN and stellar feedback models for the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Using Gaussian process emulators trained on Latin hypercubes of 32 smaller-volume simulations, we model how the galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions change as a function of the subgrid parameters. The emulators are then fit to observational data, allowing for the inclusion of potential observational biases. We apply our method to the three different FLAMINGO resolutions, spanning a factor of 64 in particle mass, recovering the observed relations within the respective resolved mass ranges. We also use the emulators, which link changes in subgrid parameters to changes in observables, to find models that skirt or exceed the observationally allowed range for cluster gas fractions and the stellar mass function. Our method enables us to define model variations in terms of the data that they are calibrated to rather than the values of specific subgrid parameters. This approach is useful, because subgrid parameters are typically not directly linked to particular observables, and predictions for a specific observable are influenced by multiple subgrid parameters.
#### Investigating the Impact of Metallicity on Star Formation in the Outer  Galaxy. I. VLT/KMOS Survey of Young Stellar Objects in Canis Major

 - **Abstract**
 The effects of metallicity on the evolution of protoplanetary disks may be studied in the outer Galaxy where the metallicity is lower than in the solar neighbourhood. We present the VLT/KMOS integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared of $\sim$120 candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in the CMa-$\ell$224 star-forming region located at a Galactocentric distance of 9.1 kpc. We characterise the YSO accretion luminosities and accretion rates using the hydrogen Br$\gamma$ emission and find the median accretion luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm acc})} = -0.82^{+0.80}_{-0.82} L_\odot$. Based on the measured accretion luminosities, we investigate the hypothesis of star formation history in the CMa-$\ell$224. Their median values suggest that Cluster C, where most of YSO candidates have been identified, might be the most evolved part of the region. The accretion luminosities are similar to those observed toward low-mass YSOs in the Perseus and Orion molecular clouds, and do not reveal the impact of lower metallicity. Similar studies in other outer Galaxy clouds covering a wide range of metallicities are critical to gain a complete picture of star formation in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation scenario of the Magellanic Bridge during an encounter between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds $\sim200\,$Myr ago, as proposed by $N$-body models, would be imprinted in the chemical enrichment and kinematics of its stars, and sites of ongoing star formation along its extension. We present an analysis of 33 Bridge star clusters using photometry obtained with the SOAR 4-m telescope equipped with adaptive optics for the VISCACHA survey. We performed a membership selection and derived self-consistent ages, metallicities, distances and reddening values via statistical isochrone fitting, as well as tidal radii and integrated masses from structure analysis. Two groups are clearly detected: 13 well-studied clusters older than the Bridge, with $0.5-6.8\,$Gyr and $\rm{[Fe/H]}<-0.6\,$dex; and 15 clusters with $< 200\,$Myr and $\rm{[Fe/H]}>-0.5\,$dex, probably formed in-situ. The old clusters follow the overall age and metallicity gradients of the SMC, whereas the younger ones are uniformly distributed along the Bridge. The main results are as follows: $(i)$ we derive ages and metallicities for the first time for 9 and 18 clusters, respectively; $(ii)$ we detect two metallicity dips in the age-metallicity relation of the Bridge at $\sim 200\,$Myr and $1.5\,$Gyr ago for the first time, possibly chemical signatures of the formation of the Bridge and Magellanic Stream; $(iii)$ we estimate a minimum stellar mass for the Bridge of $3-5 \times 10^5\,M_\odot$; $(iv)$ we confirm that all the young Bridge clusters at $\rm{RA} < 3^h$ are metal-rich $\rm{[Fe/H]} \sim -0.4\,$dex.
#### Binning is Sinning: Redemption for Hubble Diagram using Photometrically  Classified Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) has been implemented in the BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework to produce a redshift-binned Hubble diagram (HD) for Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia). The BBC method corrects for selection effects and non-SNIa contamination, and systematic uncertainties are described by a covariance matrix with dimension matching the number of BBC redshift bins. For spectroscopically confirmed SNIa samples, a recent "Binning is Sinning" article (BHS21, arxiv:2012.05900) showed that an unbinned HD and covariance matrix reduces the systematic uncertainty by a factor of 1.5 compared to the binned approach. Here we extend their analysis to obtain an unbinned HD for a photometrically identified sample processed with BBC. To test this new method, we simulate and analyze 50 samples corresponding to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with a low-redshift anchor; the simulation includes SNe Ia, and contaminants from core collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia. The analysis includes systematic uncertainties for calibration, and measures the dark energy equation of state parameter (w). Compared to a redshift-binned HD, the unbinned HD with nearly 2,000 events results in a smaller systematic uncertainty, in qualitative agreement with BHS21, and averaging results among the 50 samples we find no evidence for bias in measured cosmological parameters. To reduce computation time for fitting an unbinned HD with large samples, we propose an HD-rebinning method that defines the HD in bins of redshift, color, and stretch; the rebinned HD results in similar uncertainty as the unbinned case, and shows no evidence for biased cosmology parameters.
#### SRG/eROSITA X-ray shadowing study of giant molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 SRG/eROSITA is situated in a halo orbit around L2 where the highly variable solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) emission from Earth's magnetosheath is expected to be negligible. The soft X-ray foreground emissions from the local hot bubble (LHB) and the remaining heliospheric SWCX emissions could be studied in unprecedented detail with eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) data in a 6-month cadence and better spectral resolution than ROSAT. We aim to use eRASS data of the sight lines towards three giant molecular clouds away from the Galactic plane to isolate and study the soft X-ray diffuse foreground emission. These X-ray shadows will serve as calibration baselines for the future three-dimensional structural study of the LHB. We conducted spectral analysis on the diffuse X-ray spectra of these clouds from the first four eRASSs to estimate and separate the heliospheric SWCX contribution from the LHB emission. We find the density of the LHB to be independent of the sight line with $n_e \sim 4 \times 10^{-3}\,$cm$^{-3}$, but not the temperature. We report a lower temperature of $kT_{\mathrm{LHB}}=0.084\pm0.004\,$keV towards Chamaeleon$~$II & III (Cha$~$II & III) than Ophiuchus (Oph) and Corona Australis (CrA), in which we measured $0.102\pm0.006$ and $0.112\pm0.009\,$keV, respectively. We measured the emission measure of the LHB to be $\sim 2\times10^{-3}\,$cm$^{-6}\,$pc at medium Galactic latitudes ($|b| \sim 20^{\circ}$). A monotonic increase in the SWCX contribution has been observed since the start of 2020, coincidental with the beginning of solar cycle 25. For Oph, SWCX has dominated the LHB in the $0.3$-$0.7\,$keV band intensity since eRASS2. We observed lower SWCX contributions in Cha$~$II & III and CrA, consistent with the expected decreasing solar wind ion density at high heliographic latitudes.
#### Numerical simulations of relativistic jets

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we review recent and ongoing work by our group on numerical simulations of relativistic jets. Relativistic outflows in Astrophysics are related to dilute, high energy plasmas, with physical conditions out of the reach of current laboratory capabilities. Simulations are thus imperative for the study of these objects. We present a number of such scenarios that have been studied by our group at the Universitat de Val\`encia. In particular, we have focused on the evolution of extragalactic outflows through galactic and intergalactic environments, deceleration by interaction with stars or clouds, or the propagation of jets in X-ray binaries and interaction with stellar winds from massive companions. All also share their role as particle acceleration sites and production of non-thermal radiation throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, our work is not only aimed to understand the impact of outflows on their environments and thus their role in galaxy and cluster evolution, but also the nature and capabilities of these sites as generators of high and very-high energy radiation and cosmic rays.
#### Ohmic dissipation during the formation of super-Earth

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earth population, as one of the representatives of exoplanets, plays an important role in constraining the planet formation theories. According to the prediction from core-accretion models, super-Earths should be rare because their masses are in the range of the critical mass above which they would grow to be gas giants by runaway gas accretion. In this work, we investigate the effect of ohmic dissipation on the planetary thermal structure and cooling contraction as planets accrete gas from their surrounding disks. We find that the extra heating energy from Ohmic heating deposited into planetary envelopes can push the planetary radiative-convective boundaries inward and prevent the planets from cooling, and can even halt accretion. We explore parameter space to study the dependence of cooling timescale on the input parameters of the ohmic-dissipation model. Numerical results show that gas accretion can be halted before runaway gas accretion and the envelope mass is only several percent of planetary core mass for some parameter sets. Our results suggest that ohmic dissipation is a potential mechanism to delay the gas accretion and promote the formation of super-Earths. Future observations may help to constrain the importance of ohmic dissipation on the super-Earth formation.
#### Redeveloping a CLEAN Deconvolution Algorithm for Scatter-Broadened Radio  Pulsar Signals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06046
 - **Abstract**
 Broadband radio waves emitted from pulsars are distorted and delayed as they propagate toward the Earth due to interactions with the free electrons that compose the interstellar medium, with lower radio frequencies being more impacted than higher frequencies. Multipath propagation in the interstellar medium results in both later times of arrival for the lower frequencies and causes the observed pulse to arrive with a broadened tail described via the pulse broadening function. We employ the CLEAN deconvolution technique to recover both the intrinsic pulse shape and pulse broadening function. This work expands upon previous descriptions of CLEAN deconvolution used in pulse broadening analyses by parameterizing the efficacy on simulated data and developing a suite of tests to establish which of a set of figures of merit lead to an automatic and consistent determination of the scattering timescale and its uncertainty. We compare our algorithm to simulations performed on cyclic spectroscopy estimates of the scattering timescale. We test our improved algorithm on the highly scattered millisecond pulsar J1903+0327, showing the scattering timescale to change over years, consistent with estimates of the refractive timescale of the pulsar.
#### Ion-Driven Instabilities in the Inner Heliosphere II: Classification and  Multi-Dimensional Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Linear theory is a well developed framework for characterizing instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind. In the previous instalment of this series, we analyzed ~1.5M proton and alpha particle Velocity Distribution Functions (VDFs) observed by Helios I and II to determine the statistical properties of the standard instability parameters such as the growth rate, frequency, the direction of wave propagation, and the power emitted or absorbed by each component, as well as to characterize their behavior with respect to the distance from the Sun and collisional processing. In this work, we use this comprehensive set of instability calculations to train a Machine Learning algorithm consisting of three interlaced components that: 1) predict if an interval is unstable from observed VDF parameters; 2) predict the instability properties for a given unstable VDF; and 3) classify the type of the unstable mode. We use these methods to map the properties in multi-dimensional phase space to find that the parallel-propagating, proton-core-induced Ion Cyclotron mode dominates the young solar wind, while the oblique Fast Magnetosonic mode regulates the proton beam drift in the collisionally old plasma.
