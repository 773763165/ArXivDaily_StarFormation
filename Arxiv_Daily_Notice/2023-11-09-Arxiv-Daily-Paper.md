 - **Abstract**
 Debris discs are our best means to probe the outer regions of planetary systems. Many studies assume that planets lie at the inner edges of debris discs, akin to Neptune and the Kuiper Belt, and use the disc morphologies to constrain those otherwise-undetectable planets. However, this produces a degeneracy in planet mass and semimajor axis. We investigate the effect of a sculpting planet on the radial surface-density profile at the disc inner edge, and show that this degeneracy can be broken by considering the steepness of the edge profile. Like previous studies, we show that a planet on a circular orbit ejects unstable debris and excites surviving material through mean-motion resonances. For a non-migrating, circular-orbit planet, in the case where collisions are negligible, the steepness of the disc inner edge depends on the planet-to-star mass ratio and the initial-disc excitation level. We provide a simple analytic model to infer planet properties from the steepness of ALMA-resolved disc edges. We also perform a collisional analysis, showing that a purely planet-sculpted disc would be distinguishable from a purely collisional disc and that, whilst collisions flatten planet-sculpted edges, they are unlikely to fully erase a planet's signature. Finally, we apply our results to ALMA-resolved debris discs and show that, whilst many inner edges are too steep to be explained by collisions alone, they are too flat to arise through completed sculpting by non-migrating, circular-orbit planets. We discuss implications of this for the architectures, histories and dynamics in the outer regions of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Occultations provide indirect sensitivity to the number density of small Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) too faint to directly detect telescopically. We present results from the Caltech HI-speed Multicolor camERA (CHIMERA) survey with the Palomar Hale Telescope, which monitored stars over the central 5'x5' of the M22 globular cluster along the ecliptic plane for serendipitous occultations by kilometer-scale KBOs over 63 hr across 24 nights at a 33 Hz frame rate simultaneously in i' and g'. We adapted dense-field photometry and occultation template fitting techniques to this dataset, finding a 95% confidence upper limit on the occultation rate corresponding to an ecliptic sky density of <10^7 deg^-2 of >1 km diameter classical KBOs. We discuss a few of the occultation-like light curve signatures at the edge of the sensitivity limit responsible for setting the upper bounds, and their likely nonviability as true occultations.
#### Uniform Forward-Modeling Analysis of Ultracool Dwarfs. III. Late-M and L  Dwarfs in Young Moving Groups, the Pleiades, and the Hyades

 - **Abstract**
 We present a uniform forward-modeling analysis of 90 late-M and L dwarfs in nearby young (~$10-200$ Myr) moving groups, the Pleiades, and the Hyades using low-resolution ($R\approx150$) near-infrared ($0.9-2.4$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$) spectra and the BT-Settl model atmospheres. We derive the objects' effective temperatures, surface gravities, radii, and masses by comparing our spectra to the models using a Bayesian framework with nested sampling and calculate the same parameters using evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, our spectroscopically inferred parameters from BT-Settl exhibit two types of systematic behavior for objects near the M-L spectral type boundary. Several are clustered around $T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 1800$ K and $\log g\approx5.5$ dex, implying impossibly large masses ($150-1400$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$), while others are clustered around $T_\mathrm{eff}\gtrsim3000$ K and $\log g\lesssim3.0$ dex, implying non-physical low masses and unreasonably young ages. We find the fitted BT-Settl model spectra tend to overpredict the peak $J$ and $H$-band flux for objects located near the M-L boundary, suggesting the dust content included in the model atmospheres is insufficient to match the observations. By adding an interstellar medium-like reddening law to the BT-Settl model spectra, we find the fits between models and observed spectra are greatly improved, with the largest reddening coefficients occurring at the M-L transition. This work delivers a systematic examination of the BT-Settl model atmospheres and constitutes the largest spectral analysis of benchmark late-M and L-type brown dwarfs to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The astronomical community is grappling with the increasing volume and complexity of data produced by modern telescopes, due to difficulties in reducing, accessing, analyzing, and combining archives of data. To address this challenge, we propose the establishment of a coordinating body, an "entity," with the specific mission of enhancing the interoperability, archiving, distribution, and production of both astronomical data and software. This report is the culmination of a workshop held in February 2023 on the Future of Astronomical Data Infrastructure. Attended by 70 scientists and software professionals from ground-based and space-based missions and archives spanning the entire spectrum of astronomical research, the group deliberated on the prevailing state of software and data infrastructure in astronomy, identified pressing issues, and explored potential solutions. In this report, we describe the ecosystem of astronomical data, its existing flaws, and the many gaps, duplication, inconsistencies, barriers to access, drags on productivity, missed opportunities, and risks to the long-term integrity of essential data sets. We also highlight the successes and failures in a set of deep dives into several different illustrative components of the ecosystem, included as an appendix.
#### A Pathway for Collisional Planetesimal Growth in the Ice-Dominant  Regions of Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 We present a semi-analytic model for the growth, drift, desorption, and fragmentation of millimeter- to meter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks. Fragmentation occurs where particle collision velocities exceed critical fragmentation velocities. Using this criterion, we produce fragmentation regions in disk orbital radius-particle size phase space for particles with a range of material properties, structures, and compositions (including SiO$_2$, Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO). For reasonable disk conditions, compact aggregate H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ice particles do not reach destructive relative velocities and are thus not likely to undergo collisional fragmentation. Uncoated silicate particles are more susceptible to collisional destruction and are expected to fragment in the inner disk, consistent with previous work. We then calculate the growth, drift, and sublimation of small particles, initially located in the outer disk. We find that ice-coated particles can avoid fragmentation as they grow and drift inward under a substantial range of disk conditions as long as the particles are aggregates composed of 0.1 $\mu$m-sized monomers. Such particles may undergo runaway growth in disk regions abundant in H$_2$O or CO$_2$ ice depending on the assumed disk temperature structure. These results indicate that icy collisional growth to planetesimally-relevant sizes may happen efficiently throughout a disk's lifetime, and is particularly robust at early times when the disk's dust-to-gas ratio is comparable to that of the interstellar medium.
#### Variety of disk wind-driven explosions in massive rotating stars

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a set of two-dimensional, non-relativistic, hydrodynamics simulations for supernova-like explosion associated with stellar core collapse of rotating massive stars to a system of a black hole and a disk connected by the transfer of matter and angular momentum. Our model of the central engine also includes the contribution of the disk wind. In this work, we specifically investigate the wind-driven explosion of rotating, large-mass progenitor stars with the zero-age main-sequence mass of $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=20\,M_\odot$ from arXiv:2008.09132 . This study is carried out using the open-source hydrodynamic code Athena++, for which we implement a method to calculate self-gravity for axially symmetric density distributions. We, then, investigate the explosion properties and the $^{56}$Ni production as a function of (varying) some features of the wind injection. We find a large variety of explosion energy with $E_\mathrm{expl}$ ranging from $\sim 0.049\times10^{51}$~erg to $\sim 34\times10^{51}$~erg and ejecta mass $M_\mathrm{ej}$ from 0.58 to 6 $M_\odot$, which shows a bimodal distribution in high- and low-energy branches. We demonstrate that the resulting outcome of a highly- or sub-energetic explosion for a certain stellar structure is mainly determined by the competition between the ram pressure of the injected matter and that of the infalling envelope. In the nucleosynthesis analysis the $^{56}$Ni mass produced in our models goes from $< 0.2~M_\odot$ in the sub-energetic explosions to $2.1~M_\odot$ in the highly-energetic ones. These results are consistent with the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy SNe such as broad-lined type Ic SNe. However, we find a tighter correlation between the explosion energy and the ejecta mass than that observationally measured.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this work is to create a complete list of sources exhibiting a long secondary period (LSP) in the ASAS-SN catalog of variable stars, and analyze the properties of this sample compared to other long period variables without LSP. We use the period-amplitude diagram to identify the 55572 stars showing an LSP, corresponding to 27% of the pulsating red giants in the catalog. We use the astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and the spectroscopic data provided by the APOGEE, GALAH, and RAVE surveys to investigate the statistical properties of the sample. We find that stars displaying an LSP have a spatial distribution that is more dispersed than the non-LSP giants, suggesting that they belong to an older population. Spectroscopically-derived ages seem to confirm this. The stars with an LSP also appear to be different in terms of C/O ratio from their non-LSP counterparts.
#### Eccentricity dynamics of wide binaries -- II. The effect of stellar  encounters and constraints on formation channels

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04352
 - **Abstract**
 GAIA wide stellar binaries (semimajor axes $\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{AU}$) have a superthermal eccentricity distribution function (DF), well-fit by $P(e) \propto e^\alpha$ with $\alpha \sim 1.2$. In Paper I, we proved that this DF cannot have been produced by Galactic tidal torques starting from any realistic DF that was not already superthermal. Here, we consider the other major dynamical effect on wide binaries: encounters with passing stars. We derive and solve the Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of binaries in semimajor axis and eccentricity under many weak, impulsive, penetrative stellar encounters. We show analytically that these encounters drive the eccentricity DF towards thermal on the same timescale as they drive the semimajor axes $a$ towards ionization, $t_\mathrm{ion} \sim 4\,\mathrm{Gyr}\,(a/10^4\,\mathrm{AU})^{-1}$. We conclude that the observed superthermal DF must derive from an even more superthermal (i.e. higher $\alpha$) birth distribution. This requirement rules out the possibility that most wide binaries are formed via e.g. the dissolution of stellar clusters, and instead favors a turbulent fragmentation scenario. A testable prediction of our theory is that $\alpha$ should be a monotonically decreasing function of binary age.
#### The formation of wide-orbit giant planets in protoplanetary disks with a  decreasing pebble flux

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of distant protoplanets could explain the observed gaps in dust emission in protoplanetary disks. Here we derive a novel analytical model to describe the temporal decay of the pebble flux through a protoplanetary disk as a result of radial drift. This allows us to investigate the growth and migration of distant protoplanets throughout the lifespan of the disk. We find that early-formed Moon-mass protoplanets can grow to their pebble isolation mass between approximately $20$ and $80\,M_{\oplus}$ within less than $1\,\mathrm{Myr}$ in the $20$ to $80\,\mathrm{AU}$ region around solar-like stars. Subsequent fast migration at the early stages of gas accretion after pebble accretion has been halted nevertheless transports these giant planets into final orbits at $<\,$$10\,\mathrm{AU}$. However, our pebble decay model allows us to include a new pathway which can trigger the transition from pebble accretion to gas accretion after the pebble flux has decayed substantially. With this pebble decay pathway, we show that it is possible to form gas giants also beyond $10\,\mathrm{AU}$. The occurrence of these wide-orbit gas giants should be relatively low, since their core must attain sufficient mass to accrete gas before the pebble flux decays while avoiding excessive migration. Since these gas giants do not reach the pebble isolation mass, their heavy element content is typically less than $10\,M_{\oplus}$. Our results imply that the observed gaps in protoplanetary disks could be caused by distant protoplanets that reached the pebble isolation mass and then migrated, while gas giants in wide orbits, such as PDS 70 b and c, accreted their gas after the decay in the pebble flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) is a multi-purpose experimental technique aimed at enhancing the science return of planetary missions. The technique exploits the science payload and spacecraft service systems without requiring a dedicated onboard instrumentation or imposing on the existing instrumentation any special for PRIDE requirements. PRIDE is based on the near-field phase-referencing Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and evaluation of the Doppler shift of the radio signal transmitted by spacecraft by observing it with multiple Earth-based radio telescopes. The methodology of PRIDE has been developed initially at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE) for tracking the ESA's Huygens Probe during its descent in the atmosphere of Titan in 2005. From that point on, the technique has been demonstrated for various planetary and other space science missions. The estimates of lateral position of the target spacecraft are done using the phase-referencing VLBI technique. Together with radial Doppler estimates, these observables can be used for a variety of applications, including improving the knowledge of the spacecraft state vector. The PRIDE measurements can be applied to a broad scope of research fields including studies of atmospheres through the use of radio occultations, the improvement of planetary and satellite ephemerides, as well as gravity field parameters and other geodetic properties of interest, and estimations of interplanetary plasma properties. This paper presents the implementation of PRIDE as a component of the ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission.
#### Chandra's insight into SN 2023ixf

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04384
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04384
 - **Abstract**
 We report Chandra-ACIS observations of SN 2023ixf in M101 on day 13 and 86 since the explosion. The X-ray emission in both epochs are characterized by a high temperature plasma from the forward shocked region as a result of circumstellar interaction. We are able to constrain the absorption column density at both the Chandra epochs. The column density is much larger than that of the Galactic absorption column, and we attribute it to absorption by circumstellar matter. Combining this with the NuSTAR published measurement on day 4, we show that the column density declines as $t^{-2}$ between day 4 to day 13 and then evolves as $t^{-1}$. The unabsorbed $0.3-10$ keV luminosity also evolves as $t^{-1}$ during the Chandra epochs. At the first Chandra epoch we detect the Fe K-$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV indicating presence of cold material in the vicinity of the SN. The line is absent on day 86, consistent with the decreased column density by a factor of 7 between the two epochs. Our analysis indicates that during 10 years to 1.5 years before explosion, the progenitor was evolving with a constant mass-loss rate of $5.6\times 10^{-4}$ $M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$. The X-ray measurements indicate asymmetry in the CSM.
#### Quark confinement in an equiparticle quark model: application to stellar  matter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04393
 - **Abstract**
 We perform an improvement in a thermodynamical consistent model with density dependent quark masses ($m'_{u,d,s}$) by introducing effects of quark confinement/deconfinement phase transition, at high density regime and zero temperature, by means of the traced Polyakov loop ($\Phi$). We use realistic values for the current quark masses, provided by the Particle Data Group, and replace the constants of the interacting part of $m'_{u,d,s}$ by functions of $\Phi$, leading to a first order phase transition structure, for symmetric and stellar quark matter, with $\Phi$ being the order parameter. We show that the improved model points out the direction of the chiral symmetry restoration due to the emergence of a deconfined phase. In another application, we construct quark stars mass-radius profiles, obtained from this new model, and show to be possible to satisfy recent astrophysical observational data coming from the LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, and the NICER mission concerning the millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620.
#### Determinação da Distância à Grande Nuvem de Magalhães  Através das Estrelas Variáveis Cefeidas Disponíveis no Catálogo  OGLE-IV

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we discuss the determination of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the Leavitt Law, utilizing the public catalog of Classical Cepheid Variable stars from the observational project OGLE-IV (The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment Collection of Variable Stars), consisting of 4709 stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. To determine the pulsation period of Cepheid Variable stars, we employ the computational algorithm \textit{Lomb-Scargle periodogram} modified for our data. Additionally, with the calculation of the period, we can derive a period-luminosity relation for Cepheid Variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud and, using an independent calibration distance, deduce their distance moduli. We also discuss some general theoretical concepts of the physical mechanism behind the oscillation of variable stars.
#### Glitching pulsars as gravitational wave sources

 - **Abstract**
 Spinning neutron stars, when observed as pulsars, are seen to undergo occasional spin-up events known as glitches. Despite several decades of study, the physical mechanisms responsible for glitches are still not well understood, but probably involve an interplay between the star's outer elastic crust, and the superfluid and superconducting core that lies within. Glitches will be accompanied by some level of gravitational wave emission. In this article, we review and critique proposed models that link gravitational wave emission to glitches, exploring both short duration burst-like emission, and longer-lived signals. We illustrate how detections (and in some cases, non-detections) of gravitational signals probe both the glitch mechanism, and, by extension, the behaviour of matter at high densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Cir X-1 is a neutron star X-ray binary characterized by strong variations in flux during its eccentric $\sim$16.6 days orbit. There are also strong variations in the spectral state, and historically it has shown both atoll and Z state properties. We observed the source with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer during two orbital segments, 6 days apart, for a total of 263~ks. We find an X-ray polarization degree in these segments of $1.6\%\pm0.3\%$ and $1.4\%\pm0.3\%$ at polarization angles of $37^\circ\pm5^\circ$ and $-12^\circ\pm7^\circ$, respectively. Thus we observed a rotation of the polarization angle by $49^\circ\pm8^\circ$ along the orbit. Because variations of accretion flow, and then of the hardness ratio, are expected during the orbit, we also studied the polarization binned in hardness ratio, and found the polarization angle differing by $67^\circ\pm11^\circ$ between the lowest and highest values of the hardness ratio. We discuss possible interpretations of this result that could indicate a possible misalignment between the symmetry axes of the accretion disk and the Comptonizing region caused by the misalignment of the neutron star's angular momentum with respect to the orbital one.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the ever-growing number of exoplanets discovered and the extensive analyses carried out to find their potential satellites, only two exomoon candidates, Kepler-1625b-i and Kepler-1708 b-i, have been discovered to date. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in the development of algorithms for modelling, searching, and detecting exomoons in exoplanetary light curves. In this work, we incorporate moon handling capabilities into the state-of-the-art and publicly available code, the Transit and Light Curve Modeller (TLCM). The code is designed for the analysis of transiting exoplanet systems with the inclusion of a wavelet-based noise handling algorithm. Here we present an updated version of TLCM that is capable of modelling a coplanar planet-moon system on an elliptical orbit around its host, accounting for mutual eclipses between the two bodies (and neglecting perturbative effects) -- a so-called photodynamic model. The key benefit of this framework is the ability for a joint analysis of multiple planet-moon transits. We demonstrate the necessity of this software on a case study of Kepler-1625b. Similarly to prior works, we conclude that there is no firm evidence of an exomoon in that system, by showing that temporally correlated noise can mimic apparent lunar transits.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered super-Earth LP 890-9 c is an intriguing target for atmospheric studies as it transits a nearby, low-activity late-type M-dwarf star at the inner edge of the Habitable Zone. Its position at the runaway greenhouse limit makes it a natural laboratory to study the climate evolution of hot rocky planets. We present the first 3D-GCM exo-Venus model for a modern Venus-like atmosphere (92 bar surface pressure, realistic composition, H$_2$SO$_4$ radiatively-active clouds), applied to the tidally-locked LP 890-9c to inform observations by JWST and future instruments. If LP 890-9 c has developed into a modern exo-Venus, then the modelled temperatures suggest that H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds are possible even in the substellar region. Like on modern Venus, clouds on LP 890-9 c would create a flat spectrum. The strongest CO$_2$ bands in transmission predicted by our model for LP 890-9 c are about 10 ppm, challenging detection, given JWST estimated noise floor. Estimated phase curve amplitudes are 0.9 and 2.4 ppm for continuum and CO$_2$ bands, respectively. While pointing out the challenge to characterise modern exo-Venus analogues, these results provide new insights for JWST proposals and highlight the influence of clouds in the spectrum of hot rocky exoplanet spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Ongoing observing projects like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future missions offer the chance to characterize Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby, M-dwarfs are preferred targets for transit observations, for example, due to their favorable planet-star contrast ratio. However, the radiation and particle environment of these cool stars could be far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus, knowing the stellar radiation and particle environment and its possible influence on detectable biosignatures - particularly signs of life like ozone and methane - is crucial to understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the help of our unique model suite INCREASE, we investigate the impact of a strong stellar energetic particle event on the atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit spectra for six scenarios are simulated. We find that a Carrington-like event drastically increases atmospheric ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and spectral transmission features: all scenarios show high event-induced amounts of nitrogen dioxide (i.e., at 6.2 $\mu$m), a reduction of the atmospheric transit depth in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5 -- 7.0 $\mu$m), a decrease of the methane bands (i.e., at 3.0 -- 3.5 $\mu$m), and depletion of ozone (i.e., at $\sim$ 9.6 $\mu$m). Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle effects to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g., ozone and methane. We further show that the nitric acid feature at 11.0 - 12.0 $\mu$m, discussed as a proxy for stellar particle contamination, is absent in wet-dead atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Some He-rich hot subdwarf stars (He-sdOBs) present high abundances of trans-iron elements, such as Sr, Y, Zr and Pb. Diffusion processes are important in hot subdwarf stars, and it is thought that the high abundances of heavy elements in these stars are due to the action of radiative levitation. However, during the formation of He-sdOBs, hydrogen can be ingested into the convective zone driven by the He-core flash. It is known that episodes in which protons are being ingested into He-burning convective zones can lead to neutron-capture processes and the formation of heavy elements. In this work we aim to explore for the first time if neutron-capture processes can occur in late He-core flashes happening in the cores of the progenitors of He-sdOBs. We compute a detailed evolutionary model of a stripped red-giant star with a stellar evolution code with a nuclear network comprising 32 isotopes. Then we post-process the stellar models in the phase of He and H burning with a post-processing nucleosynthesis code with a nuclear network of 1190 species that allows us to follow the neutron-capture processes in detail. We find the occurrence of neutron-capture processes in our model, with neutron densities reaching a value of $\sim5\times10^{12}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We find that the trans-iron elements are enhanced in the surface by 1 to 2 dex as compared to initial compositions. Moreover, the relative abundance pattern $[{\rm X}_i/\rm{Fe}]$ produced by neutron-capture processes closely resembles those observed in some He-sdOBs, hinting at a possible self-synthesized origin of the heavy elements in these stars. We conclude that intermediate neutron-capture processes can occur during a proton ingestion event in the He-core flash of stripped red-giant stars. This mechanism offers a natural channel to produce the heavy elements observed in some of the He-sdOBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) has recently become operational at the Devasthal Observatory of ARIES, Nainital, India. The ILMT observes in the Time delay integration (TDI) mode where the images are formed by electronically stepping the charges over the pixels of the CCD, along a column. Observations near the zenith impose certain constraints dependent on the latitude such as image deformation due to the star-trail curvature and differential speed. These effects make the stellar trajectories in the focal plane of the ILMT to be hyperbolic, which are corrected for by the introduction of a TDI optical corrector, designed specifically for the ILMT. Here, we report the first results on the effect of this corrector on the trajectories followed by the stars in the ILMT focal plane. Astrometrically calibrating nine nights of data recorded with the ILMT during its first commissioning phase, we find simple (nearly linear) relations between the CCD-y coordinate and the right ascension (RA) of stars and between the CCD-x coordinate and their declination (DEC), respectively, which confirms that the TDI corrector works very fine in converting the stellar trajectories into straight lines.

 - **Abstract**
 The 4m International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) continuously scans a 22$'$ wide strip of the zenithal sky and records the images in three broadband filters (g', r' and i') using a 4K$\times$4K CCD camera. In about 10--12 hours of observations during a single night, $\sim$15 GB of data volume is generated. The raw images resulting from the observations in October--November 2022 have been pre-processed and astrometrically calibrated. In order to exploit the scientific capabilities of the ILMT survey data by the larger scientific community, we are disseminating the raw data (along with dark and flat fields) and the astrometrically calibrated data. These data sets can be downloaded by the users to conduct the scientific projects of their interest. In future, the data will be processed in near real-time and will be available via the ARIES data archive portal.

 - **Abstract**
 A very unique strength of the Devasthal Observatory is its capability of detecting optical transients with the 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) and to rapidly follow them up using the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) and/or the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), installed right next to it. In this context, we have inspected 20 fields observed during 9 consecutive nights in October-November 2022 during the first commissioning phase of the ILMT. Each of these fields has an angular extent of $22^\prime$ in declination by $9 \times 22^\prime$ in right ascension. Combining both a visual search for optical transients and an automatic search for these using an image subtraction technique (see the ILMT poster paper by Pranshu et al.), we report a total of 232 significant transient candidates. After consulting the Minor Planet Center database of asteroids, we could identify among these 219 positions of known asteroids brighter than $V=22$. These correspond to the confirmed positions of 78 distinct known asteroids. Analysis of the remaining CCD frames covering 19 more fields (out of 20) should lead to an impressive number of asteroids observed in only 9 nights. The conclusion is that in order to detect and characterize new supernovae, micro-lensing events, highly variable stars, multiply imaged quasars, etc. among the ILMT optical transients, we shall first have to identify all known and new asteroids. Thanks to its large diameter and short focal length (f/D $\sim$ 2.4), the ILMT turns out to be an excellent asteroid hunter.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the current expansion rate of the Universe, $H_0$, using standard candles, disagree with those derived from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This discrepancy, known as the \emph{Hubble tension}, is substantial and suggests the possibility of revisions to the standard cosmological model (Cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter - LCDM). Dynamic dark energy (DE) models that introduce deviations in the expansion history relative to LCDM could potentially explain this tension. We used Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data to test a dynamic DE model consisting of an equation of state that varies linearly with the cosmological scale factor $a$. To evaluate this model, we developed a new statistic (the \ta\ statistic) used in conjunction with an optimization code that minimizes its value to obtain model parameters. The \ta\ statistic reduces bias errors (in comparison to the $\chi^2$ statistic) because it retains the sign of the residuals, which is meaningful in testing the dynamic DE model as the deviations in the expansion history introduced by this model act asymmetrically in redshift space. The DE model fits the SNe data reasonably well, but the available SNe data lacks the statistical power to discriminate between LCDM and alternative models. To further assess the model using CMB data, we computed the distance to the last scattering surface and compared the results with that derived from the \emph{Planck} observations. Although the simple dynamic DE model tested does not completely resolve the tension, it is not ruled out by the data and could still play a role alongside other physical effects.

 - **Abstract**
 To better understand the mixing and mass loss experienced by low-mass stars as they ascend the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), I have gathered from the literature the abundances of CNO and s-process elements in post-AGB stars in Galactic globular clusters. These species are mixed to the surface during third dredge-up (3DU) events, so their abundance should increase as the star ascends the AGB. Of the 17 stars in this sample, CNO abundances are available for 11. Of these, four are enhanced in CNO relative to the RGB stars from which they descended, which I take as evidence of 3DU on the AGB. The enhancement is mainly in the form of carbon. Of the six stars for which only heavy-element abundances are available, one shows s-process enhancements that previous authors have interpreted as evidence of 3DU. Combining these 17 stars with other recent samples reveals that most globular-cluster post-AGB stars have luminosities log (L/L_sun) ~ 3.25. They are the progeny of blue horizontal-branch (HB) stars in clusters with intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5). A second group consists of sub-luminous stars associated with high-metallicity clusters ([Fe/H] ~ -1.0) with red HBs. They may be burning helium, rather than hydrogen. A third group of hot, super-luminous stars is evolving quickly across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Some of them may be merger remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale gaseous shocks in the bulge of M31 can be naturally explained by a rotating stellar bar. We use gas dynamical models to provide an independent measurement of the bar pattern speed in M31. The gravitational potentials of our simulations are from a set of made-to-measure models constrained by stellar photometry and kinematics. If the inclination of the gas disk is fixed at $i = 77^{\circ}$, we find that a low pattern speed of $16-20\;\rm km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}$ is needed to match the observed position and amplitude of the shock features, as shock positions are too close to the bar major axis in high $\Omega_{b}$ models. The pattern speed can increase to $20-30\;\rm km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}$ if the inner gas disk has a slightly smaller inclination angle compared with the outer one. Including sub-grid physics such as star formation and stellar feedback has minor effects on the shock amplitude, and does not change the shock position significantly. If the inner gas disk is allowed to follow a varying inclination similar to the HI and ionized gas observations, the gas models with a pattern speed of $38\;\rm km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}$, which is consistent with stellar-dynamical models, can match both the shock features and the central gas features.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, early classification of photometric alerts from wide-field and high-cadence surveys is a necessity to trigger spectroscopic follow-ups. These classifications are expected to play a key role in identifying potential candidates that might have a corresponding gravitational wave (GW) signature. Machine learning classifiers using features from parametric fitting of light curves are widely deployed by broker software to analyze millions of alerts, but most of these algorithms require as many points in the filter as the number of parameters to produce the fit, which increases the chances of missing a short transient. Moreover, the classifiers are not able to account for the uncertainty in the fits when producing the final score. In this context, we present a novel classification strategy that incorporates data-driven priors for extracting a joint posterior distribution of fit parameters and hence obtaining a distribution of classification scores. We train and test a classifier to identify kilonovae events which originate from binary neutron star mergers or neutron star black hole mergers, among simulations for the Zwicky Transient Facility observations with 19 other non-kilonovae-type events. We demonstrate that our method can estimate the uncertainty of misclassification, and the mean of the distribution of classification scores as point estimate obtains an AUC score of 0.96 on simulated data. We further show that using this method we can process the entire alert steam in real-time and bring down the sample of probable events to a scale where they can be analyzed by domain experts.

 HEX-P is a probe-class mission concept that will combine high spatial resolution X-ray imaging (<10" FWHM) and broad spectral coverage (0.2-80 keV) with an effective area far superior to current facilities (including XMM-Newton and NuSTAR) to enable revolutionary new insights into a variety of important astrophysical problems. With the recent discoveries of over 40 ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources (detected above 100 TeV) and neutrino emission in the Galactic Plane, we have entered a new era of multi-messenger astrophysics facing the exciting reality of Galactic PeVatrons. In the next decade, as more Galactic PeVatrons and TeV gamma-ray sources are expected to be discovered, the identification of their acceleration and emission mechanisms will be the most pressing issue in both particle and high-energy astrophysics. In this paper, along with its companion papers (Reynolds et al. 2023, Mori et al. 2023), we will present that HEX-P is uniquely suited to address important problems in various cosmic-ray accelerators, including Galactic PeVatrons, through investigating synchrotron X-ray emission of TeV-PeV electrons produced by both leptonic and hadronic processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.

 - **Abstract**
 The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is working to develop kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) that can meet the sensitivity targets of a far-infrared spectrometer on a cryogenically cooled space telescope. An important ingredient for achieving high sensitivity is increasing the fractional-frequency responsivity. Here we present a study of the responsivity of aluminum KIDs fabricated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Specifically, we model the KID's temporal response to pair-breaking excitations in the framework of the Mattis-Bardeen theory, incorporating quasiparticle recombination dynamics and the pair-breaking efficiency. Using a near-IR laser, we measure time-resolved photon pulses and fit them to our model, extracting the time-resolved quasiparticle density and the quasiparticle recombination lifetime. Comparing the fit to the known energy of the laser provides a measurement of the pair-breaking efficiency. In addition to photon-sourced excitations, it is important to understand the KID's response to phonon-sourced excitations from cosmic rays. We measure the rate of secondary cosmic rays detected by our devices, and predict the dead time due to cosmic rays for an array in L2 orbit. This work provides confidence in KIDs' robustness to cosmic ray events in the space environment.
#### A Possible Correlation between Metallicity and Near-IR Color for Late-M  and L Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the relationship between metallicity and $J-K$ color for 64 benchmark late-M and L dwarfs, all of which are wide companions to higher mass stars, and 6 of which are new discoveries. We assess the correlation between the $\Delta(J-K)$ color anomaly (the difference of an object's $J-K$ color with the median color for field objects of the same spectral type) and the host star metallicity to investigate how metallicity affects ultracool photospheres. Using Spearman's rank correlation test and Student's t test, the late-M dwarf (L dwarf) sample's $\Delta(J-K)$ and metallicity show a positive correlation with 95\% (90\%) confidence level. A linear fit to color anomaly as a function of metallicity finds a slope of $0.17\pm0.07$ for the late-M dwarfs and a slope of $0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ for the L dwarfs. We also computed the $\Delta(J-K)$ versus metallicity relationship predicted by multi-metallicity model spectra generated using Drift-Phoenix. The modeled late-M dwarfs show a slope of 0.202$\pm$0.03, which is close to our observational results, but the modeled L dwarfs show a slope of 0.493$\pm$0.02, steeper than our observational results. Both our empirical results and the models indicate that more metal-rich objects should appear redder photometrically. We speculate that higher metallicity drives more condensate formation in these atmospheres, thus making these ultracool dwarfs appear redder.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid identification of the optical counterparts of Neutron Star (NS) merger events discovered by gravitational wave detectors may require observing a large error region and sifting through a large number of transients to identify the object of interest. Given the expense of spectroscopic observations, a question arises: How can we utilize photometric observations for candidate prioritization, and what kinds of photometric observations are needed to achieve this goal? NS merger kilonova exhibits low ejecta mass (~5x10^-2 solar mass) and a rapidly evolving photospheric radius (with a velocity ~0.2c). As a consequence, these sources display rapid optical-flux evolution. Indeed, selection based on fast flux variations is commonly used for young supernovae and NS mergers. In this study, we leverage the best currently available flux-limited transient survey - the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey - to extend and quantify this approach. We focus on selecting transients detected in a 3-day cadence survey and observed at a one-day cadence. We explore their distribution in the phase space defined by g-r, g-dot, and r-dot. Our analysis demonstrates that for a significant portion of the time during the first week, the kilonova AT 2017gfo stands out in this phase space. It is important to note that this investigation is subject to various biases and challenges; nevertheless, it suggests that certain photometric observations can be leveraged to identify transients with the highest probability of being fast-evolving events. We also find that a large fraction (~0.75) of the transient candidates with |g-dot|>0.7 mag/day, are cataclysmic variables or active galactic nuclei with radio counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 The CHIME radio telescope operates in the frequency bandwidth of 400 to 800 MHz. The CHIME/FRB collaboration has a data pipeline that analyzes the data in real time, suppresses radio frequency interferences (RFI) and searches for FRBs. However, the RFI removal techniques work best for broadband and narrow FRBs.We wish to create a RFI removal technique that works without making assumptions about the characteristics of the FRB signal. In this thesis we first explore the data of intensity generated by CHIME/FRB backend. After becoming familiar with the structure and organisation of data we present a new novel method for RFI removal using unsupervised machine learning clustering techniques by using multiple beams on CHIME telescope. We are trying to use the analogy of theory of interference for RFI removal by distinguishing near field RFI and far field astrophysical signals in the data. We explored many clustering techniques like K-means,DBSCAN etc but one technique called as HDBSCAN looks particularly promising. Using HDBSCAN clustering technique we have developed the new method for RFI removal. The removal technique upto this point has been developed by us using 3 beams of CHIME telescope. The new novel idea is still in it's incubatory phase and soon we will try to include more beams for our new RFI removal method. We have visually observed that RFI has been been considerably removed from our data. In future we are going to do more calculations to further measure the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the FRB signal after RFI removal and we will use this technique to compare the SNR measured by current RFI removal technique at CHIME/FRB data pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we update and develop algorithms for KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometry in order to create an new, mostly automated, TLC pipeline. We then start a project to systematically apply the new TLC pipeline to the historic KMTNet microlensing events, and search for buried planetary signals. We report the discovery of such a planet candidate in the microlensing event MOA-2019-BLG-421/KMT-2019-BLG-2991. The anomalous signal can be explained by either a planet around the lens star or the orbital motion of the source star. For the planetary interpretation, despite many degenerate solutions, the planet is most likely to be a Jovian planet orbiting an M or K dwarf, which is a typical microlensing planet. The discovery proves that the project can indeed increase the sensitivity of historic events and find previously undiscovered signals.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields present during inflation offers a compelling observational target for galaxy surveys. These fields are of significant theoretical interest since they offer a window into particle physics in the inflaton sector. They also violate the single-field consistency conditions and induce a scale-dependent bias in the galaxy power spectrum. In this paper, we explore this particular signal for light scalar fields and study the prospects for measuring it with galaxy surveys. We find that the sensitivities of current and future surveys are remarkably stable for different configurations, including between spectroscopic and photometric redshift measurements. This is even the case at non-zero masses where the signal is not obviously localized on large scales. For realistic galaxy number densities, we demonstrate that the redshift range and galaxy bias of the sample have the largest impact on the sensitivity in the power spectrum. These results additionally motivated us to explore the potentially enhanced sensitivity of Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST through multi-tracer analyses. Finally, we apply this understanding to current data from the last data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12) and place new constraints on light fields coupled to the inflaton.
