 - **Abstract**
 Earth-mass planets are expected to have atmospheres and experience thermal tides raised by the host star. These tides transfer energy to the planet that can counter the dissipation from bodily tides. Indeed, even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive the rotation of these planets away from the synchronous state. Here we revisit the dynamical evolution of planets undergoing thermal atmospheric tides. We use a novel approach based on a vectorial formalism, which is frame independent and valid for any configuration of the system, including any eccentricity and obliquity values. We provide the secular equations of motion after averaging over the mean anomaly and the argument of the pericenter, which are suitable to model the long-term spin and orbital evolution of the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 By June of 2020, the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory had completed its first of the planned eight X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1). The large effective area of the X-ray telescope makes it ideal for a survey of the faint X-ray diffuse emission over half of the sky with an unprecedented energy resolution and position accuracy. In this work, we produce the X-ray diffuse emission maps of the eRASS1 data with a current calibration, covering the energy range from 0.2 to 8.0 keV. We validated these maps by comparison with X-ray background maps derived from the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS). We generated X-ray images with a pixel area of 9 arcmin$^2$ using the observations available to the German eROSITA consortium. The contribution of the particle background to the photons was subtracted from the final maps. We also subtracted all the point sources above a flux threshold dependent on the goal of the subtraction, exploiting the eRASS1 catalog that will soon be available. The accuracy of the eRASS1 maps is shown by a flux match to the RASS X-ray maps, obtained by converting the eROSITA rates into equivalent ROSAT count rates in the standard ROSAT energy bands R4, R5, R6, and R7, within 1.25$\sigma$. We find small residual deviations in the R4, R5, and R6 bands, where eROSITA tends to observe lower flux than ROSAT (~11%), while a better agreement is achieved in the R7 band (~1%). The eRASS maps exhibit lower noise levels than RASS maps at the same resolution above 0.3 keV. We report the average surface brightness and total flux of different large sky regions as a reference. The detection of faint emission from diffuse hot gas in the Milky Way is corroborated by the consistency of the eRASS1 and RASS maps shown in this paper and by their comparable flux dynamic range.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the formation of second-generation stars in young clusters with masses of $10^{5}$ and $10^6\ {\rm M_\odot}$ within $30-100\ {\rm Myr}$ after the formation of clusters. We assume the clusters move through a uniform interstellar medium with gas densities of $10^{-24}$ and $10^{-23}\ {\rm gcm}^{-3} $ and consider the stellar winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, gas accretion onto the cluster, ram pressure, star formation, and photoionization feedback of our stellar systems including binary stars. We find that second-generation (SG) stars can be formed only within the $10^6\ {\rm M_\odot}$ cluster in the high-density simulation, where the cluster can accrete sufficient pristine gas from their surrounding medium, leading to efficient cooling required for the ignition of SG formation and sufficient dilution of the AGB ejecta. Hence, our results indicate that a denser environment is another requirement for the AGB scenario to explain the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters. On the other hand, the ionizing feedback becomes effective in heating the gas in our low-density simulations. As a result, the clusters cannot accumulate a considerable amount of pristine gas at their center. The gas mass within the clusters in these simulations is similar to that in young massive clusters (YMCs). Hence, our studies can provide a possible reason for the lack of gas, star formation, and SG stars in YMCs. Our results indicate that the ionizing stellar feedback is not a severe problem for SG formation; rather, it can help the AGB scenario to account for some observables.
#### Signatures of Small-scale Structure of the Pre-reionization  Intergalactic Medium in $z\gtrsim7$ Quasar Proximity Zones

 - **Abstract**
 The small-scale structure of baryons in the intergalactic medium is intimately linked to their past thermal history. Prior to the $\gtrsim10^4$ K photoheating during the epoch of reionization, cold baryons may have closely traced the clumpy cosmic web of dark matter down to scales as low as $\lesssim1$ comoving kpc, depending on the degree of heating by the X-ray background. After the passage of the ionization front, this clumpy structure can persist for $\sim10^{8}$ years. The strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wings detected towards a few of the highest redshift quasars, in addition to their smaller-than-expected Ly$\alpha$-transmissive proximity zones, suggest that they have ionized and heated the foreground intergalactic medium less than $10^7$ years ago. Signatures of the pre-reionization small-scale structure should thus persist in their intergalactic surroundings. Here we explore how the persistence of this clumpy structure can affect the statistics of Ly$\alpha$ transmission inside the transparent proximity zones of $z\gtrsim7$ quasars by post-processing a suite of small-volume hydrodynamical simulations with 1D ionizing radiative transfer. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ flux power spectrum and flux PDF statistics of ten $z=7.5$ proximity zones, with realistic observational parameters, could distinguish the gaseous structure of a $T_{\rm IGM}\sim2$ K CDM model from warm dark matter models with particle masses $m_{\rm WDM}>10$ keV and X-ray heated models with $f_{\rm X}f_{\rm abs}>0.1$ ($T_{\rm IGM}(z=7.5)\gtrsim275$ K) at the $2\sigma$ level.

 - **Abstract**
 Halos with masses in excess of the atomic limit are believed to be ideal environments in which to form heavy black hole seeds with masses above 10^3 Msun. In cases where the H_2 fraction is suppressed this is expected to lead to reduced fragmentation of the gas and the generation of a top heavy initial mass function. In extreme cases this can result in the formation of massive black hole seeds. Resolving the initial fragmentation scale and the resulting protostellar masses has, until now, not been robustly tested. Cosmological simulations were performed with the moving mesh code Arepo using a primordial chemistry network until z = 11. Three haloes with masses in excess of the atomic cooling mass were then selected for detailed examination via zoom-ins. The highest resolution simulations resolve densities up to 10^-6 g cm^-3 (10^18 cm^-3) and capture a further 100 yr of fragmentation behaviour at the center of the halo. Our simulations show intense fragmentation in the central region of the halos, leading to a large number of near-solar mass protostars. Despite the increased fragmentation the halos produce a protostellar mass spectrum that peaks at higher masses relative to standard Population III star forming halos. The most massive protostars have accretion rates of 10^-3-10^-1 Msun yr^-1 after the first 100 years of evolution, while the total mass of the central region grows at 1 Msun yr^-1. Lower resolution zoom-ins show that the total mass of the system continues to accrete at 1 Msun yr^-1 for at least 10^4 yr, although how this mass is distributed amongst the rapidly growing number of protostars is unclear. However, assuming that a fraction of stars can continue to accrete rapidly the formation of a sub-population of stars with masses in excess of 10^3 Msun is likely in these halos.

 - **Abstract**
 When a star passes through the tidal disruption radius of a massive black hole (BH), it can be torn apart by the tidal force of the BH, known as the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE). Since the UV/optical emitting region inferred from the blackbody radius is significantly larger than the circularization radius predicted by the classical TDE theory, two competing models, stream collision and envelope reprocessing, were proposed to explain the unexpectedly large UV/optical emitting size. Here, we investigate the variability behaviors (cross-correlation and time delay) of three representative TDEs with continuum reverberation mapping. Our results demonstrate that TDE behavior is clearly inconsistent with the envelope reprocessing scenario. In contrast, the picture of the stream collision, together with the late-time formed accretion disk, can explain heterogeneous observations. This provides compelling evidence that the UV/optical emission originates from stream collisions during the early-stage of TDE evolution and gradually transitions to being dominated by accretion disk with detectable X-ray emission in a late stage. After fading back to a quiescent state, recurrent flares may be observed in some occasions, such as partial TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) make up a rare class of hot pulsating stars with effective temperatures of $\approx$30,000 K and surface gravities of 4.0 - 5.0 dex (cgs). The evolutionary origin and current status of BLAPs is not well understood, largely based on a lack of spectroscopic observations and no available mass constraints. However, several theoretical models have been proposed that reproduce their observed properties, including studies that identify them as pulsating helium-core pre-white dwarfs (He-core pre-WDs). We present here follow-up high-speed photometry and phase-resolved spectroscopy of one of the original 14 BLAPs, OGLE-BLAP-009, discovered during the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We aim to explore its pulsation characteristics and determine stellar properties such as mass and radius in order to test the consistency of these results with He-core pre-WD models. Using the mean atmospheric parameters found using spectroscopy, we fit a spectral energy distribution to obtain a preliminary estimate of the radius, luminosity and mass by making use of the Gaia parallax. We then compare the consistency of these results to He-core pre-WD models generated using MESA, with predicted pulsation periods implemented using GYRE. We find that our mass constraints are in agreement with a low-mass He-core pre-WD of $\approx$0.30 M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Hawking (1971) proposed that the Sun may harbor a primordial black hole whose accretion supplies some of the solar luminosity. Such an object would have formed within the first 1 s after the Big Bang with the mass of a moon or an asteroid. These light black holes are a candidate solution to the dark matter problem, and could grow to become stellar-mass black holes (BHs) if captured by stars. Here we compute the evolution of stars having such a BH at their center. We find that such objects can be surprisingly long-lived, with the lightest black holes having no influence over stellar evolution, while more massive ones consume the star over time to produce a range of observable consequences. Models of the Sun born about a BH whose mass has since grown to approximately $10^{-6}~\rm{M}_\odot$ are compatible with current observations. In this scenario, the Sun would first dim to half its current luminosity over a span of 100 Myr as the accretion starts to generate enough energy to quench nuclear reactions. The Sun would then expand into a fully-convective star, where it would shine luminously for potentially several Gyr with an enriched surface helium abundance, first as a sub-subgiant star, and later as a red straggler, before becoming a sub-solar-mass BH. We also present results for a range of stellar masses and metallicities. The unique internal structures of stars harboring BHs may make it possible for asteroseismology to discover them, should they exist. We conclude with a list of open problems and predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronagraphs are highly sensitive to wavefront errors, with performance degrading rapidly in the presence of low-order aberrations. Correcting these aberrations at the coronagraphic focal plane is key to optimal performance. We present two new methods based on the sequential phase diversity approach of the "Fast and Furious" algorithm that can correct low-order aberrations through a coronagraph. The first, called "2 Fast 2 Furious," is an extension of Fast and Furious to all coronagraphs with even symmetry. The second, "Tokyo Drift," uses a deep learning approach and works with general coronagraphic systems, including those with complex phase masks. Both algorithms have 100% science uptime and require effectively no diversity frames or additional hardware beyond the deformable mirror and science camera, making them suitable for many high contrast imaging systems. We present theory, simulations, and preliminary lab results demonstrating their performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) detected in the gas phase are thought to be mostly formed on icy grains, but no unambiguous detection of icy COMs larger than CH3OH has been reported so far. Exploring this matter in more detail has become possible with the JWST the critical 5-10 $\mu$m range. In the JOYS+ program, more than 30 protostars are being observed with the MIRI/MRS. This study explores the COMs ice signatures in the low and high-mass protostar, IRAS 2A and IRAS 23385, respectively. We fit continuum and silicate subtracted observational data with IR laboratory ice spectra. We use the ENIIGMA fitting tool to find the best fit between the lab data and the observations and to performs statistical analysis of the solutions. We report the best fits for the spectral ranges between 6.8 and 8.6 $\mu$m in IRAS 2A and IRAS 23385, originating from simple molecules, COMs, and negative ions. The strongest feature in this range (7.7 $\mu$m) is dominated by CH4 and has contributions of SO2 and OCN-. Our results indicate that the 7.2 and 7.4 $\mu$m bands are mostly dominated by HCOO-. We find statistically robust detections of COMs based on multiple bands, most notably CH3CHO, CH3CH2OH, and CH3OCHO. The likely detection of CH3COOH is also reported. The ice column density ratios between CH3CH2OH and CH3CHO of IRAS 2A and IRAS 23385, suggests that these COMs are formed on icy grains. Finally, the derived ice abundances for IRAS 2A correlate well with those in comet 67P/GC within a factor of 5. Based on the MIRI/MRS data, we conclude that COMs are present in interstellar ices, thus providing additional proof for a solid-state origin of these species in star-forming regions. The good correlation between the ice abundances in comet 67P and IRAS 2A is in line with the idea that cometary COMs can be inherited from the early protostellar phases.
#### Element abundance patterns in stars indicate fission of nuclei heavier  than uranium

 - **Abstract**
 The heaviest chemical elements are naturally produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) during neutron star mergers or supernovae. The r-process production of elements heavier than uranium (transuranic nuclei) is poorly understood and inaccessible to experiments, so must be extrapolated using nucleosynthesis models. We examine element abundances in a sample of stars that are enhanced in r-process elements. The abundances of elements Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag (atomic numbers Z = 44 to 47, mass numbers A = 99 to 110) correlate with those of heavier elements (63 <= Z <= 78, A > 150). There is no correlation for neighboring elements (34 <= Z <= 42 and 48 <= Z <= 62). We interpret this as evidence that fission fragments of transuranic nuclei contribute to the abundances. Our results indicate that neutron-rich nuclei with mass numbers >260 are produced in r-process events.
#### Semi-major Axis Jumps as the Activity Trigger in Centaurs and  High-Perihelion Jupiter Family Comets

 - **Abstract**
 We present a dynamical study of 39 active Centaurs and 17 high-perihelion (q$>$4.5 au) JFCs with a focus on investigating recent orbital changes as potential triggers for comet-like activity. We have identified a common feature in the recent dynamical histories of all active Centaurs and JFC in our sample that is not present in the history of the majority of inactive population members: a sharp decrease in semi-major axis and eccentricity occurring within the last several hundred years prior to observed activity. We define these rapid orbital changes as `a-jumps'. Our results indicate that these orbital reshaping events lead to shorter orbital periods and subsequently greater average per-orbit heating of Centaur nuclei. We suggest the a-jumps could therefore be a major trigger of cometary activity on Centaurs and JFCs. Our results further imply that analyses of the recent dynamical histories could be used to identify objects that are currently active or may become active soon, where we have identified three such Centaurs with recent a-jumps that should be considered high-priority targets for observational monitoring to search for activity.
#### Probing Disk Ice Content and PAH Emission Through Multiband MagAO+Clio  Images of HD 141569

 - **Abstract**
 We present resolved images of the inner disk component around HD 141569 using the Magellan adaptive optics system with the Clio2 1 - 5 $\mu$m camera, offering a glimpse of a complex system thought to be in a short evolutionary phase between protoplanetary and debris disk stages. We use a reference star along with the KLIP algorithm for PSF subtraction to detect the disk inward to about 0.24" (~25 au assuming a distance of 111 pc) at high signal-to-noise ratios at $L'$ (3.8 $\mu$m), $Ls$ (3.3 $\mu$m), and narrowband $Ice$ (3.1 $\mu$m). We identify an arc or spiral arm structure at the southeast extremity, consistent with previous studies. We implement forward modeling with a simple disk model within the framework of an MCMC sampler to better constrain the geometrical attributes and photometry using our KLIP-reduced disk images. We then leverage these modeling results to facilitate a comparison of the measured brightness in each passband to find a reduction in scattered light from the disk in the $Ice$ filter, implying significant absorption due to water ice in the dust. Additionally, our best-fit disk models exhibit peak brightness in the southwestern, back-scattering region of the disk, which we suggest to be possible evidence of 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission. However, we point out the need for additional observations with bluer filters and more complex modeling to confirm these hypotheses.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the viability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the Standard Model (SM) in a scenario that does not rely on specific inflationary features or any exotic physics such as phase transitions or non-minimal coupling to gravity. If the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field lies exactly at the transition between metastability and stability, its potential exhibits an inflexion point due to radiative corrections. The BEH can act like a stochastic curvaton field, leading to a non-Gaussian tail of large curvature fluctuations that later collapse into PBHs when they re-enter inside the horizon. This scenario would require a precise value of the top-quark mas to ensure the Higgs stability, which is disfavored but still consistent with the most recent measurements. However, we also find that large curvature fluctuations are also generated on cosmological scales that are inconsistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We therefore conclude that the SM cannot have led to the formation of PBHs based on this mechanism. Nevertheless, a variation of the scenario based on the Palatini formulation of gravity may have provided the conditions to produce stellar-mass PBHs with an abundance comparable to dark matter, without producing too large curvature fluctuations on cosmological scales.
#### Vertical shear instability in two-moment radiation-hydrodynamical  simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks I. Angular momentum transport  and turbulent heating

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the linear and nonlinear evolution of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) in axisymmetric models of protoplanetary disks, focusing on the transport of angular momentum, the produced temperature perturbations, and the applicability of local stability conditions. We modeled the gas-dust mixture via high-resolution two-moment (M1) radiation-hydrodynamical simulations including stellar irradiation with frequency-dependent opacities. We found that, given sufficient depletion of small grains (with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of $10\%$ of our nominal value of $10^{-3}$ for $<0.25$ $\mu$m grains), the VSI can operate in surface disk layers while being inactive close to the midplane, resulting in a suppression of the VSI body modes. The VSI reduces the initial vertical shear in bands of approximately uniform specific angular momentum, whose formation is likely favored by the enforced axisymmetry. Similarities with Reynolds stresses and angular momentum distributions in 3D simulations suggest that the VSI-induced angular momentum mixing in the radial direction may be predominantly axisymmetric. The stability regions in our models are well explained by local stability criteria, while the employment of global criteria is still justifiable up to a few scale heights above the midplane, at least as long as VSI modes are radially optically thin. Turbulent heating produces only marginal temperature increases of at most $0.1\%$ and $0.01\%$ in the nominal and dust-depleted models, respectively, peaking at a few (approximately three) scale heights above the midplane. We conclude that it is unlikely that the VSI can, in general, lead to any significant temperature increase since that would either require it to efficiently operate in largely optically thick disk regions or to produce larger levels of turbulence than predicted by models of passive irradiated disks.
#### Vertical shear instability in two-moment radiation-hydrodynamical  simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks II. Secondary instabilities  and stability regions

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a hydrodynamical instability likely to produce turbulence in the dead zones of protoplanetary disks. Various aspects of this instability remain to be understood, including the disk regions where it can operate and the physical phenomena leading to its saturation. In this work, we studied the growth and evolution of secondary instabilities parasitic to the VSI, examining their relation with its saturation in axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks. We also constructed stability maps for our disk models, considering temperature stratifications enforced by stellar irradiation and radiative cooling and incorporating the effects of dust-gas collisions and molecular line emission. We found that the flow pattern produced by the interplay of the axisymmetric VSI modes and the baroclinic torque forms bands of nearly uniform specific angular momentum. In the high-shear regions in between these bands, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is triggered. The significant transfer of kinetic energy to small-scale eddies produced by the KHI and possibly even the baroclinic acceleration of eddies limit the maximum energy of the VSI modes, likely leading to the saturation of the VSI. A third instability mechanism, consisting of an amplification of eddies by baroclinic torques, forms meridional vortices with Mach numbers up to $\sim 0.4$. Our stability analysis suggests that protoplanetary disks can be VSI-unstable in surface layers up to tens of au for reasonably high gas emissivities, even in regions where the midplane is stable. This picture is consistent with current observations of disks showing thin midplane millimeter-sized dust layers while appearing vertically extended in optical and near-infrared wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we report an optical quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of $\sim$134~day detected in g- and r-band light curves of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy TXS 1206+549 at redshift of 1.34 with the data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations. After considering the trial factor, the significance levels in the two bands are 3.1 $\sigma$ and 2.6 $\sigma$, respectively. The QPO signal presents about 10 cycles ranging from 2018 March to 2021 December lasting $\sim$4 year. A near-sinusoidal profile also appears in the folded light curves by a phase-resolved analysis. Interestingly, in the simultaneous light curve as the time scale of ZTF observations, a potential periodic signal with similar period is detected in the o-band light curve from the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System data, additionally a weak peak is also detected at the similar period in the gamma-ray light curve obtained from the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope data. Some potential origins of periodicities in active galactic nuclei are discussed for the QPO reported here.

 - **Abstract**
 Organic features lead to two distinct types of Class 0/I low-mass protostars: hot corino sources, and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) sources. Some observations suggest that the chemical variations between WCCC sources and hot corino sources are associated with local environments, as well as the luminosity of protostars. We conducted gas-grain chemical simulation in collapsing protostellar cores, and found that the fiducial model predicts abundant carbon-chain molecules and COMs, and reproduces WCCC and hot corino chemistry in the hybrid source L483. By changing values of some physical parameters, including the visual extinction of ambient clouds ($A_{\rm V}^{\rm amb}$), the cosmic-ray ionization rate ($\zeta$), the maximum temperature during the warm-up phase ($T_{\rm max}$), and the contraction timescale of protostars ($t_{\rm cont}$), we found that UV photons and cosmic rays can boost WCCC features by accelerating the dissociation of CO and CH$_4$ molecules. On the other hand, UV photons can weaken the hot corino chemistry by photodissociation reactions, while the dependence of hot corino chemistry on cosmic rays is relatively complex. The $T_{\rm max}$ does not affect WCCC features, while it can influence hot corino chemistry by changing the effective duration of two-body surface reactions for most COMs. The long $t_{\rm cont}$ can boost WCCC and hot corino chemistry, by prolonging the effective duration of WCCC reactions in the gas phase and surface formation reactions for COMs, respectively. Subsequently, we ran a model with different physical parameters to reproduce scarce COMs in prototypical WCCC sources. The scarcity of COMs in prototypical WCCC sources can be explained by insufficient dust temperature in the inner envelopes to activate hot corino chemistry. Meanwhile, the High $\zeta$ and the long $t_{\rm cont}$ favors the explanation for scarce COMs in these sources.

 We report the discovery of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (PWN), named Potoroo, and the detection of a young pulsar J1638-4713 that powers the nebula. We present a radio continuum study of the PWN based on 20-cm observations obtained from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and MeerKAT. PSR J1638-4713 was identified using Parkes radio telescope observations at frequencies above 3 GHz. The pulsar has the second-highest dispersion measure of all known radio pulsars (1553 pc/cm^3), a spin period of 65.74 ms and a spin-down luminosity of 6.1x10^36 erg/s. The PWN has a cometary morphology and one of the greatest projected lengths among all the observed pulsar radio tails, measuring over 21 pc for an assumed distance of 10 kpc. The remarkably long tail and atypically steep radio spectral index are attributed to the interplay of a supernova reverse shock and the PWN. The originating supernova remnant is not known so far. We estimated the pulsar kick velocity to be in the range of 1000-2000 km/s for ages between 23 and 10 kyr. The X-ray counterpart found in Chandra data, CXOU J163802.6-471358, shows the same tail morphology as the radio source but is shorter by a factor of 10. The peak of the X-ray emission is offset from the peak of the radio total intensity (Stokes I) emission by approximately 4.7", but coincides well with circularly polarised (Stokes V) emission. No infrared counterpart was found.

 We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), an experimental space wide-field (18.6*18.6 square degrees) X-ray telescope built from novel lobster eye mirco-pore optics. LEIA was successfully launched on July 27, 2022 onboard the SATech-01 satellite. To achieve full characterisation of its performance before launch, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module. In this paper, we present the results of the end-to-end calibration campaign of the complete module carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility at IHEP. The PSF, effective area and energy response of the detectors were measured in a wide range of incident directions at several X-ray line energies. The distributions of the PSF and effective areas are roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. The mild variations and deviations from the prediction of idealized lobster-eye optics can be understood to be caused by the imperfect shapes and alignment of the micro-pores as well as the obscuration by the supporting frames, which can be well reproduced by MC simulations. The spatial resolution of LEIA defined by the FWHM of the focal spot ranges from 4-8 arcmin with a median of 5.7. The measured effective areas are in range of 2-3 $cm^2$ at ~1.25 keV across the entire FoV, and its dependence on photon energy is in large agreement with simulations. The gains of the CMOS sensors are in range of 6.5-6.9 eV/DN, and the energy resolutions in the range of ~120-140 eV at 1.25 keV and ~170-190 eV at 4.5 keV. These results have been ingested into the calibration database and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by LEIA. This work paves the way for the calibration of the Wide-field X-Ray Telescope modules of the Einstein Probe mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that massive young star clusters may be possible candidates that can accelerate Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the range of $10^7\hbox{--}10^9$ GeV (between the `knee' and `ankle'). Various plausible scenarios such as acceleration at the wind termination shock (WTS), supernova shocks inside these young star clusters, etc. have been proposed,since it is difficult to accelerate particles up to the $10^7\hbox{--}10^9$ GeV range in the standard paradigm of CR acceleration in supernova remnants. We consider a model for the production of different nuclei in CRs from massive stellar winds using the observed distribution of young star clusters in the Galactic plane. We present a detailed calculation of CR transport in the Galaxy, taking into account the effect of diffusion, interaction losses during propagation, and particle re-acceleration by old supernova remnants to determine the all-particle CR spectrum. Using the maximum energy estimate from the Hillas criterion, we argue that a young massive star cluster can accelerate protons up to a few tens of PeV. Upon comparison with the observed data, our model requires a CR source spectrum with an exponential cutoff of $5\times 10^7 Z$ GeV ($50\,Z$~PeV) from these clusters together with a cosmic-ray injection fraction of $\sim 5\%$ of the wind kinetic energy. We discuss the possibility of achieving these requirements in star clusters, and the associated uncertainties, in the context of considering star clusters as the natural accelerator of the `second component' of Galactic cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Several ongoing and upcoming large scale structure surveys aim to explore the nonlinear regime of structure formation with high precision. Making reliable cosmological inferences from these observations necessitates precise theoretical modeling of the mildly nonlinear regime. In this work we explore how the choice of nonlinear prescription would impact parameter estimation from cosmic shear measurements for a Euclid-like survey. Specifically, we employ two different nonlinear prescriptions of Haloft and the Effective Field Theory of the Large Scale Structure and compare their measurements for the three different cosmological scenarios of $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $(w_0,w_a)$CDM. We also investigate the impact of different nonlinear cutoff schemes on parameter estimation. We find that the predicted errors on most parameters shrink considerably as smaller scales are included in the analysis, with the amount depending on the nonlinear prescription and the cutoff scheme used. We use predictions from the Halofit model to analyze the mock data from DarkSky $N$-body simulations and quantify the parameter bias introduced in the measurements due to the choice of nonlinear prescription. We observe that $\sigma_8$ and $n_{\rm{s}}$ have the largest measurement bias induced by inaccuracies of the Halofit model.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of apparently young $\alpha$-rich stars in the Galaxy is still a matter of debate in Galactic archaeology, whether they are genuinely young or might be products of binary evolution and merger/mass accretion. We aim to shed light on the nature of young $\alpha$-rich stars in the Milky Way by studying their distribution in the Galaxy thanks to an unprecedented sample of giant stars that cover different Galactic regions and have precise asteroseismic ages, chemical, and kinematic measurements. We analyze a new sample of $\sim$ 6000 stars with precise ages coming from asteroseismology. Our sample combines the global asteroseismic parameters measured from light curves obtained by the K2 mission with stellar parameters and chemical abundances obtained from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, then cross-matched with Gaia DR3. We define our sample of young $\alpha$-rich stars and study their chemical, kinematic, and age properties. We investigate young $\alpha$-rich stars in different parts of the Galaxy and we find that the fraction of young $\alpha$-rich stars remains constant with respect to the number of high-$\alpha$ stars at $\sim$ 10%. Furthermore, young $\alpha$-rich stars have kinematic and chemical properties similar to high-$\alpha$ stars, except for [C/N] ratios. This suggests that these stars are not genuinely young, but products of binary evolution and merger/mass accretion. Under that assumption, we find the fraction of these stars in the field to be similar to that found recently in clusters. This fact suggests that $\sim$ 10% of the low-$\alpha$ field stars could also have their ages underestimated by asteroseismology. This should be kept in mind when using asteroseismic ages to interpret results in Galactic archaeology.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent analysis on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant suggests interestingly small values for its mass and radius. Such an observation favors soft nuclear models that may be challenged by the observation of massive compact stars. In contrast, the recent PREX-II experiment, concerning the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb, points towards stiff equations of state that favor larger compact star radii. In the present study, we aim to explore the compatibility between stiff hadronic equations of state (favored by PREX-II) and the HESS J1731-347 remnant in the context of hybrid stars. For the construction of hybrid equations of state we use three widely employed Skyrme models combined with the well-known vector MIT bag model. Furthermore we consider two different scenarios concerning the energy density of the bag. In the first case, that of a constant bag parameter, we find that the resulting hybrid equations of state are strongly disfavored by the observation of $\sim2 M_\odot$ pulsars. However, the introduction of a Gaussian density dependence yields results that are compatible with the conservative $2 M_\odot$ constraint. The utilization of recent data based on the observation of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0952-0607 and GW190814 allows for the imposition of additional constraints on the relevant parameters and the stiffness of the two phases. Interestingly, we find that the derived hybrid equations of state do not satisfy the PSR J0030+0451 constraints in $1\sigma$ and only marginally agree with the $2\sigma$ estimations. In addition, we estimate that the observation of massive pulsars, like PSR~J0952-0607, in combination with the existence of HESS J1731-347, may require a strong phase transition below $\sim 1.7n_0$. Finally, we show that the supermassive compact object involved in GW190814 could potentially be explained as a rapidly rotating hybrid star.

 - **Abstract**
 SY Cha is a T Tauri star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a large cavity seen in the millimeter continuum but has the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a full disk. Here we report the first results from JWST-MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations taken as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO Program. The much improved resolution and sensitivity of MIRI-MRS compared to Spitzer enables a robust analysis of the previously detected H2O, CO, HCN, and CO2 emission as well as a marginal detection of C2H2. We also report the first robust detection of mid-infrared OH and ro-vibrational CO emission in this source. The derived molecular column densities reveal the inner disk of SY Cha to be rich in both oxygen and carbon bearing molecules. This is in contrast to PDS 70, another protoplanetary disk with a large cavity observed with JWST, which displays much weaker line emission. In the SY Cha disk, the continuum, and potentially the line, flux varies substantially between the new JWST observations and archival Spitzer observations, indicative of a highly dynamic inner disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The transit method is one of the most relevant exoplanet detection techniques, which consists of detecting periodic eclipses in the light curves of stars. This is not always easy due to the presence of noise in the light curves, which is induced, for example, by the response of a telescope to stellar flux. For this reason, we aimed to develop an artificial neural network model that is able to detect these transits in light curves obtained from different telescopes and surveys. We created artificial light curves with and without transits to try to mimic those expected for the extended mission of the Kepler telescope (K2) in order to train and validate a 1D convolutional neural network model, which was later tested, obtaining an accuracy of 99.02 % and an estimated error (loss function) of 0.03. These results, among others, helped to confirm that the 1D CNN is a good choice for working with non-phased-folded Mandel and Agol light curves with transits. It also reduces the number of light curves that have to be visually inspected to decide if they present transit-like signals and decreases the time needed for analyzing each (with respect to traditional analysis).

 - **Abstract**
 The effect of accretion bursts on massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) represents a new research field in the study of young stars and their environment. We aim to investigate the impact of an accretion burst on massive disks with different types of envelopes and to study the effects of an accretion burst on the temperature structure and the chemistry of the disk. We focus on water and methanol as chemical species for this paper. The thermochemical code of PRODIMO (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) is used to perform simulation of high mass protoplanetary disk models with different types of envelopes under the presence of an accretion burst. The models in question represent different evolutionary stages of protostellar objects. We calculate and show the chemical abundances in three phases of the simulation (pre-burst, burst, and post-burst). More heavily embedded disks show higher temperatures. The impact of the accretion burst is mainly characterized by the desorption of chemical species present in the disk and envelope from the dust grains to the gas phase. When the post-burst phase starts, the sublimated species freeze out again. The degree of sublimation depends strongly on the type of envelope the disk is embedded in. An accretion burst in more massive envelopes produces stronger desorption of the chemical species. However, our models show that the timescale for the chemistry to reach the pre-burst state is independent of the type of envelope. The study shows that the disk's temperature increases with a more massive envelope enclosing it. Thus, the chemistry of MYSOs in earlier stages of their evolution reacts stronger to an accretion burst than at later stages where the envelope has lost most of its mass or has been dissipated. The study of the impact of accretion bursts could also provide helpful theoretical context to the observation of methanol masers in massive disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the emergence of cosmological tension has raised doubts about the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In order to constrain the neutrino mass within a consistent cosmological framework, we investigate three massive neutrinos with normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) in both the axion-like EDE (Axi-EDE) model and the AdS-EDE model. We use the joint datasets including cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum from Planck 2018, Pantheon of type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and $H_0$ data from SH0ES. For the $\nu$Axi-EDE model, we obtain $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{NH}} < 0.152$ eV and $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{IH}} < 0.178$ eV, while for the $\nu$AdS-EDE model, we find $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{NH}} < 0.135$ eV and $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{IH}} < 0.167$ eV. Our results exhibit a preference for the normal hierarchy in both the $\nu$Axi-EDE model and the $\nu$AdS-EDE model.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2020, hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the gas phase was discovered in the atmosphere of Mars with the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) onboard the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) mission (Korablev et al., 2021). Its volume mixing ratio (VMR) shows a seasonal increase of up to 5 ppbv during the perihelion season, followed by a sudden drop to undetectable levels, contradicting previous estimations of the HCl lifetime of several months. In the Earth's stratosphere, heterogeneous uptake of HCl onto water ice is known to be a major sink for this species. Modelling of associated chemistry involving heterogeneous reactions indicates that H2O ice becomes the most effective sink for HCl above 20 km with the characteristic time shorter than 12 hours. In this work, we use simultaneous measurements of water ice particles and HCl abundance obtained by the ACS instrument and show particular structures in the vertical profiles, forming detached layers of gas at the ice free altitudes ('ice-holes'). We demonstrate that the heterogeneous uptake of HCl onto water ice operates on Mars and is potentially a major mechanism regulating the HCl abundance in the atmosphere of Mars.

 - **Abstract**
 In the homoeoidal expansion, a given ellipsoidally stratified density distribution, and its associated potential, are expanded in the (small) density flattening parameter $\eta$, and usually truncated at the linear order. The truncated density-potential pair obeys exactly the Poisson equation, and it can be interpreted as the first-order expansion of the original ellipsoidal density-potential pair, or as a new autonomous system. In the first interpretation, in the solutions of the Jeans equations the quadratic terms in $\eta$ must be discarded (``$\eta$-linear'' solutions), while in the second (``$\eta$-quadratic'') all terms are retained. In this work we study the importance of the quadratic terms by using the ellipsoidal Plummer model and the Perfect Ellipsoid, which allow for fully analytical $\eta$-quadratic solutions. These solutions are then compared with those obtained numerically for the original ellipsoidal models, finding that the $\eta$-linear models already provide an excellent approximation of the numerical solutions. As an application, the $\eta$-linear Plummer model (with a central black hole) is used for the phenomenological interpretation of the dynamics of the weakly flattened and rotating globular cluster NGC 4372, confirming that this system cannot be interpreted as an isotropic rotator, a conclusion reached previously with more sophisticated studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational breakthroughs in the exoplanet field of the last decade motivated the development of numerous theoretical models describing atmospheres and mass loss, which is believed to be one of the main drivers of planetary evolution. We aim to outline for which types of close-in planets in the Neptune-mass range the accurate treatment of photoionisation effects is most relevant concerning atmospheric escape and the parameters relevant for interpreting observations. We developed the CHAIN (Cloudy e Hydro Ancora INsieme) model combining 1D hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model with the non-LTE photoionisation and radiative transfer code Cloudy accounting for photochemistry, detailed atomic level populations, and chemical reactions for all elements up to zinc. We apply CHAIN to model the upper atmospheres of a range of Neptune-like planets with masses between 1 and 50 M$_{\oplus}$, varying also the orbital parameters. For the majority of warm and hot Neptunes, we find slower and denser outflows, with lower ion fractions, compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic model alone. Furthermore, we find significantly different temperature profiles between CHAIN and the hydrodynamic model alone, though the peak values are similar for similar atmospheric compositions. The mass-loss rates predicted by CHAIN are higher for hot, strongly irradiated planets and lower for more moderate planets. All differences between the two models are strongly correlated with the amount of high-energy irradiation. Finally, we find that the hydrodynamic effects impact significantly ionisation and heating. The impact of the precise photoionisation treatment provided by Cloudy strongly depends on the system parameters. This suggests that some of the simplifications typically employed in hydrodynamic modelling might lead to systematic errors when studying planetary atmospheres, even at a population-wide level.

 - **Abstract**
 Ocean worlds, or icy bodies in the outer solar system that have or once had subsurface liquid water oceans, are among the most compelling topics of astrobiology. Typically, confirming the existence of a subsurface ocean requires close spacecraft observations. However, combining our understanding of the chemistry that takes place in a subsurface ocean with our knowledge of the building blocks that formed potential ocean worlds provides an opportunity to identify tracers of endogenic activity in the surface volatiles of Pluto and Triton. We show here that the current composition of the volatiles on the surfaces and in the atmospheres of Pluto and Triton are deficient in carbon, which can only be explained by the loss of CH4 through a combination of aqueous chemistry and atmospheric processes. Furthermore, we find that the relative nitrogen and water abundances are within the range observed in building block analogs, comets, and chondrites. A lower limit for N/Ar in Pluto's atmosphere also suggests source building blocks that have a cometary or chondritic composition, all pointing to an origin for their nitrogen as NH3 or organics. Triton's lower abundance of CH4 compared to Pluto, and the detection of CO2 at Triton but not at Pluto points to aqueous chemistry in a subsurface ocean that was more efficient at Triton than Pluto. These results have applications to other large Kuiper Belt objects as well as the assessment of formation locations and times for the four giant planets given future probe measurements of noble gas abundances and isotope ratios.
#### Accurate Fourier-space statistics for line intensity mapping: Cartesian  grid sampling without aliased power

 - **Abstract**
 Estimators for $n$-point clustering statistics in Fourier-space demand that modern surveys of large-scale structure be transformed to Cartesian coordinates to perform Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). In this work, we explore this transformation in the context of pixelised line intensity maps (LIM), highlighting potential biasing effects on power spectrum measurements. Current analyses often avoid a complete resampling of the data by approximating survey geometry as rectangular in Cartesian space, an increasingly inaccurate assumption for modern wide-sky surveys. Our simulations of a $20\,{\times}\,20\,\text{deg}^2$ 21cm LIM survey at $0.34\,{<}\,z\,{<}\,0.54$ show this assumption biases power spectrum measurements by ${>}\,20\%$ across all scales. We therefore present a more robust framework for regridding the voxel intensities onto a 3D FFT field by coordinate transforming large numbers of Monte-Carlo sampling particles. Whilst this unbiases power spectrum measurements on large scales, smaller-scale discrepancies remain, caused by structure smoothing and aliasing from separations unresolved by the grid. To correct these effects, we introduce modelling techniques, higher-order particle assignments, and interlaced FFT grids to suppress the aliased power. Using a Piecewise Cubic Spline (PCS) particle assignment and an interlaced FFT field, we achieve sub-percent accuracy up to 80% of the Nyquist frequency for our 21cm LIM simulations. We find a more subtle hierarchical improvement in results for higher-order assignment schemes, relative to the gains made for galaxy surveys, which we attribute to the extra complexity in LIM from additional discretising steps.

 - **Abstract**
 Nova 1670 is a historical transient bearing strong similarities to a recently-recognized type of stellar eruptions known as red novae, which are thought to be powered by stellar mergers. The remnant of the transient, CK Vul, is observable today mainly through cool circumstellar gas and dust, and recombining plasma, but we have no direct view on the stellar object. Within the merger hypothesis, we aim to infer the most likely makeup of the progenitor system that resulted in Nova 1670. We collect and summarize the literature data on the physical properties of the outburst and the remnant, and on the chemical composition of the circumstellar material which resulted from optical and submillimeter observations of the circumstellar gas of CK Vul. Simple simulations yield the form and level of mixing of material associated with the merger. Products of nuclear burning are identified, among them ashes of H burning in the CNO cycles and the MgAl chain, as well as of partial He burning. Based on the luminosity and chemical composition of the remnant, we find that the progenitor primary had to be an evolutionarily advanced red-giant branch star of a mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. The secondary was either a very similar giant, or a He white dwarf. While the eruption event was mainly powered by accretion, we estimate that about 12% of total energy might have come from He burning activated during the merger. The coalescence of a first-ascent giant with a He white dwarf created a star with a rather unique internal structure and composition, which resemble these of early R-type carbon stars. Nova 1670 was the result of a merger between a He white dwarf and a first-ascent red giant and is likely now evolving to become an early R-type carbon star.

 - **Abstract**
 We show how one can test the cosmological Poisson equation by requiring only the validity of three main assumptions: the energy-momentum conservation equations of matter, the equivalence principle, and the cosmological principle. We first point out that one can only measure the combination ${\mathcal M}\equiv \Omega_m^{(0)}\mu$, where $\mu$ quantifies the deviation of the Poisson equation from the standard one and $\Omega_m^{(0)}$ is the fraction of matter density at present. Then we employ a recent model-independent forecast for the growth rate $f(z)$ and the expansion rate $E(z)$ to obtain constraints on ${\mathcal M}$ for a survey that approximates a combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid. We conclude that a constant ${\mathcal M}$ can be measured with a relative error $\sigma_{\mathcal{M}}=4.1\%$, while if ${\mathcal M}$ is arbitrarily varying in redshift, it can be measured to within $19.3\%$ (1 $\sigma$ c.l.) at redshift $z=0.9$, and 20-30\% up to $z=1.5$. We also project our constraints on some parametrizations of ${\mathcal M}$ proposed in literature, while still maintaining model-independence for the background expansion, the power spectrum shape, and the non-linear corrections. Generally speaking, as expected, we find much weaker model-independent constraints than found so far for such models. This means that the cosmological Poisson equation remains quite open to various alternative gravity and dark energy models.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-linear structure formation for fermionic dark matter particles leads to dark matter density profiles with a degenerate compact core surrounded by a diluted halo. For a given fermion mass, the core has a critical mass that collapses into a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Galactic dynamics constraints suggest a $\sim 100$ keV/$c^2$ fermion, which leads to $\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ critical core mass. Here, we show that baryonic (ordinary) matter accretion drives an initially stable dark matter core to SMBH formation and determine the accreted mass threshold that induces it. Baryonic gas density $\rho_b$ and velocity $v_b$ inferred from cosmological hydro-simulations and observations produce sub-Eddington accretion rates triggering the baryon-induced collapse in less than a Gyr. This process produces active galactic nuclei in galaxy mergers and the high-redshift Universe. For TXS 2116-077, merging with a nearby galaxy, the observed $3\times 10^7 M_\odot$ SMBH, for $Q_b = \rho_b/v_b^3 = 0.125 M_\odot/(100 \text{km/s pc})^3$, forms in $\approx 0.6$ Gyr, consistent with the $0.5$-$2$ Gyr merger timescale and younger jet. For the farthest central SMBH detected by the \textit{Chandra} X-ray satellite in the $z=10.3$ UHZ1 galaxy observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}), the mechanism leads to a $4\times 10^7 M_\odot$ SMBH in $87$-$187$ Myr, starting the accretion at $z=12$-$15$. The baryon-induced collapse can also explain the $\approx 10^7$-$10^8 M_\odot$ SMBHs revealed by the JWST at $z\approx 4$-$6$. After its formation, the SMBH can grow to a few $10^9 M_\odot$ in timescales shorter than a Gyr via sub-Eddington baryonic mass accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 The Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey is one of the largest and most sensitive searches for pulsars and transient radio objects. Observations for the survey have finished; priorities have shifted toward long-term monitoring of its discoveries. In this study, we have developed a pipeline to handle large datasets of archival observations and connect them to recent, high-cadence observations taken using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. This pipeline handles data for 128 pulsars and has produced measurements of spin, positional, and orbital parameters that connect data over observation gaps as large as 2000 days. We have also measured glitches in the timing residuals for five of the pulsars included and proper motion for 19 sources (13 new). We include updates to orbital parameters for 19 pulsars, including 9 previously unpublished binaries. For two of these binaries, we provide updated measurements of post-Keplerian binary parameters, which result in much more precise estimates of the total masses of both systems. For PSR J0509+3801, the much improved measurement of the Einstein delay yields much improved mass measurements for the pulsar and its companion, 1.399(6)\Msun and 1.412(6)\Msun, respectively. For this system, we have also obtained a measurement of the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves: $\dot{P}_{\rm B} = -1.37(7)\times10^{-12}$, which is in agreement with the rate predicted by general relativity for these masses.
#### Aliasing from Galactic Plane Setting in Widefield Radio Interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements with widefield radio interferometers often include the near-infinite gradient between the sky and the horizon. This causes aliasing inherent to the measurement itself, and is purely a consequence of the Fourier basis. For this reason, the horizon is often attenuated by the instrumental beam down to levels deemed inconsequential. However, this effect is enhanced via our own Galactic plane as it sets over the course of a night. We show all-sky simulations of the Galactic plane setting in a radio interferometer in detail for the first time. We then apply these simulations to the Murchison Widefield Array to show that a beam attenuation of 0.1% is not sufficient in some precision science cases. We determine that the noise statistics of the residual data image are drastically more Gaussian with aliasing removal, and explore consequences in simulation for cataloging of extragalactic sources and 21-cm Epoch of Reionization detection via the power spectrum.
#### Anomalous cosmic-ray correlations revisited with a complete full-sky  sample of BL Lac type objects

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays with energies above $10^{19}$ eV, observed in 1999-2004 by the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) experiment in the stereoscopic mode, were found to correlate with directions to distant BL Lac type objects (BL Lacs), suggesting non-standard neutral particles travelling for cosmological distances without attenuation. This effect could not be tested by newer experiments because of their inferior angular resolution. The distribution in the sky of BL Lacs associated with cosmic rays was found to deviate from isotropy, which might give a clue to the interpretation of the observed anomaly. However, previous studies made use of a sample of BL Lacs which was anisotropic by itself, thus complicating these interpretations. Here, we use a recently compiled isotropic sample of BL Lacs and the same HiRes data to confirm the presence of correlations and to strengthen the case for the local large-scale structure pattern in the distribution of the correlated events in the sky. Further tests of the anomaly await new precise cosmic-ray data.
