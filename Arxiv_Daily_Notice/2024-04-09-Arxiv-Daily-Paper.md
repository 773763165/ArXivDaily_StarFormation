 - **Abstract**
 The surfaces of many white dwarfs are polluted by metals, implying a recent accretion event. The tidal disruption of planetesimals is a viable source of white dwarf pollution and offers a unique window into the composition of exoplanet systems. The question of how planetary material enters the tidal disruption radius of the white dwarf is currently unresolved. Using a series of $N$-body simulations, we explore the response of the surrounding planetesimal debris disk as the white dwarf receives a natal kick caused by anisotropic mass loss on the asymptotic giant branch. We find that the kick can form an apse-aligned, eccentric debris disk in the range 30 to 240 AU which corresponds to the orbits of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt, and the scattered disk in our solar system. In addition, many planetesimals beyond 240 AU flip to counter-rotating orbits. Assuming an isotropic distribution of kicks, we predict that approximately 80% of white dwarf debris disks should exhibit significant apsidal alignment and fraction of counter-rotating orbits. The eccentric disk is able to efficiently and continuously torque planetesimals onto radial, star-grazing orbits. We show that the kick causes both an initial burst in tidal disruption events as well as an extended period of 100 Myr where tidal disruption rates are consistent with observed mass accretion rates on polluted white dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing availability of free high-resolution earth observation data covering any point on the globe every few days led to the emergence of new remote sensing tools that can manipulate the very large volumes of data generated by those satellites. We present Sen2Chain, an open-source Python tool that can automate the processing of large time series of Sentinel-2 images for their use in various fields (e.g., environmental health, natural hazards, ecology). Sen2Chain allows downloading images from various earth observation data suppliers, applying geometric and atmospheric corrections using ESA's Sen2Cor tool, and generating and applying cloud masks. Sen2Chain's ability to extract time series of spectral indices (e.g NDVI, NDWI) provides simplified access to value-added environmental information for a wide range of end-users and applications. Sen2Chain enables all data processing stages to be customized and chained together, with the possibility to automate and parallelize the processing, and optimize data management. Sen2Chain is paving the way for the creation and processing of a large earth observation image database dedicated to users who require time-series and/or perform regular environmental observations. The Web tool Sen2Extract is also presented, which enables end-users with no expertise in remote sensing to easily extract time-series for 11 spectral indices values for specific regions of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to present a robust parameter estimation with simulated Lya forest spectra from Sherwood-Relics simulations suite using Information Maximizing Neural Network(IMNN) to extract maximal information from Lya 1D-transmitted flux in Fourier space. We perform 1D estimations using IMNN for IGM thermal parameters $T_0$ & $\gamma$ at z=2-4 and cosmological parameters $\sigma_8$ & $n_s$ at z=3-4. We compare our results with estimates from power spectrum using posterior distribution from Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC). We then check robustness of IMNN estimates against deviation in spectral noise levels,continuum uncertainties & instrumental smoothing effects. Using mock Lya forest sightlines from publicly available CAMELS project we also check the robustness of the trained IMNN on a different simulation. We also perform a 2D-parameter estimation for $T_0$ & HI photoionization rates $\Gamma_{HI}$. We obtain improved estimates of $T_0$ & $\gamma$ using IMNN over standard MCMC approach. These estimates are also more robust against SNR deviations at z=2 & 3. At z=4 the sensitivity to noise deviations is on par with MCMC estimates. The IMNN also provides $T_0$ and $\gamma$ estimates which are robust against continuum uncertainties by extracting continuum-independent small-scale information from Fourier domain. In case of $\sigma_8$ & $n_s$ IMNN performs on par with MCMC but still offers a significant speed boost in estimating parameters from a new dataset. The improved estimates with IMNN are seen for high instrumental-resolution(FWHM=6km/s). At medium or low resolutions IMNN performs similar to MCMC suggesting an improved extraction of small-scale information with IMNN. We also find that IMNN estimates are robust against the choice of simulation. By performing a 2D-parameter estimation for $T_0$ & $\Gamma_{HI}$ we also demonstrate how to take forward this approach observationally in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Suzaku X-ray observations of the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 discovered exceptionally high mass ratios of Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, and Cr/Fe, consistent with a near $M_{\rm Ch}$ progenitor white dwarf (WD). The Suzaku observations have established 3C 397 as our best candidate for a near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ SNR Ia, and opened the way to address additional outstanding questions about the origin and explosion mechanism of these transients. In particular, subsequent XMM-Newton observations revealed an unusually clumpy distribution of iron group elemental (IGE) abundances within the ejecta of 3C 397. In this paper, we undertake a suite of two dimensional hydrodynamical models, varying both the explosion mechanism -- either deflagration-to-detonation (DDT), or pure deflagration -- WD progenitors, and WD progenitor metallicity, and analyze their detailed nucleosynthetic abundances and associated clumping. We find that pure deflagrations naturally give rise to clumpy distributions of neutronized species concentrated towards the outer limb of the remnant, and confirm DDTs have smoothly structured ejecta with a central concentration of neutronization. Our findings indicate that 3C 397 was most likely a pure deflagration of a high central density WD. We discuss a range of implications of these findings for the broader SN Ia progenitor problem.
#### Surface Brightness Fluctuations in Two SPT clusters: a Pilot Study
 - **Authors:** Charles E. Romero, Massimo Gaspari, Gerrit Schellenberger, Bradford A. Benson, Lindsey E. Bleem, Esra Bulbul, Matthias Klein, Ralph Kraft, Paul Nulsen, Christian L. Reichardt, Laura Salvati, Taweewat Somboonpanyakul, Yuanyuan Su

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of surface brightness fluctuations in the intracluster medium (ICM) present an indirect probe of turbulent properties such as the turbulent velocities, injection scales, and the slope of the power spectrum of fluctuations towards smaller scales. With the advancement of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies and surveys relative to X-ray observations, we seek to investigate surface brightness fluctuations in a sample of SPT-SZ clusters which also have archival \textit{XMM-Newton} data. Here we present a pilot study of two typical clusters in that sample: SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and SPT-CLJ0638-5358. We infer injection scales larger than 500 kpc in both clusters and Mach numbers $\approx 0.5$ in SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and Mach numbers $\approx 0.6 - 1.6$ in SPT-CLJ0638-5358, which has a known shock. We find hydrostatic bias values for $M_{500}$ less than 0.2 for SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and less than 0.1 for SPT-CLJ0638-5358. These results show the importance to assess its quantitative values via a detailed multiwavelength approach and suggest that the drivers of turbulence may occur at quite larger scales.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a method for aligning solar observations from different telescopes. We utilized helioprojective coordinates from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) as a reference to align images from ALMA and IRIS. The alignment is based on correlation analysis, employing both the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for assessing data correlations. PCC was preferred for its effectiveness with diverse datasets and its computational efficiency compared to SSIM. The alignment demonstrated less than 1.0\,arcsec variation in average centers between the two methods, ensuring consistent results. We illustrate this method using ALMA observations, labeled D06 in the Solar ALMA Science Archive (SALSA), as a case study.

 - **Abstract**
 Combining archival photometric observations from multiple large-area surveys spanning the past 17 years, we detect long-term variability in the light curves of ZTFJ032833.52-121945.27 (ZTFJ0328-1219), ZTFJ092311.41+423634.16 (ZTFJ0923+4236) and WD1145+017, all known to exhibit transits from planetary debris. ZTFJ0328-1219 showed an overall fading in brightness from 2011 through to 2015, with a maximum dimming of ~0.3 mag, and still remains ~0.1 mag fainter compared to 2006. We complement the analysis of the long-term behaviour of these systems with high-speed photometry. In the case of ZTFJ0923+4236 and WD1145+017, the time-series photometry exhibits vast variations in the level of transit activity, both in terms of numbers of transits, as well as their shapes and depths, and these variations correlate with the overall brightness of the systems. Inspecting the current known sample of white dwarfs with transiting debris, we estimate that similar photometric signatures may be detectable in one in a few hundred of all white dwarfs. Accounting for the highly aligned geometry required to detect transits, our estimates imply that a substantial fraction of all white dwarfs exhibiting photospheric metal pollution from accreted debris host close-in planetesimals that are currently undergoing disintegration.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the Galactic open cluster Berkeley 50 in order to determine its stellar content, distance, and age. We obtained UBV photometry of 1145 stars in a 12.3' $\times$ 12.3' field, and used Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to identify 64 members, of which we obtained spectra of the 17 brightest members. The majority of the observed population we classified as B dwarfs, with the exception of a newly identified red supergiant star, which our spectroscopy shows has a B-type companion. Our study establishes the distance as 3.8 kpc, with an average color-excess $E(B-V)=0.9$. Comparison of the physical properties of the cluster with the Geneva evolutionary tracks places the age of the cluster as 50-60 Myr, with its most massive members being $\sim7M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly-identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources, and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free-free emission. We use measurements of free-free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values $\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured towards proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster, but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially-extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external UV fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster, but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.
#### On Innermost Stable Spherical Orbits near a rotating black hole: A  numerical study of the particle motion near the plunging region

 - **Abstract**
 According to General Relativity, astrophysical black holes are described by a small number of parameters. Apart from the mass of the black hole ($M$), among the most interesting characteristics is the spin ($a$), which determines the degree of rotation, i.e., the angular momentum of the black hole. The latter is observationally constrained by the spectral and timing properties of the radiation signal emerging from an accretion disk of matter orbiting near the event horizon. In the case of planar (standard, equatorial) accretion disk, it is the location of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) that determines the observable radiation characteristics, and this way allows us to measure the spin. In this paper, we discuss a more general case of the Innermost Stable Spherical Orbits (ISSO) extending above and below the equatorial plane. To this end, we study the non-equatorial geodesic motion of particles following inclined, spherical, relativistically precessing trajectories with the aim of exploring the boundary between the regions of stable (energetically bound) and escaping (energetically unbound) motion. The concept of the ISSO radius should play a role in determining the inner rim of a tilted or geometrically thick accretion flow. We demonstrate that the region of inclined bound orbits has a complicated structure due to enhanced precession near the inner rim. We also explore the fate of particles launched below the radius of the Marginally Bound Spherical Orbit (MBSO): these may either plunge into the event horizon or escape to radial infinity.
#### First ALMA observations of the HD 105211 debris disc: A warm dust  component close to a gigayear-old star

 - **Abstract**
 Most debris discs consist of a gas-poor, cold dust belt located tens to hundreds of astronomical units away from the host star. Many cold dust belts exhibit distinct structures attributed to the dynamic interaction of planetary systems. Moreover, in a few systems, additional warm components can be found closer to the central star, resembling the asteroid belt or zodiacal dust in our Solar System. In this work, we investigate the structure of the disc surrounding the nearby F2V star HD 105211, which has a warm excess and a potential asymmetry in the cold belt. We applied the CASA pipeline to obtain the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images. Then we constructed the SED and performed MCMC simulations to fit a model to the ALMA visibility data. To characterise the disc asymmetry, we analysed the ALMA images of two individual observation blocks and compared them to the previous Herschel images. Our modelling reveals that the disc is a narrow ring (23.6+-4.6 au) with low eccentricity positioned at a distance of 133.7+-1.6 au from the central star, which differs from the broad disc (100+-20 au) starting at an inner edge of 87+-2.5 au, inferred from the Herschel images. We found that both observation blocks show excess emission at the stellar position, while OB1 shows an offset between the star and the phase centre, and OB2 shows brightness clumps. We used a two-temperature model to fit the infrared SED and used the ALMA detection to constrain the warm component to a nearly pure blackbody model. The relatively low ratio of actual radius to blackbody radius of the HD105211 debris disc indicates that this system is depleted in small grains, which could indicate that it is dynamically cold. The excess emission from the stellar position suggests that there should be a warm mm-sized dust component close to the star, for which we suggest two possible origins: in situ asteroid belt or comet delivery.
#### The particle acceleration study in blazar jet

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04609
 - **Abstract**
 The particle acceleration of blazar jets is crucial to high-energy astrophysics, yet the acceleration mechanism division in blazar subclasses and the underlying nature of these mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we utilized the synchrotron spectral information (synchrotron peak frequency, $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$, and corresponding curvature, $b_{\rm sy}$) of 2705 blazars from the literature and studied the subject of particle acceleration in blazar jets by analysing the correlation between $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$ and $1/b_{\rm sy}$. Our results suggested that the entire sample follows an energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA). Specifically, the low inverse Compton peak sources (LCPs) follow the mechanism that fluctuations of fractional gain acceleration (FFGA), while the high inverse Compton peak sources (HCPs) follow an acceleration mechanism of EDPA. Our results indicated that the separation between LCPs and HCPs results from the electron peak Lorentz factor ($\gamma_{\rm p}$), and the differentiation should originate from different acceleration mechanisms. Moreover, our study revealed a transition in the acceleration mechanism from FFGA to EDPA around $\log \nu_{\rm sy} \sim 15$ through a detailed analysis of binned-$\log \nu_{\rm sy}$. The mechanism of FFGA dominates the particle acceleration in LCP jets because of stronger jets and the EDPA dominates the particle energy gain in the HCPs due to a more efficient acceleration process.
#### Extrapolation of Type Ia Supernova Spectra into the Near-Infrared Using  PCA

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method of extrapolating the spectroscopic behavior of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regime up to 2.30 $\mu$m using optical spectroscopy. Such a process is useful for accurately estimating K-corrections and other photometric quantities of SNe Ia in the NIR. Principal component analysis is performed on data consisting of Carnegie Supernova Project I & II optical and near-infrared FIRE spectra to produce models capable of making these extrapolations. This method differs from previous spectral template methods by not parameterizing models strictly by photometric light-curve properties of SNe Ia, allowing for more flexibility of the resulting extrapolated NIR flux. A difference of around -3.1% to -2.7% in the total integrated NIR flux between these extrapolations and the observations is seen here for most test cases including Branch core-normal and shallow-silicon subtypes. However, larger deviations from the observation are found for other tests, likely due to the limited high-velocity and broad-line SNe Ia in the training sample. Maximum-light principal components are shown to allow for spectroscopic predictions of the color-stretch light-curve parameter, $s_{BV}$, within approximately $\pm$0.1 units of the value measured with photometry. We also show these results compare well with NIR templates, although in most cases the templates are marginally more fitting to observations, illustrating a need for more concurrent optical+NIR spectroscopic observations to truly understand the diversity of SNe Ia in the NIR.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers is expected to generate a bounty of new astrophysical discoveries, with sensitivities and bandwidths greatly improved compared to current-generation detectors. These detectors will allow us to make exceptional advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics, the dynamics of dense matter, and the cosmic history of compact objects. The fundamental design aspects of these planned interferometers will enable these new discoveries; however, challenges in technical noise, data quality, and calibration have the potential to limit the scientific reach of these instruments. In this work, we evaluate the requirements of these elements for next-generation gravitational-wave science, focusing on how these areas may impact the proposed Cosmic Explorer observatory. We highlight multiple aspects of these fields where additional research and development is required to ensure Cosmic Explorer reaches its full potential.

 - **Abstract**
 While 30 Dor C is a unique superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its luminous non-thermal X-ray emission, the thermal X-ray emission it emanates has not yet been thoroughly investigated and well constrained. Based on the separate ~1 Ms deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we report the discovery of the thermally-emitting plasma in some portions of the western half of 30 Dor C. The thermal emission can be reproduced by a collisional-ionization-equilibrium plasma model with an average electron temperature of ~0.4 keV. We find a significant overabundance of the intermediate-mass elements such as O, Ne, Mg, and Si, which may be indicative of a recent supernova explosion in 30 Dor C. Dynamical properties in combination with the information of the OB association LH 90 suggest that the internal post-main-sequence stars dominate the power of the superbubble and blow it out in the past ~1 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical properties of galactic molecular outflows are important as they could constrain outflow formation mechanisms. We study the properties of the southwest (SW) outflow streamer including gas kinematics, optical depth, dense gas fraction, and shock strength in the central molecular zone of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. We image the molecular emission at a spatial resolution of $\sim$27 pc based on data from the ALCHEMI program. We trace the kinematics of molecular gas with CO(1-0) line. We constrain the optical depth of CO emission with CO/$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio, the dense gas fraction with HCN/CO(1-0) ratio, as well as the shock strength with SiO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio. The CO/$^{13}$CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratio is $\sim$21 in the SW streamer region, which approximates the C/$^{13}$C isotopic abundance ratio. The higher integrated intensity ratio compared to the disk can be attributed to the optically thinner environment for CO(1-0) emission inside the SW streamer. The HCN/CO(1-0) and SiO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios both approach $\sim$0.2 in three giant molecular clouds (GMCs) at the base of the outflow streamers, which implies the higher dense gas fraction and enhanced strength of fast shocks in those GMCs than in the disk. The contours of those two integrated intensity ratios are extended towards the directions of outflow streamers, which connects the enhanced dense gas fraction and shock strength with molecular outflow. Moreover, the molecular gas with enhanced dense gas fraction and shock strength located at the base of the SW streamer shares the same velocity with the outflow. These phenomena suggest that the star formation inside the GMCs can trigger the shocks and further drive the molecular outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 KM2A is one of the main sub-arrays of LHAASO, working on gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics at energies above 10 TeV. Detector simulation is the important foundation for estimating detector performance and data analysis. It is a big challenge to simulate the KM2A detector in the framework of Geant4 due to the need to track numerous photons from a large number of detector units (>6000) with large altitude difference (30 m) and huge coverage (1.3 km^2). In this paper, the design of the KM2A simulation code G4KM2A based on Geant4 is introduced. The process of G4KM2A is optimized mainly in memory consumption to avoid memory overffow. Some simpliffcations are used to signiffcantly speed up the execution of G4KM2A. The running time is reduced by at least 30 times compared to full detector simulation. The particle distributions and the core/angle resolution comparison between simulation and experimental data of the full KM2A array are also presented, which show good agreement.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Bright Star Subtraction (BSS) pipeline for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This pipeline generates an extended PSF model using observed stars and subtracts the model from the bright stars in LSST data. When testing the pipeline on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, we find that the shape of the extended PSF model depends on the location of the detector on the camera's focal plane. The closer a detector is to the edge of the focal plane, the less the extended PSF model is circularly symmetric. We introduce an algorithm that allows the user to consider the location dependency of the model.

 - **Abstract**
 The three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum is a powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and additional general relativistic effects, which become important on large scales. At the same time, wide-angle (WA) effects due to differing lines-of-sight (LOS) on the curved sky also become important with large angular separation. In this work, we accurately model WA and Doppler effects using the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) formalism, before transforming the result into the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM). This mapping from the SFB power spectrum to PSM represents a new way to non-perturbatively model WA and GR effects present in the PSM, which we validate with log-normal mocks. Moreover, for the first time, we can compute the analytical PSM Gaussian covariance on large scales, exactly including WA-induced mode-couplings, without resorting to any plane-parallel approximations.

 - **Abstract**
 Although supernovae is a well-known endpoint of an accreting white dwarf, alternative theoretical possibilities has been discussing broadly, such as the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) event as the endpoint of oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs, either accreting up to or merging to excess the Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf). AIC is an important channel to form neutron stars, especially for those unusual systems, which are hardly produced by core-collapse supernovae. However, the observational evidences for this theoretical predicted event and its progenitor are all very limited. In all of the known progenitors, white dwarfs increase in mass by accretion. Here, we report the discovery of an intriguing binary system Lan 11, consisted of a stripped core-helium-burning hot subdwarf and an unseen compact object of 1.08 to 1.35 $M_{\odot}$. Our binary population synthesis calculations, along with the absence of detection from the deep radio observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, strongly suggest that the latter is an ONe white dwarf. The total mass of this binary is 1.67 to 1.92 $M_{\odot}$}, significantly excessing the Chandrasekhar limit. The reproduction of its evolutionary history indicates that the unique system has undergone two phases of common envelope ejections, implying a born nature of this massive ONe white dwarf rather than an accretion growth from its companion. These results, together with short orbital period of this binary (3.65 hours), suggest that this system will merge in 500-540 Myr, largely triggering an AIC event, although the possibility of type Ia supernova cannot be fully ruled out. This finding greatly provides valuable constraints on our understanding of stellar endpoints, whatever leading to an AIC or a supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 Methods. We utilized the combined five SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey data (eRASS:5) to perform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses of the Centaurus cluster in various directions to large radii. Surface brightness (SB) profiles out to $2R_{200}$ were constructed. We acquired gas temperature, metallicity, and normalization per area profiles out to $R_{200}$. We compared our results with previous Centaurus studies, cluster outskirts measurements, and simulations. Comprehensive sky background analysis was done across the FoV, in particular, to assess the variation of the eROSITA Bubble emission that partially contaminates the field. Results. The processed X-ray images show the known sloshing-induced structures in the core. The core ($r\leq11~\mathrm{kpc}$) is better described with a 2T model than a 1T model. Here, we measured lower T from the cooler component (~1.0 keV) and higher Z ($\sim\!1.6Z_\odot$), signifying an iron bias. In the intermediate radial range, we observed prominent SB and normalization per area excesses in the eastern sector (Cen 45 location), reaching out to $R_{500}$. Temperature enhancements near the location of Cen 45 imply that the gas is shock-heated due to the interaction with Cen 30, the significant excess behind Cen 45 center might be the tail/ram-pressure-stripped gas. We found good agreement between the outskirt temperatures with the profile from simulations and fit from Suzaku outskirts measurements. We detected significant SB emission to the sky background level out to $R_{200}$ with a $3.5\sigma$ and followed by $2.9\sigma$ at $1.1R_{200}$. The metallicity at $R_{500}-R_{200}$ is low but within the ranges of other outskirts studies. Conclusions. We present the first measurement of ICM morphology and properties of Centaurus cluster sampling the whole azimuth beyond $30'$, increasing the probed volume by a factor of almost 30.

 - **Abstract**
 Starobinsky's $R^2$ inflation manifests a best-fit scenario for the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations. Observables derived from the slow-roll picture of the $R^2$ model in the Einstein frame relies on the conformal transformation of the metric, which inevitably induces a unique exponential-type couplings of the rolling scalaron with all matter fields during inflation. The "large-field" nature of the $R^2$ model further invokes non-negligible time and scale dependence to the matter sector through such an exponential coupling, modifying not only the dynamics of matter perturbations on superhorizon scales but also their decay rates. In this work, we identify the simplest observable of the cosmological collider physics built in the background of $R^2$ inflation, focusing on the so-called "quantum primordial clock" signals created by the non-local propagation of massive scalar perturbations. Our numerical formalism based on the unique conformal coupling can have extended applications to (quasi-)single-field inflationary models with non-trivial couplings to gravity or models originated from the $f(R)$ modification of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 The redshift dependence of the cosmic microwave background temperature, $T(z)=T_0(1+z)$, is a key prediction of standard cosmology, but this relation is violated in many extensions thereof. Current astrophysical facilities can probe it in the redshift range $0\le z\le6.34$. We extend recent work by Gelo {\it et al.} (2022) showing that for several classes of models (all of which aim to provide alternative mechanisms for the recent acceleration of the universe) the constraining power of these measurements is comparable to that of other background cosmology probes. Specifically, we discuss constraints on two classes of models not considered in the earlier work: a model with torsion and a recently proposed phenomenological dynamical dark energy model which can be thought of as a varying speed of light model. Moreover, for both these models and also for those in the earlier work, we discuss how current constraints may be improved by next-generation ground and space astrophysical facilities. Overall, we conclude that these measurements have a significant cosmological impact, mainly because they often constrain combinations of model parameters that are orthogonal, in the relevant parameter space, to those of other probes.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio bubbles, ubiquitous features of the intracluster medium around active galactic nuclei, are known to rise buoyantly for multiple scale heights through the intracluster medium (ICM). It is an open question how the bubbles can retain their high-energy cosmic-ray content over such distances. We propose that the enhanced scattering of cosmic rays due to micromirrors generated in the ICM, as proposed recently by Reichherzer et al. (2023), is a viable mechanism for confining the cosmic rays within bubbles and can qualitatively reproduce their morphology. We discuss the observational implications of such a model of cosmic-ray confinement.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first of two papers dedicated to verifying the Australian Epoch of Reionisation pipeline (AusEoRPipe) through simulation. The AusEoRPipe aims to disentangle 21-cm radiation emitted by gas surrounding the very first stars from contaminating foreground astrophysical sources, and has been in development for close to a decade. In this paper, we build an accurate 21-cm sky model that can be used by the WODEN simulation software to create visibilities containing a predictable 21-cm signal. We verify that the power spectrum estimator CHIPS can recover this signal in the absence of foregrounds. We also investigate how measurements in Fourier-space are correlated, and how their gridded density affects the power spectrum. We measure and fit for this effect using Gaussian-noise simulations of the MWA phase I layout. We find a gridding density correction factor of 2.651 appropriate for integrations equal to or greater than 30 minutes of data, which contain observations with multiple primary beam pointings and LSTs. Paper II of this series will use the results of this paper to test the AusEoRPipe in the presence of foregrounds and instrumental effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNRs) may modify the observed line profiles and fluxes and has potential impact on estimating the physical properties of the hot gas and hence on understanding the SNR physics, but has not been theoretically modeled ever. Here we present our Monte-Carlo simulation of RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by O VII He$\alpha$ r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov-Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant. The line profiles are predicted to be asymmetric because of different temperatures and photon production efficiencies of the expanding gas at different radii. We also predict the surface brightness of the line emission would decrease in the outer projected region but is slightly enhanced in the inner. The G-ratio of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet can be effectively elevated by RS in the outer region. We show that RS effect of the O VII He$\alpha$ r line in the southwestern boundary region of Cygnus Loop is non-negligible. The observed OVII G-ratio $\sim$1.8 of the region could be achieved with RS taken into account for properly elevated O abundance from the previous estimates. Additional simulation performed for the SNRs in ejecta-dominated phase like Cas A shows that RS in the shocked ejecta may have some apparently effects on the observational properties of oxygen resonant lines.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new set of tools to derive systemic velocities for single-mode RR~Lyrae stars from visual and near-infrared spectra. We derived scaling relations and line-of-sight velocity templates using both APOGEE and {\it Gaia} spectroscopic products combined with photometric $G$-band amplitudes. We provide a means to estimate systemic velocities for the RR~Lyrae subclasses, RRab and RRc. Our analysis indicates that the scaling relation between the photometric and line-of-sight velocity amplitudes is nonlinear, with a break in a linear relation occurring around 0.4mag in both the $V$-band and $G$-band amplitudes. We did not observe such a break in the relation for the first-overtone pulsators. Using stellar pulsation models, we further confirm and examine the nonlinearity in scaling relation for the RRab subclass. We observed little to no variation with stellar parameters (mass, metallicity, and luminosity) in the scaling relation between the photometric and line-of-sight velocity amplitudes for fundamental-mode pulsators. We observed an offset in the scaling relation between the observations and stellar pulsation models, mainly in the low-amplitude RR~Lyrae regime. This offset disappears when different sets of convective parameters are used. Thus, the Fourier amplitudes obtained from the photometry and line-of-sight velocity measurements can be utilized to constrain convective parameters of stellar pulsation models. The scaling relations and templates for APOGEE and {\it Gaia} data accurately predict systemic velocities compared to literature values. In addition, our tools derived from the {\it Gaia} spectra improve the precision of the derived systemic velocities by approximately 50 percent and provide a better description of the uncertainty distribution in comparison with previous studies. Our newly derived tools will be used for RR~Lyrae variables observed toward the Galactic bulge.

 - **Abstract**
 Achieving a truly accurate wavelength calibration of high-dispersion echelle spectrographs is a challenging task but crucially needed for certain science cases, e.g. to test for a possible variation of the fine-structure constant in quasar spectra. One of the spectrographs best suited for this mission is VLT/ESPRESSO. Nevertheless, previous studies have identified significant discrepancies between the classical wavelength solutions and the one derived independently from the laser frequency comb. The dominant parts of these systematics were intra-order distortions, most-likely related to a deviation of the instrumental line-spread function from the assumed Gaussian shape. Here, we therefore present a study focused on a detailed modeling of the ESPRESSO instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate that it is strongly asymmetric, non-Gaussian, different for the two slices and fibers, and varies significantly along the spectral orders. Incorporating the determined non-parametric model in the wavelength calibration process drastically improves the wavelength calibration accuracy, reducing the discrepancies between the two independent wavelength solutions from 50m/s to about 10m/s. The most striking success is, however, that the different fibers and slices now provide fully consistent measurements with a scatter of just a couple m/s. This demonstrates that the instrument-related systematics can be nearly eliminated over most of the spectral range by properly taking into account the complex shape of the instrumental line-spread function and paves the way for further optimizations of the wavelength calibration process.

 - **Abstract**
 The HI 21cm global signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) offers critical insights into the evolution of our Universe. Yet, its detection presents significant challenges due to its extremely low signal-to-contamination ratio and complex instrumental systematics. In this paper, we examine the effects of the ionosphere and antenna beam on data analysis. The ionosphere, an ionized plasma layer in the Earth's atmosphere, refracts, absorbs, and emits radio waves in the relevant frequency range. This interaction results in additional spectral distortion of the observed signal, complicating the process of foreground subtraction. Additionally, chromatic variations in the beam can also introduce further contamination into the global spectrum measurement. Notably, the ionospheric effect, being dependent on the direction of incoming light, interacts with the instrumental beam, adding another layer of complexity. To address this, we evaluate three different fitting templates of foreground: the logarithmic polynomial, the physically motivated EDGES template, and a SVD-based template. Our findings indicate that the EDGES and SVD templates generally surpass logarithmic polynomials in performance. Recognizing the significance of beam chromaticity, we further investigate specific beam distortion models and their impacts on the signal extraction process.

 Transit photometry is currently the most efficient and sensitive method for detecting extrasolar planets (exoplanets) and a large majority of confirmed exoplanets have been detected with this method. The substantial success of space-based missions such as NASA's Kepler/K2 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has generated a large and diverse sample of confirmed and candidate exoplanets. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) provides a useful tool for studying photometric time series and exoplanetary transits. SSA is a technique for decomposing a time series into a sum of its main components, where each component is a separate time series that incorporates specific information from the behavior of the initial time series. SSA can be implemented for extracting important information (such as main trends and signals) from the photometry data or reducing the noise factors. The detectability and accurate characterization of an exoplanetary transit signal is principally determined by its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Stellar variability of the host star, small planet to star radius ratio, background noises from other sources in the field of observations and instrumental noise can cause lower SNRs and consequently, more complexities or inaccuracies in the modeling of the transit signals, which in turn leads to the inaccurate inference of the astrophysical parameters of the planetary object. Therefore, implementing SSA leads to a more accurate characterization of exoplanetary transits and is also capable of detecting transits with low SNRs ($SNR<10$). In this paper, after discussing the principles and properties of SSA, we investigate its applications for studying photometric transit data and detecting low SNR exoplanet candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Empirical constraints on the internal dynamics of open clusters are important for understanding their evolution and evaporation. High precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 are thus useful to observe aspects of the cluster dynamics. This work aims to identify dynamically peculiar clusters such as spinning and expanding clusters. We also quantify the spin frequency and expansion rate and compare them with $N$-body models to identify the origins of the peculiarities. We used the latest Gaia DR3 and archival spectroscopic surveys to analyse the radial velocities and proper motions of the cluster members in 1379 open clusters. A systematic analysis of synthetic clusters is performed to demonstrate the observability of the cluster spin along with effects of observational uncertainties. $N$-body simulations were used to understand the evolution of cluster spin and expansion for initially non-rotating clusters. We identified spin signatures in 10 clusters (and 16 candidates). Additionally, we detected expansion in 18 clusters and contraction in 3 clusters. The expansion rate is compatible with previous theoretical estimates based on expulsion of residual gas. The orientation of the spin axis is independent of the orbital angular momentum. The spin frequencies are much larger than what is expected from simulated initially non-rotating clusters. This indicates that >1% of the clusters are born rotating and/or they have undergone strong interactions. Higher precision observations are required to increase the sample of such dynamically peculiar clusters and to characterise them.

 Gamma-ray bursts are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. The recent GRB 221009A event, identified as the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hadronic emissions involving neutrinos. The KM3NeT undersea neutrino detectors participated in the worldwide follow-up effort triggered by the event, searching for neutrino events. In this letter, we summarize subsequent searches, in a wide energy range from MeV up to a few PeVs. No neutrino events are found in any of the searches performed. Upper limits on the neutrino emission associated with GRB 221009A are computed.

 Millimeter-waveband spectra of Venus from both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provide conclusive evidence (signal-to-noise ratio of about $15\sigma$) of a phosphine absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. Phosphine is an important biomarker; e.g., the trace of phosphine in the Earth's atmosphere is uniquivocally associated with anthropogenic activity and microbial life (which produces this highly reducing gas even in an overall oxidizing environment). Motivated by the JCMT and ALMA tantalizing observations we reexamine whether Venus could accommodate Earthly life. More concretly, we hypothesize that the microorganisms populating the venusian atmosphere are not free floating but confined to the liquid environment inside cloud aerosols or droplets. Armed with this hypothesis, we generalize a study of airborne germ transmission to constrain the maximum size of droplets that could be floating in the venusian atmosphere and estimate whether their Stokes fallout times to reach moderately high temperatures are pronouncedly larger than the microbe's replication time. We also comment on the effect of cosmic ray showers on the evolution of aerial microbial life.

 - **Abstract**
 Because of the small strain amplitudes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals, unveiling them in the presence of detector/environmental noise is challenging. For visualizing the signals and extracting its waveform for a comparison with theoretical prediction, a frequency-domain whitening process is commonly adopted for filtering the data. In this work, we propose an alternative template-free framework based on autoregressive modeling for denoising the GW data and extracting the waveform. We have tested our framework on extracting the injected signals from the simulated data as well as a series of known compact binary coalescence (CBC) events from the LIGO data. Comparing with the conventional whitening procedure, our methodology generally yields improved cross-correlation and reduced root mean square errors with respect to the signal model.

 - **Abstract**
 EX Lupi, a low-mass young stellar object, went into an accretion-driven outburst in March of 2022. The outburst caused a sudden phase change of ~ 112$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$ in periodically oscillating multiband lightcurves. Our high resolution spectra obtained with HRS on SALT also revealed a consistent phase change in the periodically varying radial velocities, along with an increase in the radial velocity amplitude of various emission lines. The phase change and increase of radial velocity amplitude morphologically translates to a change in the azimuthal and latitudinal location of the accretion hotspot over the stellar surface, which indicates a reconfiguration of the accretion funnel geometry. Our 3D MHD simulations reproduce the phase change for EX Lupi. To explain the observations we explored the possibility of forward shifting of the dipolar accretion funnel as well as the possibility of an emergence of a new accretion funnel. During the outburst, we also found evidence of the hotspot's morphology extending azimuthally, asymmetrically with a leading hot edge and cold tail along the stellar rotation. Our high cadence photometry showed that the accretion flow has clumps. We also detected possible clumpy accretion events in the HRS spectra, that showed episodically highly blue-shifted wings in the Ca II IRT and Balmer H lines.

 We present new results on PHL 5038AB, a widely separated binary system composed of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf, refining the white and brown dwarf parameters and determining the binary separation to be $66^{+12}_{-24}$~AU. New spectra of the white dwarf show calcium absorption lines suggesting the hydrogen-rich atmosphere is weakly polluted, inferring the presence of planetesimals in the system, which we determine are in an S-type orbit around the white dwarf in orbits closer than 17-32 AU. We do not detect any infrared excess that would indicate the presence of a disc, suggesting all dust present has either been totally accreted or is optically thin. In this system, we suggest the metal pollution in the white dwarf atmosphere can be directly attributed to the presence of the brown dwarf companion disrupting the orbits of planetesimals within the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* < 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy provides an avenue to study the atmosphere of both transiting and non-transiting planets. This powerful method has also yielded some of the most robust atmospheric detections to date. Currently, high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy detects atmospheric signals by cross-correlating observed data with a model atmospheric spectrum. This technique has been successful in detecting various molecules such as H2O, CO, HCN and TiO, as well as several atomic species. Here we present an alternative method of performing high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy, using a technique known as Doppler tomography. We present an analysis of HD 179949 b using Doppler tomography and provide Doppler tomograms confirming previous detections of CO at 2.3 microns, and H2O at both 2.3 microns, and 3.5 microns within the atmosphere of HD 179949 b, showing significantly lower background noise levels when compared to cross-correlation methods applied to the same data. We also present a novel detection of H2O at 2.1 microns, as well as a tentative detection of CO on the night side of the planet at 2.3 microns. This represents the first observational evidence for molecular absorption in the night-side emission spectrum of an exoplanet using Doppler spectroscopy.
#### The impact of Population III stars on the astrophysical  gravitational-wave background

 - **Abstract**
 We probe the astrophysical gravitational-wave background resulting from compact binary coalescences, focusing on Population III binary black holes. We exploit results of state-of-the-art simulations on the evolution of Population I-II and III binaries, considering a variety of initial condition and star formation rate models for the latter. The contribution from Population III binary black holes is found to be very small, with no effect on the gravitational-wave spectrum. A network of third-generation detectors will detect easier individual Population III binaries, due to their significantly higher masses, hence decreasing even further their residual contribution.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop and apply a new framework for reconstructing the ionization history during the epoch of recombination with combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova data. We find a wide range of ionization histories that are consistent with current CMB data, and also that cosmological parameter constraints are significantly weakened once freedom in recombination is introduced. BAO data partially break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters and the recombination model, and are therefore important in these reconstructions. The 95% confidence upper limits on H0 are 80.1 (70.7) km/s/Mpc given CMB (CMB+BAO) data, assuming no other changes are made to the standard cosmological model. Including Cepheid-calibrated supernova data in the analysis drives a preference for non-standard recombination histories with visibility functions that peak early and exhibit appreciable skewness. Forthcoming measurements from SPT-3G will reduce the uncertainties in our reconstructions by about a factor of two.
#### Quintessential interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of  DESI

 - **Abstract**
 The recent result of DESI in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the EoS parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.
