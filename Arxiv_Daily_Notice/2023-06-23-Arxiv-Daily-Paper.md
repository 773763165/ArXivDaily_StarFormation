 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar small bodies are unique probes into the histories of exoplanetary systems. One hypothesized class of interlopers are "Jurads," exo-comets released into the Milky Way during the post-main sequence as the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) host stars lose mass. In this study, we assess the prospects for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to detect a Jurad and examine whether such an interloper would be observationally distinguishable from exo-comets ejected during the (pre-)main sequence. Using analytic and numerical methods, we estimate the fraction of exo-Oort Cloud objects that are released from 1-8 solar mass stars during post-main sequence evolution. We quantify the extent to which small bodies are altered by the increased luminosity and stellar outflows during the AGB, finding that some Jurads may lack hypervolatiles and that stellar winds could deposit dust that covers the entire exo-comet surface. Next, we construct models of the interstellar small body reservoir for various size-frequency distribution slopes, characteristic sizes, and the total mass sequestered in the minor planets of exo-Oort Clouds. Even with the LSST's increased search volume compared to contemporary surveys, we find that detecting a Jurad is unlikely but not infeasible given the current understanding of (exo)planet formation.
#### An insight into Capella (alpha Aurigae): from the extent of core  overshoot to its evolutionary history

 - **Abstract**
 The binary star alpha Aurigae (otherwise known as Capella) is extremely important to understand the core hydrogen and helium burning phases of the stars, as the primary star is likely evolving through the core helium burning phase, and the masses of the two components are 2.5 Msun and 2.6 Msun, which fall into a mass range for which the extention of the core overshoot during the main sequence phase is uncertain. We aim at deriving the extent of the core overshoot experienced during the core burning phases and testing the efficiency of the convective transport of energy in the external envelope, by comparing results from stellar evolution modelling with the results from the observations. We consider evolutionary tracks calculated on purpose for the present work, for the primary and secondary star of Capella. We determine the extent of the extra-mixing from the core during the main sequence evolution and the age of the system, by requiring that the effective temperatures and surface gravities of the model stars reproduce those derived from the observations at the same epoch. We further check consistency between the observed and predicted surface chemistry of the stars. Consistency between results from stellar evolution modelling and the observations of Capella is found when extra-mixing from the core is assumed, the extent of the extra-mixed zone being of the order of 0.25 H_P. The age of the system is estimated to be 710 Myr. These results allow to nicely reproduce the observed surface chemistry, particularly the recent determination of the 12C/13C ratio based on LBT (Large Binocular Telescope) and VATT (Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope) observations

 - **Abstract**
 In the centre of pre-stellar cores, deuterium fractionation is enhanced due to the low temperatures and high densities. Therefore, the chemistry of deuterated molecules can be used to study the earliest stages of star formation. We analyse the deuterium fractionation of simple molecules, comparing the level of deuteration in the envelopes of the pre-stellar core L1544 in Taurus and the protostellar core HH211 in Perseus. We used single-dish observations of CCH, HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, and their $^{13}$C-, $^{18}$O- and D-bearing isotopologues, detected with the Onsala 20m telescope. We derived the column densities and the deuterium fractions of the molecules. Additionally, we used radiative transfer simulations and results from chemical modelling to reproduce the observed molecular lines. We used new collisional rate coefficients for HNC, HN$^{13}$C, DNC, and DCN that consider the hyperfine structure of these molecules. We find high levels of deuteration for CCH (10%) in both sources, consistent with other carbon chains, and moderate levels for HCN (5-7%) and HNC (8%). The deuterium fraction of HCO$^+$ is enhanced towards HH211, most likely caused by isotope-selective photodissociation of C$^{18}$O. Similar levels of deuteration show that the process is likely equally efficient towards both cores, suggesting that the protostellar envelope still retains the chemical composition of the original pre-stellar core. The fact that the two cores are embedded in different molecular clouds also suggests that environmental conditions do not have a significant effect on the deuteration within dense cores. Radiative transfer modelling shows that it is necessary to include the outer layers of the cores to consider the effects of extended structures. Besides HCO$^+$ observations, HCN observations towards L1544 also require the presence of an outer diffuse layer where the molecules are relatively abundant.

 - **Abstract**
 We recommend a deeper extension to the High-Latitute Wide Area Survey planned to be conducted by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (\emph{Roman}). While this deeper-tier survey extension can support a range of astrophysical investigations, it is particularly well suited to characterize the dark matter substructure in galactic halos and reveal the microphysics of dark matter through gravitational lensing. We quantify the expected yield of \emph{Roman} for finding galaxy-galaxy-type gravitational lenses and motivate observational choices to optimize the \emph{Roman} core community surveys for studying dark matter substructure. In the proposed survey, we expect to find, on average, one strong lens with a characterizable substructure per \emph{Roman} tile (0.28 squared degrees), yielding approximately 500 such high-quality lenses. With such a deeper legacy survey, \emph{Roman} will outperform any current and planned telescope within the next decade in its potential to characterize the concentration and abundance of dark matter subhalos in the mass range 10$^7$-10$^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$.
#### Scattering Transparency of Clouds in Exoplanet Transit Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of aerosols in an exoplanet atmosphere can veil the underlying material and can lead to a flat transmission spectrum during primary transit observations. In this work, we explore forward scattering effects from super-micron sized aerosol particles present in the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet. We find that the impacts of forward scattering from larger aerosols can significantly impact exoplanet transits and the strength of these effects can be dependent on wavelength. In certain cloud configurations, the forward-scattered light can effectively pass through the clouds unhindered, thus rendering the clouds transparent. The dependence of the aerosol scattering properties on wavelength can then lead to a positive slope in the transit spectrum. These slopes are characteristically different from both Rayleigh and aerosol absorption slopes. As examples, we demonstrate scattering effects for both a rocky world and a hot Jupiter. In these models, the predicted spectral slopes due to forward scattering effects can manifest in the transit spectrum at the level of $\sim$10s to $\sim$100s of parts per million and, hence, could be observable with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 It remains unclear how galactic environment affects star formation and stellar cluster properties. This is difficult to address in Milky Way-mass galaxy simulations because of limited resolution and less accurate feedback compared to cloud-scale models. We carry out zoom-in simulations to re-simulate 100-300 pc regions of a Milky Way-like galaxy using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, including finer resolution (0.4 Msun per particle), cluster-sink particles, ray-traced photoionization from O stars, H$_2$/CO chemistry, and ISM heating/cooling. We select $10^6$ Msun cloud complexes from a galactic bar, inner spiral arm, outer arm, and inter-arm region (in order of galactocentric radius), retaining the original galactic potentials. The surface densities of star formation rate and neutral gas follow $\Sigma_{SFR} \propto \Sigma_{gas}^{1.3}$, with the bar lying higher up the relation than the other regions. However, the inter-arm region forms stars 2-3x less efficiently than the arm models at the same $\Sigma_{gas}$. The bar produces the most massive cluster, the inner arm the second, and the inter-arm the third. Almost all clusters in the bar and inner arm are small (radii < 5 pc), while 30-50 per cent of clusters in the outer arm and inter-arm have larger radii more like associations. Bar and inner arm clusters rotate at least twice as fast, on average, than clusters in the outer arm and inter-arm regions. The degree of spatial clustering also decreases from bar to inter-arm. Our results indicate that young massive clusters, potentially progenitors of globular clusters, may preferentially form near the bar/inner arm compared to outer arm/inter-arm regions.
