          The Cosmic Microwave Background: Spectral Distortions

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) traveled the cosmos long before it reached our telescopes today. Consequently, it is one of the best probes of fundamental processes in the early Universe that we could hope to observe. The cosmological information is encoded in two distinct ways. First, we can investigate how the CMB photons in one sky-direction are distributed across energy by focusing on information carried by the CMB frequency spectrum. Second, we can compare the flux of CMB photons that we receive from different directions, this time at a fixed frequency, to study the CMB anisotropies. In the past six decades since the serendipitous discovery of the CMB in 1965, cosmologists have advanced both frontiers in terms of theory and observation. In this chapter, I will give a broad-brush overview about how the CMB spectrum forms and evolves throughout cosmic history, mentioning CMB anisotropies only on the side. I will attempt to highlight some of the key theoretical ingredients that allowed us to establish the detailed picture of the Universe we have today. With this, I hope to convince you that, beyond the impressive past successes, the CMB still holds many treasures for us, and will keep generations of scientists busy for the decades to come.

          Press-Schechter Formalism and The PBH Mass Distributions

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we derive the primordial black hole (PBH) mass function using the Press-Schechter formalism, particularly using the excursion set approach, which is a powerful statistical method for obtaining the mass functions and modeling the formation of PBHs in the early universe by invoking the concepts like random walks. The excursion set formalism provides a framework for calculating the mass function by tracking the evolution of density fluctuations in the primordial universe and their subsequent collapse into PBHs uponcrossing critical barriers. By applying this theory, we compute the PBH mass function and explore its dependence on key parameters such as the peak mass,standard deviation, and initial PBH fraction. We also incorporate the effects of observational constraints, including microlensing and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements, to place limits on the PBH population across different mass ranges. Our results offer important insights into the role of PBHs as potential dark matter candidates and their contribution to the overall matter content in the universe. The derived mass function provides a basis for further exploration of PBH formation, growth, and their possible detection through gravitational waves and other cosmological signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 In active galactic nuclei, X-ray illumination of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the production of the K$\alpha$ fluorescent line of iron, which provides insights into accretion physics and SMBH spins. In this work, we studied X-ray reflection from the accretion disk in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 using all the data collected by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer. We used hardness-ratio diagrams to distinguish between different spectral states and conducted spectral analysis of all the multi-epoch datasets, as well as the source in the observed spectral states. Our hardness analysis indicates that the source gradually evolved into a harder state (2013-2016) compared to the previous epochs (2000-2001). Our spectral modeling implies that the relativistically broadened iron emission from the innermost accretion disk is associated with a near-maximal SMBH spin ($a=0.98^{+0.02}_{-0.12}$) in all the datasets, even though the hard state was present in 17% of them, and a consistent spin is also found in different spectral states. In addition, the narrow, bright Fe K$\alpha$ line from distant regions has an excess velocity of $620^{+80}_{-70}$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the rest frame, implying that some distant layers of the disk could be twisted. Our results suggest that, despite long-term changes in the X-ray brightness of NGC 3783, likely caused by eclipsing material, the relativistic reflection can be constrained thanks to the substantial counts provided by multi-epoch observations, while a warped disk structure may be present.

          Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code & Validation

 - **Abstract**
 To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.

          Neutrino Mass Constraints from kSZ Tomography

 - **Abstract**
 We forecast neutrino mass constraints using Stage IV CMB and large-scale structure surveys, focusing on kSZ tomography as an independent probe of the growth of cosmic structure. We take into account several realistic factors, including the kSZ optical depth degeneracy. Our baseline setup consists of CMB S4 temperature and polarization (but not lensing) information, DESI BAO, the LSST galaxy power spectrum, and a Planck like $\tau$ prior, yielding $\sigma(\sum m_\nu) = 32\, \rm{meV}$. Adding kSZ tomography improves this by a few percent, while a kSZ optical depth prior can push this improvement to over $15\%$, giving $\sigma(\sum m_\nu) = 27\, \rm{meV}$. When CMB lensing is included in the baseline setup, kSZ does not further improve neutrino mass constraints. We find promising prospects for a scenario combining futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys.

          The Qz5 Survey (I): How the HI Mass Density of the Universe Evolves With Cosmic Time

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass density of the Universe ($\rho_{HI}$) increases with cosmic time since $z \sim 5$, peaks at $z \sim 3$, and then decreases toward $z \sim 0$. This is the first result of Qz5, our spectroscopic survey of 63 quasars at $z \gtrsim 5$ with VLT/X-SHOOTER and Keck/ESI aimed at characterizing intervening HI gas absorbers at $z \sim 5$. The main feature of Qz5 is the high resolution ($R \sim 7000 - 9000$) of the spectra, which allows us to (1) accurately detect high column density HI gas absorbers in an increasingly neutral intergalactic medium at $z \sim 5$ and (2) determine the reliability of previous $\rho_{HI}$ measurements derived with lower resolution spectroscopy. We find 5 intervening Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z > 4.5$, which corresponds to the lowest DLA incidence rate ($0.034^{0.05}_{0.02}$) at $z \gtrsim 2$. We also measure the lowest $\rho_{HI}$ at $z \gtrsim 2$ from our sample of DLAs and subDLAs, corresponding to $\rho_{HI} = 0.56^{0.82}_{0.31} \times 10^8~$M$_{\odot}~$Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 5$. Taking into account our measurements at $z \sim 5$ and systematic biases in the DLA detection rate at lower spectral resolutions, we conclude that $\rho_{HI}$ doubles from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 3$. From these results emerges a qualitative agreement between how the cosmic densities of HI gas mass, molecular gas mass, and star-formation rate build up with cosmic time.

          ASKAP EMU Radio Detection of the Reflection Nebula VdB-80 in the Monoceros Crossbones Filamentary Structure

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new radio detection from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey associated with the reflection nebula (RN) VdB-80. The radio detection is determined to be a previously unidentified HII region, now named Lagotis. The RN is located towards Monoceros, centred in the molecular cloud feature known as the `Crossbones'. The 944 MHz EMU image shows a roughly semicircular HII region with an integrated flux density of 30.2$\pm$0.3 mJy. The HII region is also seen at 1.4 GHz by NVSS, yielding an estimated spectral index of 0.65$\pm$0.51, consistent with thermal radio emission. Gaia DR3 and 2MASS data give a distance to the stars associated with the HII region of $\sim$960 pc. This implies a size of 0.76$\times$0.68($\pm$0.09) pc for the HII region. We derive an HII region electron density of the bright radio feature to be 26 cm$^{-3}$, requiring a Lyman-alpha photon flux of $10^{45.6}$ s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the expected Lyman flux of HD 46060, the B2II type star which is the likely ionising star of the region. The derived distance to this region implies that the Crossbones feature is a superposition of two filamentary clouds, with Lagotis embedded in the far cloud.

          Redefining $Q$ for multi-component discs of stars and gas

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We point out a fundamental mismatch in the $Q$ stability parameter for Galactic discs: Toomre's $Q = 1$ defines the boundary between axisymmetric stability/instability, while simulations, observations, and theoretical expectations apply $Q$ in the region $Q > 1$ as a measure for spiral activity (e.g. swing amplification), for which $Q$ has not been designed. We suggest to redefine $Q$ to keep $Q = 1$ as the stability boundary, but to equally yield a consistent map between $Q$ and the maximum swing amplification factor. Using the Goldreich-Lynden-Bell formalism, we find that particularly the $Q$ for gas discs has been mismatched, and should be redefined to close to the square of the traditional definition. We provide new formulations of $Q$ for simple, two-component, and multi-component discs, including a discussion of vertically extended discs, providing a simple iterative formula for which we also provide code. We find $Q \approx 1.58$ for the Solar Neighbourhood under our definition, closer to results from simulations. We compare the Milky Way and M74, showing that, consistent with observations, the theory suggests a higher $m$ number for the Milky Way (arguing against a 2-arm pattern) for stellar-dominated patterns. Gas instability arises at much smaller scales ($m \gtrsim 10$), and we link both M74's gas pattern and local spurs in the Milky Way to this gas instability rather than stellar spiral arms.

          VODKA: Complex molecular gas dynamics in a kpc-separation z=2.17 dual quasar with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 In galaxy mergers, dual quasars - two actively accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) - provide a unique opportunity to study the interplay between galaxy dynamics and quasar activity. However, very little is known about their molecular gas, which fuels star formation and quasar activity. In this study, we map the kinematics of the cold molecular gas in J0749+2255, a 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar at z=2.17 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 4. We detect CO(4-3)650um, which shows remarkably complex morphological and kinematic structures. While the integrated CO map suggested a lens-like ring, this feature disappears with kinematic decomposition. The kinematic analysis with ALMA resolves the ambiguities introduced by previous observations, further supporting the dual quasar interpretation of J0749+2255. We find two kinematically distinct molecular gas components: spatially extended, yet dynamically complex slow-moving gas (FWHM~130 km/s), and a compact, blueshifted, fast-moving, turbulent gas (FWHM~300 km/s). The disturbed kinematics, likely driven by the merger, show hints of rotation but no molecular outflows, suggesting circumnuclear flows. We estimate a large molecular gas reservoir ($M_{H2}\sim10^{10} M_{\odot}$), yet the starburst activity appears to exceed the available fuel. We detect an extended continuum in excess at rest-frame 455 GHz. The kinematic complexity of CO implicates the connection of mergers on the starburst and quasar activity in J0749+2255, yet whether J0749+2255 represents the dual quasar population remains unclear. Targeted kinematic studies of larger dual quasar samples will be essential to disentangling the nature of dual quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 The companion GL229B was recently resolved by Xuan et al. (2024) as a tight binary of two brown dwarfs (Ba and Bb) through VLTI-GRAVITY interferometry and VLT-CRIRES+ RV measurements. Here, we present Bayesian models of the interferometric and RV data in additional detail, along with an updated outer orbit of the brown dwarf pair about the primary. To create a model of the inner orbit with robust uncertainties, we apply kernel phases to the GRAVITY data to address baseline redundancy in the raw closure phases. Using parallel tempering, we constrain the binary's orbit using only VLTI-GRAVITY data, despite each epoch having low visibility-plane coverage and/or SNR. We demonstrate very agreement the VLTI-GRAVITY and CRIRES+ datasets and find that the inner binary has a period of 12.1346$\pm$0.0011 days, eccentricity of 0.2317$\pm$0.0025, and total mass of 71.0$\pm$0.4 Mjup, with Ba and Bb having masses of 37.7$\pm$1.1Mjup and 33.4$\pm$1.0Mjup respectively. With new Keck/NIRC2 astrometry, we update the outer orbit GL229B around the primary. We find a semi-major axis of 42.9+3.0-2.4AU, eccentricity of 0.736$\pm$0.014, and a total mass for B of 71.7$\pm$0.6Mjup, consistent with that derived from the inner orbit. We find a mutual inclination of 31$\pm$2.5deg, below the threshold for Kozai-Lidov oscillations. The agreement on the mass of Ba+Bb between the inner and outer orbits is an important test of our ability to model RV, astrometry, and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. Our methodological advances in handling interferometric data with low SNR and sparse UV-coverage will benefit future observations of rapidly-orbiting companions with VLTI-GRAVITY.

          Black Holes and Higgs Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes, dark energy, and the Higgs field are all currently established, exciting, and mysterious, each in its own way. Cosmological data show that dark energy may evolve with time. The electroweak phase transition during stellar collapse can provide a mechanism via the Higgs field for dark energy to be trapped inside black holes at the time of their formation. Using the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of collapse, we calculate the total matter and dark energy densities in a black hole, to be in the ratio of 2 to 1 at the start of collapse. The solution for the scale factor a(t) is a cycloid with a collapse time of 57 \mu s. If black holes are cosmologically coupled and grow in mass as the universe expands, they can account for the evolution and quantity of the dark energy of the universe.

          Dynamic spectral tailoring of a 10 GHz laser frequency comb for enhanced calibration of astronomical spectrographs

 - **Abstract**
 Laser frequency combs (LFCs) are an important component of Doppler radial velocity (RV) spectroscopy that pushes fractional precision to the $10^{-10}$ level, as required to identify and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. However, large intensity variations across the LFC spectrum that arise in nonlinear broadening limit the range of comb lines that can be used for optimal wavelength calibration with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, temporal spectral-intensity fluctuations of the LFC, that are coupled to flux-dependent detector defects, alter the instrumental point spread function (PSF) and result in spurious RV shifts. To address these issues and improve calibration precision, spectral flattening is crucial for LFCs to maintain a constant photon flux per comb mode. In this work, we demonstrate a dynamic spectral shaping setup using a spatial light modulator (SLM) over the wavelength range of 800nm to 1300nm. The custom shaping compensates for amplitude fluctuations in real time and can also correct for wavelength-dependent spectrograph transmission, achieving a spectral profile that delivers the constant readout necessary for maximizing precision. Importantly, we characterize the out-of-loop properties of the spectral flattener to verify a twofold improvement in spectral stability. This technique, combined with our approach of pumping the waveguide spectral broadener out-of-band at 1550 nm, reduces the required dynamic range. While this spectral region is tailored for the LFC employed at the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph, the method is broadly applicable to any LFC used for astronomical spectrograph calibration.

          Characterization of Residual Charge Images in LSST Camera e2v CCDs

 - **Abstract**
 LSST Camera CCDs produced by the manufacturer e2v exhibit strong and novel residual charge images when exposed to bright sources. These manifest in images following bright exposures both in the same pixel areas as the bright source, and in the pixels trailing between the source and the serial register. Both of these pose systematic challenges to the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time instrument signature removal. The latter trail region is especially impactful as it affects a much larger pixel area in a less well defined position. In our study of this effect at UC Davis, we imaged bright spots to characterize these residual charge effects. We find a strong dependence of the residual charge on the parallel clocking scheme, including the relative levels of the clocking voltages, and the timing of gate phase transition during the parallel transfer. Our study points to independent causes of residual charge in the bright spot region and trail region. We propose potential causes in both regions and suggest methodologies for minimizing residual charge. We consider the trade-offs to these methods including decreasing the camera's full well and dynamic range at the high end. Some of these results and suggestions have been reviewed by the camera commissioning team and may result in changes made to the clocking voltage scheme on the LSST Camera.

          Tests and calibrations of stellar models with two triply eclipsing triple systems

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the possibility of using two recently characterised triply eclipsing triple systems to constrain stellar model parameters. We specifically focused on evaluating the influence of the underlying astrophysical assumptions employed in the characterisation of the system to fix absolute values of the radii, effective temperatures, and metallicity. We used dense grids of pre-computed stellar models to fit the data for the triply eclipsing systems with a modified version of the SCEPtER pipeline. We achieve an excellent agreement with observational data for TIC 650024463, which comprises three low-mass main-sequence (MS) stars. We find it has an age of $9.0^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ Gyr and a multimodal posterior density. Characterising TIC 323486857 proved more challenging. This system comprises two intermediate-mass MS stars and a slightly more massive tertiary in the red giant branch phase. For this last system we tested alternative scenarios for convective core overshooting. When all stars were assumed to have the same overshooting efficiency, significant discrepancies arose with the observed data for the tertiary star. This discrepancy may arise from the different assumptions regarding overshooting efficiency made for the observational characterisation of the system, in which an increasing overshooting efficiency with stellar mass was adopted. By allowing independent overshooting efficiencies for all stars, we recovered a solution close to that adopted in the system observational characterisation. Encouragingly, despite the relevant differences between the adopted stellar models and those used for the observational characterisation, we found a system age of $2.33^{+0.18}_{-0.16}$ Gyr in all the tested scenarios, and this age is in agreement with independent determinations.

          A ZTF Search for Circumstellar Debris Transits in White Dwarfs: Six New Candidates, one with Gas Disk Emission, identified in a Novel Metric Space

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WDs) showing transits from orbiting planetary debris provide significant insights into the structure and dynamics of debris disks. This is a rare class of objects with only eight published systems. In this work, we perform a systematic search for such systems within 500 pc in the Gaia-eDR3 catalog of WDs using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and present six new candidates. Our selection process targets the top 1% most photometrically variable sources identified using a combined variability metric from ZTF and Gaia eDR3 photometry, boosted by a metric space we define using von Neumann statistics and Pearson-Skew as a novel discovery tool to identify these systems. This is followed by optical spectroscopic observations of visually selected variables to confirm metal pollution. Four of the six systems show long-timescale photometric variability spanning several months to years, resulting either from long-term evolution of transit activity or dust and debris clouds at wide orbits. Among them, WD J1013-0427 shows an indication of reddening during the long-duration dip. Interpreting this as dust extinction makes it the first system to indicate an abundance of small dust grains (radius $\lesssim$$0.3~{\rm \mu m}$) in the occulting material. The same object also shows metal emission lines that map an optically thick eccentric gas disk orbiting within the star's Roche limit. For each candidate, we infer the abundances of the photospheric metals and estimate accretion rates. We show that transiting debris systems tend to have higher inferred accretion rates compared to the general population of metal-polluted WDs. Growing the number of these systems will further illuminate such comparative properties in the near future. Separately, we also serendipitously discovered an AM CVn showing a very long-duration outburst $-$ only the fourth such system to be known.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) generally share common propagation features, leading to consistent spectral observations of secondary nuclei such as Li, Be, and B. However, the Li spectrum predicted by the CR diffusion coefficient inferred from B/C is significantly lower than the latest measurement of AMS-02. This anomaly may be attributed to the missing contributions from the heavy nuclei components in cosmic rays. By including these missing contributions the excess of the Li spectrum disappears. However, another inconsistency still exists since the calculated Li spectrum is now overestimated compared to the data. In this work, we update the cross-section model used to calculate the Li production according to more cross-section measurements. We find that the cross sections of these added reactions are systematically overestimated, and should be renormalized to the interpolations of available data. As a result, our prediction of the total Li spectrum is consistent with the measurement without discrepancy, and our prediction of the $\rm^6Li$ and $\rm^7Li$ spectra are consistent with the preliminary measurements of AMS-02 within the cross-section uncertainties.

Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.

 We reported the results of observations of small-scale variability in the hydrogen Balmer lines in Vega. Spectral observations were carried out with low-resolution spectrograph (R $\simeq$ 600) installed in the Main Astronomical Observatory, Ukraine. Spectra were obtained with a time resolution in the second range. It has been found that Vega shows variations in the hydrogen lines $H_{\beta} $, $H_{\gamma} $, $H_{ \delta} $. This can be interpreted that their variations are non-radial pulsations. The characteristic time of the observed variations ranges from 300 to 1200 sec. The horizontal scale for oscillating elements is about 800 Mm, which is comparable to the solar radius. The radial velocity of the variations is about 36 km/s.

          The dispersion measure and scattering of Fast Radio Bursts: contributions from multi-components, and clues for the intrinsic properties

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, millisecond-duration transients that offer great potential for probing the universe, yet their physical origins remain unclear. The dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) distributions provide key insights into FRBs' properties, including source population, redshift, and energy distribution. We use a simplified model of FRB source population and intrinsic Schechter function-like energy distribution, coupled with a thorough assessment of various contributors to dispersion and scattering, to replicate the joint distribution of DM and $\tau$ in the CHIME/FRB catalog. A mixed FRB source population, including both young and old progenitors, is considered. Contributions to the DM and $\tau$ from interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM) within host and foreground halos are informed by the IllustrisTNG simulation, while contributions from the Milky Way, intergalactic medium (IGM), and local environmental are estimated by updated models. Using MCMC simulations, we identify optimal model that well reproduce the DM distribution and broadly reproduce the $\tau$ distribution in the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our model suggests that the fraction of FRBs tracing star-formation rate is $\rm{f_{PSFR}=0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.27}}$, while $\rm{log_{10}E_*[erg]=42.27^{+1.17}_{-1.18}}$ and $\gamma=-1.60^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ in the energy distribution function. Scattering predominantly arises from the circumburst medium or the ISM and CGM of hosts, which cause a DM of $\sim 10\, \rm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Using our optimal model, we estimate FRB redshifts with two methods: DM-only and combined DM-$\tau$. Evaluation with 68 localized FRBs reveals an RMS error $0.11-0.12$, and incorporation of $\tau$ has a minor effect. We further argue that the host galaxy properties of localized FRBs could be a potential tool to validate our model in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 GDL, a free interpreter for the IDL language, continues to develop smoothly, driven by feedback and requests from an increasingly active and growing user base, especially since GDL was made available on GitHub. Among the most notable features introduced in recent years are stable Widgets; extensive testing on M1, M2, and M3 processors; excellent computational performance (including OpenMP support) demonstrated across a comprehensive benchmark; simplified compilation and installation processes; and the availability of SHMMAP and Bridge functions, which enable concurrent GDL runs on shared RAM in HPC environments. As developers of GDL, we believe this language holds a valuable place in today's world, where efficiency and low-power computing are essential. GDL (not to mention IDL), written in C/C++, demonstrates exceptional efficiency in "real-world" benchmarks, making it one of the few interpreted languages that can truly be considered "green." Moreover, it is likely the only interpreter accompanied by a vast collection of free, well-tested, and proven astronomical procedures developed by colleagues over the years. GDL also stands out for its suitability for long-term projects, thanks to its stable and reliable syntax.

          Galactic structure dependence of cloud-cloud collisions driven star formation in the barred galaxy NGC 3627

 - **Abstract**
 While cloud-cloud collisions (CCCs) have been proposed as a mechanism for triggering massive star formation, it is suggested that higher collision velocities ($v_{\rm col}$) and lower GMC mass ($M_{\rm GMC}$) or/and density ($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$) tend to suppress star formation. In this study, we choose the nearby barred galaxy NGC 3627 to examine the SFR and SFE of a colliding GMC ($m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$) and explore the connections between $m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$, $M_{\rm GMC}$($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$) and $v_{\rm col}$, and galactic structures (disk, bar, and bar-end). Using ALMA CO(2--1) data (60~pc resolution), we estimated $v_{\rm col}$ within 500~pc apertures, based on line-of-sight GMC velocities, assuming random motion in a two-dimensional plane. We extracted apertures where at least 0.1 collisions occur per 1 Myr, identifying them as regions dominated by CCC-driven star formation, and then calculated $m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$ using attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ data from VLT MUSE. We found that both $m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$ are lower in the bar (median values: $10^{3.84}~M_\odot$ and $0.18~\%$), and higher in the bar-end ($10^{4.89}~M_\odot$ and $1.10~\%$) compared to the disk ($10^{4.28}~M_\odot$ and $0.75~\%$). Furthermore, we found that structural differences within the parameter space of $v_{\rm col}$ and $M_{\rm GMC}$($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$), with higher $M_{\rm GMC}$($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$) in the bar-end and higher $v_{\rm col}$ in the bar compared to the disk, lead to higher star formation activity in the bar-end and lower activity in the bar. Our results support the scenario that variations in CCC properties across different galactic structures can explain the observed differences in SFE on a kpc scale within a disk galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) memory, a permanent distortion of the space-time metric, is anticipated during the acceleration of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). While the precise mechanism behind GRBs is not yet fully understood, detecting GW memory may contribute to clarifying their nature. In this paper, we consider various scenarios of GW memory emission, including both single and multiple shells with thin- and thick-shells. In particular, the memory spectrum for each scenario is compared with the sensitivity of next-generation detectors, namely DECIGO and ET-D. Physical properties spread over a broad-band region, emphasizing the importance of combined and wide-band observations. We also simulate GW memory based on nearby, realistic scenarios and demonstrate its detectability.

 The Gaia optical observations are not the most suitable spectral domain for studying the low-mass, faintest and reddest part of the main sequence. Nevertheless, the large number of objects observed with an unprecedented precision, including trigonometric parallax, makes it an unrivaled dataset for studying the stellar-substellar boundary. In this paper, I review the contribution of the successive catalogues offered by the Gaia mission to study the low-mass, ultra-cool objetcs. I also present further characterisations and scientific exploitations of the Gaia sample.

          PAH carbon accretion and return to the diffuse interstellar medium

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 Two key questions of the chemistry of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) are addressed: i) the way carbon is returned from PAHs to the interstellar gas after the very efficient accretion of C+ ions onto PAHs; ii) the PAH contribution to the high abundance of small carbon molecules observed in UV-irradiated regions. They are addressed based on the structure and stability of the various isomers of the complexes formed by PAHs and their cations with atomic carbon. Carbon complexes with coronene are studied by B3LYP/6-311+ZPVE(B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations, in order to figure out the behaviour of C+ and C complexes with larger pericondensed interstellar PAHs, which are thought to be dominant in the ISM. The most stable forms of [C-coronene]+ cation include 7C and 4C rings, C+ insertion into a CH bond, and a 5C ring with a short exocyclic cumulene chain, and similarly for neutral [C-coronene]. The subsequent evolution of similar complexes with pericondensed PAHs, in diffuse clouds, is discussed under the action of interstellar UV photons and H atoms, as function of the PAH size. Despite the complexity of such a processing, it seems probable that, for small PAHs, these complexes efficiently lose a C2H2 molecule from repeated photodissociations. However, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by the identification of reaction paths and the computation of activation energies. The case of the evolution of larger [C-PAH] complexes is less clear. Such a processing may explain the observed balance between C+ and PAHs, at least in the diffuse ISM. Such a formation of C2H2 from PAH catalysis is a key input for the chemistry of small carbon molecules in diffuse clouds. C+ accretion might frequently form stable PAHs that contain a peripheral pentagonal ring and form a significant fraction of interstellar PAHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We presented the first photometric light curve solutions of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems. This investigation utilized photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). We used the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for these light curve solutions. Only TIC 249064185 among the target systems needed a cold starspot to be included in the analysis. Based on the estimated mass ratios for these total eclipse systems, three of them are categorized as low mass ratio contact binary stars. The absolute parameters of the systems were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax method and the orbital period and semi-major axis ($P-a$) empirical relationship. We defined that TIC 318015356 and TIC 55522736 systems are A-subtypes, while TIC 249064185 and TIC 397984843 are W-subtypes, depending on each component's effective temperature and mass. We estimated the initial masses of the stars, the mass lost by the binary system, and the systems' ages. We displayed star positions in the mass-radius, mass-luminosity, and total mass-orbital angular momentum diagrams. In addition, our findings indicate a good agreement with the mass-temperature empirical parameter relationship for the primary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Numerous studies of diffuse interstellar band (DIB) profiles have detected substructures, implying large molecules as their carriers. However, some of the narrowest DIBs generally do not show such substructure, suggesting the possibility of very small carriers. Aims: Based on the previously found tight correlation of the three narrow DIBs at 6196, 6440 and 6623 A and the present detection of weaker side DIBs to each of them in the extensive data set from the ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey, we investigate whether they may stem from small linear carrier molecules. This approach can lead to concrete DIB carrier suggestions, which can be tested in laboratory measurements in future studies. Methods: We suggest that the DIBs we study here represent individual rotational transitions of a small molecule. We determined the molecular constants from observation and compared them with data from a large set of quantum-chemical calculations to confine possible carrier candidates. Furthermore, we determined rotational temperatures by fitting line ratios using the fitted molecular models. Results: We determined molecular constants for three DIB systems and the corresponding transition types. The fitted rotational temperatures lie within the range of known interstellar diatomic molecules. We identified several DIB carrier candidates, almost all of them molecular ions. Some of them are metastable species, indicating the possibility of collision complexes as DIB carriers. Conclusions: If our hypothesis holds, this would be a major step toward the identification of a carrier molecule of the 6196 A DIB, the strongest among the narrow DIBs.

 - **Abstract**
 High reddening near the Galactic plane hampers observations and proper characterization of the globular clusters (GCs) located toward the inner regions of the Milky Way. The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey observed the Galactic bulge and adjacent disk for several years, providing multi-epoch, near-infrared images for 41 Galactic GCs. Detecting RRLyrae variables belonging to these GCs will aid in their accurate parameterization. By fully leveraging the astrometric, photometric, and variability VVV catalogs, we searched for RRLyrae stars associated with GCs. Our selection criteria, based on proper motions, proximity to the cluster centers, and distances inferred from their period-luminosity-metallicity relations, enable us to accurately identify the RRLyrae population in these GCs and determine color excesses and distances in a homogeneous manner. Since the VVV catalogs cover from the innermost regions of the GCs to their outskirts, we can provide a comprehensive picture of the entire RRLyrae population in these GCs. We have discovered significant RRLyrae populations in two highly reddened Galactic GCs: UKS1 and VVV-CL160, previously unknown to host RRLyrae stars. Additionally, we have detected one RRLyrae candidate in each of Terzan4 and Terzan9, also new to RRLyrae detection. We further confirm and increase the number of RRLyrae stars detected in 22 other low-latitude Galactic GCs. The RRLyrae distances place most of these GCs within the Galactic bulge, aligning well with the few GCs in our sample with reliable Gaia or Hubble Space Telescope measurements. However, most of the VVV GCs lack accurate Gaia distances, and literature distances are generally significantly smaller than those derived in this work. As a byproduct of our analysis, we have obtained the proper motions for all the VVV GCs, independently confirming Gaia results, except for UKS1 and 2MASS-GC02.

 We report the discovery of a complete Einstein ring around the elliptical galaxy NGC 6505, at $z=0.042$. This is the first strong gravitational lens discovered in Euclid and the first in an NGC object from any survey. The combination of the low redshift of the lens galaxy, the brightness of the source galaxy ($I_\mathrm{E}=18.1$ lensed, $I_\mathrm{E}=21.3$ unlensed), and the completeness of the ring make this an exceptionally rare strong lens, unidentified until its observation by Euclid. We present deep imaging data of the lens from the Euclid Visible Camera (VIS) and Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instruments, as well as resolved spectroscopy from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The Euclid imaging in particular presents one of the highest signal-to-noise ratio optical/near-infrared observations of a strong gravitational lens to date. From the KCWI data we measure a source redshift of $z=0.406$. Using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) we measure a velocity dispersion for the lens galaxy of $\sigma_\star=303\pm15\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. We model the lens galaxy light in detail, revealing angular structure that varies inside the Einstein ring. After subtracting this light model from the VIS observation, we model the strongly lensed images, finding an Einstein radius of 2.5 arcsec, corresponding to $2.1\,\mathrm{kpc}$ at the redshift of the lens. This is small compared to the effective radius of the galaxy, $R_\mathrm{eff}\sim 12.3\,\mathrm{arcsec}$. Combining the strong lensing measurements with analysis of the spectroscopic data we estimate a dark matter fraction inside the Einstein radius of $f_\mathrm{DM} = (11.1_{-3.5}^{+5.4})\%$ and a stellar initial mass-function (IMF) mismatch parameter of $\alpha_\mathrm{IMF} = 1.26_{-0.08}^{+0.05}$, indicating a heavier-than-Chabrier IMF in the centre of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The census of planets around M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood meets two challenges: detecting the best targets for the future characterisation of planets with ELTs, and studying the statistics of planet occurrence that are crucial to formation scenarios. The radial velocity (RV) method remains the most appropriate for such a census as it is sensitive to the widest ranges of masses and periods. HARPS, mounted on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory (ESO, Chile), has been obtaining velocity measurements since 2003, and can therefore be used to analyse a very large and homogeneous dataset. We performed a homogeneous analysis of the RV time series of 200 M dwarfs observed with HARPS from 2003 to 2019 (gathering more than 15000 spectra), with the aim of understanding detectable signals such as stellar and planetary companions and activity signals. The RVs were computed with a template matching method before carrying out the time series analysis. First, we focused on the systematic analysis of the presence of a dominant long-term pattern in the RV time series (linear or quadratic trend and sine function). Then, we analysed higher-frequency perdiodic signals using periodograms of the residual time series and Keplerian function fitting. We found long-term variability in 57 RV time series (28.5%). This led to the revision of the parameters of the massive planet (GJ9482 b), as well as the detection of four substellar and stellar companions (around GJ3307, GJ4001, GJ4254, andGJ9588), for which we characterised inclinations and masses by combining RV and astrometry. The periodic analysis allowed us to recover 97% of the planetary systems already published in this sample, but also to propose three new planetary candidates orbiting GJ300 (7.3Me), GJ654(5Me), and GJ739 (39Me), which require additional measurements before they can be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 We re-determine planetary occurrences around M dwarfs using 20 years of observations from HARPS on 197 targets. The first aim of this study is to propose more precise occurrence rates using the large volume of the sample but also variations to previous calculations, particularly by considering multiplicity, which is now an integral part of planetary occurrence calculations. The second aim is to exploit the extreme longevity of HARPS to determine occurrence rates in the unexplored domain of very long periods. This work relies entirely on the 197 radial velocity time series obtained and analysed in our previous study. By considering they are cleaned of any detectable signal, we convert them into detection limits. We use these 197 limits to produce a detectability map and combine it with confirmed planet detections to establish our occurrence rates. Finally, we also convert the detection limits from orbital period to insolation in order to construct an occurrence statistics for the temperate zone. We find a strong prevalence of low-mass planets around M dwarfs, with an occurrence rate of 120% for planets with a mass between 0.75 and 3 Me. In addition, we compute an occurrence rate of 45.3% +20-16% for temperate zone planets around M dwarfs. We obtain an occurrence rate of a few percent for giant planets with wide separations. In our sample these giant planets with wide separations are only detected around the most massive M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the potential of new adaptive optical technology to expand the detection horizon of gravitational-wave observatories. Achieving greater quantum-noise-limited sensitivity to spacetime strain hinges on achieving higher circulating laser power, in excess of 1~MW, in conjunction with highly-squeezed quantum states of light. The new technology will enable significantly higher levels of laser power and squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors, by providing high-precision, low-noise correction of limiting sources of thermal distortions directly to the core interferometer optics. In simulated projections for LIGO~A+, assuming an input laser power of 125~W and an effective injected squeezing level of 9~dB entering the interferometer, an initial concept of this technology can reduce the noise floor of the detectors by up to 20\% from 200~Hz to 5~kHz, corresponding to an increment of 4~Mpc in the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers. This work lays the foundation for one of the key technology improvements essential to fully utilize the scientific potential of the existing 4-km LIGO facilities, to observe black hole merger events past a redshift of~5, and opens a realistic pathway towards a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, Cosmic~Explorer.

 - **Abstract**
 We report here on new results of the systematic monitoring of southern glitching pulsars at the Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy. In particular, we study in this work the new major glitch in the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835$-$4510) that occurred on 2024 April 29. We aim to thoroughly characterise the rotational behaviour of the Vela pulsar around its last major glitch and investigate the statistical properties of its individual pulses around the glitch. We characterise the rotational behaviour of the pulsar around the glitch through the pulsar timing technique. We measured the glitch parameters by fitting timing residuals to the data collected during the days surrounding the event. In addition, we study Vela individual pulses during the days of observation just before and after the glitch. We selected nine days of observations around the major glitch on 2024 April 29 and studied their statistical properties with the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) technique. We used Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) reconstruction of the pulses to separate them clearly from the noise. We obtain a precise timing solution for the glitch. We find two recovery terms of $\sim 3~\mathrm{days}$ and $\sim 17~\mathrm{days}$. We find a correlation of high amplitude with narrower pulses while not finding notable qualitative systematic changes before and after the glitch.
