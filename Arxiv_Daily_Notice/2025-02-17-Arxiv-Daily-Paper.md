#### Title:
          Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We study the influence of axion dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a 'gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a generic quantum state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core; for plausible parameter values, such a core is found to be in tension with the existence of the clockwise stellar disc at $2\sigma$ for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, the distances of stellar systems classified as cataclysmic variables in the literature were determined by using the distance compiled from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021). The spatial distributions of cataclysmic variables in the heliocentric Galactic coordinate system are obtained and their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram constructed from Gaia colors are discussed.

          Flip-flop QPO changes during state transitions: a case study of GX339-4 and theoretical discussion

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the 2021 outburst from the black hole X-ray binary GX339-4 observed by NICER around the hard to soft transition, when the system exhibits flip-flops between two distinct luminosity states: a bright state with a 5-6 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) and a dim state showing only strong broadband noise. Despite the marked differences in variability patterns between these states, the spectral energy distributions remain strikingly similar, with only minor changes in the black body component in the soft X-ray range. We find that the QPO frequency correlates with the X-ray count rates and hardness, suggesting a tight coupling between the QPO mechanism and the accretion disc's spectral properties. Additionally, we demonstrate that flip-flops can occur on very short timescales, with almost 50 state changes within ~1200 s, while both states can also remain stable over longer periods (at least 1000 s). We explore various QPO models to explain these observations, including the possibility that the corona's accretion speed is near the sound speed, affecting the presence of QPOs. However, the exact mechanism driving the flip-flops and the QPOs remains unclear. Our findings emphasize the complexity of these phenomena and the necessity for further theoretical and observational studies to unravel the intricacies of QPO and flip-flop behaviours in X-ray binaries.

          21-cm Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation after an Early Matter-Dominated Era

 - **Abstract**
 Although it is commonly assumed that relativistic particles dominate the energy density of the universe quickly after inflation, a variety of well-motivated scenarios predict an early matter-dominated era (EMDE) before the onset of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Subhorizon dark matter density perturbations grow faster during an EMDE than during a radiation-dominated era, leading to the formation of "microhalos" far earlier than in standard models of structure formation. This enhancement of small-scale structure boosts the dark-matter annihilation rate, which contributes to the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compute how the dark matter annihilation rate evolves after an EMDE and forecast how well measurements of the 21-cm background can detect dark matter annihilation in cosmologies with EMDEs. We find that future measurements of the global 21-cm signal at a redshift of $z\sim 17$ are unlikely to improve on bounds derived from observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background, but measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum have the potential to detect dark matter annihilation following an EMDE. Moreover, dark matter annihilation and astrophysical X-rays produce distinct heating signatures in the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts around 14, potentially allowing differentiation between these two IGM heating mechanisms.

          The spectral shapes of Galactic gamma-ray source

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes have led to the publication of catalogs listing sources observed in the TeV and PeV energy ranges. Photons of such high energy are strongly absorbed during propagation over extragalactic distances, and the catalogs are dominated by Galactic sources. Of particular interest are the observations of the LHAASO telescope, which cover a very broad energy range (from 1 to 10$^3$ TeV) and show that the spectra of all Galactic gamma-ray sources are curved, with significantly different slopes below and above $E \sim 30$ TeV. The cumulative spectrum obtained by summing the contributions of Galactic individual sources has a spectral shape that gradually softens with energy, with a slope that increases from a value of order 2.2 at $E \simeq 1$ TeV, to 2.5 at 30 TeV, and $\simeq 3.4$ at 100 TeV. It is remarkable that the smooth variation in the shape of the cumulative spectrum is obtained from the sum of contributions that have a wide range of shapes. Understanding the origin of the spectral shapes of the Galactic gamma-ray sources is a crucial challenge for high energy astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 The EXO-UV program is an international, interdisciplinary collaboration between astrophysicists and biologists aimed at expanding the characterization of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) environments on exoplanets. This approach combines astrophysical studies with biological experiments to better understand the potential impacts of UVR on exoplanetary surfaces. UVR is particularly relevant because it reaches the surface of planets and can influence their habitability. The specific wavelengths within the UVR spectrum depend on the planet's atmospheric composition and the spectral energy distribution of its host star. Additionally, high UVR fluxes emitted during flares and superflares are of particular interest due to the limited information available regarding their biological impact. The EXO-UV program has successfully led to the first experimental study examining the biological effects of high UVR fluences, such as those produced by flares and superflares. Future experimental studies aim to investigate the biological effects of repetitive flares. In this paper, we review the latest results from our EXO-UV program.

          Cold molecular gas in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Large Millimeter Telescope and the SEQUOIA 3~mm focal plane array, we have searched for molecular line emission from two atomic clouds associated with the Fermi Bubble of the Milky Way. Neither 12CO nor 13CO J=1-0 emission is detected from the HI cloud, MW-C20. 12CO J=1-0 emission is detected from MW-C21 that is distributed within 11 clumps with most of the CO luminosity coming from a single clump. However, we find no 13CO emission to a 3sigma brightness temperature limit of 0.3 K. Using this limit and RADEX non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation models, we derive H2 column density upper limits of (0.4-3)x10^{21} cm-2 for a set of physical conditions and a H2 to 12CO abundance ratio of 10^4. Model CO-to-H2 conversion factors are derived for each set of physical conditions. We find the maximum value is 1.6x10^{20} cm-2/(K km/s). Increasing [H2/12CO] to 10^5 to account for photodissociation and cosmic ray ionization increases the column density and XCO upper limits by a factor of 10. Applying these XCO limits to the CO luminosities, the upper limit to the total molecular mass in MW-C21 is 132+/-2~Msun, corresponding to less than 27% of the neutral gas mass. For the three clumps that are fully resolved, lower limits to the virial ratios are 288+/-32, 68+/-28, and 157+/-39, which suggest that these structures are bound by external pressure to remain dynamically stable over the entrainment time of 2x10^6 years or are being disrupted by shear and expansion over the clump crossing times of (3-8)x10^5 years. The observations presented in this study add to the growing census of cold gas entrained within the Galactic Center wind.

          Modified Hadronic Interactions and the future of UHECR observations

 - **Abstract**
 Data from multiple experiments suggest that the current interaction models used in Monte Carlo simulations do not correctly reproduce the hadronic interactions in air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR). We have created a large library of UHECR simulations where the interactions at the highest energies are slightly modified in various ways - but always within the constraints of the accelerator data, without any abrupt changes with energy and without assuming any specific mechanism or dramatically new physics at the ultra-high energies. Recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory indicate a need for a change in the prediction of the models for both the muon content at ground and the depth of the maximum of longitudinal development of the shower. In our parameter space, we find combinations of modifications that are in agreement with this analysis, however a consistent description of UHECR showers remains elusive. Our library however provides a realistic representation of the freedom in the modeling of the hadronic interactions and offers an opportunity to quantify uncertainties of various predictions. This can be particularly valuable for the design of future observatories where hadronic models are often used as input for the prediction of the performance. We demonstrate this powerful capability on several selected examples.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend a recently developed dynamically self-consistent model of the Milky Way constrained by observations from the Gaia observatory to include a radially anisotropic component in the dark matter (DM) halo, which represents the debris from the accreted Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) galaxy. In the new model, which we call a self-consistent Anisotropic Halo Model or scAHM, we derive distribution functions for DM velocity in heliocentric and geocentric reference frames. We compare them with the velocity distributions in the standard halo model (SHM) and another anisotropic model (SHM++). We compute predicted scattering rates in direct-detection experiments, for different target nuclei and DM particle masses. Seasonal dependencies of scattering rates are analyzed, revealing small but interesting variations in detection rates for different target nuclei and DM masses. Our findings show that the velocity distribution of the anisotropic GSE component significantly deviates from Gaussian, showing a modest impact on the detection rates. The peculiar kinematic signature of the radially anisotropic component would be most clearly observable by direction-sensitive detectors.

          Long Secondary Periods in Red Giants: AAVSO Observations and the Eclipse Hypothesis
 - **Authors:** John Percy, Melanie Szpigiel

 - **Abstract**
 At least a third of red giants show a long secondary period (LSP), 5 to 10 times longer than the pulsation period. There is strong evidence that the LSP is caused by eclipses of the red giant by a dust-enshrouded low-mass companion. We have used long-term AAVSO observations of 11 stars to study two aspects of the eclipse hypothesis: the relation between the LSP phase (eclipse) curve and the geometry of the eclipse, and the long-term (decades) changes in the LSP phenomenon in each star. The stars with the largest LSP amplitudes show evidence of a dust tail on the companion, but most of the 11 stars show only a small-amplitude sinusoidal phase curve. The LSP amplitudes of all the stars vary slowly by up to a factor of 8, suggesting that the amount of obscuring dust varies by that amount, but there is no strong evidence that the geometry of the system changes over many decades.

          DESI dark secrets

 - **Abstract**
 The first year results of DESI provide evidence that dark energy may not be quantum vacuum energy ($\Lambda$). If true, this would be an extraordinary development in the 25-year quest to understand cosmic acceleration. The best-fit DESI $w_0w_a$ models for dark energy, which underpin the claim, have very strange behavior. They achieve a maximum dark energy density around $z\simeq 0.4$ and rapidly decrease before and after. We explore physics-motivated models where the dark energy is a rolling scalar-field. Each of our four scalar-field models is characterized by one dimensionless parameter $\beta$, which in the limit of $\beta \rightarrow 0$ reduces to $\Lambda$CDM. While none of our models fit the DESI data significantly better than $\Lambda$CDM, for values of $\beta$ of order unity, they fit about as well as $\Lambda$CDM. Each scalar field model makes different predictions for the age of the Universe, which might be used to discriminate amongst them. For small values of $\beta$, the dimensionsless initial slope of the scalar field potential links the predictions of different scalar field models. And for small values of $\beta$, $w_0w_a$ models can marginally represent the predictions of a scalar-field model at the current precision needed. However, with increasingly precise distance measurements, over a larger redshift range, explicit modeling of the scalar-field evolution is already and will continue to be essential to testing alternatives to $\Lambda$.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos act as probes of hadronic processes and offer a distinctive view into their astrophysical origins at high energies. When reaching energies on the PeV scale, $\nu_\tau$ interactions within the Earth can produce a significant flux of $\tau$-leptons. These $\tau$-leptons subsequently decay, generating upward-moving extensive air showers (EAS). Using the Earth as a target for neutrinos and the atmosphere as a signal generator effectively creates a detector with a mass $\gg$ gigaton. $\nu$SpaceSim is a comprehensive simulation developed to model all the relevant physical processes that describe the neutrino-induced, Earth-emergent lepton chain. The simulation models neutrino interactions inside the Earth that produce leptons, the propagation of the leptons through the Earth into the atmosphere, and their decay, forming composite EAS. Next, it models the generation of air optical Cherenkov and radio signals from these showers, including the propagation and attenuation of these signals through the atmosphere, accounting for effects such as clouds and the ionosphere. Finally, the simulation models the detector response according to the parameters defined by the user (such as altitude, effective area, frequency band...). Through this end-to-end simulation, $\nu$SpaceSim aims to help design the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, to estimate the exposure of ground-based experiments to these showers, and to understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and ANITA.

          Deep Optical Images of the Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 8 (HD 62910)

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of deep H-alpha and [O III] images of the bright WN7/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR 8 (HD 62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span 6' in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H-alpha emission, WR 8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint 9' x 13' diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. The nebula's optical structure is substantially different from that of its thermal continuum dust emission seen in WISE 22 micron infrared images which show a smaller and sharply defined emission shell.

          Solving for the 2D Water Snowline with Hydrodynamic Simulations. Emergence of gas outflow, water cycle and temperature plateau

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks, the water snowline marks the location where ice-rich pebbles sublimate, releasing silicate grains and water vapor. These processes can trigger pile-ups of solids, making the water snowline a promising site for forming planetesimals. However, previous studies exploring the pile-up conditions typically employ 1D, vertically-averaged and isothermal assumptions. In this work, we investigate how a 2D flow pattern and realistic temperature structure affect the pile-up of pebbles at the snowline and how latent heat effects can leave observational imprints. We perform 2D (R-Z) multifluid hydrodynamic simulations, tracking chemically heterogeneous pebbles and the released vapor. With a recent-developed phase change module, the mass transfer and latent heat exchange during ice sublimation are calculated self-consistently. The temperature is calculated by a two-stream radiation transfer method under various opacities and stellar luminosity. We find that vapor injection at the snowline drives a previously unrecognized outflow, leading to a pile-up of ice outside the snowline. Vapor injection also decreases the headwind velocity in the pile-up, promoting planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. In active disks, we identify a water-cycle: after ice sublimates in the hotter midplane, vapor recondenses onto pebbles in the upper, cooler layers, which settle back to the midplane. This cycle promotes ice-trapping at snowline. Latent heat exchange flattens the temperature gradient across the snowline, broadening the width while reducing the peak solid-to-gas ratio of pile-ups. Due to the water cycle, active disks are more conducive to planetesimal formation than passive disks. The significant temperature dip (~ 40K) caused by latent heat cooling manifests as an intensity dip in the dust continuum, presenting a new channel to identify the water snowline in outbursting systems.

          Semi-analytic modelling of Pop. III star formation and metallicity evolution - II. Impact on 21cm power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Simulating Population (Pop.) III star formation in mini-halos in a large cosmological simulation is an extremely challenging task but it is crucial to estimate its impact on the 21cm power spectrum. In this work, we develop a framework within the semi-analytical code meraxes to estimate the radiative backgrounds from Pop. III stars needed for the computation of the 21cm signal. We computed the 21cm global signal and power spectrum for different Pop. III models varying star formation efficiency, initial mass function (IMF) and specific X-ray luminosity per unit of star formation (LX/SFR). In all the models considered, we find Pop. III stars have little to no impact on the reionization history but significantly affect the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to the strong injection of X-ray photons from their remnants that heat the neutral IGM at $z \geq$ 15. This is reflected not only on the 21cm sky-averaged global signal during the Cosmic Dawn but also on the 21cm power spectrum at $z \leq$ 10 where models with strong Pop. III X-ray emission have larger power than models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission. We estimate observational uncertainties on the power spectrum using 21cmsense and find that models where Pop. III stars have a stronger X-ray emission than Pop. II are distinguishable from models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission with 1000 hours observations of the upcoming SKA1-low.

          Foreground Removal in Ground-Based CMB Observations Using a Transformer Model

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) foreground removal based on deep learning techniques. This method employs a Transformer model, referred to as \texttt{TCMB}, which is specifically designed to effectively process HEALPix-format spherical sky maps. \texttt{TCMB} represents an innovative application in CMB data analysis, as it is an image-based technique that has rarely been utilized in this field. Using simulated data with noise levels representative of current ground-based CMB polarization observations, the \texttt{TCMB} method demonstrates robust performance in removing foreground contamination. The mean absolute variance for the reconstruction of the noisy CMB Q/U map is significantly less than the CMB polarization signal. To mitigate biases caused by instrumental noise, a cross-correlation approach using two half-mission maps was employed, successfully recovering CMB EE and BB power spectra that align closely with the true values, and these results validate the effectiveness of the \texttt{TCMB} method. Compared to the previously employed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach, the \texttt{TCMB} method offers two significant advantages: (1) It demonstrates superior effectiveness in reconstructing CMB polarization maps, outperforming CNN-based methods. (2) It can directly process HEALPix spherical sky maps without requiring rectangular region division, a step necessary for CNN-based approaches that often introduces uncertainties such as boundary effects. This study highlights the potential of Transformer-based models as a powerful tool for CMB data analysis, offering a substantial improvement over traditional CNN-based techniques.

          Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) I: Survey description, discovery and timing of the first pulsar in NGC 6093 (M80)

 This paper describes the new Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey. This survey aims to find MSPs in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using uGMRT. The observations use the uGMRT's Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, which are well suited for steep-spectral-index radio sources like MSPs; the survey will eventually cover the GCs accessible to the uGMRT sky (i.e. $\delta\:>\:\sim\:-\:53^\circ$), and that is South of $\delta = -17^\circ$ (FAST sky limit) and have not been targeted with the sensitivity of this survey. The observations started in May 2023, having so far resulted in seven new discoveries. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up study of the first pulsar from this survey, J1617$-$2258A, a 4.32 ms binary MSP that is also the first to be discovered in the globular cluster NGC 6093. We localised this MSP with arc-sec precision from imaging and obtained the unique timing solution from more than one year of timing observations with the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) receivers of the uGMRT. This revealed an unusual binary MSP, with a $\sim$ 19-hour, highly eccentric (e $\sim$ 0.54) orbit having a low-mass companion. This orbital eccentricity allowed the measurement of the rate of advance of periastron for this system, which led to the derivation of its total mass, $1.67 \, \pm \, 0.06 \, \rm M_{\odot}$; this together with the system's mass function implies, for the pulsar and the companion, $M_\mathrm{p} < 1.60 \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and $M_\mathrm{c} > 0.072 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. The system is likely a perturbed MSP-Helium WD system seen at a low orbital inclination.

          Pulsar scattering as a probe for structures in the interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the inhomogeneity of electron number density, radio waves emitted by pulsars undergo scattering as they pass through the interstellar medium (ISM). However, a connection between large-scale pulsar scattering data and the structure of the Galactic ISM has yet to be established. In this paper, we explore the capability of pulsar scattering time data in discovering structures in the ISM. Using a large dataset of scattering time measurements for 473 pulsars, we fit the pulsar reduced scattering intensity as a function of Galactic latitude and distance, constructing a smooth model of the Galactic pulsar scattering distribution. By comparing this smooth distribution with observational data, we identify two ISM structures responsible for pulsar scattering, one is associated with the Vela supernova remnant region within the Gum Nebula, while the other is a newly discovered structure -- a distant superbubble, G38, located at a distance of 2.3 kpc with a size of ~50 pc. Analysis of the correlation coefficient of the pulsar scattering distribution shows that the correlation is dominated by structures smaller than 0.15 kpc -- the closest separation approachable by the current dataset. As measurements of the pulsar scattering time continue to increase in the future, they can potentially become an independent tool for exploring structures in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are generally observed in low-metallicity environments. However, 10 to 20 per cent of LGRBs at redshift $z<2$ are associated with near-solar to super-solar metallicity environments, remaining unexplained by traditional LGRB formation pathways that favour low metallicity progenitors. Aims. In this work, we propose a novel formation channel for LGRBs that is dominant at high metallicities. We explore how a stripped primary star in a binary can be spun up by a second, stable reverse-mass-transfer phase, initiated by the companion star. Methods. We use POSYDON a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star mode grids, to investigate the metallicity dependence of the stable reverse-mass-transfer LGRB formation channel. We determine the available energy to power an LGRB from the rotational profile and internal structure of a collapsing star, and investigate how the predicted rate density of the proposed channel changes with different star formation histories and criteria for defining a successful LGRB. Results. Stable reverse mass transfer can produce rapidly rotating, stripped stars at collapse. These stars retain enough angular momentum to account for approximately 10-20% of the observed local LGRB rate density, under a reasonable assumption for the definition of a successful LGRB. However, the local rate density of LGRBs from stable reverse mass transfer can vary significantly, between 1 and 100 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, due to strong dependencies on cosmic star formation rate and metallicity evolution, as well as the assumed criteria for successful LGRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze PSR J0952-0607, the most massive and fastest spinning neutron star observed to date, to refine constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and investigate its robustness against r-mode instabilities. With a mass of \( 2.35 \pm 0.17 \, M_{\odot} \) and a spin frequency of 709.2 Hz, PSR J0952-0607 provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of rapid rotation on the structure of a neutron star. Using a Bayesian framework, we incorporate the rotationally corrected mass of PSR J0952-0607, alongside PSR J0740+6620's static mass measurement, to constrain the EoS. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting rotational effects leads to biases in the inferred EoS, while including the neutron star spin produces tighter constraints on pressure-density and mass-radius relations. Additionally, we explore the r-mode instability window for PSR J0952-0607 under the assumption of both rigid and elastic crust models and find that a rigid crust allows a higher stable temperature range, whereas an elastic crust places the star within the instability window under certain thermal insulation conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for parameter inference on massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), considering joint observations from a network of three space-based gravitational wave detectors. Our result demonstrates that the trained CVAE model can estimate the posterior distribution of source parameters in approximately 0.5 seconds, while the standard Bayesian sampling method, utilizing parallel computation across 16 CPU cores, takes an average of 22 hours across 25 MBHB signals. While the CVAE model achieves remarkable efficiency, its estimated distributions exhibit slight differences in shape compared to the standard Bayesian results, particularly showing lighter tails with broader widths. By using CVAE result to constrain the prior range for Bayesian sampling, we reduce the sampling time to $14.0\%$ of the original runtime on average, while maintaining similar Bayesian result.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the gravitational-wave (GW) strain upper limits from resolvable supermassive black-hole binaries using the data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), in the context of the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array project. We focus on circular orbits in the $\mu$Hz GW frequency band between $10^{-7}$ and $3\times10^{-6}$ Hz. This frequency band is higher than the traditional pulsar timing array band and is less explored. We used the data of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+5307 observed between August 2019 and April 2021. A dense observation campaign was carried out in September 2020 to allow for the $\mu$Hz band coverage. Our sky-average continuous source upper limit at the 95% confidence level at 1$\mu$Hz is 1.26$\times10^{-12}$, while the same limit in the direction of the pulsar is 4.77$\times10^{-13}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilized archived data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) to analyze the single-pulse profile morphology of PSR J1935$+$1616 (B1933$+$16). The results show that PSR J1935$+$1616 exhibits significant micropulses as well as various changes in single-pulse profile morphology. In the FAST archived data, a total of 969 single pulses with microstructure were identified, accounting for 9.69$\%$ of the total pulse sample, with characteristic widths of $127.63^{+70.74}_{-46.25}$ $\mu$s. About half of these pulses display quasiperiodic micropulses, with a periodicity of 231.77 $\pm$ 9.90 $\mu$s. Among the 520 single pulses with quasiperiodic microstructure, 208 also exhibit quasiperiodicity in circular polarization, with a characteristic period of $244.70^{+45.66}_{-21.05}$ $\mu$s. The micropulse characteristic width in circular polarization is 106.52 $\pm$ 46.14 $\mu$s. Compared to normal pulses, the relative energy (E/<E>) of single pulse with microstructure follows a double Gaussian distribution, while that of normal pulses follows a single Gaussian distribution. Based on the intensity of the leading and trailing components in the single-pulse profile morphology of PSR J1935+1616, we classified the pulses into four morphological modes (A, B, C, and D). The relative energy distribution of pulses in mode A is significantly different from the others, following a double Gaussian distribution, while the relative energy distributions in modes B, C, and D follow a single Gaussian distribution. Our study also suggests a possible correlation between micropulses and single-pulse profile morphology. Single pulse with micropulses are most likely to occur in mode A, while their occurrence is least likely in mode D.

 - **Abstract**
 Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168<\sigma_{v_r}<380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 {\mu}m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 {\mu}m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are important targets in the search for Earth-like exoplanets due to their small masses and low luminosities. Several ongoing and upcoming space missions are targeting M dwarfs for this reason, and the ESA PLATO mission is one of these. In order to fully characterise a planetary system the properties of the host star must be known. For M dwarfs we can derive effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and abundances of various elements from spectroscopic observations in combination with photometric data. The Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline (SAPP) has been developed as a prototype for one of the stellar science softwares within the PLATO consortium, it is aimed at FGK stars. We have modified it to be able to analyse the M dwarf among the PLATO targets. The current version of the pipeline for M dwarfs mostly relies on spectroscopic observations. The data processing is based on the machine learning algorithm The Payne and fits a grid of model spectra to an observed spectrum to derive effective temperature and metallicity. We use spectra in the H-band, as the near-infrared region is beneficial for M dwarfs. A method based on synthetic spectra was developed for the continuum normalisation of the spectra, taking into account the pseudo-continuum formed by numerous lines of the water molecule. Photometry is used to constrain the surface gravity. We tested the modified SAPP on spectra of M dwarfs from the APOGEE survey. Our validation sample of 26 stars includes stars with interferometric observations and binaries. We found a good agreement between our values and reference values from a range of studies. The overall uncertainties in the derived effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity is 100 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.15 dex, respectively. We find that the modified SAPP performs well on M dwarfs and identify possible areas of future development.

 - **Abstract**
 We quantify the effect of starspots for the orbital elements of the spotted RS CVn binary $\lambda$ Andromedae ($\lambda$ And) and present an empirical correction. The aim is to obtain a more precise orbital solution that can be used to better study the system's severe orbital-rotational asynchronism. Phase-resolved high-resolution optical spectra were recorded over the course of 522 days in 2021-2022. We employed two facilities with medium and high resolution spectroscopy for the multiple activity analyses. Doppler imaging is used to reconstruct $\lambda$ And's starspots with a high resolution (R= 250 000) and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. Optimized cross-correlation functions were used to measure precise radial velocities at a level of a few ten's of m/s. The spot-corrected radial velocities enable, on average, a threefold increase in precision of the individual orbital elements. The residual velocity jitter with a full range of 500 m/s is modulated by the rotation period of $\lambda$ And of 54.4$\pm$0.3 days. Our logarithmic gravity from spectrum synthesis of 2.8$\pm$0.2 together with the interferometrically determined stellar radius suggest a most-likely mass of the primary of $\approx$1.4 Msun. The small orbital mass function then implies a secondary mass of just $\approx$0.1 Msun, which is appropriate for an L-class brown dwarf. The Doppler image reconstructs a dominating cool spot with an umbral temperature difference of $\approx$1000 K with respect to the photosphere of 4660 K and is likely surrounded by a moat-like velocity field. Three more weaker spots add to the total surface spottedness, which is up to 25% of the visible surface. Seven optical chromospheric tracers show rotational modulation of their emission line fluxes in phase with the cool spots. This surface configuration appears to have been stable for the 522 days of our observations.

 We derive all the orbital parameters of the blue large-amplitude pulsator (BLAP) in the binary system HD133729 by exploiting the frequency modulation (FM) method, which is based on the analytical relations between the orbital parameters and a multiplet separated by the orbital frequency in the frequency spectrum of the light curve. Because the FM method uses the entire data through the Fourier transform, it is the most effective use of high-precision photometry data, taken over a long timespan by the TESS space mission, for determining orbital parameters.

 NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA/NASA's Solar Orbiter are encounter missions that are currently both in their nominal science phases, venturing closer to the Sun than ever before. These complementary spacecraft are operating together in order to combine in situ measurements of solar wind plasma in the inner heliosphere with high-resolution remote sensing observations of their source regions in the solar atmosphere. This paper highlights the synergetic science that these multi-viewpoint messengers of the inner heliosphere enable and how they are working together to significantly advance our understanding of the physical processes that are important for solar wind formation, the eruption of coronal mass ejections and their space weather effects.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we reanalyze the extended ETV curves of the formerly identified triple star candidates and many other $Kepler$ EBs. Besides the confirmations of the former findings and/or the improvements of the triple systems' orbital properties, the extended time-base allows us to identify several new, longer outer period triple systems, and it also makes possible a more detailed study of the dynamical perturbations in the tightest triple stars. We extend the ETV curves of the $Kepler$ triples with those mid-eclipse times which can be deduced from the TESS observations and, moreover, from targeted ground-based follow up observations for a number of the objects. In general, we use the same methods that were applied for the older studies, which are described in the literature. Due to the lower quality of the TESS observations, however, for the fainter systems we average light curves of the EBs for 5-20 consecutive cycles, and thereby calculate `normal' minima from these averaged light curves. In conclusion, we identified 243 hierarchical triple star candidates in the $Kepler$ sample. This sample strongly overlaps our former, nine-year-old sample, confirming the older results, or providing new solutions for 193 systems of the 2016 sample. For the remaining 28 hierarchical triple candidates of that former study, we were unable to find new solutions either because of the disappearance of the eclipses due to orbital plane precession, or due to instrumental reasons. On the other hand, due to the extended time series, we were able to identify 50 new, longer period triple star candidates, as well. We briefly discuss the main properties of each individual system and present statistical studies of the results, as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Calculating the action and the interaction Hamiltonian at higher orders in cosmological perturbation theory is a cumbersome task. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$. To complete the dictionary, a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and $\pi$ is presented. Equipped with these non-linear results, we calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level.

          The Effect of Rotation on Triggering S Doradus Instabilities in Luminous Blue Variables

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous blue variables are an intermediate stage in the evolution of high-mass stars characterized by extreme mass loss and substantial variability. The stars show large irregular episodic variations on timescales of years to decades in these stars' effective temperatures (called "S Dor variations"). Observations show that these variations are triggered when the stars are in a well-defined strip in the HRD that corresponds to the Modified Eddington Limit, where the atmospheric radiation pressure almost balances gravity. In this work we consider the role that rotation plays in the instability that leads to the triggering of S Dor variations in luminous post-main sequence LBVs. We adopt the existing instability criterion that the effective surface gravity is reduced to 10% of the Newtonian gravity due to radiation pressure in the atmosphere of non-rotating stars. We then specifically describe how rotation impacts this instability. By carrying out numerical simulations of model LBVs at both solar and sub-solar metallicities, we confirm that most LBVs should be unstable at both the equator and the poles, and that rotation exacerbates this effect; some models also produce enhanced mass loss at the pole or equator. Our numerical models also predict dense equatorial disks or rings and high-velocity bipolar outflows, in agreement with existing observations of LBV circumstellar nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 Using data collected by the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission in October 2021, we investigated coronal regions of the Sun by analyzing the Doppler spectral width of radio signals to estimate solar wind velocity. A simplified equation is introduced to directly relate these two parameters. The study focuses on observations conducted from October 2 to October 14, 2021, a relatively quiet phase of solar cycle 25. The analysis targeted the coronal region within heliocentric distances of 5-8 RSun, near the ecliptic plane. In this region, solar wind velocities ranged from 100 to 150 kms^-1, while electron densities were on the order of 10^10 m^(-3). We also compared our results with electron density observations and models derived from previous studies. Though the decrease in the electron densities with respect to increasing helio-centric distance matches quite well with the theoretical models, MOM estimates fall at the lower edge of the distribution. This difference may be attributed to the prolonged weak solar activity during the MOM observations, in contrast to prior studies conducted during periods of comparatively higher solar activity in earlier solar cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 Many large scale structure surveys sort their observations into redshift bins and treat every tracer as being located at the mean redshift of its bin, a treatment which we refer to as the equal time approximation. Recently, a new method was developed which allows for the estimation and correction of errors introduced by this approximation, which we refer to as the unequal time correlator-level projection. For single tracer power spectra, corrections arise at second order and above in a series expansion, with first order terms surviving only in multi-tracer analyses. In this paper we develop a new method which we refer to as the unequal time field level projection. This formalism projects the fields individually onto the celestial sphere, displaced from individual reference times, before defining their correlators. This method introduces new, first order correction terms even in the case of single tracer power spectra. Specifically, new first order terms are introduced which apply to both cross-bin and single bin correlators. All of these new corrections originate with derivatives over combinations of a delta function, a cross-bin phase term, and the power spectrum itself and stem from the introduction of two unequal time Fourier transforms into the analysis. We analyse these corrections in the context of a linearly biased power spectrum divided between two redshift bins and find that they can lead to non-trivial corrections, particularly to cross-bin correlators. We also show that these terms can be replicated by appropriately extending the correlator-level analysis to include a second Fourier transform which allows for a full redshift bin integration.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify an axis connecting two opposite `ears' in the supernova remnant W49B and morphological signatures of three arcs around this axis that we claim are sections of full circum-jet rings. Based on recent identifications of morphological signatures of jets in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), including ejecta-rich axes, we reexamine images of W49B and identify a heavy element-rich protrusion (ear) as a jet-inflated structure. We identify the opposite ear and a clump at its tip as the signature of the opposite jets. The line connecting the two clumps at the tips of the two opposite ears forms the main jet axis of W49B. We compare the three arcs around the main jet axis in W49B to the circum-jet rings of the jets in the Cygnus A galaxy and deduce that these arcs are sections of full circum-jet rings in W49B. In W49B, the jets are long gone, as in some planetary nebulae with circum-jet rings. Identifying the main jet axis is incompatible with a type Ia supernova. It leaves two possibilities: that jets exploded W49B as a CCSN, i.e., the jittering jets explosion mechanism where the pair of jets we identify is one of many that exploded the star, or that the explosion was a common envelope jet supernova with a thermonuclear outburst, i.e., both the pair of jets and thermonuclear outburst exploded the core of a red supergiant star as a pre-existing neutron star tidally destroyed it.

 - **Abstract**
 A meta-analysis of seismic ages determined for individual stars in the well-studied open and globular clusters NGC 6819, NGC 6791, M67, M4, M19, M80, and M9 reveals both high variance across measurements and significant discrepancy with independent, isochrone-based age determinations for the clusters in which these stars reside. The scatter among asteroseismic ages for individual stars in any one of these clusters far surpasses both the absolute age uncertainty computed for reference cluster M92 (5.4\%) and the model-to-model systematic uncertainties in isochrones (roughly 10\%). This suggests that either binary processes are significantly altering the masses of stars in these clusters, or some additional corrections, perhaps as a function of mass, metallicity, or surface gravity, are required to bring the asteroseismic age scale into concordance with ages inferred from isochrone or similar model fitting.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic double white dwarfs will be prominent gravitational-wave sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). While previous studies have primarily focused on formation scenarios in which binaries form and evolve in isolation, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. In this work, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. We use the multiple stellar evolution code (MSE) to model the stellar evolution, binary interactions, and the dynamics of triple star systems then use a Milky Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 simulations to construct a representative sample of LISA double white dwarfs. In our simulations about $7\times10^6$ Galactic double white dwarfs in the LISA frequency bandwidth originate from triple systems, whereas $\sim4\times10^6$ form from isolated binary stars. The properties of double white dwarfs formed in triples closely resemble those formed from isolated binaries, but we also find a small number of systems $\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$ that reach extreme eccentricities $(>0.9)$, a feature unique to the dynamical formation channels. Our population produces $\approx 10^{4} $ individually resolved double white dwarfs (from triple and binary channels) and an unresolved stochastic foreground below the level of the LISA instrumental noise. About $57\,\%$ of double white dwarfs from triple systems retain a bound third star when entering the LISA frequency bandwidth. However, we expect the tertiary stars to be too distant to have a detectable imprint in the gravitational-wave signal of the inner binary.
