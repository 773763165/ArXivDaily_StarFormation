 - **Abstract**
 In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31<w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.

          Weighing The Options: The Unseen Companion in LAMOST J2354 is Likely a Massive White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co, min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly detecting the white dwarf companion.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemistry of phosphorus (31P) in space is particularly significant due to the key role it plays in biochemistry on Earth. Utilising radio and infrared spectroscopic observations, several key phosphorus-containing molecules have been detected in interstellar clouds, circumstellar shells, and even extragalactic sources. Among these, phosphorus nitride (PN) was the first P-bearing molecule detected in space, and still is the species detected in the largest number of sources. Phosphorus oxide (PO) and phosphine (PH3) were also crucial species due to their role both in chemical networks and in forming biogenic compounds. The still limited high-angular resolution observations performed so far are shading light on the geometrical distribution of these molecules, which represent crucial insights on their formation processes. Observations have also highlighted the challenges and complexities associated with detecting and understanding phosphorus chemistry in space, owing to the low elemental abundance of P relative to other elements. This review article provides a state-of-art picture of the observational results obtained so far on phosphorus compounds in the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to star-forming regions, and to their implications for our understanding of prebiotic chemistry and the potential for life beyond Earth. Our knowledge of the dominant formation and destruction pathways of the most abundant species has improved, but critical questions remain open, among which: what is (are) the main phosphorus carrier(s) in space? Upcoming facilities will offer new opportunities to both detect new phosphorus-bearing molecules and enlarge the number of sources in which the chemistry of P can be studied. The synergy between observations, models, laboratory experiments, and computational works is mandatory to progress in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectrographs open a detailed window onto the atmospheres of stars and planets. As the number of systems observed with different instruments grows, it is crucial to develop a standard in analyzing spectral time series of exoplanet transits and occultations, for the benefit of reproducibility. Here, we introduce the ANTARESS workflow, a set of methods aimed at processing high-resolution spectroscopy datasets in a robust way and extracting accurate exoplanetary and stellar spectra. While a fast preliminary analysis can be run on order-merged 1D spectra and cross-correlation functions (CCFs), the workflow was optimally designed for extracted 2D echelle spectra to remain close to the original detector counts, limit the spectral resampling, and propagate the correlated noise. Input data from multiple instruments and epochs were corrected for relevant environmental and instrumental effects, processed homogeneously, and analyzed independently or jointly. In this first paper, we show how planet-occulted stellar spectra extracted along the transit chord and cleaned from planetary contamination provide a direct comparison with theoretical stellar models and enable a spectral and spatial mapping of the photosphere. We illustrate this application of the workflow to archival ESPRESSO data, using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect Revolutions (RMR) technique to confirm the spin-orbit alignment of HD\,209458b and unveil biases in WASP-76b's published orbital architecture. Because the workflow is modular and its concepts are general, it can support new methods and be extended to additional spectrographs to find a range of applications beyond the proposed scope. In a companion paper, we will present how planet-occulted spectra can be processed further to extract and analyze planetary spectra decontaminated from the star, providing clean and direct measurements of atmospheric properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at this https URL. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR>50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.

          On the suppression of giant planet formation around low-mass stars in clustered environments

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Current exoplanet formation studies tend to overlook the birth environment of stars in clustered environments. The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an extensive follow-up campaign of the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) ASASSN-15oi spanning $\delta t \sim 10 - 3000$ d, offering an unprecedented window into the multiwavelength properties of a TDE during its first $\approx 8$ years of evolution. ASASSN-15oi is one of the few TDEs with strong detections at X-ray, optical/UV, and radio wavelengths and featured two delayed radio flares at $\delta t \sim 180$ d and $\delta t \sim 1400$ d. Our observations at $> 1400$ d reveal an absence of thermal X-rays, a late-time variability in the non-thermal X-ray emission, and sharp declines in the non-thermal X-ray and radio emission at $\delta t \sim 2800$ d and $\sim 3000$ d, respectively. The UV emission shows no significant evolution at $>400$ d and remains above the pre-TDE level. We show that a cooling envelope model can explain the thermal emission consistently across all epochs. We also find that a scenario involving episodic ejection of material due to stream-stream collisions is conducive to explaining the first radio flare. Given the peculiar spectral and temporal evolution of the late-time emission, however, constraining the origins of the second radio flare and the non-thermal X-rays remains challenging. Our study underscores the critical role of long-term, multiwavelength follow-up.

          The winds, metallicity, rotational velocities and mass loss rate of the hot, contact binary TU Muscae (HD100213)

 - **Abstract**
 A model of the TU Muscae binary system has been developed by a study of 23 SWP spectrophotometric images obtained with the IUE satellite telescope and downloaded from the IUE Archive. The images are well distributed in Keplerian orbital phase thereby permitting a simultaneous fitting of the C IV wind-line profile by the SEI method and the light curve for the same bandpass by means of a program similar to that of Wilson and Devinney. The result is a set of parameters characterizing the physical and geometric properties of the wind envelopes surrounding the stars. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for a P Cygni profile or strong, distinguishable shock front in the system, as has been found for similar investigations of EM Carinae and HD159176. This is probably a result of the contact nature of the binary and the high temperature environment of such a shock. That is, most of the carbon ions in the shock are more highly ionized. Based on the parameters for the SEI fit to the C IV profile, the value for the ionization fraction of C IV in the wind was calculated to be 10-4. With this value, the mass loss rate calculated from two independent equations, was found to be about 10-6 solar masses/yr. The line blanketing or metallicity was found to be erratically variable with orbital phase and time, indicating a variable amount of fast moving, dense clouds in the winds and/or a great amount of turbulence. The meaning of rotational velocities for the stars is problematic and depends on what point on the photospheres one is considering.

          Rates and beaming angles of GRBs associated with compact binary coalescences

 - **Abstract**
 Some, if not all, binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and a fraction of neutron - star black hole (NSBH) mergers, are thought to produce sufficient mass-ejection to power Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). However, this fraction, as well as the distribution of beaming angles of BNS-associated GRBs, are poorly constrained from observation. Recent work applied machine learning tools to analyze GRB light curves observed by {\textit{Fermi}}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT. GRBs were segregated into multiple distinct clusters, with the tantalizing possibility that one of them (BNS cluster) could be associated with BNSs and another (NSBH cluster) with NSBHs. As a proof of principle, assuming that all GRBs detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT associated with BNSs (NSBHs) lie in the BNS (NSBH) cluster, we estimate their rates ($\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). We compare these rates with corresponding BNS and NSBH rates estimated by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration from the first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3). We find that the BNS rates are consistent with LVK's rate estimates, assuming a uniform distribution of beaming fractions ($f_b \in [0.01, 0.1]$). Conversely, using the LVK's BNS rate estimates, assuming all BNS mergers produce GRBs, we are able to constrain the beaming angle distribution to $\theta_j \in [0.8^{\circ}, 38.8^{\circ}]$ at $90\%$ confidence. We similarly place a lower limit on the fraction of GRB-Bright NSBHs to $f_B \gtrsim 0.10$ ($f_B \gtrsim 0.022$) with {\it Fermi}/GBM ({\it Swift}/BAT) data.

 - **Abstract**
 In the period between 2009 and 2015, several very high-energy (VHE $> 100$ GeV) gamma-ray flaring events from the BL Lac object PKS 1424+240 were observed by the Cerenkov telescopes VERITAS and MAGIC. It had uncertain redshift ($z$) and using spectroscopical measurement, Paiano et al. (2017) found it to be $z=0.604$. Using four different extragalactic background light (EBL) models and the photohadronic model, nine independently observed VHE gamma-ray spectra of PKS 1424+240 are analyzed and a global $\chi^2$ fit is performed on all observations to estimate the best-fit value for the redshift for each EBL model. Confidence levels (CL) intervals for the redshift are also estimated using all the EBL models. This method is tested by comparing our analysis with the observed value. It is shown that the photohadronic scenario provides an excellent description of all the observed spectra. It is found that the EBL model of Domínguez et al. (2011) is the one that provides the most restrictive limits on the redshift of PKS 1424+240, but in our analysis, $z=0.604$ lies within the $3\sigma$ CL interval of the EBL model of Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021).

          Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high resolution and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a machine-learning general methodology, intended to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio according to their potential to contain biosignatures. For that purpose, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra, as having methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained with $\sim\, 10^6$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, which were generated with the package MultiREx, especially developed for this work. The trained algorithms correctly classified test planets with transmission spectra having SNR $<$ 6 and containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra based on the current Earthś atmosphere show at least one of our models would classify as likely having biosignatures and using only one transit, most of the inhabited terrestrial planets observed with the JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs located at distances similar or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e. The implication of this result for the designing of observing programs and future surveys is enormous since machine-assisted strategies similar to those presented here could significantly optimize the usage of JWST resources for biosignature searching, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery after dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of the barycenter of the Solar System (SSB), the origin of the International Celestial Reference System, causes a directional displacement known as secular aberration. The secular aberration drift caused by the galactocentric acceleration of the SSB has been modeled in the third generation of the International Celestial Reference Frame. We aim to address another secular aberration drift effect due to the change in the line-of-sight direction and study its implications for stellar proper motions. A complete formula of secular aberration drift is derived, and its influence on stellar proper motion is computed based on the astrometric data in \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We found that the secular aberration drift due to the change in the line-of-sight direction tends to decrease the observed proper motions for stars with galactic longitudes between $0^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$, and increase the observed proper motion for stars in the remaining region. If this secular aberration drift effect is ignored, it will induce an additional proper motion of $>1\,\mathrm{mas\,yr^{-1}}$ for 84 stars and $>0.02\,\mathrm{mas\,yr^{-1}}$ for 5\,944\,879 stars, which is comparable to or several times greater than the typical formal uncertainty of the \textit{Gaia} proper motion measurements at $G<13$. The secular aberration drift due to the change in the line-of-sight direction and the acceleration of the SSB should be modeled to make the stellar reference frame consistent with the extragalactic reference frame.

 - **Abstract**
 The facility adaptive optics of the Subaru Telescope AO188 recently received some long-awaited upgrades: a new 3224-actuator deformable mirror (DM) from ALPAO (hence the name change to AO3000 or AO3k), an upgraded GPU-based real-time computer, a visible nonlinear curvature wavefront sensor and a near-infrared wavefront sensor (NIR WFS), closing the loop at up to 2~kHz. The wavefront sensors were added in 2023, while the DM will be installed at the beginning of 2024. With these new features, AO3k will provide extreme-AO level of correction to all the instruments on the IR Nasmyth platform: The NIR-MIR camera and spectrograph IRCS, the high-resolution Doppler spectrograph IRD, and the high-contrast instrument SCExAO. AO3k will also support laser tomography (LTAO), delivering high Strehl ratio imaging with large sky coverage. The high Strehl will especially benefit SCExAO for high-contrast imaging, both in infrared and visible. The second stage extreme AO will no longer have to chase large residual atmospheric turbulence, and will focus on truly high-contrast techniques to create and stabilize dark holes, as well as coherent differential imaging techniques. We will finally be able to leverage the several high performance coronagraphs tested in SCExAO, even in the visible. AO3k will answer crucial questions as a precursor for future adaptive optics systems for ELTs, especially as a technology demonstrator for the HCI Planetary Systems Imager on the Thirty Meter Telescope. A lot of questions are still unanswered on the on-sky behavior of high actuator counts DMs, NIR wavefront sensing, the effect of rolling shutters or persistence. We present here the first on-sky results of AO3k, before the system gets fully offered to the observers in the second half of 2024. These results give us some insight on the great scientific results we hope to achieve in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the first ever broadband (0.7-25.0 keV) timing and spectral analysis of Be-HMXB 2S 1417-624 during its 2021 outburst. Using AstroSat observations, coherent pulsations at ~17.36633 s (MJD 59239.082) were detected in 0.7-7.0 keV SXT and 3.0-25.0 keV LAXPC data. The pulse profile was dual peaked at all energies, with the relative intensity of main peak increasing with energy. The peaks in the SXT profiles were broad and comprised of several mini-structures. The LAXPC profiles were relatively smooth and had higher pulsed fraction which increased with energy. The SXT+LAXPC simultaneous energy spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law with exponential cut-off, along with ~1.6 keV black body component and 6.47 keV emission line. A model comprising of an absorbed power law with high energy cutoff plus a partial covering absorber and Gaussian emission line also fits the spectrum quite well. These results have been compared with timing and spectral features during the previous outbursts of this transient pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of five white dwarf + ultracool dwarf systems identified as common proper motion wide binaries in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV~1256-62AB, a gravitationally-bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with a projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white dwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of 10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L subdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.81\pm0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of its optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the stellar/substellar boundary. The subsolar metallicity of the L subdwarf and the system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the Galactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc of the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4 Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at apogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age, making it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar blends, where two or more stars appear blended in an image, pose a significant visualization challenge in astronomy. Traditionally, distinguishing these blends from single stars has been costly and resource-intensive, involving sophisticated equipment and extensive expert analysis. This is especially problematic for analyzing the vast data volumes from surveys, such as Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Legacy Imaging Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To address these challenges, we apply different normalizations and data embeddings on low resolution images of single stars and stellar blends, which are passed as inputs into machine learning methods and to a computationally efficient Gaussian process model (MuyGPs). MuyGPs consistently outperforms the benchmarked models, particularly on limited training data. Moreover, MuyGPs with $r^\text{th}$ root local min-max normalization achieves 83.8% accuracy. Furthermore, MuyGPs' ability to produce confidence bands ensures that predictions with low confidence can be redirected to a specialist for efficient human-assisted labeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift $z\lesssim2.5$ are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z $\gtrsim 6$.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect $\sim 1(2)$ SNe Ia from Pop III stars at $z\approx 4(5)$ for a survey of area $300 \;\rm arcmin^2$ during a $3\;\rm yr$ period with JWST. The same survey may record more than $\sim 400$ SNe Ia at lower redshift ($z\lesssim 2.5$) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be $\sim 6$ Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of $5-10$.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of $5-10$ can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 IGR J17091-3624, in addition to GRS 1915+105, is the only black hole X-ray binary that displays ``heartbeat"-like variability characterized by structured flares with high amplitudes. In this study, we conduct a detailed phase-resolved analysis of the recently identified ``heartbeat"-like Class X variability in IGR J17091-3624 during its 2022 outburst, utilizing data from NICER and NuSTAR observations. A shortage in the high-energy (>20 keV) X-ray flux is detected at peak phases of the soft X-ray flare at a ~15 sigma confidence level from the phase-folded light curves. Furthermore, our phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals variations in the spectral shape, particularly showing significant synchronous variations in the disk temperature and flux with the count rate. These findings imply that the flare is primarily driven by instabilities within the accretion disk, consistent with previous studies on the well-known Class rho variability in GRS 1915+105. However, we also observe a positive correlation between the disk temperature and flux over the flare cycle, which differs from a loop relation between the two parameters found in the Class rho variability. This could suggest differences in underlying physical processes between the two variability classes. Variations in the Componization component during flares are also observed: the electron temperature and covering fraction show anti-correlations with the disk flux, revealing potential interactions between the accretion disk and the corona during these flares.

 - **Abstract**
 After receiving an X-ray photon, an X-ray detector is not operational for a duration known as deadtime. It is detector specific and its effect on the data depends upon the luminosity of the source. It reduces the observed photon count rate in comparison to the expected one. In periodic sources such as the Crab pulsar, it can distort the folded light curve (FLC). An undistorted FLC of the Crab pulsar is required in combination with its polarization properties for studying its X-ray emission mechanism. This work derives a simple formula for the distortion of the FLC of a pulsar caused by the detector deadtime, and validates it using Crab pulsar data from the X-ray observatories {\it NICER} and {\it NUSTAR}, which have very small and relatively large detector deadtimes respectively. Then it derives a method for correcting the distorted FLC of the Crab pulsar in {\it IXPE} data, which has intermediate detector deadtime. The formula is verified after addressing several technical issues. This work ends with a discussion of why an undistorted FLC is important for studying the formation of cusps in the FLC of the Crab pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 The expansion of satellite constellations poses a significant challenge to optical ground-based astronomical observations, as satellite trails degrade observational data and compromise research quality. Addressing these challenges requires developing robust detection methods to enhance data processing pipelines, creating a reliable approach for detecting and analyzing satellite trails that can be easily reproduced and applied by other observatories and data processing groups. Our method, called ASTA (Automated Satellite Tracking for Astronomy), combines deep learning and computer vision techniques for effective satellite trail detection. It employs a U-Net based deep learning network to initially detect trails, followed by a Probabilistic Hough Transform to refine the output. ASTA's U-Net model was trained on a dataset with manually labelled full-field MeerLICHT images prepared using the LABKIT annotation tool, ensuring high-quality and precise annotations. This annotation process was crucial for the model to learn and generalize the characteristics of satellite trails effectively. Furthermore, the user-friendly LABKIT tool facilitated quick and efficient data refinements, streamlining the overall model development process. ASTA's performance was evaluated on a test set of 20,000 image patches, both with and without satellite trails, to rigorously assess its precision and recall. Additionally, ASTA was applied to approximately 200,000 full-field MeerLICHT images, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and characterizing satellite trails. The software's results were validated by cross-referencing detected trails with known public satellite catalogs, confirming its reliability and showcasing its ability to uncover previously untracked objects.

          Polar cap region and plasma drift in pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars often display systematic variations in the position and/or intensity of the subpulses, the components that comprise each single pulse. Although the drift of these subpulses was observed in the early years of pulsar research, and their potential for understanding the elusive emission mechanism was quickly recognised, there is still no consensus on the cause of the drift. We explore the electrodynamics of two recently proposed or refined drift models: one where plasma lags behind corotation, connecting the drift with the rotational pole; and another where plasma drifts around the electric potential extremum of the polar cap. Generally, these are different locations, resulting in different drift behaviours, that can be tested with observations. In this study, however, we specifically examine these models in the axisymmetric case, where the physics is well understood. This approach seems counter-intuitive as both models then predict similar large-scale plasma drift. However, it allows us to show, by studying conditions \emph{within} the sparks for both models, that the lagging behind corotation (LBC) model is inconsistent with Faraday's law. The modified carousel (MC) model, where plasma drifts around the electric potential extremum, not only aligns with Faraday's law, but also provides a future direction for developing a comprehensive model of plasma generation in the polar cap region. Unlike previous models, which considered the drift only inside the discharging regions, the MC model reveals that the electric field \emph{between} the discharges is not completely screened, and plasma drifts there -- a paradigm shift for the drifting subpulse phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep, sub-arcsecond ($\sim$2000 AU) resolution ALMA 0.82 mm observations of the former high-mass prestellar core candidate G11.92-0.61 MM2, recently shown to be an $\sim$500 AU-separation protobinary. Our observations show that G11.92-0.61 MM2, located in the G11.92-0.61 protocluster, lies on a filamentary structure traced by 0.82 mm continuum and N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) emission. The N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) spectra are multi-peaked, indicative of multiple velocity components along the line of sight. To analyse the gas kinematics, we performed pixel-by-pixel Gaussian decomposition of the N$_2$H$^+$ spectra using SCOUSEPY and hierarchical clustering of the extracted velocity components using ACORNS. Seventy velocity- and position-coherent clusters (called "trees") are identified in the N$_2$H$^+$-emitting gas, with the 8 largest trees accounting for >60% of the fitted velocity components. The primary tree, with $\sim$20% of the fitted velocity components, displays a roughly north-south velocity gradient along the filamentary structure traced by the 0.82 mm continuum. Analysing a $\sim$0.17 pc-long substructure, we interpret its velocity gradient of $\sim$10.5 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ as tracing filamentary accretion towards MM2 and estimate a mass inflow rate of $\sim$1.8$\times10^{-4}$ to 1.2$\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Based on the recent detection of a bipolar molecular outflow associated with MM2, accretion onto the protobinary is ongoing, likely fed by the larger-scale filamentary accretion flows. If 50% of the filamentary inflow reaches the protostars, each member of the protobinary would attain a mass of 8 M$_\odot$ within $\sim1.6\times$10$^5$ yr, comparable to the combined timescale of the 70 $\mu$m- and MIR-weak phases derived for ATLASGAL-TOP100 massive clumps using chemical clocks.

          Improving Pulsar Timing Precision with Single Pulse Fluence Clustering

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional pulsar timing techniques involve averaging large numbers of single pulses to obtain a high signal-to-noise (S/N) profile, which is matched to a template to measure a time of arrival (TOA). However, the morphology of individual single pulses varies greatly due to pulse jitter. Pulses of different fluence contribute differently to the S/N of the pulse average. Our study proposes a method that accounts for these variations by identifying a range of states and timing each separately. We selected two 1-hour observations of PSR J2145-0750, each in a different frequency band with the Green Bank Telescope. We normalized the pulse amplitudes to account for scintillation effects and probed different excision algorithms to reduce radio-frequency interference. We then measured four pulse parameters (amplitude, position, width, and energy) to classify the single pulses using automated clustering algorithms. For each cluster, we calculated an average pulse profile and template and used both to obtain a TOA and TOA error. Finally, we computed the weighted average TOA and TOA error, the latter as a metric of the total timing precision for the epoch. The TOA is shifted relative to the one obtained without clustering, and we can estimate the shift with this weighting using the same data. For the 820 MHz and 1400 MHz bands, we obtained TOA uncertainties of 0.057 microseconds and 0.46 microseconds, compared to 0.066 microseconds and 0.74 microseconds when no clustering is applied. We conclude that tailoring this method could help improve the timing precision for certain bright pulsars in NANOGrav's dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional nanosatellite communication links rely on infrequent ground-station access windows. While this is well suited to both payload data and detailed scheduling information, the resulting long periods without contact are ill-suited for both opportunistic tasking of satellites and triggers generated by autonomous operations. Existing orbital infrastructure in the form of satellite communication (SATCOM) networks, such as Iridium and others provide a readily available and cost effective solution to this problem. While these networks continue to be utilized onboard nanosatellites, a full characterization of their utility and performance in-orbit is vital to understand the reliability and potential for high-timeliness message delivery. The SpIRIT 6U nanosatellite is a mission led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with the Italian Space Agency and supported by the Australian Space Agency. Developed over the last four years and launched in a 510km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit in late 2023, SpIRIT carries multiple subsystems for scientific and technology demonstration. The Mercury subsystem provides a demonstration and characterization test bed for SATCOM utilization in-orbit, while also providing the capability of rapid down-link of detection events generated by the main scientific payload of the mission, the HERMES instrument for the detection of high-energy astrophysical transients. This paper first presents a brief payload characterization experiment overview. Early in-orbit results are then presented. This work not only sheds light on the utility of these networks for autonomous operations, and on their potential impact to enable greater utilization of nanosatellites for scientific missions, but also offers insights into the practical challenges related to the design and implementation of utilizing these networks in-orbit.

 Observing and characterizing young planetary systems can aid in unveiling the evolutionary mechanisms that sculpt the mature exoplanet population. As an all-sky survey, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has expanded the known young planet population as it has observed young comoving stellar populations. This work presents the discovery of a multiplanet system orbiting the 61 Myr old G4V star TIC 434398831 (M = 0.99 Msun, R = 0.91 Rsun, Teff = 5638 K, Tmag = 11.31) located in the Theia 116 comoving population. We estimate the population's age based on rotation periods measured from the TESS light curves, isochrone fitting, and measurements of lithium equivalent widths in the spectra of Theia 116 members. The TESS FFI light curves reveal a mini-Neptune (Rb = 3.51 Rearth, Pb = 3.69 days) and super-Neptune (Rc = 5.63 Rearth, Pc = 6.21 days) with an orbital period ratio slightly larger than 5:3. Follow-up observations from CHEOPS and ground-based telescopes confirm the transits of TIC 434398831 b and c, and constrain their transit times. We explore the potential mass-loss histories of the two planets in order to probe possible initial conditions of the planets immediately after formation.

          Revisiting the statistical equilibrium of H$^-$ in stellar atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 The negative hydrogen ion H$^-$ is, almost without exception, treated in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in modelling of F, G and K stars, where it is the dominant opacity source in the visual spectral region. This assumption in practice rests on the study by Lambert & Pagel from 1968. Since that work, knowledge of relevant atomic processes, and theoretical calculations of stellar atmospheres and their spectra, have advanced significantly, yet this question has not been reexamined. Calculations are presented for a slightly modified version of Lambert & Pagel's analytical model including H, H$_2$ and H$^-$, together with modern atomic data and a grid of 1D LTE theoretical stellar atmosphere models with stellar parameters ranging from T$_\mathrm{eff} = 4000$ to 7000~K, $\log{g} = 1$ to 5 cm/s$^2$, and [Fe/H]$=-3$ to 0. We find direct non-LTE effects on populations in spectrum forming regions, continua and spectral lines of the order of 1-2 percent in stars with higher T$_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or lower $\log g$. Effects in models for solar parameters are a factor of 10 smaller, of order 0.1-0.2 percent, and in models with lower T$_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or higher $\log g$ practically absent. These departures from LTE found in our calculations originate from radiative recombination of electrons with hydrogen to form H$^-$ exceeding photodetachment, i.e. overrecombination. Modern atomic data are not a source of significant differences compared to Lambert & Pagel's work, though detailed data for processes on H$_2$ resolved with vibrational and rotational states provide a more complete and complex picture of the role of H$_2$ in the equilibrium of H$^-$. In the context of modern studies of stellar spectra at percent level, our results suggest this question requires further attention, including a more extensive reaction network, and indirect effects due to non-LTE electron populations.

 We present an analysis of a stellar occultation event caused by a near-Earth asteroid (98943) 2001 CC21, an upcoming flyby target in the Hayabusa2 extended mission, on March 5, 2023. To accurately determine the asteroid's shape from diffraction-affected light curves, we developed a novel data reduction technique named the Diffracted Occultation's United Simulator for Highly Informative Transient Explorations (DOUSHITE). Using DOUSHITE-generated synthetic models, we derived constraints on (98943) 2001 CC21's shadow shape from the single-chord occultation data. Our results suggest a significant elongation of the shadow with an axis ratio of $b/a = 0.37\pm0.09$. This shape can be crucial for planning Hayabusa2's high-speed flyby to optimise the limited imaging opportunities.

 Despite the established role of additive manufacturing (AM) in aerospace and medical fields, its adoption in astronomy remains low. Encouraging AM integration in a risk-averse community necessitates documentation and dissemination of previous case studies. The objective of this study is to create the first review of AM in astronomy hardware, answering: where is AM currently being used in astronomy, what is the status of its adoption, and what challenges are preventing its widespread use? The review starts with an introduction to astronomical instruments size/cost challenges, alongside the role of manufacturing innovation. This is followed by highlighting the benefits/challenges of AM and used materials/processes in both space-based and ground-based applications. The review case studies include mirrors, optomechanical structures, compliant mechanisms, brackets and tooling applications that are either in research phase or are implemented.

 - **Abstract**
 Herschel surveys have found large numbers of sources with red far-IR colours, and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) rising from 250 to 500$\mu$m: 500 risers. The nature and role of these sources is not fully understood. We here present Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometric imaging at 200 GHz of a complete sample of five 500 risers with F500 $>$ 44 mJy selected within a 4.5 square degree region of the XMMLSS field. These observations can resolve the separate components of multiple sources and allow cross identification at other wavelengths using the extensive optical-to-IR data in this field. Of our five targets we find that two are likely gravitationally lensed, two are multiple sources, and one an isolated single source. Photometric redshifts, using optical-to-IR data and far-IR/submm data, suggest they lie at redshifts $z \sim 2.5 - 3.5$. Star formation rates and stellar masses estimated from the SEDs show that the majority of our sources lie on the star-formation rate-stellar mass `main sequence', though with outliers both above and below this relation. Of particular interest is our most multiple source which consists of three submm emitters and one submm-undetected optical companion within a 7 arcsecond region, all with photometric redshifts $\sim$ 3. One of the submm emitters in this group lies above the `main sequence', while the optical companion lies well below the relation, and has an estimated stellar mass of 3.3$\pm 1.3 \times$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We suggest this object is a forming brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the process of accreting actively star forming companions.

 - **Abstract**
 Membership analysis is an important tool for studying star clusters. There are various approaches to membership determination, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods. We perform membership analysis using the supervised machine learning approach. We train and test our ML models on two sets of star cluster data: snapshots from $N$-body simulations and 21 different clusters from the Gaia Data Release 3 data. We explore five different ML models: Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Feed-Forward Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbors. We find that all models produce similar results, with RF showing slightly better accuracy. We find that a balance of classes in datasets is optional for successful learning. The classification accuracy depends strongly on the astrometric parameters. The addition of photometric parameters does not improve performance. We do not find a strong correlation between the classification accuracy and clusters' age, mass, and half-mass radius. At the same time, models trained on clusters with a larger number of members generally produce better results.

 - **Abstract**
 The end state of binary-neutron-star (BNS) mergers can manifest conditions to produce high-energy neutrinos. Inspired by the event GW170817, detected in gravitational waves and in optical/infrared emission, we investigate a scenario in which cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated, in a population of BNS mergers, in the energy range from the knee to the ankle. By taking into account the measured thermal and non-thermal energy density of the photon fields in the source environment as a function of the time after the merger, we model the CR interactions and the consequent neutrino production. We propagate the escaped CR and neutrino fluxes through the extragalactic space and compare the expected diffuse fluxes to the experimental data and current limits. Depending on the accelerated CR mass composition and on the contribution of this possible source class to the sub-ankle CR flux, we provide indications on the rate of BNS merger events and the amount of baryons present in the source site.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper demonstrates the impact of state-of-the-art instrumental calibration techniques on the precision of arrival times obtained from 9.6 years of observations of millisecond pulsars using the Murriyang 64-m CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope. Our study focuses on 21-cm observations of 25 high-priority pulsars that are regularly observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) project, including those predicted to be the most susceptible to calibration errors. We employ Measurement Equation Template Matching (METM) for instrumental calibration and Matrix Template Matching (MTM) for arrival time estimation, resulting in significantly improved timing residuals with up to a sixfold reduction in white noise compared to arrival times estimated using Scalar Template Matching and conventional calibration based on the Ideal Feed Assumption. The median relative reduction in white noise is 33 percent, and the maximum absolute reduction is 4.5 microseconds. For PSR J0437-4715, METM and MTM reduce the best-fit power-law amplitude (2.7 sigma) and spectral index (1.7 sigma) of the red noise in the arrival time residuals, which can can be tentatively interpreted as mitigation of 1/f noise due to otherwise unmodeled steps in polarimetric response. These findings demonstrate the potential to directly enhance the sensitivity of pulsar timing array experiments through more accurate methods of instrumental calibration and arrival time estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 When the planet formation process begins in the disks surrounding young stars is still an open question. Annular substructures such as rings and gaps in disks are intertwined with planet formation, and thus their presence or absence is commonly used to investigate the onset of this process. Current observations show a limited number of disks surrounding protostars exhibiting annular substructures, all of them in the Class I stage. The lack of observed features in most of these sources may indicate a late emergence of substructures, but it could also be an artifact of these disks being optically thick. To mitigate the problem of optical depth, we investigate substructures within a very young Class 0 disk characterized by a low inclination using observations at longer wavelengths. We use 3 mm ALMA observations tracing dust emission at a resolution of 7 au to search for evidence of annular substructures in the disk around the deeply embedded Class 0 protostar Oph A SM1. The observations reveal a nearly face-on disk (i$\sim$16$^{\circ}$) extending up to 40 au. The radial intensity profile shows a clear deviation from a smooth profile near 30 au, which we interpret as the presence of either a gap at 28 au or a ring at 34 au with Gaussian widths of $\sigma=1.4^{+2.3}_{-1.2}$ au and $\sigma=3.9^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ au, respectively. The 3 mm emission at the location of the possible gap or ring is determined to be optically thin, precluding the possibility that this feature in the intensity profile is due to the emission being optically thick. Annular substructures resembling those in the more evolved Class I and II disks could indeed be present in the Class 0 stage, earlier than previous observations suggested. Similar observations of embedded disks in which the high optical depth problem can be mitigated are clearly needed to better constrain the onset of substructures in the embedded stages.

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks, small mm-cm-sized pebbles drift inwards which can aid planetary growth and influence the chemical composition of their natal disks. Gaps in protoplanetary disks can hinder the effective inward transport of pebbles by trapping the material in pressure bumps. Here we explore how multiple planets change the vapour enrichment by gap opening. For this, we extend the chemcomp code to include multiple growing planets and investigate the effect of 1, 2 & 3 planets on the water content and C/O ratio in the gas disk as well as the final composition of the planetary atmosphere. We follow planet migration over evaporation fronts and find that previously trapped pebbles evaporate relatively quickly and enrich the gas. We also find that in a multi-planet system, the atmosphere composition can be reduced in carbon and oxygen compared to the case without other planets, due to the blocking of volatile-rich pebbles by an outer planet. This effect is stronger for lower viscosities because planets migrate further at higher viscosities and eventually cross inner evaporation fronts, releasing the previously trapped pebbles. Interestingly, we find that nitrogen remains super-stellar regardless of the number of planets in the system such that super-stellar values in N/H of giant planet atmospheres may be a tracer for the importance of pebble drift and evaporation.

 - **Abstract**
 - Aims: We intended to quantify the impact of stellar multiplicity on the presence and properties of exoplanets. - Methods: We investigated all exoplanet host stars at less than 100 pc using the latest astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and advanced statistical methodologies. We complemented our search for common proper motion and parallax companions with data from the Washington Double Star catalogue and the literature. After excluding a number of systems based on radial velocity data, and membership in clusters and open associations, or with resolved ultracool companions, we kept 215 exoplanet host stars in 212 multiple-star systems. - Results: We found 17 new companions in the systems of 15 known exoplanet host stars, measured precise angular and projected physical separations and position angles for 236 pairs of stars, compiled key parameters for 276 planets in multiple systems, and established a comparison sample comprising 687 single stars with exoplanets. With all of this, we statistically analysed a series of hypothesis regarding planets in multiple stellar systems. Although they are only statistically significant at a 2{\sigma} level, our analysis pointed to several interesting results on the comparison in the mean number of planets in multiple versus single stellar systems and the tendency of high mass planets to be located in closer orbits in multiple systems. We confirm that planets in multiple systems tend to have orbits with larger eccentricities than those in single systems. In particular, we found a significant (> 4{\sigma}) preference for planets to exhibit high orbital eccentricities at small ratios between star-star projected physical separations and star-planet semi-major axes.

          Self-similar cluster structures in massive star-forming regions: Isolated evolution from clumps to embedded clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We used the dendrogram algorithm to decompose the surface density distributions of stars into hierarchical structures. These structures were tied to the multiscale structures of star clusters. A similar power-law for the mass-size relation of star clusters measured at different scales suggests a self-similar structure of star clusters. We used the minimum spanning tree method to measure the separations between clusters and gas clumps in each massive star-forming region. The separations between clusters, between clumps, and between clusters and clumps were comparable, which indicates that the evolution from clump to embedded cluster proceeds in isolation and locally, and does not affect the surrounding objects significantly. By comparing the mass functions of the ATLASGAL clumps and the identified embedded clusters, we confirm that a constant star formation efficiency of $\approx$ 0.33 can be a typical value for the ATLASGAL clumps.

          On the leptonic contribution to the ultra high-energy diffuse gamma-ray background

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra high-energy (UHE) diffuse gamma-ray background holds important information on the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. However, its measurements suffer from a contamination from unresolved sources whose importance remains unclear. In this Letter, we propose a novel data-driven estimate of the contribution of unresolved leptonic sources based on the information present in the ATNF and the LHAASO catalogs. We find that in the inner Galaxy at most $\sim60\%$ of the diffuse flux measured by LHAASO at $10\,\rm{TeV}$ may originate from unresolved leptonic sources, and this fraction drops with energy to less than $20\%$ at $100\,\rm{TeV}$. In the outer Galaxy, the contribution of unresolved leptonic sources is always subdominant. It is less than $\sim 20\%$ at $10\,\rm{TeV}$ and less than $\sim 8\%$ above $\sim25\,\rm{TeV}$. We conclude that the UHE diffuse background should be dominated by photons from a hadronic origin above a few tens of $\rm{TeV}$.

          Prospects of using closure traces directly for imaging in Very Long Baseline Interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 The reconstruction of the polarization of a source in radio interferometry is a challenging calibration problem since the reconstruction strongly depends on the gains and leakages that need to be inferred along with the image. This is particularly true for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) due to its small number of antennas, small signal-to-noise ratio and large gain corruptions. To recover linear polarization, one either has to infer the leakages and gains together with the image structure, or rely completely on calibration independent closure quantities. While the first approach has been explored in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for a long time, the later one has been less studied for polarimetry. Closure traces are a recently proposed concept of closure quantities that, in contrast to closure phases and closure amplitudes, are independent against both gains and leakages and carry the relevant information about the polarization of the source. Here we explore, how closure traces could be directly fitted to create an image and point out an imaging pipeline that succeeds in the direct imaging from closure traces. Since closure traces have a number of inherent degeneracies, multiple local image modes that can fit the data are detected. Therefore, a multiobjective imaging technique is needed to correctly sample this multimodality. Closure traces are not constraining enough for the EHT configuration in 2017 to recover an image directly, mainly due to the small number of antennas. For planned successors of the EHT however (with a significantly larger number of antennas), this option becomes feasible and performs competitive to the imaging with residual leakages.

 Context. 3D numerical simulations of radiative transfer are crucial for understanding complex astrophysical objects. For Monte Carlo radiative transfer, the spatial grid design is critical yet complex. Common grids include hierarchical octree and unstructured Voronoi grids, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Tetrahedral grids, widely used in ray-tracing graphics, are a potential alternative. Aims. We explore the possibilities, advantages, and limitations of tetrahedral grids for Monte Carlo radiative transfer, comparing their performance with other grid structures. Method. We integrated a tetrahedral grid structure, using the TetGen library, into the SKIRT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. Tetrahedral grids can be imported or adaptively constructed and refined within SKIRT. We implemented an efficient grid traversal method using Plücker coordinates and Plücker products. Results. We validated the tetrahedral grid construction and traversal algorithm with 2D radiative transfer benchmarks. In a simple 3D model, we compared the performance of tetrahedral, octree, and Voronoi grids. The octree grid outperformed the others in traversal speed, while the tetrahedral grid had the lowest grid quality. Overall, tetrahedral grids performed worse than octree and Voronoi grids. Conclusion. While tetrahedral grids may not be ideal for most astrophysical simulations, they offer a viable unstructured alternative to Voronoi grids for specific applications, such as post-processing hydrodynamical simulations on tetrahedral or unstructured grids.
