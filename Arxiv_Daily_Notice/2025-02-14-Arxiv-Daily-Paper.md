 - **Abstract**
 Endurance is a mission concept to explore and ultimately return samples from the Moon's largest and oldest impact basin, South Pole-Aitken (SPA). SPA holds the answers to many outstanding planetary science questions, including the earliest impact bombardment of the Solar System and the evolution of the Moon's interior. Endurance would address these questions by traversing 2,000 kilometers across the lunar farside, collecting samples, and delivering those samples to Artemis astronauts for return to Earth. Endurance was identified as the highest priority strategic mission for NASA's Lunar Discovery and Program in the recent Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey. This report summarizes the results from the first public workshop about the concept. Major findings include: (1) Endurance is an exciting concept that would address long-standing, high-priority lunar and planetary science questions, and the community is ready for it. (2) Endurance's sample science objectives are achievable, although they would require coordinated analysis techniques and numerous diverse samples. (3) Geologic context is essential for addressing Endurance's science objectives. (4) While Endurance's objectives center on sample return, Endurance's long traverse would enable a variety of additional transformative science investigations. (5) Endurance is an ambitious mission that would be enabled and enhanced by investing in developing key technologies now. (6) Endurance should strive to include more diverse perspectives in its formulation, particularly from early-career scientists and engineers who will ultimately operate the rover and analyze the samples. Endurance is early in its formulation and the next major activity will be a Science Definition Team (SDT). It is expected that this report and the findings therein may be useful input to the Endurance SDT.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of a candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, with JWST are opening the prospects for characterising potential biospheres on temperate exoplanets. Hycean worlds are a recently theorised class of habitable exoplanets with ocean covered surfaces and hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Hycean planets are thought to be conducive for hosting microbial life under conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans. In the present work we investigate the potential for biological evolution on Hycean worlds and their dependence on the thermodynamic conditions. We find that a large range of evolutionary rates and origination times are possible for unicellular life in oceanic environments for a relatively marginal range in environmental conditions. For example, a relatively small (10 K) increase in the average ocean temperature can lead to over twice the evolutionary rates, with key unicellular groups originating as early as $\sim$1.3 billion years from origin of life. On the contrary, similar decreases in temperatures can also significantly delay the origination times by several billion years. This delay in turn could affect their observable biomarkers such as dimethylsulfide, which is known to be produced predominantly by Eukaryotic marine phytoplankton in Earth's oceans. Therefore, Hycean worlds that are significantly cooler than Earth may be expected to host simpler microbial life than Earth's oceans and may show weaker biosignatures, unless they orbit significantly older stars than the Sun. Conversely, Hycean worlds with warmer surface temperatures than Earth are more likely to show stronger atmospheric biosignatures due to microbial life if present.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of molecular lines are a key tool to determine the main physical properties of prestellar cores. However, not all the information is retained in the observational process or easily interpretable, especially when a larger number of physical properties and spectral features are involved. We present a methodology to link the information in the synthetic spectra with the actual information in the simulated models (i.e., their physical properties), in particular, to determine where the information resides in the spectra. We employ a 1D gravitational collapse model with advanced thermochemistry, from which we generate synthetic spectra. We then use neural network emulations and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning technique, to connect the models' properties to the specific spectral features. Thanks to interpretable machine learning, we find several correlations between synthetic lines and some of the key model parameters, such as the cosmic-ray ionization radial profile, the central density, or the abundance of various species, suggesting that most of the information is retained in the observational process. Our procedure can be generalized to similar scenarios to quantify the amount of information lost in the real observations. We also point out the limitations for future applicability.

          Measuring the Distances to Asteroids from One Observatory in One Night with Upcoming All-Sky Telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming telescopes like the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO) and the Argus Array will image large fractions of the sky multiple times per night yielding numerous Near Earth Object (NEO) discoveries. When asteroids are measured with short observation time windows, the dominant uncertainty in orbit construction is due to distance uncertainty to the NEO. One approach to recover distances is from topocentric parallax, which is a technique that leverages the rotation of the Earth, causing a small but detectable sinusoidal additive signal to the Right Ascension (RA) of the NEO following a period of 1 day. In this paper, we further develop and evaluate this technique to recover distances in as quickly as a single night. We first test the technique on synthetic data of 19 different asteroids ranging from $\sim0.05 \,\text{AU}$ to $\sim2.4 \,\text{AU}$. We modify previous algorithms and quantify the limitations of the method, recovering distances with uncertainties as low as the $\sim1.3\%$ level for more nearby objects ($\lesssim$ 0.3 AU) assuming typical astrometric uncertainties. We then acquire our own observations of two asteroids within a single night with $\sim0.1''$ uncertainties on RA, and we find we are able to recover distances to the $3\%$ level. We forecast likely scenarios with the VRO and the Argus Array with varying levels of astrometric precision and expected pointings per night. Our analysis indicates that distances to NEOs on the scale of $\sim0.5$ AU can be constrained to below the percent level within a single night, depending on spacing of observations from one observatory. In a follow-up paper, we will compare these constraints with synchronous and asynchronous observations from two separate observatories to measure parallax even more efficiently, an exciting and likely possibility over the upcoming decade.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical discovery and multiwavelength follow-up observations of AT2024kmq, a likely tidal disruption event (TDE) associated with a supermassive ($M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{8} M_\odot$) black hole in a massive galaxy at $z=0.192$. The optical light curve of AT2024kmq exhibits two distinct peaks: an early fast (timescale 1 d) and luminous ($M\approx-20$ mag) red peak, then a slower (timescale 1 month) blue peak with a higher optical luminosity ($M\approx-22$ mag) and featureless optical spectra. The second component is similar to the spectroscopic class of "featureless TDEs" in the literature, and during this second component we detect highly variable, luminous ($L_X\approx 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and hard ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-1.5}$) X-ray emission. Luminous ($10^{29} $erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at 10 GHz) but unchanging radio emission likely arises from an underlying active galactic nucleus. The luminosity, timescale, and color of the early red optical peak can be explained by synchrotron emission, or alternatively by thermal emission from material at a large radius ($R\approx\mathrm{few}\times10^{15}$ cm). Possible physical origins for this early red component include an off-axis relativistic jet, and shocks from self-intersecting debris leading to the formation of the accretion disk. Late-time radio observations will help distinguish between the two possibilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the composition of exoplanets is one of the most promising approaches to observationally constrain planet formation and evolution processes. However, this endeavour is complicated for small exoplanets by the fact that a wide range of compositions is compatible with their bulk properties. To overcome this issue, we identify triangular regions in the mass-radius space where part of this degeneracy is lifted for close-in planets, since low-mass H/He envelopes would not be stable due to high-energy stellar irradiation. Planets in these Hot Water World triangles need to contain at least some heavier volatiles and are therefore interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up observations. We perform a demographic study to show that only few well-characterised planets in these regions are currently known and introduce our CHEOPS GTO programme aimed at identifying more of these potential hot water worlds. Here, we present CHEOPS observations for the first two targets of our programme, TOI-238 b and TOI-1685 b. Combined with TESS photometry and published RVs, we use the precise radii and masses of both planets to study their location relative to the corresponding Hot Water World triangles, perform an interior structure analysis and study the lifetimes of H/He and water-dominated atmospheres under these conditions. We find that TOI-238 b lies, at the 1-sigma level, inside the corresponding triangle. While a pure H/He atmosphere would have evaporated after 0.4-1.3 Myr, it is likely that a water-dominated atmosphere would have survived until the current age of the system, which makes TOI-238 b a promising hot water world candidate. Conversely, TOI-1685 b lies below the mass-radius model for a pure silicate planet, meaning that even though a water-dominated atmosphere would be compatible both with our internal structure and evaporation analysis, we cannot rule out the planet to be a bare core.

 - **Abstract**
 HL Tau is one of the most well-studied Class I young stellar objects, including frequent observations at near- and mid-infrared, (sub-) millimeter, and X-ray wavelengths. We present the results of an X-ray variability monitoring campaign with XMM-Newton in 2020 and X-ray gratings spectroscopy from Chandra/HETGS in 2018. We find that the X-ray spectrum of HL Tau is consistently hot (with characteristic plasma temperatures $T \gtrsim 30$ MK) over 31 epochs spanning 20 years, which is consistent in temperature with most Class I YSOs. The high-resolution HETG spectrum indicates the presence of some cooler plasma. We characterize the variability of the star across the 31 observations and find a subset of observations with significant variability on a $\sim$21-day timescale in the observed count rate and flux. We discuss the possible origins of this variability, and identify further observations that would better constrain the nature of the changes.

 - **Abstract**
 Markarian 501, a well known high energy BL Lac object, has exhibited several epochs of very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray flaring events when its synchrotron peak frequency shifted above $10^{17}$ Hz, a signature of extreme behavior. From July 16 to July 31, 2014 such flaring events were observed for 15 days by various telescopes. On July 19 (MJD 56857.98), the X-ray outburst from the source was at its highest and on the same day an intriguing narrow peak-like feature around 3 TeV was observed by MAGIC telescopes, a feature inconsistent with standard interpretations. Using the well known two-zone photohadronic model, we study these VHE gamma-ray spectra on a day-by-day basis and offer explanation. Our two-zone photohadronic scenario shows that, on MJD 56857.98, the peak-like feature appears at a cutoff energy of $E^c_{\gamma}$ = 3.18 TeV. Below this energy the observed VHE spectrum increases slowly and above $E^c_{\gamma}$ it falls faster, thus resulting in a mild peak-like feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study investigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyman (Ly)-$\alpha$ (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules in molecular clouds. The UV destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be ($4.7\pm0.3)\times10^{-18}$ cm$^2$, providing insight into its half-life of $6.5\times10^{7}$ yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming up process following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides and their derivatives. High mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several complex organic molecules, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.

 - **Abstract**
 In high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), the compact object accretes the strong stellar wind of an O-B supergiant companion star. X-ray flux variations alter the stellar wind's ionization state and optical line profiles, which are key in the determination of the orbital parameters of the system. Using the method of Fourier Disentangling, we decomposed the spectral contributions from the stellar atmosphere close to the photosphere and the accreted stream of matter (i.e. the focused wind). High-resolution optical spectroscopy of Cyg X-1 in its hard and soft-intermediate X-ray states revealed state-dependent variability in the line profiles. In both states, we detect H-alpha and He II in both the focused wind and the stellar photosphere, whereas He I is not detected in the focused wind. Additionally, we observe an X-ray/optical anticorrelation, where the lines' intensity decreases in the soft-intermediate state and the lines are more absorbed at the inferior conjunction of the star. These results suggest a stronger wind in the low-hard state and the presence of high-density clumps in the line of sight at the conjunction.

 The PLATO mission is scheduled for launch in December 2026. It is an ESA M-class mission designed to find small planets around bright stars via the transit technique. The light curves it obtains will be wonderful for other science goals, among which is the study of binary and multiple stars. We are creating the Multiple Star Working Group (MSWG) to bring together the community to best exploit this unique opportunity. We will assemble the many science cases, create target lists, and co-ordinate applications for PLATO observations. We include instructions on how to register your interest.

          In-depth characterization of the Kepler-10 three-planet system with HARPS-N RVs and Kepler TTVs

 - **Abstract**
 The old G3V star Kepler-10 is known to host two transiting planets, the ultra-short-period super-Earth Kepler-10b ($P=0.837$ d; $R_{\rm p}=1.47~\rm R_\oplus$) and the long-period sub-Neptune Kepler-10c ($P=45.294$ d; $R_{\rm p}=2.35~\rm R_\oplus$), and a non-transiting planet causing variations in the Kepler-10c transit times. Measurements of the mass of Kepler-10c in the literature have shown disagreement, depending on the radial-velocity dataset and/or the modeling technique used. Here we report on the analysis of almost 300 high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo over $\sim11$~years, and extracted with the YARARA-v2 tool correcting for possible systematics and/or low-level activity variations at the spectrum level. To model these radial velocities, we used three different noise models and various numerical techniques, which all converged to the solution: $M_{\rm p, b}=3.24 \pm 0.32~\rm M_\oplus$ (10$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, b}=5.54 \pm 0.64~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet b; $M_{\rm p, c}=11.29 \pm 1.24~\rm M_\oplus$ (9$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, c}=4.75 \pm 0.53~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet c; and $M_{\rm p, d}\sin{i}=12.00 \pm 2.15~\rm M_\oplus$ (6$\sigma$) and $P=151.06 \pm 0.48$ d for the non-transiting planet Kepler-10d. This solution is further supported by the analysis of the Kepler-10c transit timing variations and their simultaneous modeling with the HARPS-N radial velocities. While Kepler-10b is consistent with a rocky composition and a small or no iron core, Kepler-10c may be a water world that formed beyond the water snowline and subsequently migrated inward.

 - **Abstract**
 The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) is the X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for the soft X-ray imaging telescope Xtend installed on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which was adopted as a recovery mission for the Hitomi X-ray satellite and was successfully launched on 2023 September 7 (JST). In order to maximize the science output of XRISM, we set the requirements for Xtend and find that the CCD set employed in the Hitomi/SXI or similar, i.e., a $2 \times 2$ array of back-illuminated CCDs with a $200~\mu$m-thick depletion layer, would be practically best among available choices, when used in combination with the X-ray mirror assembly. We design the XRISM/SXI, based on the Hitomi/SXI, to have a wide field of view of $38' \times 38'$ in the $0.4-13$ keV energy range. We incorporated several significant improvements from the Hitomi/SXI into the CCD chip design to enhance the optical-light blocking capability and to increase the cosmic-ray tolerance, reducing the degradation of charge-transfer efficiency in orbit. By the time of the launch of XRISM, the imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the SXI has been extensively studied in on-ground experiments with the full flight-model configuration or equivalent setups and confirmed to meet the requirements. The optical blocking capability, the cooling and temperature control performance, and the transmissivity and quantum efficiency to incident X-rays of the CCDs are also all confirmed to meet the requirements. Thus, we successfully complete the pre-flight development of the SXI for XRISM.

          What causes the ultraviolet extinction bump at the cosmic dawn?

 - **Abstract**
 The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore likelihood-free (aka simulation-based) Bayesian model selection to quantify model comparison analyses of reionisation scenarios. We iteratively train the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on four toy EoR models based on 21cmFAST simulations with contrasting morphology to obtain summaries of the 21 cm lightcone. Within the pyDelfi framework, we replaced the Emcee sampler with MultiNest to integrate learnt posteriors and produce the Bayesian Evidence. We comfortably distinguish the model used to produce the mock data set in all cases. However, we struggle to produce accurate posterior distributions for outside-in reionisation models. After a variety of cross-checks and alternate analyses we discuss the flexibility of summarising models that differ from precisely the intended network training conditions as this should be more widely scrutinised before CNN can reliably analyse observed data.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores dynamical models of the Milky Way (MW) by analyzing a sample of 86,109 K giant stars selected through cross-matching the LAMOST DR8 and Gaia EDR3 surveys. Our earlier torus models in Wang et al. (2017) did not include Gaia data, making them incompatible with the new proper motion distributions of samples. Here, we refine the construction of action-based, self-consistent models to constrain the three-dimensional velocity distribution of K giants over a larger parameter space, drawing on a series of existing MW models. This approach produces several new MW models. Our best-fit model for the local kinematics near the Sun indicates a MW virial mass of 1.35 $\times 10^{12} M_\odot$, a local stellar density of 0.0696 $\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}$, and a local dark matter density of 0.0115 $\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}$. Our main conclusion supports a thicker and more extended thick disk, alongside a cooler thin disk, compared to the best-fitting model in Wang et al. (2017). Near the Sun, our model aligns well with observations, but is less satisfactory at distances far from the Galactic center, perhaps implying unidentified structures. Further high-precision observations will be critical for understanding the dynamics in these outer Galactic regions, and will require a more realistic model.

 - **Abstract**
 On February 13th, 2023, the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope detected a neutrino candidate with an estimated energy in the hundreds of PeVs. In this article, the observation of this ultra-high-energy neutrino is discussed in light of null observations above tens of PeV from the IceCube and Pierre Auger observatories. Performing a joint fit of all experiments under the assumption of an isotropic $E^{-2}$ flux, the best-fit single-flavour flux normalisation is $E^2 \Phi^{\rm 1f}_{\nu + \bar \nu} = 7.5 \times 10^{-10}~{\rm GeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}}$ in the 90% energy range of the KM3NeT event. Furthermore, the ultra-high-energy data are then fit together with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, either with a single power law or with a broken power law, allowing for the presence of a new component in the spectrum. The joint fit including non-observations by other experiments in the ultra-high-energy region shows a slight preference for a break in the PeV regime if the ``High-Energy Starting Events'' sample is included, and no such preference for the other two IceCube samples investigated. A stronger preference for a break appears if only the KM3NeT data is considered in the ultra-high-energy region, though the flux resulting from such a fit would be inconsistent with null observations from IceCube and Pierre Auger. In all cases, the observed tension between KM3NeT and other datasets is of the order of $2.5\sigma-3\sigma$, and increased statistics are required to resolve this apparent tension and better characterise the neutrino landscape at ultra-high energies.

 In this work, we develop a theoretical model for the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density field before and after standard baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction. Using this model, we extract the redshift-space distortion (RSD) parameter from the cross-power spectrum. The model is validated against a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness for cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the light curves of a sample of novae, classifying them into single-peaked and multiple-peaked morphologies. Using accurate distances from Gaia, we determine the spatial distribution of these novae by computing their heights, $Z$, above the Galactic plane. We show that novae exhibiting a single peak in their light curves tend to concentrate near the Galactic plane, while those displaying multiple peaks are more homogeneously distributed, reaching heights up to 1000 pc above the plane. A KS test rejects the null hypothesis that the two distributions originate from the same population at a significance level corresponding to $4.2\sigma$.

 Large, freely available, well-maintained data sets have made astronomy a popular playground for machine learning projects. Nevertheless, robust insights gained to both machine learning and physics could be improved by clarity in problem definition and establishing workflows that critically verify, characterize and calibrate machine learning models. We provide a collection of guidelines to setting up machine learning projects to make them likely useful for science, less frustrating and time-intensive for the scientist and their computers, and more likely to lead to robust insights. We draw examples and experience from astronomy, but the advice is potentially applicable to other areas in science.

          Impact of accretor size on the morphology of supersonic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flows

 - **Abstract**
 Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with surrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow shocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes affect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its accretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to distinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance, and the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations using a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the accretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the stand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these spatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady state. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock forms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within. Accretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while larger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales. Fully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly anisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger accretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow direction, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size strongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow characteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the bow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does not affect large-scale flow morphology.

          Secondary ionisation in hot atmospheres and interactions between planetary and stellar winds

 - **Abstract**
 The loss of close-in planetary atmospheres is influenced by various physical processes, such as photoionisation, which could potentially affect the atmosphere survivability on a secular timescale. The amount of stellar radiation converted into heat depends on the energy of the primary electrons produced by photoionisation and the local ionisation fraction. The Lyman-alpha line is an excellent probe for atmospheric escape. We study the interaction between the planetary and the stellar wind, the difference of the predicted mass-loss rates between 1D and 2D models, the signal of Ly-a and the impact of stellar flares. Using the PLUTO code, we perform 2D hydrodynamics simulations for four different planets. We consider planets in the size range from Neptune to Jupiter. We produce synthetic Ly-a profiles to comprehend the origin of the signal, and in particular its high velocity Doppler shift. Our results indicate a trend similar to the 1D models, with a decrease in the planetary mass-loss rate for all systems when secondary ionisation is taken into account. The mass-loss rates are found to decrease by 48% for the least massive planet when secondary ionisation is accounted for. We find nevertheless a decrease that is less pronounced in 2D than in 1D. We observe differences in the Ly-a profile between the different cases and significant asymmetries in all of them, especially for the lower mass planets. Finally, we observe that stellar flares do not affect the mass-loss rate because they act, in general, on a timescale that is too short. We find velocities in the escaping atmosphere up to 100 km/s, with the gas moving away from the star, which could be the result of the interaction with the stellar wind. Furthermore, we find that stellar flares generally occur on a timescale that is too short to have a visible impact on the mass-loss rate of the atmosphere.

          Field-level inference of $H_0$ from simulated type Ia supernovae in a local Universe analogue

 - **Abstract**
 Two particular challenges face type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) as probes of the expansion rate of the Universe. One is that they may not be fair tracers of the matter velocity field, and the second is that their peculiar velocities distort the Hubble expansion. Although the latter has been estimated at $\lesssim1.5\%$ for $z>0.023$, this is based either on constrained linear or unconstrained non-linear velocity modelling. In this paper, we address both challenges by incorporating a physical model for the locations of supernovae, and develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model that accounts for non-linear peculiar velocities in our local Universe, inferred from a Bayesian analysis of the 2M++ spectroscopic galaxy catalogue. With simulated data, the model recovers the ground truth value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the presence of peculiar velocities including their correlated uncertainties arising from the Bayesian inference, opening up the potential of including lower redshift SNeIa to measure $H_0$. Ignoring peculiar velocities, the inferred $H_0$ increases minimally by $\sim 0.4 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the range $0.023<z<0.046$. We conclude it is unlikely that the $H_0$ tension originates in unaccounted-for non-linear velocity dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT observatory detected the most energetic neutrino candidate ever observed, with an energy between 72 PeV and 2.6 EeV at the 90% confidence level. The observed neutrino is likely of cosmic origin. In this article, it is investigated if the neutrino could have been produced within the Milky Way. Considering the low fluxes of the Galactic diffuse emission at these energies, the lack of a nearby potential Galactic particle accelerator in the direction of the event and the difficulty to accelerate particles to such high energies in Galactic systems, we conclude that if the event is indeed cosmic, it is most likely of extragalactic origin.

          Physically motivated analytic model of energy efficiency for EUV-driven atmospheric escape of close-in exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) driven atmospheric escape is a key process in the atmospheric evolution of close-in exoplanets. In many evolutionary models, the energy-limited mass-loss rate with a constant efficiency (typically $\sim10\%$) is assumed for calculating the mass-loss rate. However, hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that this efficiency depends on various stellar and planetary parameters. Comprehending the underlying physics of the efficiency is essential for understanding planetary atmospheric evolution and recent observations of the upper atmosphere of close-in exoplanets. We introduce relevant temperatures and timescales derived from physical principles to elucidate the mass-loss process. Our analytical mass-loss model is based on phenomenology and consistent across a range of planetary parameters. We compare our mass-loss efficiency and the radiation hydrodynamic simulations. The model can predict efficiency in both energy-limited and recombination-limited regimes. We further apply our model to exoplanets observed with hydrogen absorption (Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$). Our findings suggest that Ly$\alpha$ absorption is detectable in planets subjected to intermediate EUV flux; under these conditions, the escaping outflow is insufficient in low-EUV environments, while the photoionization timescale remains short in high-EUV ranges. Conversely, H$\alpha$ absorption is detectable under high EUV flux conditions, facilitated by the intense Ly$\alpha$ flux exciting hydrogen atoms. According to our model, the non-detection of neutral hydrogen can be explained by a low mass-loss rate and is not necessarily due to stellar wind confinement or the absence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere in many cases. This model assists in identifying future observational targets and explicates the unusual absorption detection/non-detection patterns observed in recent studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $>2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.

          Stability and Dynamics of Three-Mode Coupling in $δ$ Scuti Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of $\delta$ Scuti stars find evidence of nonlinear three-mode coupling in their oscillation spectra. There are two types of three-mode coupling likely to be important in $\delta$ Scuti stars: (i) direct coupling, in which two linearly unstable modes (driven by the kappa-mechanism) excite a linearly stable mode, and (ii) parametric coupling, in which one linearly unstable mode excites two linearly stable modes. Breger & Montgomery (2014) find especially strong evidence of direct coupling in the $\delta$ Scuti star KIC 8054146. However, direct coupling is inherently unstable and cannot be the mechanism by which the modes saturate and achieve nonlinear equilibrium. By integrating the amplitude equations of small mode networks, we show that the modes can achieve equilibrium if parametric coupling operates in tandem with direct coupling. Using mode parameters calculated from a $\delta$ Scuti model, we also find that parametric and direct coupling are likely to be simultaneously active. Importantly, parametric coupling does not necessarily disrupt the correlations found in KIC 8054146 between the amplitudes and phases of the directly coupled modes. We conclude that $\delta$ Scuti stars are likely impacted by both parametric and direct coupling and that accounting for both in future large mode network calculations may help explain the complicated mode dynamics observed in many $\delta$ Scuti stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Cluster scaling relations are key ingredients in cluster abundance-based cosmological studies. In optical cluster cosmology, weak gravitational lensing has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the cluster mass-richness relation. This work is conducted as part of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), which aims to analyze the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of Vera C. Rubin Observatory, starting in 2026. Weak lensing-inferred cluster properties, such as mass, suffer from several sources of bias. In this paper, we aim to test the impact of modeling choices and observational systematics in cluster lensing on the inference of the mass-richness relation. We constrain the mass-richness relation of 3,600 clusters detected by the redMaPPer algorithm in the cosmoDC2 extra-galactic mock catalog (covering $440$ deg$^2$) of the LSST DESC DC2 simulation, using number count measurements and stacked weak lensing profiles in several intervals of richness ($20 \leq \lambda \leq 200$) and redshift ($0.2 \leq z \leq 1$). By modeling the mean of the scaling relation as $\langle \ln \lambda|M_{\rm 200c}, z\rangle = \ln\lambda_0 + \mu_z\log[(1+z)/(1+0.5)] + \mu_m[\log_{10}(M_{\rm 200c}) - 14.3]$, our baseline constraints are $\ln\lambda_0 = 3.37\pm 0.03$, $\mu_z = 0.08\pm 0.07$ and $\mu_m = 2.18 \pm 0.07$. We have found that, for a LSST-like source galaxy density, our constraints are robust to a change in concentration-mass relation and dark matter density profile modeling choices, when source redshifts and shapes are perfectly known. We have found that photometric redshift uncertainties can introduce bias at the $1\sigma$ level, which can be mitigated by an overall correcting factor, fitted jointly with scaling parameters. We find that including positive shear-richness covariance in the fit shifts the results by up to 0.5$\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet research is at the forefront of contemporary astronomy recommendations. As more and more exoplanets are discovered and vetted, databases and catalogs are built to collect information. Various resources are available to scientists for this purpose, though every one of them has different scopes and notations. In Alei et al. (2020) we described Exo-MerCat, a script that collects information from multiple sources and creates a homogenized table. In this manuscript, we announce the release of the Exo-MerCat v2.0.0 script as an upgraded, tested, documented and open-source software to produce catalogs. The main upgrades on the script concern: 1) the addition of the TESS Input Catalog and the K2 Input Catalog as input sources; 2) the optimization of the main identifier queries; 3) a more complex merging of the entries from the input sources into the final catalog; 4) some quality-of-life improvements such as informative flags, more user-friendly column headers, and log files; 5) the refactoring of the code in modules. We compare the performance of Exo-MerCat v2.0.0 with the previous version and notice a substantial improvement in the completeness of the sample, thanks to the addition of new input sources, and its accuracy, because of the optimization of the script.

 I show that a dedicated space telescope with a meter-size aperture can detect numerous interstellar objects, 10-m in diameter, that pass within ~20 degrees from the Sun. Separating the emitted thermal radiation from the reflection of sunlight would allow to measure the surface temperature, area and albedo of these objects. Spectroscopic observations of any evaporated material at the expected temperature of ~600K would provide important clues about the nature and birth sites of interstellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino with an energy estimate of ~ 220 PeV, the most energetic yet observed. The neutrino arrival direction has a 99% confidence region of 3° radius centred at RA 94.3°, Dec -7.8° (J2000). High-energy astrophysical neutrinos are a crucial messenger for understanding hadronic acceleration processes in the Universe and for identifying the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Among the most powerful cosmic accelerators, blazars are proposed as promising neutrino sources. A sample of seventeen candidate blazars located in this region is selected through their multiwavelength properties, and studied using archival data and dedicated observations. One of the candidate counterparts exhibits a radio flare coinciding with the neutrino arrival time, with a pre-trial chance probability of 0.26%. Another candidate counterpart exhibits a rising trend in the X-ray flux in a one-year window around the neutrino arrival time. A third candidate undergoes a gamma-ray flare during the same period. While none of these candidates can conclusively be linked to the neutrino, the implications of a possible blazar origin for the KM3NeT event are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 On the 13th February 2023 the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope observed a track-like event compatible with a ultra-high-energy muon with an estimated energy of 120 PeV, produced by a neutrino with an even higher energy, making it the most energetic neutrino event ever detected. A diffuse cosmogenic component is expected to originate from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with ambient photon and matter fields. The flux level required by the KM3NeT/ARCA event is however in tension with the standard cosmogenic neutrino predictions based on the observations collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array over the last decade of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays above the ankle (hence from the local Universe, $z\lesssim 1$). We show here that both observations can be reconciled by extending the integration of the equivalent cosmogenic neutrino flux up to a redshift of $z\simeq 6$ and assuming a subdominant fraction of protons in the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray flux, thus placing constraints on known cosmic accelerators.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most challenging problems in cosmology is the Hubble tension, a discrepancy in the predicted expansion rate of the Universe. We leverage the sensitivity of the Dispersion Measure (DM) from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Hubble factor to investigate the Hubble tension. We build a catalog of 98 localized FRBs and an independent mock catalog and employ 3 methods to calculate the best value of the $H_0$: i) the mean of $H_0$ values obtained through direct calculation, ii) the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and iii) the reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history $H(z)$ using two DM-$z$ relations. When the confirmed FRBs is employed, our predictions are compatible with reports from the Planck+2018, with $H_0=65.13\pm2.52\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $57.67\pm11.99\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for MLE and the arithmetic mean, respectively. If we assume a linear and a power-law function for the DM-$z$ relation, our predictions for $H_0$ are $51.27^{+3.80}_{-3.31}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $77.09^{+8.89}_{-7.64}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively. Using 100 mock catalogs of simulated FRBs, we obtain larger values for $H_0$ with all methods considered: $H_{0;\text{ Like}}=67.30\pm0.91\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Mean}}=66.21\pm3.46\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Median}}=66.10\pm1.89\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{Linear}}=54.34\pm1.57\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_{0;\text{Power-law}}=91.84\pm1.82\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for the MLE, the arithmetic mean, and linear and power-law $\text{DM}-z$ relations, respectively. Our results for mock FRB catalogs increase the statistical precision, ranging from 1.4\% to 5.2\% for the MLE and arithmetic mean. Our result with the MLE applied to synthetic FRBs is at the same level of precision as reports from SH0ES. The increase in the number of confirmed FRBs will provide us, in combination with other observations, a robust prediction of the value of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through general relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), which uses a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to improve the accuracy of generated black hole images based on seven physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. This approach reduces computational costs and provides a faster, more efficient method for dataset expansion, parameter estimation, and model fitting.

 - **Abstract**
 Debris disks common around Sun-like stars carry dynamical imprints in their structure that are key to understanding the formation and evolution history of planetary systems. In this paper, we extend an algorithm (rave) originally developed to model edge-on disks to be applicable to disks at all inclinations. The updated algorithm allows for non-parametric recovery of the underlying (i.e., deconvolved) radial profile and vertical height of optically thin, axisymmetric disks imaged in either thermal emission or scattered light. Application to simulated images demonstrates that the de-projection and deconvolution performance allows for accurate recovery of features comparable to or larger than the beam or PSF size, with realistic uncertainties that are independent of model assumptions. We apply our method to recover the radial profile and vertical height of a sample of 18 inclined debris disks observed with ALMA. Our recovered structures largely agree with those fitted with an alternative visibility-space de-projection and deconvolution method (frank). We find that for disks in the sample with a well-defined main belt, the belt radius, fractional width and fractional outer edge width all tend to increase with age, but do not correlate in a clear or monotonic way with dust mass or stellar temperature. In contrast, the scale height aspect ratio does not strongly correlate with age, but broadly increases with stellar temperature. These trends could reflect a combination of intrinsic collisional evolution in the disk and the interaction of perturbing planets with the disk's own gravity.
