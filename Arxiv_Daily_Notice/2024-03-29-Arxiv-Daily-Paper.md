 - **Abstract**
 The current and upcoming large data volume galaxy surveys require the use of machine learning techniques to maximize their scientific return. This study explores the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to estimate galaxy parameters with a focus on handling cases of missing data and providing realistic probability distribution functions for the parameters. We train a SOM with a simulated mass-limited lightcone assuming a ugrizYJHKs+IRAC dataset, mimicking the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Deep joint dataset. For parameter estimation, we derive SOM likelihood surfaces considering photometric errors to derive total (statistical and systematic) uncertainties. We explore the effects of missing data including which bands are particular critical to the accuracy of the derived parameters. We demonstrate that the parameter recovery is significantly better when the missing bands are "filled-in" rather than if they are completely omitted. We propose a practical method for such recovery of missing data.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of temperate sub-Neptunes is the new frontier in exoplanetary science. A major development in the past year has been the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of a temperate sub-Neptune, K2-18 b, a possible Hycean world, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The JWST is poised to characterise the atmospheres of several other such planets with important implications for planetary processes in the temperate regime. Meanwhile, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has been highly successful in detecting chemical signatures of giant exoplanets, though low-mass planets have remained elusive. In the present work, we report the atmospheric reconnaissance of a temperate sub-Neptune using ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. The long orbital period and the low systemic velocity results in a low planetary radial velocity during transit, making this system a valuable testbed for high-resolution spectroscopy of temperate sub-Neptunes. We observe high-resolution time-series spectroscopy in the H- and K-bands during the planetary transit with the IGRINS instrument (R$\sim$45,000) on Gemini-South. Using observations from a single transit we find marginal evidence (2.2$\sigma$) for the presence of methane (CH$_4$) in the atmosphere and no evidence for ammonia (NH$_3$) despite its strong detectability for a cloud-free H$_2$-rich atmosphere. We assess our findings using injection tests with different atmospheric scenarios, and find them to be consistent with a high CH$_4$/NH$_3$ ratio and/or the presence of high-altitude clouds. Our results demonstrate the capability of Gemini-S/IGRINS for atmospheric characterization of temperate sub-Neptunes, and the complementarity between space- and ground-based facilities in this planetary regime.

 - **Abstract**
 In cosmologies with hidden sector dark matter, the lightest hidden sector species can come to dominate the energy budget of the universe and cause an early matter-dominated era (EMDE). EMDEs amplify the matter power spectrum on small scales, leading to dense, early-forming microhalos which massively boost the dark matter annihilation signal. We use the Fermi-LAT measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background to place limits on the parameter space of hidden sector models with EMDEs. We calculate the amplified annihilation signal by sampling the properties of prompt cusps, which reside at the centers of these microhalos and dominate the signal on account of their steep $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ density profiles. We also include the portions of the parameter space affected by the gravitational heating that arises from the formation and subsequent destruction of nonlinear structure during the EMDE. We are able to rule out significant portions of the parameter space, particularly at high reheat temperatures. Long EMDEs remain poorly constrained despite large structure-induced boosts to the annihilation signal.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared has led to detections of prominent molecules in several giant exoplanets on close-in orbits. This approach has traditionally relied on the large Doppler shifts of the planetary spectral lines induced by the high velocities of the close-in planets, which were considered necessary for separating them from the quasi-static stellar and telluric lines. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for chemical detections in atmospheres of temperate low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs with low radial velocity variation during transit. We pursue this goal using model injection and recovery tests with H- and K- band high-resolution spectroscopy of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-732 c, observed using the IGRINS spectrograph on Gemini-S. We show that planetary signals in transit may be recovered when the change in the planet's radial velocity is very small, down to sub-pixel velocities. This is possible due to the presence of the planetary signal in only a subset of the observed spectra. A sufficient number of out-of-transit spectra can create enough contrast between the planet signal and telluric/stellar contaminants that the planet signal does not constitute a principal component of the time-series spectra and can therefore be isolated using PCA-based detrending without relying on a significant Doppler shift. We additionally explore novel metrics for finding such signals, and investigate trends in their detectability. Our work extends the scope of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy and creates a pathway towards the characterisation of habitable sub-Neptune worlds with ground-based facilities.
#### Ages of "singles" versus "multis": Predictions for dynamical sculpting  over Gyr in the Kepler Sample

 - **Abstract**
 The sample of host stars with multiple transiting planets has illuminated the orbital architectures of exoplanetary systems. These architectures may be shaped mostly by formation conditions, be continually sculpted by ongoing dynamical processes, or both. As more studies place planet occurrence within a galactic context, evidence has emerged for variable planet multiplicity over time. In this manuscript, we investigate the use of transit multiplicity as a tool to constrain longer-timescale (>1 Gyr) dynamical sculpting. First, with a suite of injection-and-recovery tests, we quantify sensitivity to sculpting laws across different regimes. We employ a forward modeling framework in which we generate synthetic planetary systems, according to a prescribed sculpting speed and timescale, around the FGK dwarfs studied by the Kepler Mission. Some sculpting scenarios are hypothetically detectable in the Kepler sample, while others can be disfavored from Kepler transit statistics alone. Secondly, we apply our analysis to reverse-engineer the sculpting laws consistent with the true yield from Kepler. We confirm the present-day fraction of host stars containing dynamically cool "systems with tightly-packed inner planets" (STIPs) is 4-13%. A variety of Gyr-timescale sculpting laws successfully predict the transit multiplicity of the Kepler sample, but none of these laws succeeds in also producing a detectable trend with transit multiplicity and stellar age. An improvement to measured stellar age precision may help uncover such a sculpting law, but nevertheless reflects limitations in transit multiplicity as an observable. Therefore other phenomena, apart from Gyr-timescale dynamical sculpting, may be required to explain the Kepler yield.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars are members of binary systems, a fraction of which is expected to remain bound after the first star goes off as a supernova. When the second star also explodes, the SN ejecta are bound to interact with the compact object companion. We explore the consequences of this interaction in the case of a black hole (BH) companion. We show that accretion of the SN ejecta by the BH generally occurs with highly super-Eddington rates, which can be strongly modulated if the ejecta are clumpy, as typically observed in supernova remnants. This late accretion produces transient flaring activity with a time delay from the SN explosion of days to months, depending on the orbital separation and the velocity of the ejecta. The flares are expected to have a non-thermal, broad band spectrum, but their high-frequency emission (UV and X-rays) would be absorbed within the remnant. Observed flares should therefore be in the optical and near-infrared. We propose this model as an explanation to the late-time flaring activity observed in the fast blue optical transient AT2022tsd.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging exoplanetary systems is essential to characterizing exoplanetary systems and to studying planet-disk interactions to understand planet formation. Such imaging in the visible and near-infrared is challenging because these objects are very faint relative to their star and only fractions of an arcsecond away. Coronagraphic instruments have already allowed the imaging of a few exoplanets, but their performance is limited by wavefront aberrations. Adaptive optics systems partly compensate for the Earth's atmosphere turbulence, but they cannot fully control the wavefront. Some of the starlight leaks through the coronagraph and forms speckles in the image. Focal plane wavefront control, used as a second stage after the adaptive optics system, can minimize the speckle intensity within an area called the dark hole. We demonstrated the on-sky performance of dark hole techniques, pairwise probing coupled with electric field conjugation, using the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph of the VLT/SPHERE instrument. In this paper, we probe their performance using the SPHERE four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph. We demonstrate the interest of combining dark hole techniques and reference differential imaging (RDI). We create a dark hole on-sky in the narrow band around~$1.7\,\mu$m observing HR\,4796. We then record broadband images of HR\,4796 and a reference star at the H band. The dark hole techniques improve the H-band detection limit by a factor of three. The dark hole is stable from one star to a nearby star enabling RDI. This stability offers two new strategies of observation. First, one can quickly create a dark hole observing a bright star before pointing to a faint target star. Furthermore, one can couple dark hole techniques and RDI. A very interesting point is that the performance of these methods does not depend on the astrophysical signal.
#### A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million  Main-Sequence FGK Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G < 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.
#### Presupernova evolution and explosive nucleosynthesis of rotating massive  stars II: the Super Solar models at [Fe/H]=0.3

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extension of the set of models published in Limongi & Chieffi, 2018, ApJS, 237, 13, at metallicity two times solar, i.e. [Fe/H]=0.3. The key physical properties of these models at the onset of the core collapse are mainly due to the higher mass loss triggered by the higher metallicity: the super solar metallicity (SSM) models reach the core collapse with smaller He- and CO-core masses, while the amount of 12C left by the central He burning is higher. These results are valid for all the rotation velocities. The yields of the neutron capture nuclei expressed per unit mass of Oxygen (i.e. the X/O) are higher in the SSM models than in the SM ones in the non rotating case while the opposite occurs in the rotating models. The trend shown by the non rotating models is the expected one, given the secondary nature of the n-capture nucleosynthesis. Vice versa, the counter intuitive trend obtained in the rotating models is the consequence of the higher mass loss present in the SSM models that removes the H rich envelope faster than in the SM ones while the stars are still in central He burning, dumping out the entanglement (activated by the rotation instabilities) and therefore a conspicuous primary n-capture nucleosynthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we have performed a comparative study of different types of oscillating dark energy models using the Metropolis algorithm of MCMC. Eight different oscillating parameterization being examined herein which have demonstrated considerable ability to fit the overall cosmological observations including Pantheon sample of SnIa, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Chronometer Hubble data and distance priors of Planck CMB. In order to compare the consistency of these models with observations, we have used both Akaike and Deviation information criteria. Although, the values of Akaike information criteria for different models indicate that there is no support for oscillating DE models, Deviation information criteria showed that there is significant support for some of these models. Our results showed that these models are capable of solving cosmic coincidence problem and alleviating the Hubble tension. Comparing the $H_0$ values obtained for different oscillating scenarios, with that of $\Lambda$CDM, we observe that our oscillating models led to $\bar{H_0}=69.78$ which is $0.29$ greater than $H_{0,\Lambda}$ and thus reduce the Hubble tension. Among all of models, Model(1) with $H_0=70.00 \pm 0.71$ is the most capable of alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we examined our models assuming $H_0=73.0 \pm 1.4$ from SHoES measurements. We find that adding this data point to our data combination, led to a $\Delta \bar{H_0}=0.95$ increase in $H_0$ value for different models.
#### Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of HI Absorbing Clouds in the Solar  Neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical distribution of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds is a constraint on models of the structure, dynamics, and hydrostatic balance of the interstellar medium. In 1978, Crovisier pioneered a method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using data from the Nan\c{c}ay 21-cm absorption survey, they determine the mean vertical displacement of cold HI clouds, $\langle|z|\rangle$. We revisit Crovisier's analysis and explore the consequences of truncating the HI absorption sample in Galactic latitude. For any non-zero latitude limit, we find that the quantity inferred by Crovisier is not the mean vertical displacement but rather a ratio involving higher moments of the vertical distribution. The resultant distribution scale heights are thus ${\sim}1.5$ to ${\sim}3$ times smaller than previously determined. In light of this discovery, we develop a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds. We fit our model to the original Nan\c{c}ay data and find a vertical distribution moment ratio $\langle|z|^3\rangle/\langle|z|^2\rangle = 97 \pm 15\,\text{pc}$, which corresponds to a Gaussian scale height $\sigma_z = 61 \pm 9\,\text{pc}$, an exponential scale height $\lambda_z = 32 \pm 5\,\text{pc}$, and a rectangular half-width $W_{z, 1/2} = 129 \pm 20\,\text{pc}$. Consistent with recent simulations, the vertical scale height of cold HI clouds appears to remain constant between the inner-Galaxy and the Galactocentric distance of the solar neighborhood. Local fluctuations might explain the large scale height observed at the same Galactocentric distance on the far side of the Galaxy.
#### The Sun's differential rotation is controlled by high-latitude  baroclinically unstable inertial modes

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly rotating fluids have a rotation profile which depends only on the distance from the rotation axis, in accordance with the Taylor-Proudman theorem. Although the Sun was expected to be such a body, helioseismology showed that the rotation rate in the convection zone is closer to constant on radii. It has been postulated that this deviation is due to the poles being warmer than the equator by a few degrees. Using numerical simulations, we show that the pole-to-equator temperature difference cannot exceed 7 Kelvin as a result of the back-reaction of the high-latitude baroclinically unstable inertial modes. The observed amplitudes of the modes further indicate that this maximum temperature difference is reached in the Sun. We conclude that the Sun's latitudinal differential rotation reaches its maximum allowed value.
#### JWST Spectroscopy of SN H0pe: Classification and Time Delays of a  Triply-imaged Type Ia Supernova at z = 1.78

 - **Abstract**
 SN H0pe is a triply imaged supernova (SN) at redshift $z=1.78$ discovered using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In order to classify the SN spectroscopically and measure the relative time delays of its three images (designated A, B, and C), we acquired NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy spanning 0.6 to 5 microns. From the high signal-to-noise spectra of the two bright images B and C, we first classify the SN, whose spectra most closely match those of SN 1994D and SN 2013dy, as a Type Ia SN. We identify prominent blueshifted absorption features corresponding to Si II $\lambda6355$ and Ca II H $\lambda3970$ and K $\lambda3935$. We next measure the absolute phases of the three images from our spectra, which allows us to constrain their relative time delays. The absolute phases of the three images, determined by fitting the three spectra to Hsiao07 SN templates, are $6.5_{-1.8}^{+2.4}$d, $24.3_{-3.9}^{+3.9}$d, and $50.6_{-15.3}^{+16.1}$d for the brightest to faintest images. These correspond to relative time delays between Image A and Image B and between Image B and Image C of $-122.3_{-43.8}^{+43.7}$d and $49.3_{-14.7}^{+12.2}$d, respectively. The SALT3-NIR model yields phases and time delays consistent with these values. After unblinding, we additionally explored the effect of using Hsiao07 template spectra for simulations through eighty instead of sixty days past maximum, and found a small (11.5 and 1.0 days, respectively) yet statistically insignificant ($\sim$0.25$\sigma$ and $\sim$0.1$\sigma$) effect on the inferred image delays.

 - **Abstract**
 Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.

 - **Abstract**
 The age of the Universe at a given redshift is a fundamental relationship in cosmology. For many years, the uncertainties in it were dauntingly large, close to a factor of 2. In this age of precision cosmology, they are now at the percent level and dominated solely by the Hubble constant. The uncertainties due to the parameters that describe the cosmological model are must less important. In decreasing order they are: uncertainty due to the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$, at most 0.9%; uncertainty due to the matter density $\Omega_M$, at most 0.5% and uncertainty due to the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, at most 0.07%.

 - **Abstract**
 IGR J18434-0508 is a Galactic Intermediate Polar (IP) type Cataclysmic Variable (CV) previously classified through optical spectroscopy. The source is already known to have a hard Chandra spectrum. In this paper, we have used follow-up XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations to measure the white dwarf (WD) mass and spin period. We measure a spin period of P = 304.4 +/- 0.3 s based on the combined MOS1, MOS2, and pn light curve. Although this is twice the optical period found previously, we interpret this value to be the true spin period of the WD. The source has an 8 +/- 2% pulsed fraction in the 0.5-10 keV XMM-Newton data and shows strong dips in the soft energy band (0.5-2 keV). The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR joint spectrum is consistent with a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum model with an additional partial covering factor, reflection, and Fe line Gaussian components. Furthermore, we fit the joint spectrum with the post-shock region "ipolar" model which indicates a high WD mass $>$ $\sim$ 1.36 Msun, approaching the Chandrasekhar limit.

 - **Abstract**
 The correlations between T, E modes and B modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which are expected to vanish under parity symmetry, have become a sensitive probe of the new physics beyond the standard model. In this paper, we forecast the estimation of TB and EB cross power spectra using NILC and cILC on AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that, NILC performs better than cILC on TB and EB correlations in light of its lower uncertainties. In terms of the birefringence angle estimation without assuming systematic errors, the combination of CMB TB and EB spectrum from NILC cleaned simulations could reach a sensitivity of $-0.049^\circ<\beta<0.056^\circ$ (95% CL).

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we have conducted an investigation focused on a segment of the $Spitzer$ mid-infrared bubble N59, specifically referred to as R1 within our study. Situated in the inner Galactic plane, this region stands out for its hosting of five 6.7 GHz methanol masers, as well as numerous compact H II regions, massive clumps, filaments, and prominent bright rims. As 6.7 GHz masers are closely linked to the initial phases of high-mass star formation, exploring regions that exhibit a high abundance of these maser detections provides an opportunity to investigate relatively young massive star-forming sites. To characterize the R1 region comprehensively, we utilize multi-wavelength (archival) data from optical to radio wavelengths, together with $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O data. Utilizing the $Gaia$ DR3 data, we estimate the distance towards the bubble to be $4.66 \pm 0.70$ kpc. By combining near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data, we identify 12 Class I and 8 Class II sources within R1. Furthermore, spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of selected sources reveals the presence of four embedded high-mass sources with masses ranging from 8.70-14.20 M$_\odot$. We also identified several O and B-type stars from radio continuum analysis. Our molecular study uncovers two distinct molecular clouds in the region, which, although spatially close, occupy different regions in velocity space. We also find indications of a potential hub-filament system fostering star formation within the confines of R1. Finally, we propose that the feedback from the H II regions has led to the formation of prominent Bright Rimmed Clouds (BRC) within our region of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in identifying giant molecular filaments in galactic surveys allow us to study the interstellar material and its dense, potentially star forming phase on scales comparable to resolved extragalactic clouds. Two large filaments detected in the CHIMPS $^{13}$CO(3-2) survey, one in the Sagittarius-arm and one in an inter-arm region, were mapped with dense gas tracers inside a 0.06 deg$^2$ area and with a spatial resolution of around 0.4 and 0.65 pc at the distance of the targets using the IRAM 30m telescope, to investigate the environmental dependence of the dense gas fraction. The N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) transition, an excellent tracer of the dense gas, was detected in parsec-scale, elliptical clumps and with a filling factor of around 8.5% in our maps. The N$_2$H$^+$-emitting areas appear to have higher dense gas fraction (e.g. the ratio of N$_2$H$^+$ and $^{13}$CO emission) in the inter-arm than in the arm which is opposite to the behaviour found by previous studies, using dust emission rather than N$_2$H$^+$ as a tracer of dense gas. However, the arm filament is brighter in $^{13}$CO and the infrared emission of dust, and the dense gas fraction determined as above is governed by the $^{13}$CO brightness. We caution that measurements regarding the distribution and fraction of dense gas on these scales may be influenced by many scale- and environment-dependent factors, as well as the chemistry and excitation of the particular tracers, then consider several scenarios that can reproduce the observed effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly growing datasets from stellar spectroscopic surveys are providing unprecedented opportunities to analyse the chemical evolution history of our Galaxy. However, spectral analysis requires accurate modelling of synthetic stellar spectra for late-type stars, for which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) has been shown to be insufficient in many cases. Errors associated with LTE can be particularly large for Ti I, which is susceptible to over-ionisation, particularly in metal-poor stars. The aims of this work are to study and quantify the 1D non-LTE effects on titanium abundances across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for a large sample of stars. A large grid of departure coefficients, $\beta_\nu$, were computed on standard MARCS model atmospheres. The grid extends from 3000K to 8000K in T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$, -0.5 to +5.5 dex in log(g), and -5.0 to +1.0 in [Fe/H], with non-LTE effects in this grid reaching up to 0.4 dex. This was used to compute abundance corrections that were subsequently applied to the LTE abundances of over 70,000 stars selected from the GALAH survey and additional metal-poor dwarfs. The non-LTE effects grow towards lower [Fe/H], lower log(g), and higher T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$, with a minimum and maximum $\Delta$A(Ti I) of 0.02 and 0.19 in the GALAH sample. For metal-poor giants, the non-LTE modelling reduces the average ionisation imbalance from -0.11 dex to -0.01 dex at [Fe/H] = -1.7, and the enhancement in titanium abundances from Ti I lines results in a [Ti/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend that more closely resembles the behaviour of Ti II at low metallicities. Non-LTE effects on titanium abundances are significant. Neglecting them may alter our understanding of Galactic chemical evolution. We have made our grid of departure coefficients publicly available, with the caveat that the Ti abundances of metal-poor dwarfs need further study in 3D non-LTE.

 - **Abstract**
 Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foils have been demonstrated as a wavelength shifter suitable for operation in liquid argon. At the same time, wavelength shifting efficiency of technical grades of PEN, commercially available on the market, is lower than that of tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). This paper reports on an R&D program focused on exploring the intrinsic limitations of PEN and optimizing it for the highest achievable wavelength shifting efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of gamma-ray emission by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) towards the young massive star cluster RCW 38 in the 1-500 GeV photon energy range. We found spatially extended GeV emission towards the direction of RCW 38, which is best modelled by a Gaussian disc of 0.23$\deg$ radius with a significance of the extension is $\sim 11.4 \sigma$. Furthermore, the spatial correlation with the ionized and molecular gas content favors the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission. The gamma-ray spectrum of RCW 38 has a relatively hard photon index of $2.44 \pm 0.03$, which is similar to other young massive star clusters. We argue that the diffuse GeV gamma-ray emission in this region likely originates from the interaction of accelerated protons in the stellar cluster with the ambient gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and impact of outflows on proto-planetary disks and planet formation are key open questions. DG Tau B, a Class I protostar with a structured disk and a striking rotating conical CO outflow, recently identified with ALMA as one of the best MHD disk wind candidate, is an ideal target for studying these phenomena. Our aim is to analyse the outflow components intermediate between the fast axial jet and the wider molecular CO outflow to discriminate between the different scenarios at their origin (irradiated/shocked disk wind or swept-up material). Using observations from JWST NIRSpec-IFU, NIRCam and SINFONI/VLT, we investigate the morphology, kinematics and excitation conditions of H$_2$ emission lines of the red-shifted outflow lobe. We find an onion-like structure of the outflows with increasing temperature, velocity and collimation towards the flow axis. The red-shifted H$_2$ emission reveals a narrow conical cavity nested inside the CO outflow and originating from the inner disk regions (< 6 au). The H$_2$ shell exhibits a constant vertical velocity ($\simeq$22 km/s), twice faster that of the CO flow and an average mass flux of $\dot{M}$(H$_2$) = 3e-11 M$_\odot$/yr significantly lower than the jet and CO values, suggesting low H$_2$ abundance. The global layered structure of the H$_2$/CO outflows is consistent with an MHD disk wind scenario, with the hot H$_2$ possibly tracing an inner dense photodissociation layer of the wind coming from a launching radius in the disk of 0.2-0.4 au. Further analysis, including MIRI observations will provide additional insights into the H$_2$ excitation mechanisms and the origin of the layered outflows observed in DG Tau B.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the abundances of C- and O-bearing species in exoplanet atmospheres enables us to constrain the C/O ratio, that contains indications about the planet formation history. With a wavelength coverage going from 0.95 to 2.5 microns, the high-resolution (R$\sim$70 000) spectropolarimeter SPIRou can detect spectral lines of major bearers of C and O in exoplanets. Here we present our study of SPIRou transmission spectra of WASP-76 b acquired for the ATMOSPHERIX program. We applied the publicly available data analysis pipeline developed within the ATMOSPHERIX consortium, analysing the data using 1-D models created with the petitRADTRANS code, with and without a grey cloud deck. We report the detection of H$_2$O and CO at a Doppler shift of around -6 km.s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous observations of the planet. Finding a deep cloud deck to be favoured, we measured in mass mixing ratio (MMR) log(H$_2$O)$_{MMR}$ = -4.52 $\pm$ 0.77 and log(CO)$_{MMR}$ = -3.09 $\pm$ 1.05 consistent with a sub-solar metallicity to more than 1$\sigma$. We report 3$\sigma$ upper limits for the abundances of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and OH. We estimated a C/O ratio of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.39 ($\sim$ 1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 x solar, with errors indicated corresponding to the 2$\sigma$ values) for the limbs of WASP-76 b at the pressures probed by SPIRou. We used 1-D ATMO forward models to verify the validity of our estimation. Comparing them to our abundance estimations of H$_2$O and CO, as well as our upper limits for C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and OH, we found that our results were consistent with a C/O ratio between 1 and 2 x solar, and hence with our C/O estimation. Finally, we found indications of asymmetry for both H$_2$O and CO when investigating the dynamics of their signatures, pointing to a complex scenario involving possibly both a temperature difference between limbs and clouds being behind the asymmetry this planet is best known for.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) orbiting pulsating A/F stars represent an important subset of the exoplanetary demographic, as they are excellent candidates for the study of exoplanetary atmospheres, as well as being astrophysical laboratories for the investigation of planet-to-star interactions. We analyse the \texttt{TESS} (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curve of the WASP-167 system, consisting of an F1V star and a substellar companion on a $\sim 2.02$ day orbit. We model the combination of the ellipsoidal variability and the Doppler beaming to measure the mass of WASP-167b, and the reflection effect to obtain constraints on the geometric albedo, while placing a special emphasis on noise separation. We implement a basic model to determine the dayside ($T_{\rm Day}$), nightside ($T_{\rm Night}$) and intrinsic ($T_{\rm Internal}$) temperatures of WASP-167b and put a constraint on its Bond albedo. We confirm the transit parameters of the planet seen in the literature. We find that a resonant $\sim 2P^{-1}$ stellar signal (which may originate from planet-to-star interactions) interferes with the phase curve analysis. After considerate treatment of this signal, we find $M_p = 0.34 \pm 0.22$~$M_J$. We measure a dayside temperature of $2790 \pm 100$ K, classifying WASP-167b as an UHJ. We find a $2\sigma$ upper limit of $0.51$ on its Bond albedo, and determine the geometric albedo at $0.34 \pm 0.11$ ($1 \sigma$ uncertainty). With an occultation depth of $106.8 \pm 27.3$ ppm in the \texttt{TESS} passband, the UHJ WASP-167b will be an excellent target for atmospheric studies, especially those at thermal wavelength ranges, where the stellar pulsations are expected to be be less influential.

 The paper demonstrates the spectroscopic and photometric capabilities of the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to study T-Tauri stars (TTSs). We present the first UVIT/Far-UV spectrum of a TTS, TW Hya. Based on C IV line luminosity, we estimated accretion luminosity (0.1 $L_\odot$) and mass accretion rate (2.2 $\times$ $10^{-8} M_\odot /yr$) of TW Hya, and compared these values with the accretion luminosity (0.03 $L_\odot$) and mass accretion rate (0.6 $\times$ $10^{-8} M_\odot /yr$) derived from spectral energy distribution (SED). From the SED, we derive best-fitted parameters for TW Hya: $T_{eff}$ = 3900$\pm$50 K, radius = 1.2$\pm$0.03 $R_\odot$, $\mathrm{log}\, g = 4.0$ and equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to accretion luminosity as 14100$\pm$25 K. The parameters of TW Hya derived from UVIT observations were found to be matched well with the literature. Comparison with IUE spectra also suggests that UVIT can be used to study the spectroscopic variability of young stars. This study proposes leveraging the FUV spectroscopic capabilities of UVIT to contribute to the advancement of upcoming UV spectroscopic missions, including the Indian Spectroscopic Imaging Space Telescope (INSIST).

 - **Abstract**
 We have adapted the Planck cluster likelihood in such a way that it can be applied to the sample of clusters detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Applying it to the 2016 sample from Planck and the 2018 sample from ACT we find, by fixing the cosmology using CMB observations and the cluster model adopted by Planck, that the mass bias required by the two are $1-b_{\rm Planck}=0.61\pm 0.03$ and $1-b_{\rm ACT}=0.75\pm 0.06$. These are broadly in agreement but hint that the model could be adapted to reach a better agreement. By normalizing the cluster model using weak lensing observations, we find evidence for either evolution in the cluster model, quantified by the cluster modeling parameter describing redshift dependence $\beta=0.86 \pm 0.07$ using an updated CCCP-based normalization, or evolution in the cosmological model quantified by the dark energy equation of state parameter $w=-0.82 \pm 0.07$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GW) are expected to interact with dark energy and dark matter, affecting their propagation on cosmological scales. In order to model this interaction, we derive a gauge invariant effective equation and action valid for all GWs polarizations, based on encoding the effects of the interaction of GWs at different order in perturbations, in a polarization, frequency and time dependent effective speed. The invariance of perturbations under time dependent conformal transformations and the gauge invariance of the GWs allow to obtain the unitary gauge effective action in any conformally related frame, making transparent the relation between Einstein and Jordan frame. The propagation time and luminosity distance of different GWs polarizations allow to probe at different frequencies and redshift the dark Universe, which act as an effective medium, whose physical properties can be modeled by the GWs effective speed.
#### A search for super-imposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum  in Planck and SPT-3G 2018 data

 - **Abstract**
 We search for super-imposed oscillations linearly or logarithmically spaced in Fourier wavenumbers in Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) 2018 temperature and polarization data. The SPT-3G temperature and polarization data provide a new window to test these oscillations at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. We consider both models with a constant and a Gaussian modulated amplitude, which correspond to three and four additional parameters beyond power-law primordial power spectrum for the templates considered, respectively. We find that each of the four models considered can provide an improved fit to Planck data, consistently with previous findings, and to SPT-3G data, always compared to $\Lambda$CDM. For a constant amplitude of the superimposed oscillations, we find tighter constraints on the amplitude of the oscillations from the combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. When the ranges of parameters which provide a better fit to Planck and SPT-3G data overlap, as in the case of Gaussian modulated oscillations, we find a larger $\Delta \chi^2$ - $- 17 \, (-16)$ for logarithmic (linear) oscillations - in a combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. These findings will be further tested with upcoming CMB temperature and polarization measurements at high multipoles provided by ongoing ground experiments.
