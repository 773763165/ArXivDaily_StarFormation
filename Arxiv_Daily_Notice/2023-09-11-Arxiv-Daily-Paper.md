 - **Abstract**
 We present the low-frequency radio spectra of 9 high-redshift quasars at $5.6 \leq z \leq 6.6$ using the Giant Metre Radio Telescope band-3, -4, and -5 observations ($\sim$300-1200 MHz), archival Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; 144 MHz), and Very Large Array (VLA; 1.4 and 3 GHz) data. Five of the quasars in our sample have been discovered recently, representing some of the highest redshift radio bright quasars known at low-frequencies. We model their radio spectra to study their radio emission mechanism and age of the radio jets by constraining the spectral turnover caused by synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) or free-free absorption (FFA). Besides J0309+2717, a blazar at $z=6.1$, our quasars show no sign of a spectral flattening between 144 MHz and a few GHz, indicating there is no strong SSA or FFA absorption in the observed frequency range. However, we find a wide range of spectral indices between $-1.6$ and $0.05$, including the discovery of 3 potential ultra-steep spectrum quasars. Using further archival VLBA data, we confirm that the radio SED of the blazar J0309+2717 likely turns over at a rest-frame frequency of 0.6-2.3 GHz (90-330 MHz observed frame), with a high-frequency break indicative of radiative ageing of the electron population in the radio lobes. Ultra-low frequency data below 50 MHz are necessary to constrain the absorption mechanism for J0309+2717 and the turnover frequencies for the other high-$z$ quasars in our sample. A relation between linear radio jet size and turnover frequency has been established at low redshifts. If this relation were to hold at high redshifts, the limits on the turnover frequency of our sample suggest the radio jet sizes must be more extended than the typical sizes observed in other radio-bright quasars at similar redshift. To confirm this deep radio follow-up observations with high spatial resolution are required.

 - **Abstract**
 A cosmological scenario in which the onset of neutrino free-streaming in the early universe is delayed until close to the epoch of matter-radiation equality has been shown to provide a good fit to some cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, while being somewhat disfavored by Planck CMB polarization data. To clarify this situation, we investigate in this paper CMB-independent constraints on this scenario from the Full Shape of the galaxy power spectrum. Although this scenario predicts significant changes to the linear matter power spectrum, we find that it can provide a good fit to the the galaxy power spectrum data. Interestingly, we show that the data display a modest preference for a delayed onset of neutrino free-streaming over the standard model of cosmology, which is driven by the galaxy power spectrum data on mildly non-linear scales. This conclusion is supported by both profile likelihood and Bayesian exploration analyses, showing robustness of the results. Compared to the standard cosmological paradigm, this scenario predicts a significant suppression of structure on subgalactic scales. While our analysis relies on the simplest cosmological representation of neutrino self-interactions, we argue that this persistent - and somehow consistent - picture in which neutrino free-streaming is delayed motivates the exploration of particle models capable of reconciling all CMB, large-scale structure, and laboratory data.
#### 21cmFirstCLASS I. Cosmological tool for $Λ$CDM and beyond

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present 21cmFirstCLASS, a modified version of 21cmFAST, the most popular code in the literature for computing the anisotropies of the 21-cm signal. Our code uses the public cosmic microwave background (CMB) Boltzmann code CLASS, to establish consistent initial conditions at recombination for any set of cosmological parameters and evolves them throughout the dark ages, cosmic dawn, the epoch of heating and reionization. We account for inhomogeneity in the temperature and ionization fields throughout the evolution, crucial for a robust calculation of both the global 21-cm signal and its fluctuations. We demonstrate how future measurements of the CMB and the 21-cm signal can be combined and analyzed with 21cmFirstCLASS to obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters and examine degeneracies between them. As an example application, we show how 21cmFirstCLASS can be used to study non-linear cosmological models, such as scattering dark matter (SDM). For the first time, we present self-consistent calculations of the 21-cm power spectrum in the presence of SDM during the non-linear epoch of cosmic dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new cosmological parameter constraints from the eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey. We use a new theoretical model and likelihood based on the PRIYA simulation suite. PRIYA is the first suite to resolve the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in a ($120$ Mpc/h)$^3$ volume, using a multi-fidelity emulation technique. We use PRIYA to predict Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables with $\lesssim 1\%$ interpolation error over an $11$ dimensional ($9$ simulated, $2$ in post-processing) parameter space. We identify an internal tension within the flux power spectrum data. Once the discrepant data is removed, we find the scalar spectral index at $k = 0.78$ h/Mpc to be $n_P = 0.97 - 0.995$ at $68\%$ confidence from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum alone, in good agreement with Planck. The amplitude of matter fluctuations is $\sigma_8 = 0.733 \pm 0.026$ at $68\%$ confidence, in agreement with Dark Energy Survey weak lensing measurements and other small-scale structure probes and in tension with CMB measurements from Planck and ACT. The effective optical depth to Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from our pipeline is in good agreement with earlier measurements. We add measurements of the mean temperature of the intergalactic gas from $z=3.8 - 2.2$ and use them to constrain the duration and heating rate of helium reionization, finding a preference for an early, hot, helium reionization event, as suggested by measurements from the helium Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Adding the mean IGM temperature data also increases the significance of the $\sigma_8$ tension. In the near future we will use our pipeline to infer cosmological parameters from the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ data.
#### Gaia22dkvLb: A Microlensing Planet Potentially Accessible to  Radial-Velocity Characterization

 - **Abstract**
 We report discovering an exoplanet from following up a microlensing event alerted by Gaia. The event Gaia22dkv is toward a nearby disk source at ~2.5 kpc rather than the traditional bulge microlensing fields. Our primary analysis yields a Jovian planet with M_p = 0.50 +/- 0.05 M_J at a projected orbital separation r_perp = 1.63 +/- 0.17 AU. The host is a turnoff star with mass 1.24 +/- 0.06 M_sun and distance of 1.35 +/- 0.09 kpc, and at r'~14, it is far brighter than any previously discovered microlensing planet host, opening up the opportunity of testing the microlensing model with radial velocity (RV) observations. RV data can be used to measure the planet's orbital period and eccentricity, and they also enable searching for inner planets of the microlensing cold Jupiter, as expected from the "inner-outer correlation" inferred from Kepler and RV discoveries. Furthermore, we show that Gaia astrometric microlensing will not only allow precise measurements of its angular Einstein radius theta_E, but also directly measure the microlens parallax vector and unambiguously break a geometric light-curve degeneracy, leading to definitive characterization of the lens system.
#### 21cmFirstCLASS II. Early linear fluctuations of the 21cm signal

 - **Abstract**
 In a companion paper we introduce 21cmFirstCLASS, a new code for computing the 21-cm anisotropies, assembled from the merger of the two popular codes 21cmFAST and CLASS. Unlike the standard 21cmFAST, which begins at $z=35$ with homogeneous temperature and ionization boxes, our code begins its calculations from recombination, evolves the signal through the dark ages, and naturally yields an inhomogeneous box at $z=35$. In this paper, we validate the output of 21cmFirstCLASS by developing a new theoretical framework which is simple and intuitive on the one hand, but is robust and precise on the other hand. As has been recently claimed, using consistent inhomogeneous initial conditions mitigates inaccuracies, which according to our analysis can otherwise reach the $\mathcal O\left(20\%\right)$ level. On top of that, we also show for the first time that 21cmFAST over-predicts the 21-cm power spectrum at $z\gtrsim20$ by another $\mathcal O\left(20\%\right)$, due to the underlying assumption that $\delta_b=\delta_c$, namely that the density fluctuations in baryons and cold dark matter are indistinguishable. We propose an elegant solution to this discrepancy by introducing an appropriate scale-dependent growth factor into the evolution equations. Our analysis shows that this modification will ensure sub-percent differences between 21cmFirstCLASS and the Boltzmann solver CAMB at $z\leq50$ for all scales between the horizon and the Jeans scale. This will enable 21cmFirstCLASS to consistently and reliably simulate the 21-cm anisotropies both in the dark ages and cosmic dawn, for any cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets are considered a potential source of inner solar system volatiles, but the timing of this delivery relative to that of Earth's accretion is still poorly understood. Measurements of xenon isotopes in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko revealed that comets partly contributed to the Earth's atmosphere. However, there is no conclusive evidence of a significant cometary component in the Earth's mantle. These geochemical constraints would favour a contribution of comets mainly occurring after the last stages of Earth's formation. Here, we evaluate whether dynamical simulations satisfy these constraints in the context of an Early Instability model. We perform dynamical simulations of the solar system, calculate the probability of collision between comets and Earth analogs component embryos through time and estimate the total cometary mass accreted in Earth analogs as a function of time. While our results are in excellent agreement with geochemical constraints, we also demonstrate that the contribution of comets on Earth might have been delayed with respect to the timing of the instability, due to a stochastic component of the bombardment. More importantly, we show that it is possible that enough cometary mass has been brought to Earth after it had finished forming so that the xenon constraint is not necessarily in conflict with an Early Instability scenario. However, it appears very likely that a few comets were delivered to Earth early in its accretion history, thus contributing to the mantle's budget. Finally, we compare the delivery of cometary material on Earth to Venus and Mars. These results emphasize the stochastic nature of the cometary bombardment in the inner solar system.
#### Cold Solar Flares I. Microwave Domain

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a set of ~100 "cold" solar flares and perform a statistical analysis of them in the microwave range. Cold flares are characterized by a weak thermal response relative to nonthermal emission. This work is a follow up of a previous statistical study of cold flares, which focused on hard X-ray emission to quantify the flare nonthermal component. Here we focus on the microwave emission. The thermal response is represented by the soft X-ray emission measured by the GOES X-ray sensors. We obtain spectral parameters of the flare gyrosynchrotron emission and investigate patterns of the temporal evolution. The main results of the previous statistical study are confirmed: as compared to a "mean" flare, the cold flares have shorter durations, higher spectral peak frequencies, and harder spectral indices above the spectral peak. Nonetheless, there are some cold flares with moderate and low peak frequencies. In a majority of cold flares, we find evidence suggesting the presence of the Razin effect in the microwave spectra, indicative of rather dense flaring loops. We discuss the results in the context of electron acceleration efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the methods and results from the discovery and photometric measurement of 26 bright (VR $>$ 24 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) during the first year (2019-20) of the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP). The DEEP survey is an observational TNO survey with wide sky coverage, high sensitivity, and a fast photometric cadence. We apply a computer vision technique known as a progressive probabilistic Hough transform to identify linearly-moving transient sources within DEEP photometric catalogs. After subsequent visual vetting, we provide a photometric and astrometric catalog of our TNOs. By modeling the partial lightcurve amplitude distribution of the DEEP TNOs using Monte Carlo techniques, we find our data to be most consistent with an average TNO axis ratio b/a $<$ 0.5, implying a population dominated by non-spherical objects. Based on ellipsoidal gravitational stability arguments, we find our data to be consistent with a TNO population containing a high fraction of contact binaries or other extremely non-spherical objects. We also discuss our data as evidence that the expected binarity fraction of TNOs may be size-dependent.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundances of major carbon and oxygen bearing gases in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets provide insights into atmospheric chemistry and planet formation processes. Thermochemistry suggests that methane should be the dominant carbon-bearing species below $\sim$1000 K over a range of plausible atmospheric compositions; this is the case for the Solar System planets and has been confirmed in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and self-luminous directly imaged exoplanets. However, methane has not yet been definitively detected with space-based spectroscopy in the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet, but a few detections have been made with ground-based, high-resolution transit spectroscopy including a tentative detection for WASP-80b. Here we report transmission and emission spectra spanning 2.4-4.0 micrometers of the 825 K warm Jupiter WASP-80b taken with JWST's NIRCam instrument, both of which show strong evidence for methane at greater than 6-sigma significance. The derived methane abundances from both viewing geometries are consistent with each other and with solar to sub-solar C/O and ~5$\times$ solar metallicity, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the pyKLIP-CHARIS post-processing pipeline, a Python library that reduces high contrast imaging data for the CHARIS integral field spectrograph used with the SCExAO project on the Subaru Telescope. The pipeline is a part of the pyKLIP package, a Python library dedicated to the reduction of direct imaging data of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and discs. For PSF subtraction, the pyKLIP-CHARIS post-processing pipeline relies on the core algorithms implemented in pyKLIP but uses image registration and calibrations that are unique to CHARIS. We describe the pipeline procedures, calibration results, and capabilities in processing imaging data acquired via the angular differential imaging and spectral differential imaging observing techniques. We showcase its performance on extracting spectra of injected synthetic point sources as well as compare the extracted spectra from real data sets on HD 33632 and HR 8799 to results in the literature. The pipeline is a python-based complement to the SCExAO project supported, widely used (and currently IDL-based) CHARIS data post-processing pipeline (CHARIS DPP) and provides an additional approach to reducing CHARIS data and extracting calibrated planet spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the region surrounding eHWC J1842-035 has been studied extensively by gamma-ray observatories due to its extended emission reaching up to a few hundred TeV and potential as a hadronic accelerator. In this work, we use 1,910 days of cumulative data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory to carry out a dedicated systematic source search of the eHWC J1842-035 region. During the search we have found three sources in the region, namely, HAWC J1844-034, HAWC J1843-032, and HAWC J1846-025. We have identified HAWC J1844-034 as the extended source that emits photons with energies up to 175 TeV. We compute the spectrum for HAWC J1844-034 and by comparing with the observational results from other experiments, we have identified HESS J1843-033, LHAASO J1843-0338, and TASG J1844-038 as very-high-energy gamma-ray sources with a matching origin. Also, we present and use the multi-wavelength data to fit the hadronic and leptonic particle spectra. We have identified four pulsar candidates in the nearby region from which PSR J1844-0346 is found to be the most likely candidate due to its proximity to HAWC J1844-034 and the computed energy budget. We have also found SNR G28.6-0.1 as a potential counterpart source of HAWC J1844-034 for which both leptonic and hadronic scenarios are feasible.

 - **Abstract**
 The total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv, is a key parameter for tracing the properties of interstellar dust, as it directly determines the variation of the extinction curve with wavelength. By utilizing accurate color excess measurements from the optical to the mid-infrared range, we have derived Rv values for approximately 3 million stars from the LAMOST data release 7 (DR7) using a forward modeling technique. This extensive dataset enables us to construct a comprehensive two-dimensional Rv map of the Milky Way within the LAMOST footprint at a spatial resolution of ~27.5arcmin. Based on reliable sightlines of E(B-V) > 0.1, we find that Rv exhibits a Gaussian distribution centered around 3.25 with a standard deviation of 0.25. The spatial variability of Rv in the Galactic disk exhibits a wide range, spanning from small scales within individual molecular clouds to large scales up to kiloparsecs. A striking correlation is observed between the distribution of Rv and molecular clouds. Notably, we observe lower Rv values within the regions of nearby molecular clouds compared to their surrounding areas. Furthermore, we have investigated the relationships between Rv and various parameters, including dust temperature, dust emissivity spectral index, column density of atomic and molecular hydrogen, as well as their ratios and the gas-to-dust ratio. We find that these relationships vary with the level of extinction. These analyses provide new insights into the properties and evolution of dust grains in diverse interstellar environments and also hold significant importance for achieving accurate extinction corrections.
#### A study of the stellar photosphere-hydrogen ionization front interaction  in $δ$ Scuti stars

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsating variable $\delta$ Scuti stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses in the range of $1-3$ $M_{\odot}$ and spectral types between $A2$ and $F2$. They can be found at the intersection of the Cepheid instability strip with the main sequence. They can be used as astrophysical laboratories to test theories of stellar evolution and pulsation. In this contribution, we investigate the observed period-colour and amplitude-colour (PCAC) relations at maximum/mean/minimum light of Galactic bulge and Large Magellanic Cloud $\delta$ Scuti stars for the first time and test the hydrogen ionization front (HIF)-photosphere interaction theory using the MESA- RSP code. The PCAC relations, as a function of pulsation phase, are crucial probes of the structure of the outer stellar envelope and provide insight into the physics of stellar pulsation and evolution. The observed behaviour of the $\delta$ Scuti PCAC relations is consistent with the theory of the interaction between the HIF and the stellar photosphere.
#### Impact of Self-shielding Minihalos on the Ly$α$ Forest at High  Redshift

 - **Abstract**
 Dense gas in minihalos (MHs) with masses of $10^6-10^8~M_\odot$ can shield themselves from reionization for about $100$ megayears after being exposed to UV radiation. These self-shielded systems, often unresolved in cosmological simulations, can introduce strong absorption in quasar spectra. This paper is the first systematic study on the impact of these systems on the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We first derive the HI column density profile of photoevaporating MHs by conducting 1-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We utilize these results to estimate the Ly$\alpha$ opacity from minihalos in a large-scale simulation that cannot resolve the self-shielding process. When the ionization rate of the background radiation is $0.03\times 10^{-12}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, as expected near the end of reionization at $z\sim 5.5$, we find that the incidence rate of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers, $dN/dX$, increases by nearly a factor of 2 - 4 compared to at $z=4.5$. The Ly$\alpha$ flux is, on average, suppressed by $10\%$ of its mean due to absorption by MHs. The extended absorption features contribute to a $\sim 20\%$ enhancement in the 1D power spectrum at $k\sim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ ($10^{-3}~{\rm km}^{-1}~{\rm s}$), which is comparable to the enhancement caused by inhomogeneous reionization. Notably, the flux is particularly suppressed in the vicinity of large halos along the line-of-sight direction at separations of up to $10~h^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}$ at $r_\perp\lesssim 2~h^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}$. However, these effects become much smaller for higher ionizing rates ($0.3$ and $1\times 10^{-12}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) expected in the post-reionization universe $z\lesssim5.5$. Our findings highlight the need to consider the absorption by MHs when interpreting the Ly$\alpha$ forest at $z\gtrsim5.5$. Moreover, the sensitivity of this effect to the ionizing background intensity can be exploited to constrain the intensity itself.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the study of multiphase relations of classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds for short periods (log P < 1) and long periods (log P > 1). From the analysis, it has been found that the multiphase relations obtained using the models as well as observations are highly dynamic with pulsational phase. The multiphase relations for short and long periods are found to display contrasting behaviour for both LMC and SMC. It has been observed that the multiphase relations obtained using the models agree better with the observations in the PC plane in most phases in comparison to the PL plane. Multiphase relations obtained using the models display a clear distinction among different convection sets in most phases. Comparison of models and observations in the multiphase plane is one way to test the models with the observations and to constrain the theory of stellar pulsation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two mini-Neptunes in near 2:1 resonance orbits ($P=7.610303$ d for HIP 113103 b and $P=14.245651$ d for HIP 113103 c) around the adolescent K-star HIP 113103 (TIC 121490076). The planet system was first identified from the TESS mission, and was confirmed via additional photometric and spectroscopic observations, including a $\sim$17.5 hour observation for the transits of both planets using ESA CHEOPS. We place $\leq4.5$ min and $\leq2.5$ min limits on the absence of transit timing variations over the three year photometric baseline, allowing further constraints on the orbital eccentricities of the system beyond that available from the photometric transit duration alone. With a planetary radius of $R_{p}=1.829^{+0.096}_{-0.067}\,R_{\oplus}$, HIP 113103 b resides within the radius gap, and this might provide invaluable information on the formation disparities between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Given the larger radius $R_{p}=2.40^{+0.10}_{-0.08}\,R_{\oplus}$ for HIP 113103 c, and close proximity of both planets to HIP 113103, it is likely that HIP 113103 b might have lost (or is still losing) its primordial atmosphere. We therefore present simulated atmospheric transmission spectra of both planets using JWST, HST, and Twinkle. It demonstrates a potential metallicity difference (due to differences in their evolution) would be a challenge to detect if the atmospheres are in chemical equilibrium. As one of the brightest multi sub-Neptune planet systems suitable for atmosphere follow up, HIP 113103 b and HIP 113103 c could provide insight on planetary evolution for the sub-Neptune K-star population.

 - **Abstract**
 Results of astrometric very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations towards an extreme OH/IR star candidate NSV17351 are presented. We used the VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry) VLBI array to observe 22\,GHz H$_2$O masers of NSV17351. We derived an annual parallax of 0.247$\pm$0.035 mas which corresponds to a distance of 4.05$\pm$0.59 kpc. By averaging the proper motions of 15 maser spots, we obtained the systemic proper motion of NSV17351 to be ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos{\delta}, \mu_{\delta}$)$^{\mathrm{avg}}$ $=$ ($-$1.19 $\pm$ 0.11, 1.30 $\pm$ 0.19) mas\,yr$^{-1}$. The maser spots spread out over a region of 20 mas $\times$ 30 mas, which can be converted to a spatial distribution of $\sim$80 au $\times$ $\sim$120 au at the source distance. Internal motions of the maser spots suggest an outward moving maser region with respect to the estimated position of the central star. From single dish monitoring of the H$_2$O maser emission, we estimate the pulsation period of NSV17351 to be 1122$\pm$24 days. This is the first report of the periodic activity of NSV17351, indicating that NSV17351 could have a mass of $\sim$4\,M$_{\odot}$. We confirmed that the time variation of H$_2$O masers can be used as a period estimator of variable OH/IR stars. Furthermore, by inspecting dozens of double-peaked H$_2$O maser spectra from the last 40 years, we detected a long-term acceleration in the radial velocity of the circumstellar matter to be $0.17\pm0.03$ km\,s$^{-1}$\,yr$^{-1}$ Finally, we determined the position and kinematics of NSV17351 in the Milky Way Galaxy and found that NSV17351 is located in an interarm region between the Outer and Perseus arms. We note that astrometric VLBI observations towards extreme OH/IR stars are useful samples for studies of the Galactic dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the dynamics study toward the G326.611+0.811 (G326) hub-filament-system (HFS) cloud using the new APEX observations of both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1). The G326 HFS cloud constitutes a central hub and at least four hub-composing filaments that are divided into a major branch of filaments (F1, and F2) and a side branch (F3-F5). The cloud holds ongoing high-mass star formation as characterised by three massive dense clumps (i.e., 370-1100 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.14-0.16 g cm$^{-2}$ for C1-C3) with the high clump-averaged mass infalling rates ($>10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) within in the major filament branch, and the associated point sources bright at 70 $\mu$m typical of young protostars. Along the five filaments, the velocity gradients are found in both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1) emission, suggesting that the filament-aligned gravitational collapse toward the central hub (i.e., C2) is being at work for high-mass star formation therein. Moreover, a periodic velocity oscillation along the major filament branch is revealed in both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1) emission with a characteristic wavelength of $\sim$3.5 pc and an amplitude of $\sim$0.31-0.38 km s$^{-1}$. We suggest that this pattern of velocity oscillation in G326 could arise from the clump-forming gas motions induced by gravitational instability. Taking into account the prevalent velocity gradients, the fragmentation of the major branch of filaments, and the ongoing collapse of the three massive dense clumps, it is indicative that G326 is a HFS undergoing global collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Observers submit both new and known meteor shower parameters to the database of the IAU Meteor Data Center (MDC). It may happen that a new observation of an already known meteor shower is submitted as a discovery of a new shower. Then, a duplicate shower appears in the MDC. On the other hand, the observers may provide data which, in their opinion, is another set of parameters of an already existing shower. However, if this is not true, we can talk about a shower that is a false-duplicate of a known meteor shower. We aim to develop a method for objective detection of duplicates among meteor showers and apply it to the MDC. The method will also enable us to verify whether various sets of parameters of the same shower are compatible and, thus, reveal the false-duplicates. We suggest two methods based on cluster analyses and two similarity functions among geocentric and heliocentric shower parameters collected in the MDC. 8 new showers represented by two or more parameter sets were discovered. 31 times there was full agreement between our results and those reported in the MDC. 23 times the same duplicates as given in the MDC, were found only by one method. We found 27 multi-solution showers for which the number of the same duplicates found by both method is close to the corresponding number in the MDC database. However for 60 multi-solution showers listed in the MDC no duplicates were found by any of the applied methods. The obtained results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach of identifying duplicates. We have shown that in order to detect and verify duplicate meteor showers, it is possible to apply the objective proposal instead of the subjective approach used so far.

 - **Abstract**
 The complex classification of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that are captured in mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and the constraint of their multiple origins are two significant open problems concerning the Solar System. The case-by-case study of the different MMRs and their characteristics provide information about their origin and dynamics, which helps us to understand the early stages of the Solar System evolution. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the detected TNOs close to a 3/1 MMR with Neptune. We initially use a semi-analytic three-body model to investigate the coplanar secular dynamics of these objects and find the stationary points. We then use surface sections and stability maps to analyse the non-averaged dynamics. These methods allow us to isolate the different stability regions and determine the extent of the chaotic regions. We show that stability maps are an extremely powerful tool for studying the resonant dynamics when they are computed in terms of the resonant angle. We then use these maps to study the non-planar three-body problem and the full dynamics in the presence of planetary perturbations. We confirm that TNOs near the 3/1 MMR regions can exist at very high inclinations. In the framework of the three-body problem, many of these objects can also be stable outside the 3/1 MMR owing to a Kozai secular resonance. However, when we take into account the perturbations of the four giant planets, the Kozai regions disappear and only the 3/1 MMR region remains, with eccentricities $e \lesssim 0.5$.
#### High-resolution APEX/LAsMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3-2) observation of  the G333 giant molecular cloud complex : II. Survival and gravitational  collapse of dense gas structures under feedback

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical properties of gas structures under feedback in the G333 complex using data of the 13CO (3-2) line in the LAsMA observation. We used the Dendrogram algorithm to identify molecular gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of the 13CO (3-2) emission, and extracted the average spectra of all structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. We derive the column density ratios between different transitions of the 13CO emission pixel-by-pixel, and find the peak values N(2-1)/N(1-0) ~ 0.5, N(3-2)/N(1-0) ~ 0.3, N(3-2)/N(2-1) ~ 0.5. These ratios can also be roughly predicted by RADEX for an average H$_2$ volume density of ~ 4.2 * 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$. A classical virial analysis does not reflect the true physical state of the identified structures, and we find that external pressure from the ambient cloud plays an important role in confining the observed gas structures. For high column density structures, velocity dispersion and density show a clear correlation, while for low column density structures they do not, indicating the contribution of gravitational collapse to the velocity dispersion. For both leaf and branch structures, $\sigma-N*R$ always has a stronger correlation compared to $\sigma-N$ and $\sigma-R$. The scaling relations are stronger, and have steeper slopes when considering only self-gravitating structures, which are the structures most closely associated with the Heyer-relation. Although the feedback disrupting the molecular clouds will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational lens system PS J0147+4630 (Andromeda's Parachute) consists of four quasar images ABCD and a lensing galaxy. We obtained $r$-band light curves of ABCD in the 2017$-$2022 period from monitoring with two 2-m class telescopes. Applying state-of-the-art curve shifting algorithms to these light curves led to measurements of time delays between images, and the three independent delays relative to image D are accurate enough to be used in cosmological studies (uncertainty of about 4%): $\Delta t_{\rm{AD}}$ = $-$170.5 $\pm$ 7.0, $\Delta t_{\rm{BD}}$ = $-$170.4 $\pm$ 6.0, and $\Delta t_{\rm{CD}}$ = $-$177.0 $\pm$ 6.5 d, where image D is trailing all the other images. Our finely sampled light curves and some additional fluxes in the years 2010$-$2013 also demonstrated the presence of significant microlensing variations. From the measured delays relative to image D and typical values of the external convergence, recent lens mass models yielded a Hubble constant that is in clear disagreement with currently accepted values around 70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We discuss how to account for a standard value of the Hubble constant without invoking the presence of an extraordinary high external convergence.

 - **Abstract**
 The transient Galactic black hole candidate MAXI J0637-430 went through an outburst in 2019--20 for the very first time. This outburst was active for almost 6 months from November 2019 to May 2020. We study the spectral properties of this source during that outburst using archival data from NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR satellites/instruments. We have analyzed the source during 6 epochs on which simultaneous NICER--NuSTAR and Swift/XRT--NuSTAR data were available. Using both phenomenological and physical model fitting approaches, we analyzed the spectral data in the broad $0.7-70$ keV energy band. We first used a combination of disk blackbody with power-law, disk blackbody with broken power-law, and disk blackbody with power-law and bmc models. For a better understanding of the accretion picture, e.g., understanding how the accretion rates change with the changing size of the perceived Compton cloud, we used the two-component advective flow (TCAF) model with broken power-law, TCAF with power-law and bmc models. For last 3 epochs, the diskbb+power-law and TCAF models were able to spectrally fit the data for acceptable $\chi^2/DOF$. However, for the first 3 epochs, we needed an additional component to fit spectra for acceptable $\chi^2/DOF$. From our analysis, we reported about the possible presence of another component during these first 3 epochs when the source was in the high soft state. This additional component in this state is best described by the bulk motion Comptonization phenomenon. From the TCAF model fitting, we estimated the average mass of the source as $8.1^{+1.3}_{-2.7}~M_\odot$.
#### A broadband X-ray study of the dwarf nova SS Cyg during quiescence and  outburst

 - **Abstract**
 We present a broadband X-ray study ($\sim$\,0.3-50 keV) of the dwarf nova SS Cyg highlighting the changes in the accretion during two phases, the quiescence and the outburst states. The investigation was based on simultaneous observations carried out with the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR telescopes in two epochs, involving medium and high-resolution spectroscopy. Spectra were harder during quiescence ($kT_{\rm high}\sim22.8$ keV) than outburst ($kT_{\rm high}\sim8.4$ keV), while the mass accretion rate increased by $\sim35$ times in outburst ($1.7\times10^{16} \rm g\;s^{-1}$) than quiescence. The bolometric luminosity (0.01-100.0 keV) during the outburst was dominated by a blackbody emission ($kT_{\rm BB}\sim28$ eV) from the optically thick boundary layer, and the inner edge of the accretion disk resides very close to the WD surface. X-rays from the accretion disk boundary layer are consistent with the white dwarf having mass $1.18_{-0.01}^{+0.02} \rm M_{\odot}$. Our study conclusively confirms the presence of the reflection hump in the 10-30 keV range for both phases, which arises when X-ray photons hit colder material and undergo Compton scattering. We estimated a similarly strong reflection amplitude during quiescence ($\sim1.25$) and outburst ($\sim1.31$), indicating both the WD surface and disk are contributing to reflection. The neutral Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line, which is correlated with Compton reflection, also showed similar strength ($\sim80$ eV) in both phases. Finally, X-rays also revealed the presence of a partial intrinsic absorber during the outburst, possibly due to an outflowing accretion disk wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Tension remains between the observed and modeled properties of substellar objects, but objects in binary orbits, with known dynamical masses can provide a way forward. HD 72946 B is a recently imaged brown dwarf companion to the nearby, solar type star. We achieve $\sim100~\mu\mathrm{as}$ relative astrometry of HD 72946 B in the K-band using VLTI/GRAVITY, unprecedented for a benchmark brown dwarf. We fit an ensemble of measurements of the orbit using orbitize! and derive a strong dynamical mass constraint $\mathrm{M_B}=69.5\pm0.5~\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ assuming a strong prior on the host star mass $\mathrm{M_A}=0.97\pm0.01~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ from an updated stellar analysis. We fit the spectrum of the companion to a grid of self-consistent BT-Settl-CIFIST model atmospheres, and perform atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS. A dynamical mass prior only marginally influences the sampled distribution on effective temperature, but has a large influence on the surface gravity and radius, as expected. The dynamical mass alone does not strongly influence retrieved pressure-temperature or cloud parameters within our current retrieval setup. Independent of cloud prescription and prior assumptions, we find agreement within $\pm2\,\sigma$ between the C/O ratio of the host ($0.52\pm0.05)$ and brown dwarf ($0.43$ to $0.63$), as expected from a molecular cloud collapse formation scenario, but our retrieved metallicities are implausibly high ($0.6-0.8$) in light of an excellent agreement of the data with the solar abundance model grid. Future work on our retrieval framework will seek to resolve this tension. Additional study of low surface-gravity objects is necessary to assess the influence of a dynamical mass prior on atmospheric analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of 21 cm emission at an average redshift $\bar{z} = 2.3$ in the cross-correlation of data from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest from eBOSS. Data collected by CHIME over 88 days in the $400-500$~MHz frequency band ($1.8 < z < 2.5$) are formed into maps of the sky and high-pass delay filtered to suppress the foreground power, corresponding to removing cosmological scales with $k_\parallel \lesssim 0.13\ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at the average redshift. Line-of-sight spectra to the eBOSS background quasar locations are extracted from the CHIME maps and combined with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux transmission spectra to estimate the 21 cm-Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation function. Fitting a simulation-derived template function to this measurement results in a $9\sigma$ detection significance. The coherent accumulation of the signal through cross-correlation is sufficient to enable a detection despite excess variance from foreground residuals $\sim6-10$ times brighter than the expected thermal noise level in the correlation function. These results are the highest-redshift measurement of \tcm emission to date, and set the stage for future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses at $z>1.8$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present evolutionary models of massive, accreting population III stars with constant and variable accretion rates until the end of silicon burning, with final masses of 1000 - 3000 Msol. In all our models, after the core-hydrogen burning phase, the star expands towards the red side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where it spends the rest of its evolution. During core helium burning, the models exhibit an outer convective envelope as well as many large intermediate convective zones. These intermediate zones allow for strong internal mixing to occur which enriches the surface in helium. The effect of increasing metallicity at a constant accretion rate of 1e-3 Msol/yr shows an increase in lifetime, final mass and distribution of helium in the envelope. Our fiducial model with mass of 3000 Msol has a final surface helium abundance of 0.74 with 9% of its total mass or 50% of the core mass below Gamma1 < 4/3 at the end of core silicon burning. If the collapse of the core is accompanied by the ejection of the envelope above the carbon-oxygen core, this could have a significant impact on the chemical evolution of the surroundings and subsequent stellar generations. The model has has a final log(N/O) ~ 0.45, above the lower limit in the recently detected high-redshift galaxy GN-z11. We discuss the impact of a single 3000 Msol on chemical, mechanical and radiative feedback, and present directions for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies based on Bayesian methods have shown that the constraints on cosmological parameters from the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) full-shape data using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) depend on the choice of prior on the EFT nuisance parameters. In this work, we explore this prior dependence by adopting a frequentist approach based on the profile likelihood method, which is inherently independent of priors, considering data from BOSS, eBOSS and Planck. We find that the priors on the EFT parameters in the Bayesian inference are informative and that prior volume effects are important. This is reflected in shifts of the posterior mean compared to the maximum likelihood estimate by up to 1.0 {\sigma} (1.6 {\sigma}) and in a widening of intervals informed from frequentist compared to Bayesian intervals by factors of up to 1.9 (1.6) for BOSS (eBOSS) in the baseline configuration, while the constraints from Planck are unchanged. Our frequentist confidence intervals give no indication of a tension between BOSS/eBOSS and Planck. However, we find that the profile likelihood prefers extreme values of the EFT parameters, highlighting the importance of combining Bayesian and frequentist approaches for a fully nuanced cosmological inference. We show that the improved statistical power of future data will reconcile the constraints from frequentist and Bayesian inference using the EFTofLSS.
