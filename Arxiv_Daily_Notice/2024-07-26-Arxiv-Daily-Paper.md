 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs (BD) are model degenerate in age and mass. High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of BD companions to host stars where the mass and age can be independently constrained by dynamics and stellar age indicators respectively provide valuable tests of BD evolution models. In this paper, we present a new epoch of Subaru/CHARIS H- and K-band observations of one such previously discovered system, HD 33632 Ab. We reanalyze the mass and orbit using our new epoch of extracted relative astrometry, and fit extracted spectra to the newest generation of equilibrium, disequilibrium, and cloudy spectral and evolution models for BDs. No spectral model perfectly agrees with evolutionary tracks and the derived mass and age, instead favoring a somewhat younger BD than the host star's inferred age. This tension can potentially be resolved using atmosphere and evolution models that consider both clouds and disequilibrium chemistry simultaneously, or by additional future spectra at higher resolution or in other band passes. Photometric measurements alone remain consistent with the luminosity predicted by evolutionary tracks. Our work highlights the importance of considering complexities like clouds, disequilibrium chemistry, and composition when comparing spectral models to evolutionary tracks.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our numerical simulation approach for the End-to-End (E2E) model applied to various astronomical spectrographs, such as SOXS (ESO-NTT), CUBES (ESO-VLT), and ANDES (ESO-ELT), covering multiple wavelength regions. The E2E model aim at simulating the expected astronomical observations starting from the radiation of the scientific sources (or calibration sources) up to the raw-frame data produced by the detectors. The comprehensive description includes E2E architecture, computational models, and tools for rendering the simulated frames. Collaboration with Data Reduction Software (DRS) teams is discussed, along with efforts to meet instrument requirements. The contribution to the cross-correlation algorithm for the Active Flexure Compensation (AFC) system of CUBES is detailed.

 - **Abstract**
 While dynamical tides only become relevant during the last couple of orbits for circular inspirals, orbital eccentricity can increase their impact during earlier phases of the inspiral by exciting tidal oscillations at each close encounter. We investigate the effect of dynamical tides on the orbital evolution of eccentric neutron star binaries using post-Newtonian numerical simulations and constructing an analytic stochastic model. Our study reveals a strong dependence of dynamical tides on the pericenter distance, with the energy transferred to dynamical tides over that dissipated in gravitational waves (GWs) exceeding $\sim1\%$ at separations $r_\mathrm{p}\lesssim50$ km for large eccentricities. We demonstrate that the effect of dynamical tides on orbital evolution can manifest as a phase shift in the GW signal. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW phase shift can reach the detectability threshold of 8 with a single aLIGO detector at design densitivity for eccentric neutron star binaries at a distance of $40$ Mpc. This requires a pericenter distance of $r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim68$ km ($r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim76$ km) at binary formation with eccentricity close to 1 for a reasonable tidal deformability and f-mode frequency of 500 and $1.73$ kHz (700 and $1.61$ kHz), respectively. The observation of the phase shift will enable measuring the f-mode frequency of neutron stars independently from their tidal deformability, providing significant insights into neutron star seismology and the properties of the equation of state. We also explore the potential of distinguishing between equal-radius and twin-star binaries, which could provide an opportunity to reveal strong first-order phase transitions in the nuclear equation of state.

          Compactness peaks: An astrophysical interpretation of the mass distribution of merging binary black holes

 - **Abstract**
 With the growing number of detections of binary black hole mergers, we are beginning to probe structure in the distribution of masses. A recent study by Schneider et al. proposes that isolated binary evolution of stripped stars naturally gives rise to the peaks at chirp masses $\sim 8 M_\odot$, $14 M_\odot$ in the chirp mass distribution and explains the dearth of black holes between $\approx 10-12 M_\odot$ in chirp mass. The gap in chirp mass results from an apparent gap in the component mass distribution between $m_1, m_2 \approx 10-15 M_\odot$ and the specific pairing of these black holes. This component mass gap results from the variation in core compactness of the progenitor, where a drop in compactness of Carbon-Oxygen core mass will no longer form black holes from core collapse. We develop a population model motivated by this scenario to probe the structure of the component mass distribution of binary black holes consisting of two populations: 1) two peak components to represent black holes formed in the compactness peaks, and 2) a powerlaw component to account for any polluting events, these are binaries that may have formed from different channels (e.g. dynamical). We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference to analyse the events from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) with this model. We find that there is a preference for the lower mass peak to drop off sharply at $\sim 11 M_\odot$ and the upper mass peak to turn on at $\sim 13 M_\odot$, in line with predictions from Schneider et al. However, there is no clear evidence for a gap. We also find mild support for the two populations to have different spin distributions. In addition to these population results, we highlight observed events of interest that differ from the expected population distribution of compact objects formed from stripped stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a dynamical study of the intermediate polar cataclysmic variable YY Dra based on time-series observations in the $K$ band, where the donor star is known to be the major flux contributor. We covered the $3.97$-h orbital cycle with 44 spectra taken between $2020$ and $2022$ and two epochs of photometry observed in 2021 March and May. One of the light curves was simultaneously obtained with spectroscopy to better account for the effects of irradiation of the donor star and the presence of accretion light. From the spectroscopy, we derived the radial velocity curve of the donor star metallic absorption lines, constrained its spectral type to M0.5$-$M3.5 with no measurable changes in the effective temperature between the irradiated and non-irradiated hemispheres of the star, and measured its projected rotational velocity $v_\mathrm{rot} \sin i = 103 \pm 2 \, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Through simultaneous modelling of the radial velocity and light curves, we derived values for the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star, $K_2 = 188^{+1}_{-2} \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the donor to white dwarf mass ratio, $q=M_2/M_1 = 0.62 \pm 0.02$, and the orbital inclination, $i={42^{\circ}}^{+2^{\circ}}_{-1^{\circ}}$. These binary parameters yield dynamical masses of $M_{1} = 0.99^{+0.10}_{-0.09} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $M_2 = 0.62^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($68$ per cent confidence level). As found for the intermediate polars GK Per and XY Ari, the white dwarf dynamical mass in YY Dra significantly differs from several estimates obtained by modelling the X-ray spectral continuum.

          Stellar Models are Reliable at Low Metallicity: An Asteroseismic Age for the Ancient Very Metal-Poor Star KIC 8144907

 - **Abstract**
 Very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-2) are important laboratories for testing stellar models and reconstructing the formation history of our galaxy. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar interiors and measure ages, but few asteroseismic detections are known in very metal-poor stars and none have allowed detailed modeling of oscillation frequencies. We report the discovery of a low-luminosity Kepler red giant (KIC 8144907) with high S/N oscillations, [Fe/H]=-2.66+/-0.08 and [alpha/Fe]=0.38+/-0.06, making it by far the most metal-poor star to date for which detailed asteroseismic modeling is possible. By combining the oscillation spectrum from Kepler with high-resolution spectroscopy we measure an asteroseismic mass and age of 0.79+/-0.02(ran)+/-0.01(sys) Msun and 12.0+/-0.6(ran)+/-0.4(sys) Gyr, with remarkable agreement across different codes and input physics, demonstrating that stellar models and asteroseismology are reliable for very metal-poor stars when individual frequencies are used. The results also provide a direct age anchor for the early formation of the Milky Way, implying that substantial star formation did not commence until redshift z~3 (if the star formed in-situ) or that the Milky Way has undergone merger events for at least ~12 Gyr (if the star was accreted by a dwarf satellite merger such as Gaia Enceladus).

 - **Abstract**
 The redshifted $21$\,cm signal of neutral hydrogen can be used as a direct probe of the intergalactic medium during Cosmic Dawn\,(CD) and Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). However, detecting this inherently weak signal has numerous challenges. The major ones include accurate foreground removal from low-frequency radio observations and systematics arising from instrumental effects. The Earth's ionosphere poses a major obstacle at these low radio frequencies. Thus, a systematic study of ionospheric effects on these sensitive low-frequency observations is critical, given that the construction of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1-Low) is in full progress. We use the end-to-end pipeline, called {\sc 21cme2e}, to study the effect of time-varying ionospheric corruption on the $21$\,cm power spectrum recovery. We use two models: a) a catalogue-based model focused on source position shift due to the refractive effect of the ionosphere and b) a realistic ionospheric condition generated using Kolmogorov's turbulence model. We assess the effect of the imperfections thus generated on the extraction of \HI\ $21$\,cm signal power spectrum. Our study shows that beyond ``median ionospheric offset" ($\theta_{\text{MIO}} \lesssim 0.1''$), the $21$\,cm signal from the EoR is unaffected by residual ionospheric effects. Our study emphasizes the need for the development of efficient ionospheric calibration algorithms for the upcoming SKA1-Low observations to extract the \HI\ $21$\,cm power spectra from the CD/EoR.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6357, a star-forming complex at $\sim 1.7$ kpc from the Sun, contains giant molecular clouds and three prominent star clusters alongside with HII regions, very massive stars and thousands of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. We present a combined infrared kinematic and time domain study of the line of sight towards this region enabled by the VVVX survey. In terms of kinematics, a novel discovery emerges: an asymmetrical distribution in the vector point diagram. Some stars in the sample exhibit spatial proximity to dusty regions, with their proper motions aligned with filament projections, hinting at a younger population linked to triggered star formation. However, this distribution could also stem from an asymmetric stellar expansion event within NGC 6357, warranting further investigation. Comparing this data with Gaia revealed inconsistencies likely due to high extinction levels in the region. Additionally, owing to accretion episodes and surface cool spots, young stars display high variability. Using the $K_s$-band time series data, we overcome the extreme levels of extinction towards the region, and compile a catalogue of $774$ infrared light curves of young stars. Each light curve has been characterized in terms of asymmetry and periodicity, to infer the dominant underlying physical mechanism. These findings are then correlated with evolutionary stages, aiming to uncover potential age disparities among the observed stars. This study contributes to our understanding the intricate dynamics and evolutionary processes within NGC 6357, offering valuable insights into the formation and development of stellar populations within such complex environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The differential rotation plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Sun. We study the solar rotation and its correlation with solar activity by applying a modified machine learning algorithm to identify and track coronal bright points (CBPs) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations at 193 Å during cycle 24. For more than 321,440 CBPs, the sidereal and meridional velocities are computed. We find the occurring height of CBPs about 5627 km above the photosphere. We obtain a rotational map for the corona by tracking CBPs at the formation height of Fe\,{\sc xii} (193 Å) emissions. The equator rotation (14.$^{\circ}$40 to 14.$^{\circ}$54 day$^{-1}$) and latitudinal gradient of rotation ($ - $3.$^{\circ}$0 to $ - $2.$^{\circ}$64 day$^{-1}$) show very slightly positive and negative trends with solar activity (sunspots and flares), respectively. For cycle 24, our investigations show that the northern hemisphere has more differential rotation than the southern hemisphere, confirmed by the asymmetry of the midlatitude rotation parameter. The asymmetry (ranked) of the latitudinal gradient of the rotation parameter is concordant with the sunspot numbers for 7 yr within the 9 yr of the cycle; however, for only 3 yr, it is concordant with the flare index. The minimum horizontal Reynolds stress changes from about $ - $2500 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$ (corresponding to high activity) in 2012 and 2014 to $ - $100 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$ (corresponding to low activity) in 2019 over 5$^{\circ}$ to 35$^{\circ}$ latitudes within cycle 24. We conclude that the negative horizontal Reynolds stress (momentum transfer toward the Sun's equator) is a helpful indication of solar activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary driver of ionization in star forming molecular clouds (MCs). Despite their potential impacts on gas dynamics and chemistry, no simulations of star cluster formation following the creation of individual stars have included explicit cosmic ray transport (CRT) to date. We conduct the first numerical simulations following the collapse of a $2000 M_{\odot}$ MC and the subsequent star formation including CRT using the STARFORGE framework implemented in the GIZMO code. We show that when CR-transport is streaming-dominated, the CR energy in the cloud is strongly attenuated due to energy losses from the streaming instability. Consequently, in a Milky Way like environment the median CR ionization rate (CRIR) in the cloud is low ($ \zeta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-19} \rm s^{-1}$) during the main star forming epoch of the calculation and the impact of CRs on the star formation in the cloud is limited. However, in high-CR environments, the CR distribution in the cloud is elevated ($\zeta \lesssim 6 \times 10^{-18}$), and the relatively higher CR pressure outside the cloud causes slightly earlier cloud collapse and increases the star formation efficiency (SFE) by $50 \%$ to $\sim 13 \%$. The initial mass function (IMF) is similar in all cases except with possible variations in a high-CR environment. Further studies are needed to explain the range of ionization rates observed in MCs and explore star formation in extreme CR environments.

          Climate Transition to Temperate Nightside at High Atmosphere Mass

 - **Abstract**
 Our recent work shows how M-Earth climates and transmission spectra depend on the amount of ice-free ocean on the planet's dayside and the mass of N2 in its atmosphere. M-Earths with more ice-free ocean and thicker atmospheres are hotter and more humid, and have larger water vapour features in their transmission spectra. In this paper, we describe a climate transition in high-pN2 simulations from the traditional ``eyeball" M-Earth climate, in which only the substellar region is temperate, to a ``temperate nightside" regime in which both the dayside and the nightside are entirely ice-free. Between these two states, there is a ``transition" regime with partial nightside ice cover. We use 3D climate simulations to describe the climate transition from frozen to deglaciated nightsides. We attribute this transition to increased advection and heat transport by water vapour in thicker atmospheres. We find that the nightside transitions smoothly back and forth between frozen and ice-free when the instellation or pCO2 is perturbed, with no hysteresis. We also find an analogous transition in colder planets: those with thin atmospheres can have a dayside hotspot when the instellation is low, whereas those with more massive atmospheres are more likely to be in the ``snowball" regime, featuring a completely frozen dayside, due to the increased advection of heat away from the substellar point. We show how both of these climate transitions are sensitive to instellation, land cover, and atmosphere mass. We generate synthetic transmission spectra and phase curves for the range of climates in our simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Future millimeter wavelength experiments aim to both increase aperture diameters and broaden bandwidths to increase the sensitivity of the receivers. These changes produce a challenging anti-reflection (AR) design problem for refracting and transmissive optics. The higher frequency plastic optics require consistently thin polymer coats across a wide area, while wider bandwidths require multilayer designs. We present multilayer AR coats for plastic optics of the high frequency BICEP Array receiver (200-300 GHz) utilizing an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, layered and compressively heat-bonded to itself. This process allows for a range of densities (from 0.3g/cc to 1g/cc) and thicknesses (>0.05mm) over a wide radius (33cm), opening the parameter space of potential AR coats in interesting directions. The layered ePTFE membrane has been combined with other polymer layers to produce band average reflections between 0.2% and 0.6% on high density polyethylene and a thin high modulus polyethylene window, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The fraction of white dwarfs found in wide binaries is estimated by cross referencing a catalogue of wide binaries with catalogues photometrically determined white-dwarf candidates and spectroscopically confirmed white dwarf stars. The wide-binary fraction of white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres is about 5%, but the fraction of white dwarfs with helium or carbon-dominated atmospheres is significantly larger. Using spectroscopic classifications, the binary fraction of DA white dwarfs is determined to be $0.063\pm0.002$ and for non-DA white dwarfs is larger at $0.080\pm0.004$.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, we have access to enormous inventories of stellar spectra that allow the extraction of atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances essential in stellar studies. However, characterizing such a large amount of data is complex and requires a good understanding of the studied object to ensure reliable and homogeneous results. In this study, we present a methodology to measure homogenously the basic atmospheric parameters and detailed chemical abundances of over 1600 thin disk main-sequence stars in the 100 pc solar neighborhood, using APOGEE-2 infrared spectra. We employed the code tonalli to determine the atmospheric parameters using a prior on log g. The log g prior in tonalli implies an understanding of the treated population and helps to find physically coherent answers. Our atmospheric parameters agree within the typical uncertainties (100 K in Teff, 0.15 dex in log g and $[M/H]$) with previous estimations of ASPCAP and Gaia DR3. We use our temperatures to determine a new infrared color-temperature sequence, in good agreement with previous works, that can be used for any main-sequence star. Additionally, we used the BACCHUS code to determine the abundances of Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe in our sample. The five elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe) studied have an abundance distribution centered around slightly sub-solar values, in agreement with previous results for the solar neighborhood. The over 1600 main-sequence stars atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances presented here are useful in follow-up studies of the solar neighborhood or as a training set for data-driven methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations and showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.

          WASP 0346-21: An EL CVn-Type Eclipsing Binary with Multiperiodic Pulsations in a Triple System

 - **Abstract**
 VLT/UVES spectroscopic and TESS photometric observations for WASP 0346-21 allow the direct determination of its physical properties, along with the detection of a circumbinary object and oscillating signals. The high-resolution spectra yielded the radial velocities of all three stars and the atmospheric parameters of $T_{\rm eff,A}$ = 7225$\pm42$ K, [M/H] = 0.30$\pm$0.03 dex, and $v_{\rm A}$$\sin i$ = 78$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ of the primary component. The combined analysis of these observations resulted in the fundamental parameters of the eclipsing components and the third light of $l_3$ = 0.043$\pm$0.004, which is consistent with the light contribution of the tertiary star observed in the echelle spectra. WASP 0346-21 A resides within the overlapping main-sequence domain of $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor variables, while the secondary component of $M_{\rm B}$ = 0.185$\pm$0.013 M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm B}$ = 0.308$\pm$0.023 R$_\odot$, $T_{\rm eff,B}$ = 10,655$\pm$146 K, and $L_{\rm B}$ = 1.09$\pm$0.17 L$_\odot$ matches well with the low-mass white dwarf (WD) model for $Z$ = 0.01, corresponding to the thick-disk population classified by the Galactic kinematics. Multifrequency analyses were performed on the residual TESS data after removing the binarity effects. The low frequencies around 26.348 day$^{-1}$ and 17.683 day$^{-1}$ are $\delta$ Sct pulsations originating from WASP 0346-21 A, and the high frequencies of 97.996 day$^{-1}$ and 90.460 day$^{-1}$ are considered to be extremely low-mass WD oscillations. These results demonstrate that WASP 0346-21 is a hierarchical triple system, consisting of an EL CVn binary with multiperiodic pulsations in each component and a distant outer tertiary.

 - **Abstract**
 GLINT is a nulling interferometer downstream of the SCExAO extreme-adaptive-optics system at the Subaru Telescope (Hawaii, USA), and is a pathfinder instrument for high-contrast imaging of circumstellar environments with photonic technologies. GLINT is effectively a testbed for more stable, compact, and modular instruments for the era of 30m-class telescopes. GLINT is now undergoing an upgrade with a new photonic chip for more achromatic nulls, and for phase information to enable fringe tracking. Here we provide an overview of the motivations for the GLINT project and report on the design of the new chip, the on-site installation, and current status.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars have been primarily detected by their narrow pulses or periodicity in time domain data. Interferometric surveys for pulsars are challenging due to the trade-off between beam sensitivity and beam size and the corresponding tradeoff between survey sensitivity (depth), sky coverage, and computational efforts. The detection sensitivity of time-domain searches for pulsars is affected by dispersion smearing, scattering, and rapid orbital motion of pulsars in binaries. We have developed a new technique to select pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images by identifying scintillating sources and measuring their scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Identifying likely candidates allows sensitive, focused time-domain searches, saving computational effort. Pulsar scintillation is independent of its timing properties and hence offers a different selection of pulsars compared to time-domain searches. Candidates identified from this method could allow us to find hard-to-detect pulsars, such as sub-millisecond pulsars and pulsars in very compact, highly-accelerated binary orbits. We use uGMRT observations in the fields of PSR\,B1508+55, PSR\,J0437$-$4715, and PSR\,B0031$-$07 as test cases for our technique. We demonstrate that the technique correctly differentiates between the pulsar and other non-scintillating point sources and show that the extracted dynamic spectrum of the pulsar is equivalent to that extracted from the uGMRT phased array beam. We show the results from our analysis of known pulsar fields and discuss challenges in dealing with interference and instrumental effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a small planet, TOI-1408 c, on a 2.2-day orbit located interior to a previously known hot Jupiter, TOI-1408 b ($P=4.42$ d, $M=1.86\pm0.02\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$, $R=2.4\pm0.5\,R_\mathrm{Jup}$) that exhibits grazing transits. The two planets are near 2:1 period commensurability, resulting in significant transit timing variations (TTVs) for both planets and transit duration variations (TDVs) for the inner planet. The TTV amplitude for TOI-1408 c is 15% of the planet's orbital period, marking the largest TTV amplitude relative to the orbital period measured to date. Photodynamical modeling of ground-based radial velocity (RV) observations and transit light curves obtained with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and ground-based facilities leads to an inner planet radius of $2.22\pm0.06\,R_\oplus$ and mass of $7.6\pm0.2\,M_\oplus$ that locates the planet into the Sub-Neptune regime. The proximity to the 2:1 period commensurability leads to the libration of the resonant argument of the inner planet. The RV measurements support the existence of a third body with an orbital period of several thousand days. This discovery places the system among the rare systems featuring a hot Jupiter accompanied by an inner low-mass planet.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we construct a dissipative quintessential cosmic inflation. For this purpose, we add a multiplicative dissipative term in the standard quintessence field Lagrangian. We consider the specific form of dissipation as the time integral including the Hubble parameter and an arbitrary function that describes the dissipative properties of the quintessential scalar field. Inflation parameters and observables are calculated under slow-roll approximations and a detailed calculation of the cosmological perturbations is performed in this setup. We consider different forms of potentials and calculate the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio for a constant as well as variable dissipation function. To check the reliability of this model, a numerical analysis on the model parameters space is done in confrontation with recent observational data. By comparing the results with observational joint datasets at 68% and 95% confidence levels, we obtain some constraints on the model parameters space, specially the dissipation factor with e-folds numbers N = 55 and N = 60. As some specific results, we show that the power-law potential with a constant dissipation factor and N = 60 is mildly consistent with observational data in some restricted domains of the model parameter space with very small and negative dissipation factor and a negligible tensor-toscalar ratio. But this case with N = 55 is consistent with observation considerably. For power-law potential and variable dissipation factor as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$, the consistency with observation is also considerable with a reliable tensor-to-scalar ratio. The quadratic and quartic potentials with variable dissipation function as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$ are consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing data at the 68% and 95% levels of confidence for some intervals of the parameter n.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detailed analysis of a new hybrid (p- and g-mode) sdB pulsator, TIC441725813 (TYC 4427-1021-1), discovered and monitored by TESS over 670 days. The TESS light curves available for this star were analysed using prewhitening techniques to extract mode frequencies accurately. The pulsation spectrum is then interpreted through methods that include asymptotic period spacing relationships and rotational multiplets identification. We also exploited a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), low-resolution spectrum of TIC441725813 using grids of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres to derive its atmospheric parameters. Interestingly, several frequency multiplets interpreted as rotational splittings of deep-probing g-modes indicate a slow rotation period of at least $85.3 \pm 3.6$ day, while splittings of mostly envelope-probing p-modes suggest a significantly shorter rotation period of $17.9 \pm 0.7$ day, which implies the core (mainly the helium mantle with possibly the deeper partially-mixed helium-burning core that it surrounds) rotates at least ~4.7 times slower than the envelope. The radial velocity curves indicate that TIC441725813 is in a close binary system with a low-luminosity companion, possibly a white dwarf. While elusive in the available TESS photometry, a low-frequency signal that would correspond to a period of $\sim 6.7$ h is found, albeit at low S/N. TIC441725813 is a particularly interesting sdB star whose envelope rotates faster than the core. We hypothesise that this might be caused by the effects of tidal interaction with a companion, although in the present case, the presence of such a companion will have to be further investigated. This analysis paves the way toward a more detailed seismic probing of TIC441725813 using optimisation techniques, which will be presented in a second paper.

 - **Abstract**
 NH$_{3}$(ammonia) plays a critical role in the chemistry of star and planet formation, yet uncertainties in its binding energy (BE) values complicate accurate estimates of its abundances. Recent research suggests a multi-binding energy approach, challenging the previous single-value notion. In this work, we use different values of NH$_{3}$ binding energy to examine its effects on the NH$_{3}$ abundances and, consequently, in the early evolution of protostellar cores. Using a gas-grain chemical network, we systematically vary the values of NH$_{3}$ binding energies in a model Class 0 protostellar core and study the effects of these binding energies on the NH$_{3}$ abundances. Our simulations indicate that abundance profiles of NH$_{3}$ are highly sensitive to the binding energy used, particularly in the warmer inner regions of the core. Higher binding energies lead to lower gas-phase NH$_{3}$ abundances, while lower values of binding energy have the opposite effect. Furthermore, this BE-dependent abundance variation of NH$_{3}$ significantly affects the formation pathways and abundances of key species such as HNC, HCN, and CN. Our tests also reveal that the size variation of the emitting region due to binding energy becomes discernible only with beam sizes of 10 arcsec or less. These findings underscore the importance of considering a range of binding energies in astrochemical models and highlight the need for higher resolution observations to better understand the subtleties of molecular cloud chemistry and star formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the origin of the broad component of the [Ar II] 7 mcm line emission related to the ejecta excitation by the neutron star of SN 1987A. We argue that the line broad wings are emitted at the tmperature of $\sim300$ K. The flux excess in the red wing of [Ar II] line is reproduced by the line photons scattering off the optically thin uniform dust component with the grain size of 1 - 2 mcm and the total mass of $\mbox{(several)}\times10^{-3}\,M{\odot}$. The dusty opaque clumps containing almost all the dust of SN~1987A have a low occultation optical depth and line photon scattering on dusty clumps do not contribute noticeably in the red wing. The additional heating might be related to ionization losses of relativistic protons.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical evolution models predict a gradual build-up of $^{13}$C in the universe, based on empirical nuclear reaction rates and assumptions on the properties of stellar populations. However, old metal-poor stars within the Galaxy contain more $^{13}$C than is predicted, suggesting that further refinements to the models are necessary. Gas at high redshift provides important supplementary information at metallicities $-2\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-1$, for which there are only a few measurements in the Galaxy. We obtained new, high-quality, VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the QSO B1331+170 and used them to measure $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ system (DLA) at $z_{abs}=1.776$, with [Fe/H]=-1.27. AI-VPFIT, an Artificial Intelligence tool based on genetic algorithms and guided by a spectroscopic information criterion, was used to explore different possible kinematic structures of the carbon gas. Three hundred independent AI-VPFIT models of the absorption system were produced using pre-set $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values, ranging from 4 to 500. Our results show that $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$=28.5^{+51.5}_{-10.4}$, suggesting a possibility of $^{13}$C production at low metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 High energy electrons carry much of a solar flare's energy. Therefore, understanding changes in electron beam distributions during their propagation is crucial. A key focus of this paper is how the co-spatial return current reduces the energy flux carried by these accelerated electrons. We systematically compute this reduction for various beam and plasma parameters relevant to solar flares. Our 1D model accounts for collisions between beam and plasma electrons, return current electric-field deceleration, thermalization in a warm target approximation, and runaway electron contributions. The results focus on the classical (Spitzer) regime, offering a valuable benchmark for energy flux reduction and its extent. Return current losses are only negligible for the lowest nonthermal fluxes. We calculate the conditions for return current losses to become significant and estimate the extent of the modification to the beam's energy flux density. We also calculate two additional conditions which occur for higher injected fluxes: (1) where runaway electrons become significant, and (2) where current-driven instabilities might become significant, requiring a model that self-consistently accounts for them. Condition (2) is relaxed and the energy flux losses are reduced in the presence of runaway electrons. All results are dependent on beam and co-spatial plasma parameters. We also examine the importance of the reflection of beam electrons by the return-current electric field. We show that the interpretation of a number of flares needs to be reviewed to account for the effects of return currents.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the topic of existence and exploration of exocomets has been gaining increasing attention. The asymmetrical decrease in the stellar brightness due to the passage of a comet-like object in front of the star was successfully predicted. It was subsequently confirmed on the basis of the light curves of stars observed by Kepler and TESS orbital telescopes. Since then, there have been successful attempts to fit the asymmetrical dips observed in the stellar light curves utilizing a simple 1D model of an exponentially decaying optically thin dust tail. In this work, we propose fitting the photometric profiles of some known exocomet transits based on a Monte Carlo approach to build up the distribution of dust particles in a cometary tail. As the exocomet prototypes, we used the physical properties of certain Solar System comets belonging to the different dynamical groups and moving at heliocentric distances of 0.6 au, 1.0 au, 5.0 au, and 5.5 au. We obtained a good agreement between the observed and modeled transit light curves. We also show that the physical characteristics of dust particles, such as the particle size range, the power index of dust size distribution, the particle terminal velocity, and distance to the host star affect the shape of the transit light curve, while the dust productivity of the comet nucleus and the impact parameter influence its depth and duration. The estimated dust production rates of the transiting exocomets are at the level of the most active Solar System comets.

 - **Abstract**
 The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity. In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be applicable to any gravitational wave background.

 - **Abstract**
 The very late thermal pulse (VLTP) affects the evolution of $\sim$20\% of 1--8\,$\mathrm M_\odot$ stars, repeating the last phases of the red giant within a few years and leading to the formation of a new, but hydrogen-poor nebula within the old planetary nebula (PN). The strong dust formation in the latter obscures the optical and near-infrared radiation of the star. We aimed to determine the reheating timescale of the central star in Sakurai's object, which is an important constraint for the poorly understood VLTP evolution. We observed the radio continuum emission of Sakurai's object for almost 20 years from 2004 to 2023. Continuous, multi-frequency observations proved to be essential to distinguish between phases dominated by photoionization and shock ionization. The flux density fluctuates by more than a factor 40 within months to years. The spectral index remained negative between 2006 and 2017 and is close to zero since 2019. The emission region is barely resolved since 2021. Non-thermal radio emission observed from 2004 to 2017 traces shocks induced by wind interactions due to discrete mass-loss events. Thermal emission dominates during the period 2019--2023 and may indicate photoionization of the nebula by the central star.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative transfer simulations of the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05° in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of 1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve climate simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}<0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain astrophysics has leaped forward with the direct discovery of gravitational waves and the emergence of new generation instruments for multi-messenger studies. The capacity of the multi-messenger multi-wavelength community to effectively pursue follow-up observations is hindered by the suboptimal localization of numerous transient events and the escalating volume of alerts. Thus, we have developed an effective tool to overcome the observational and technical hurdles inherent in the emerging field of multi-messenger astrophysics. We present tilepy, a Python package for the automatic scheduling of follow-up observations of poorly localized transient events. It is ideally suited to tackle the challenge of complex follow-up in mid and small-FoV telescope campaigns, with or without human intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of tilepy in the realm of multi-observatory, multi-wavelength campaigns, to cover the localization uncertainty region of various events ultimately aiming at pinpointing the source of the multi-messenger emission. The tilepy code is publicly available on GitHub and is sufficiently flexible to be employed either automatically or in a customized manner, tailored to collaboration and individual requirements. tilepy is also accessible via a public API and through the Astro-COLIBRI platform.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the possibility that the cosmic neutrino background might have a nonthermal spectrum, and investigate its effect on cosmological parameters relative to standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. As a specific model, we consider a thermal $y$-distortion, which alters the distribution function of the neutrino background by depleting the population of low-energy neutrinos and enhancing the high-energy tail. We constrain the thermal $y$-parameter of the cosmic neutrino background using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and place a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $y \leq 0.043$. The $y$-parameter increases the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, reducing the sound horizon radius and increasing the best-fit value for the Hubble constant $H_0$. We obtain an upper bound on the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 71.12\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ at $95\%$ confidence, substantially reducing the tension between CMB/BAO constraints and direct measurement of the expansion rate from Type-Ia supernovae. Including a spectral distortion also allows for a higher value of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations, with a best-fit of $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 0.9720 \pm 0.0063$, and a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $n_{\mathrm{S}} \leq 0.9842$.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly observed in X-ray light curves of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs); however, their origin remains a topic of debate. In order to thoroughly investigate variations in spectral properties on the QPO timescale, we utilized the Hilbert-Huang transform technique to conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy across a broad energy band for LFQPOs in the newly discovered BHXRB Swift J1727.8-1613. This is achieved through quasi-simultaneous observations from Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER), Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR), and Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). Our analysis reveals that both the non-thermal and disk-blackbody components exhibit variations on the QPO timescale, with the former dominating the QPO variability. For the spectral parameters, we observe modulation of the disk temperature, spectral indices, and reflection fraction with the QPO phase with high statistical significance (>5\sigma). Notably, the variation in the disk temperature is found to precede the variations in the non-thermal and disk fluxes by ~0.4-0.5 QPO cycles. We suggest that these findings offer further evidence that the type-C QPO variability is a result of geometric effects of the accretion flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Spaced-based mirrors are a developing use-case for Additive Manufacturing (AM), the process that builds a part layer-by-layer. The increased geometric freedom results in novel and advantageous designs previously unachievable. Conventionally, mirror fabrication uses subtractive (milling & turning), formative (casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing methods; however, an additive method can simplify an assembly by consolidating individual components into one, and incorporating lattice structures and function optimised geometries to reduce the mass of components, which are beneficial to space-based instrumentation as mass and volume are constrained. Attention must be given to the printability of the design - build orientation and powder/resin removal from lattices and internal cavities are challenges when designing for AM. This paper will describe the design, manufacture and metrology of mirror prototypes from the Active Deployable Optical Telescope (ADOT) 6U CubeSat project. The AM mirror is 52mm in diameter, 10mm deep, with a convex 100mm radius of curvature reflective surface and deploys telescopically on three booms. The objectives of the designs were to combine the boom mounting features into the mirror and to lightweight both prototypes by 50% and 70% using internal, thin-walled lattices. Four final lattice designs were downselected through simulation and prototype validation. Prototypes were printed in the aluminium alloy AlSi10Mg using powder bed fusion and fused silica using stereolithography. Aluminium mirrors were single point diamond turned and had surface roughness measurements taken. Fused silica designs were adapted from the aluminium designs and have completed printing.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon abundances in first-ascent giant stars are usually lower than those of their main-sequence counterparts. At moderate metallicities, stellar evolution of single stars cannot account for the existence of red-giant branch stars with enhanced carbon abundances. The phenomenon is usually interpreted as resulting from past mass transfer from an evolved binary companion now in the white dwarf evolutionary stage. Aims: We aim to confirm the links between [C/O] enhancement, s-process element enhancement and binary fraction using large-scale catalogues of stellar abundances and probable binary stars. Methods: We use a large data set from the 17 data release of the SDSS-IV/APOGEE~2 survey to identify carbon-enhanced stars in the Galactic disk. We identify a continuum of carbon enrichment throughout three different sub-populations of disk stars and explore links between the degree of carbon enrichment and binary frequency, metallicity and chemical compositions. Results: We verify a clear correlation between binary frequency and enhancement in the abundances of both carbon and cerium, lending support to the scenario whereby carbon-enhanced stars are the result of mass transfer by an evolved binary companion. In addition, we identify clustering in the carbon abundances of high-$\alpha$ disk stars, suggesting that those on the high metallicity end are likely younger, in agreement with theoretical predictions for the presence of a starburst population following the gas-rich merger of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage system.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics of the young stellar association near the Sun TW Hya is studied. Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in two ways. The first method -- analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back in time -- gave an estimate of the age $t=4.9\pm1.2$ Myr. The second was to analyze the instantaneous velocities of stars and showed that there is a volume expansion of the stellar system with an angular velocity coefficient $K_{xyz}=103\pm12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Based on this effect, the time interval that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya association to the present moment was found, $t=9.5\pm1.1$ Myr. The following principal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid are determined: $\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 If a planetary nebula (PN) is shown to be a member of a star cluster, we obtain important new constraints on the mass and chemical composition of the PN's progenitor star, which cannot be determined for PNe in the field. Cluster membership can be tested by requiring the projected separation between the PN and cluster to be within the tidal radius of the cluster, and the objects to have nearly identical radial velocities (RVs) and interstellar extinctions, and nearly identical proper motions (PMs). In an earlier study, we used PMs to confirm that three PNe, which had already passed the other tests, are highly likely to be members of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). For a fourth object, the PN JaFu 1, which lies in the Galactic bulge near the GC Palomar 6 on the sky and has a similar RV, the available PM measurement gave equivocal results. We have now obtained new high-resolution images of the central star of JaFu 1 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which, combined with archival HST frames taken 14 and 16 years earlier, provide a high-precision PM. Unfortunately, we find that the PM of the central star differs from that of the cluster with high statistical significance, and thus is unlikely to be a member of Palomar 6. Nevertheless, JaFu 1 is of astrophysical interest because its nucleus appears to be a member of the rare class of "EGB 6-type" central stars, which are associated with compact emission-line knots.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.

 - **Abstract**
 It has now been just over four decades since the first discovery of a millisecond spin period pulsar (MSP), B1937+21, by Don Backer and collaborators in late 1982. This finding of an entirely new class of astronomical object revolutionized pulsar astronomy and provided inspiration for novel scientific investigation for decades to come, continuing to the current day and beyond. Here we review the events leading to the discovery, based on archival material, personal correspondence, and first-hand accounts of several of the participants. We also briefly review the enormous impact that MSPs have had on physics and astronomy by highlighting major MSP-related science of the past 40 years.

 The NASA Standard Break-Up Model models collisions and explosions in space, which identifies the future distribution of debris. Given a possible break-up event, this work analyses the threat posed by the generated debris in the orbit of an asset spacecraft. Using the Koopman Operator solution of the $J_2$ perturbed two-body dynamics, the family of all possible orbits that cross the asset's pathway is identified and parameterized according to their velocity. The threat level assessment of a collision onto the asset is estimated considering the intersection between the velocities of the break-up model and the Koopman transfer solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the transiting planet GJ 238 b, with a radius of $0.566\pm0.014$ R$_{\oplus}$ ($1.064\pm0.026$ times the radius of Mars) and an orbital period of 1.74 day. The transit signal was detected by the TESS mission and designated TOI-486.01. The star's position close to the Southern ecliptic pole allows for almost continuous observations by TESS when it is observing the Southern sky. The host star is an M2.5 dwarf with $V=11.57\pm0.02$ mag, $K=7.030\pm0.023$ mag, a distance of $15.2156\pm0.0030$ pc, a mass of $0.4193_{-0.0098}^{+0.0095}$ M$_{\odot}$, a radius of $0.4314_{-0.0071}^{+0.0075}$ R$_{\odot}$, and an effective temperature of $3{,}485\pm140$ K. We validate the planet candidate by ruling out or rendering highly unlikely each of the false positive scenarios, based on archival data and ground-based follow-up observations. Validation was facilitated by the host star's small size and high proper motion, of $892.633\pm0.025$ mas yr$^{-1}$.

          Catalog of Proper Orbits for 1.25 Million Main Belt Asteroids and Discovery of 136 New Collisional Families

 - **Abstract**
 The proper elements of asteroids are obtained from the instantaneous orbital elements by removing periodic oscillations produced by gravitational interactions with planets. They are unchanging in time, at least if chaotic dynamics and non-gravitational forces could be ignored, and can therefore be used to identify fragments of major collisions (asteroid families) that happened eons ago. Here we present a new catalog of proper elements for 1.25 million main belt asteroids. We explain the methodology, evaluate uncertainties, and discuss how the new catalog can be used to identify asteroid families. A systematic search for families yielded 153 cases not reported in Nesvorný at al. (2015) -- 17 of these cases were identified in various other publications, 136 cases are new discoveries. There are now 274 families in the asteroid belt in total (plus a handful of families in the resonant Hilda population). We analyzed several compact families in detail. The new family around the middle belt asteroid (9332) 1990SB1 (9 members) is the youngest family found so far (estimated formation only 16-17 kyr ago). New families (1217) Maximiliana, (6084) Bascom, (10164) Akusekijima and (70208) 1999RX33 all formed 0.5-2.5 Myr ago. The (2110) Moore-Sitterly family is a close pair of relatively large bodies, 2110 and 44612, and 15 small members all located sunwards from 2110 and 44612, presumably a consequence of the Yarkovsky drift over the estimated family age (1.2-1.5 Myr). A systematic characterization of the new asteroid families is left for future work.

          Predicting spatial curvature $\Omega_K$ in globally $CPT$-symmetric universes

 - **Abstract**
 Boyle and Turok's $CPT$-symmetric universe model posits that the universe was symmetric at the Big Bang, addressing numerous problems in both cosmology and the Standard Model of particle physics. We extend this model by considering the symmetric conditions at the end of the Universe, following Lasenby et al. by imposing constraints on the allowed perturbation modes. These constrained modes conflict with the integer wave vectors required by the global spatial geometry in a closed universe. To resolve this conflict, only specific values of curvature are permissible, and in particular the curvature density is constrained to be $\Omega_K \in \{-0.014, -0.009, -0.003, \ldots\}$, consistent with Planck observations.

          Review of Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories in Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories are the most general scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and a single scalar field and which propagate only one scalar degree of freedom, without being plagued by Ostrogradsky instabilities. This is achieved through certain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise the Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally build to describe the late-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the cosmological constant, they can be used to build models for early universe, to describe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe, they modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories which can have observable consequences and are suited to build black hole models, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work we review their effects on cosmology, looking at their basic properties, their parameterisations and classifications, and then focusing on solutions in the early and the late universe.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GW due to the density function in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider Dark Matter self-interactions mediated by ultralight scalars. We show that effectively massless mediators lead to an enhancement of the matter power spectrum, while heavier mediators lead to a suppression, together with a feature around their Jeans scale. We derive the strongest present constraints by combining Planck and BOSS data. The recent DESI measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations exhibit a mild preference for long-range self-interactions, as strong as 4 per mille of the gravitational coupling. Forthcoming data from DESI itself and Euclid will confirm or disprove such a hint.
