 - **Abstract**
 Electrostatic force actuation is a key component of the system of geodesic reference test masses (TM) for the LISA orbiting gravitational wave observatory and in particular for performance at low frequencies, below 1 mHz, where the observatory sensitivity is limited by stray force noise. The system needs to apply forces of order 10$^{-9}$ N while limiting fluctuations in the measurement band to levels approaching 10$^{-15}$ N/Hz$^{1/2}$. We present here the LISA actuation system design, based on audio-frequency voltage carrier signals, and results of its in-flight performance test with the LISA Pathfinder test mission. In LISA, TM force actuation is used to align the otherwise free-falling TM to the spacecraft-mounted optical metrology system, without any forcing along the critical gravitational wave-sensitive interferometry axes. In LISA Pathfinder, on the other hand, the actuation was used also to stabilize the TM along the critical $x$ axis joining the two TM, with the commanded actuation force entering directly into the mission's main differential acceleration science observable. The mission allowed demonstration of the full compatibility of the electrostatic actuation system with the LISA observatory requirements, including dedicated measurement campaigns to amplify, isolate, and quantify the two main force noise contributions from the actuation system, from actuator gain noise and from low frequency ``in band'' voltage fluctuations. These campaigns have shown actuation force noise to be a relevant, but not dominant, noise source in LISA Pathfinder and have allowed performance projections for the conditions expected in the LISA mission.
#### Convergence properties of fine structure constant measurements using  quasar absorption systems

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for spacetime variations of fundamental constants have entered an era of unprecedented precision. New, high quality quasar spectra require increasingly refined analytic methods. In this article, a continuation in a series to establish robust and unbiased methodologies, we explore how convergence criteria in non-linear least squares optimisation impact on quasar absorption system measurements of the fine structure constant alpha. Given previous claims for high-precision constraints, we critically examine the veracity of a so-called ``blinding'' approach, in which alpha is fixed at the terrestrial value during the model building process, releasing it as a free parameter only after the ``final'' absorption system kinematic structure has been obtained. We show that this approach results in an extended flat canyon in chi squared-alpha space, such that convergence is unlikely to be reached, even after as many as 1000 iterations. The fix is straightforward: alpha must be treated as a free parameter from the earliest possible stages of absorption system model building. The implication of the results presented here is that all previous measurements that have used initially-fixed alpha should be reworked.
#### A refined search for high-velocity gas in the Cygnus Loop supernova  remnant

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a sensitive search for high-velocity gas in interstellar absorption lines associated with the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant (SNR). We examine high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra of six stars in the Cygnus Loop region with distances greater than ~700 pc. All stars show low-velocity Na I and Ca II absorption. However, only one star, HD 198301, exhibits high-velocity Ca II absorption components, at velocities of +62, +82, and +96 km/s. The distance to this star of ~870 pc helps to constrain the distance to the receding edge of the Cygnus Loop's expanding shock front. One of our targets, HD 335334, was previously thought to exhibit high positive and high negative velocity interstellar Na I and Ca II absorption. This was one factor leading Fesen et al. to derive a distance to the Cygnus Loop of 725 pc. However, we find that HD 335334 is in fact a double-line spectroscopic binary and shows no evidence of high-velocity interstellar absorption. As such, the distance to HD 335334 cannot be used to constrain the distance to the Cygnus Loop. Our detection of Ca II absorption approaching 100 km/s toward HD 198301 is the first conclusive detection of high-velocity absorption from a low ionization species associated with the Cygnus Loop SNR. A large jump in the Na I column density toward BD+31 4218, a star located beyond the northwestern boundary of the Cygnus Loop, helps to constrain the distance to a large molecular cloud complex with which the Cygnus Loop is evidently interacting.

 - **Abstract**
 The full array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has been in operation since July 2021. For its kilometer-square array (KM2A), we have optimized the selection criteria for very high and ultra-high energy $\gamma$-rays, using the data collected from August 2021 to August 2022, resulting in an improvement on significance of about 15$\%$ compared with previous cuts. With the implementation of these new selection criteria, the angular resolution is also significantly improved by approximately 10$\%$ at tens of TeV. Other aspects of the full KM2A array performance, such as the pointing error are also calibrated using the Crab Nebula. The resulting energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula in the energy range of 10-1000 TeV can be well fitted by a log-parabola model, which is consistent with the previous results from LHAASO and other experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia DR3 parallax approach was used to estimate the absolute parameters of 2375 Delta Scuti stars from the ASAS catalog. The selected stars have a variety of observational characteristics, with a higher than 80% probability of being Delta Scuti stars. We have displayed all the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram along with the Delta Scuti instability strip, the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), and the Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS). Then, we determined which fundamental and overtone modes each star belongs to using pulsation constant (Q) calculations. In addition, we evaluated the parameters in the Q calculation equation using three machine learning methods, which showed that surface gravity and temperature have the greatest effect on its calculation. The Period-Luminosity (P-L) relationship of the Delta Scuti stars was also revisited. Eventually, using least squares linear regression, we made four linear fits for fundamental and overtone modes and updated their relationships.

 AI-FLARES (Artificial Intelligence for the Analysis of Solar Flares Data) is a research project funded by the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana and by the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica within the framework of the ``Attivit\`a di Studio per la Comunit\`a Scientifica Nazionale Sole, Sistema Solare ed Esopianeti'' program. The topic addressed by this project was the development and use of computational methods for the analysis of remote sensing space data associated to solar flare emission. This paper overviews the main results obtained by the project, with specific focus on solar flare forecasting, reconstruction of morphologies of the flaring sources, and interpretation of acceleration mechanisms triggered by solar flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Extinction is the elephant in the room that almost everyone tries to avoid when analyzing optical/IR data: astronomers tend to find a quick fix for it that the referee will accept, but that does not mean such a solution is correct or even optimal. In this contribution I address three important issues related to extinction that are commonly ignored and present current and future solutions for them: [1] Extinction produces non-linear photometric effects, [2] the extinction law changes between sightlines, and [3] not all families of extinction laws have the same accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The high resolution rovibronic line list of MgH+ molecular cation are presented in our work. The potential energy curves are calculated by the method of multireference configuration interaction plus Davidson correction (MRCI+Q) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. Spectroscopy constants are fitted and the results are in good agreement with the experiment, ensuring the accuracy of the electronic structure. On account of potential energy curves and transition dipole moments, the Franck - Condon factors and Einstein coefficients of transition are obtained. These calculations are used to obtain an accurate partition functions and line list for the molecule. Using the data obtained from the ab initio calculation, the absorption cross-sections under different temperatures and pressures were simulated. Our work could provide some theoretical insights into solar and cold planet spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new procedure to identify observations of known objects in large data sets of unlinked detections. It begins with a Keplerian integrals method that allows us to link two tracklets, computing preliminary orbits, even when the tracklets are separated in time by a few years. In the second step, we represent the results in a `graph' where the tracklets are the nodes and the preliminary orbits are the edges. Then, acceptable `3-cycles' are identified and a least squares orbit is computed for each of them. Finally, we construct sequences of $n \geq 4$ tracklets by searching through the orbits of nearby 3-cycles and attempting to attribute the remaining tracklets. We calculate the technique's efficiency at identifying unknown objects using real detections that attempt to mimic key parameters of the Minor Planet Center's Isolated Tracklet File (ITF) and then apply the procedure to the ITF to identify tens of thousands of new objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the behaviour of two recent methods for the computation of preliminary orbits. These methods are based on the conservation laws of Kepler's problem, and enable the linkage of very short arcs of optical observations even when they are separated in time by a few years. Our analysis is performed using both synthetic and real data of 822 main belt asteroids. The differences between computed and true orbital elements have been analysed for the true linkages, as well as the occurrence of alternative solutions. Some metrics have been introduced to quantify the results, with the aim of discarding as many of the false linkages as possible and keeping the vast majority of true ones. These numerical experiments provide thresholds for the metrics which take advantage of the knowledge of the \emph{ground truth}: the values of these thresholds can be used in normal operation mode, when we do not know the correct values of the orbital elements and whether the linkages are true or false.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the emission of dust grains within the Orion Bar - a well-known, highly far-UV (FUV)-irradiated PDR. The Orion Bar because of its edge-on geometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution and the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our goal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to models. Taking advantage of the recent JWST PDRs4All data, we follow the dust emission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 micron) and MIRI (at 7.7, 11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 micron), along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of carbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra and the predictions of the THEMIS dust model coupled to the numerical code DustEM. Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer simulations of dust emission with the SOC code and compare to data obtained along well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar. The JWST data allows us, for the first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at the illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with carbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive unprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain the observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the nano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas) 15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains. The lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating stars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found in the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger grains.
#### Blind source separation for decomposing X-ray pulsar profiles.  Introducing phase-correlated variability analysis (PCVA) with a case study of  Cen X-3

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars offer a unique opportunity to study physics under extreme conditions. To fully exploit this potential, the interrelated problems of modelling radiative transport and the dynamical structure of the accretion flow must, however, be solved. This task is challenging both from a theoretical and observational point of view and is further complicated by a lack of direct correspondence between the properties of emission emerging from the neutron star and observed far away from it. In general, a mixture of emission from both poles of the neutron star viewed from different angles is indeed observed at some or even all phases of the pulse cycle. It is essential, therefore, to reconstruct the contributions of each pole to the observed flux in order to test and refine models describing the formation of the spectra and pulse profiles of X-ray pulsars. In this paper we propose a novel data-driven approach to address this problem using the pulse-to-pulse variability in the observed flux, and demonstrate its application to RXTE observations of the bright persistent X-ray pulsar Cen X-3. We then discuss the comparison of our results with previous work attempting to solve the same problem and how they can be qualitatively interpreted in the framework of a toy model describing emission from the poles of a neutron star.
#### New Horizons Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter Observes Higher than  Expected Fluxes Approaching 60 AU

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA New Horizons Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC) measures dust particle impacts along the spacecraft's flight path for grains with mass $\ge$ $10^{-12}$ g, mapping out their spatial density distribution. We present the latest SDC dust density, size distribution, and flux measurements through 55 au and compare them to numerical model predictions. Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are thought to be the dominant source of interplanetary dust particles (IDP) in the outer solar system due to both collisions between KBOs, and their continual bombardment by interstellar dust particles (ISD). Continued measurements through 55 au show higher than model-predicted dust fluxes as New Horizons approaches the putative outer edge of the Kuiper Belt (KB). We discuss potential explanations for the growing deviation: radiation pressure stretches the dust distribution to further heliocentric distances than its parent body distribution; icy dust grains undergo photo-sputtering that rapidly increases their response to radiation pressure forces and pushes them further away from the sun; and the distribution of KBOs may extend much further than existing observations suggest. Ongoing SDC measurements at even larger heliocentric distances will continue to constrain the contributions of dust production in the KB. Continued SDC measurements remain crucial for understanding the Kuiper Belt and the interpretation of observations of dust disks around other stars.
#### Optically-thick Structure in Early B Type Supergiant Stellar Winds at  Low Metallicities

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate determination of mass-loss rates from massive stars is important to understanding stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Large-scale structure and variability in stellar winds have significant effects on mass-loss rates. Time-series observations provide direct quantification of such variability. Observations of this nature are available for some Galactic early supergiant stars but not yet for stars in lower metallicity environments such as the Magellanic Clouds. We utilise ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope ULLYSES program to demonstrate that the presence of structure in stellar winds of supergiant stars at low metallicities may be discerned from single-epoch spectra. We find evidence that, for given stellar luminosities and mean stellar wind optical depths, structure is more prevalent at higher metallicities. We confirm, at Large Magellanic Cloud (0.5 Z_solar), Small Magellanic Cloud (0.2 Z_solar) and lower (0.14 -- 0.1 Z_solar) metallicities, earlier Galactic results that there does not appear to be correlation between the degree of structure in stellar winds of massive stars and stellar effective temperature. Similar lack of correlation is found with regard to terminal velocity of stellar winds. Additional and revised values for radial velocities of stars and terminal velocities of stellar winds are presented. Direct evidence of temporal variability, on timescales of several days, in stellar wind at low metallicity is found. We illustrate that narrow absorption components in wind-formed profiles of Galactic OB stellar spectra remain common in early B supergiant spectra at low metallicities, providing means for better constraining hot, massive star mass-loss rates.
#### Pruning: a tool to optimize the layout of large scale arrays for  ultra-high-energy air-shower detection

 - **Abstract**
 The deployment of several large scale arrays is envisioned to study astroparticles at ultra-high energies. In order to circumvent the heavy computational costs of exploring and optimizing their layouts, we have developed a pruning method. It consists in i) running a set of microscopic simulations and interpolate them over a dense, regularly spaced array of detection units, and ii) pruning the unnecessary units out of the layout, in order to obtain the shower footprint on a newly shaped layout. This method offers flexibility to test various layout parameters, instrumental constraints, and physical inputs, with a drastic reduction in the required CPU time. The method can be universally applied to optimize arrays of any size, and using any detection techniques. For demonstration, we apply the pruning tool to radio antenna layouts, which allows us to discuss the interplay between the energy and inclination of air-showers on the size of the radio footprint and the intensity of the signal on the ground. Some rule-of-thumb conclusions that can be drawn for this specific case are: i) a hexagonal geometry is more efficient than a triangular geometry, ii) the detection efficiency of the array is stable to changes in the spacing between radio antennas around 1000m step size, iii) for a given number of antennas, adding a granular infill on top of a coarse hexagonal array is more efficient than instrumenting the full array with a less dense spacing.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a model of a twisted accretion disc around a Kerr black hole interacting with a secondary black hole of a smaller mass on an inclined eccentric orbit. We use parameters of the system, which may be appropriate for the so-called 'precessing massive' model of OJ 287. We calculate expressions for torque exerted on the disc by the secondary and a contribution of the secondary to the apsidal precession of disc elements by a double averaging procedure over the periods of the secondary and the disc elements. These expressions are used at all scales of interest, including the ones inside the binary orbit. We calculate numerically the evolution of the disc tilt and twist assuming a flat initial configuration. We consider the disc aspect ratio $h/r=10^{-3}$, a rather large viscosity parameter $\alpha=0.1$ and several values of the primary rotational parameter, $\chi$. We find that, after a few periods of Lense-Thirring precession of the orbit, the disc relaxes to a quasi-stationary configuration in the precessing frame with a non-trivial distribution of the disc inclination angle, $\beta$, over the radial scale. We propose an analytic model for this configuration. We show that the presence of the twisted disc leads to multiple crossings of the disc by the secondary per one orbital period, with time periods between the crossings being different from the flat disc model. Our results should be taken into account in the modelling of OJ 287. They can also be applied to similar sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present time-series near-infrared (NIR) spectra for the classical Cepheid, CP Cephei, from the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope and NIR spectrograph, TripleSpec, at Apache Point Observatory, NM, USA. Spectral observations were made at three points on the ascending portion of the visible phase diagram for the star. Carbon monoxide (CO) was detected in absorption in the 2.3-micron band head for each observation. We observed that the equivalent width of the 3-1 transition of the CO band head decreased by half from our first observation to the second, or slightly over one day out of the 17.867-day period. Our third observation occurred 54 days after the first (slightly over three periods for the star) and showed similar CO levels to the first observation, suggesting that the CO is in the stellar atmosphere and varies with pulsation.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the equilibrium configurations of relativistic Neutron Stars(NS) with a polytropic model in a $f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T+\xi T^{2}$ gravity.We investigate the neutron star properties and their dependence on $\lambda$ and $\xi$ corresponding to different central densities ($\rho_c$) of the NS. For $\lambda = 0,-1,-3,-5$ with $\xi=0$ and $\rho_c=1.5\times10^{18}~\rm{kg~m^{-3}}$, we find the maximum mass of the NS as $M = 1.06 M_\odot$, $1.19 M_\odot$ $1.61 M_\odot$ and $2.47~M_\odot$ corresponding to the radius($R$) $10.409$ km, $10.737$ km, $11.461$ km and $12.119$ km. This higher value of NS mass can be compared with gravitational wave data(GW170817). For given $\lambda =-6$ and $\xi = 0$, we find that as $\rho_c$ increases from $\rho_c=1.1 to 1.6 \times 10^{18}~\rm{kg~m^{-3}}$, the maximum mass of the NS decreases from $4.19 M_\odot$ to $3.23 M_\odot$ while it's radius $R$ decreases $13.86 \rm{km}$ to $11.54 \rm{km}$. With the fixed value of $\xi = 10^{-27}$ and $\lambda = 0,-1,-3,-5$, we find the maximum mass $M =1.06 M_\odot$,$1.34 M_\odot$,$1.89 M_\odot$ and $3.39~M_\odot$ corresponding to the radius $R = 10.409$ km, $10.843$ km, $11.549$ km and $11.680$ km. respectively. Taking our observational constraints i.e. GW170817 (BNS Merger) mass - radius data, observed pulsars PSRJ1614-2230, PSRJ0348+0432 maximum mass - radius data; we found that posterior distribution plot of mass $\&$ radius gives good result and the corner plot of modified gravity parameters $\lambda$ and $\xi$ are giving very good posterior results. So, for a range of values of $\lambda$ with $\xi=0 (\neq 0)$, we found that the mass $M$ and the radius $R$ of the NS lie within the range given by the GW170817 gravitational wave data given by LIGO, Pulsars $\&$ Millisecond Pulsars data and the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) mass-radius data given by NASA.
