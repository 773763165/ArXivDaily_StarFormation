 - **Abstract**
 Despite the growing number of confident binary black hole coalescences observed through gravitational waves so far, the astrophysical origin of these binaries remains uncertain. Orbital eccentricity is one of the clearest tracers of binary formation channels. Identifying binary eccentricity, however, remains challenging due to the limited availability of gravitational waveforms that include effects of eccentricity. Here, we present observational results for a waveform-independent search sensitive to eccentric black hole coalescences, covering the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We identified no new high-significance candidates beyond those that were already identified with searches focusing on quasi-circular binaries. We determine the sensitivity of our search to high-mass (total mass $M>70$ $M_\odot$) binaries covering eccentricities up to 0.3 at 15 Hz orbital frequency, and use this to compare model predictions to search results. Assuming all detections are indeed quasi-circular, for our fiducial population model, we place an upper limit for the merger rate density of high-mass binaries with eccentricities $0 < e \leq 0.3$ at $0.33$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) 26-Al and 60-Fe in the Solar system places constraints on the initial conditions of our planetary system. Most theories posit that the origin of 26-Al and 60-Fe is in the interiors of massive stars, and they are either delivered directly to the protosolar disc from the winds and supernovae of the massive stars, or indirectly via a sequential star formation event. However, massive stars that produce SLRs also emit photoionising far and extreme ultraviolet radiation, which can destroy the gas component of protoplanetary discs, possibly precluding the formation of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Here, we perfom N-body simulations of star-forming regions and determine whether discs that are enriched in SLRs can retain enough gas to form Jovian planets. We find that discs are enriched and survive the photoionising radiation only when the dust radius of the disc is fixed and not allowed to move inwards due to the photoevaporation, or outwards due to viscous spreading. Even in this optimal scenario, not enough discs survive until the supernovae of the massive stars and so have zero or very little enrichment in 60-Fe. We therefore suggest that the delivery of SLRs to the Solar system may not come from the winds and supernovae of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 New physics in the early Universe could lead to parity-violation in the late Universe, sourcing statistics whose sign changes under point reflection. The best constraints on such phenomena have come from the Planck temperature fluctuations; however, this is already cosmic-variance-limited down to relatively small scales, thus only small improvements are expected in the future. Here, we search for signatures of parity-violation in the polarized CMB, using the Planck PR4 $T$- and $E$-mode data. We perform both a simulation-based blind test for any parity-violating signal at $\ell<518$, and a targeted search for primordial $U(1)$ gauge fields (and the amplitudes of a generic collapsed model) at $\ell<2000$. In all cases, we find no evidence for new physics, with the model-independent test finding consistency with the FFP10/NPIPE simulation suite at $(-)0.4\sigma$, and the gauge field test constraining the fractional amplitude of gauge fields during inflation to be below $6\times 10^{-19}$ at $95\%$ confidence level for a fiducial model. The addition of polarization data can significantly improve the constraints, depending on the particular model of primordial physics, and the bounds will tighten significantly with the inclusion of smaller-scale information.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been widely accepted that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of a CO white dwarf. However, the natures of the progenitor system(s) and explosion mechanism(s) are still unclarified. Thanks to the recent development of transient observations, they are now frequently discovered shortly after the explosion, followed by rapid spectroscopic observations. In this study, by modeling very early-phase spectra of SNe Ia, we try to constrain the explosion models of SNe Ia. By using the Monte Carlo radiation transfer code, TARDIS, we estimate the properties of their outermost ejecta. We find that the photospheric velocity of normal-velocity supernovae (NV SNe) in the first week is $\sim$15000 km s$^{-1}$. The outer velocity, to which the carbon burning extends, spans the range between $\sim$20000 and 25000 km s$^{-1}$. The ejecta density of NV SNe also shows a large diversity. For high-velocity supernovae (HV SNe) and 1999aa-like SNe, the photospheric velocity is higher, $\sim$20000 km s$^{-1}$. They are different in the photospheric density, with HV SNe having higher density than 1999aa-like SNe. For all these types, we show that the outermost composition is closely related to the outermost ejecta density; the carbon burning layer and the unburnt carbon layer are found in the higher-density and lower-density objects, respectively. This finding suggests that there might be two sequences, the high-density and carbon-poor group (HV SNe and some NV SNe) and the low-density and carbon-rich group (1999aa-like and other NV SNe), which may be associated with different progenitor channels.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of a 4 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) in UHZ1 at $z =$ 10.3, just 450 Myr after the big bang, suggests that the seeds of the first quasars may have been direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) from the collapse of supermassive primordial stars at $z \sim$ 20. This object was identified in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRcam and Chandra X-ray data, but recent studies suggest that radio emission from such a BH should also be visible to the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). Here, we present estimates of radio flux for UHZ1 from 0.1 - 10 GHz, and find that SKA and ngVLA could detect it with integration times of 10 - 100 hr and just 1 - 10 hr, respectively. It may be possible to see this object with VLA now with longer integration times. The detection of radio emission from UHZ1 would be a first test of exciting new synergies between near infrared (NIR) and radio observatories that could open the era of $z \sim$ 5 - 15 quasar astronomy in the coming decade.
#### Ruling out Strongly Interacting Dark Matter-Dark Radiation Models from  Joint Cosmic Microwave Background-Quasar Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm provides a remarkably good description of the Universe's large-scale structure. However, some discrepancies exist between its predictions and observations at very small sub-galactic scales. To address these issues, the consideration of a strong interaction between dark matter particles and dark radiation emerges as an intriguing alternative. In this study, we explore the constraints on those models using joint observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Quasars with our previously built parameter estimation package CosmoReionMC. At 2-$\sigma$ confidence limits, this analysis rules out all strongly interacting Dark Matter - Dark Radiation models proposed to date, representing the most stringent constraint on those models to the best of our knowledge. Future research using a 21-cm experiment holds the potential to reveal stronger constraints or uncover hidden interactions within the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the degree of energy equipartition in a sample of 101 Monte Carlo numerical simulations of globular clusters (GCs) hosting either a system of stellar-mass black holes (BHS), an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or neither of them. For the first time, we systematically explore the signatures that the presence of BHS or IMBHs produces on the degree of energy equipartition and if these signatures could be found in current observations. We show that a BHS can halt the evolution towards energy equipartition in the cluster centre. We also show that this effect grows stronger with the number of stellar-mass black holes in the GC. The signatures introduced by IMBHs depend on how dominant their masses are to the GCs and for how long the IMBH has co-evolved with its host GCs. IMBHs with a mass fraction below 2% of the cluster mass produce a similar dynamical effect to BHS, halting the energy equipartition evolution. IMBHs with a mass fraction larger than 2% can produce an inversion of the observed mass-dependency of the velocity dispersion, where the velocity dispersion grows with mass. We compare our results with observations of Galactic GCs and show that the observed range of the degree of energy equipartition in real clusters is consistent with that found in our analysis. In particular, we show that some Galactic GCs fall within the anomalous behaviour expected for systems hosting a BHS or an IMBH and are promising candidates for further dynamical analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube real-time alerts allow for rapid follow-up observations of likely astrophysical neutrino events, enabling searches for multi-messenger counterparts. The Enhanced Starting Track Real-time Stream (ESTReS) is a real-time extension of the Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection (ESTES), a high astrophysical purity muon-neutrino sample recently used by IceCube to measure the astrophysical diffuse flux. A set of computationally cheap cuts allows us to run a fast filter in seconds. This online filter selects about 100 events per day to be sent to Madison, WI via satellite where the full ESTES event selection is applied within minutes. Events that pass the final set of cuts (ESTReS + ESTES) will be sent out as real-time alerts to the broader astrophysical community. ESTReS's unique contribution to the current real-time alerts will be events in the southern sky in the 5 TeV - 100 TeV range. We expect about 10.3 events per year which average 50% astrophysical purity. In this talk I will report the status of the ESTReS alert stream in the context of the IceCube real-time program.
#### Oort Cloud Comets Discovered Far from the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Increasingly, Oort Cloud comets are being discovered at great distances from the Sun and tracked over ever wider ranges of heliocentric distances as observational equipment improves. Aims: To investigate in detail how the original semimajor axis for near-parabolic comets depends on the selected data arc and the assumed form of the non-gravitational (NG) acceleration. Methods: Among currently known Oort Cloud comets with large perihelion distances ($q > 3$ au), we selected 32 objects observed over the widest ranges of heliocentric distances in orbital legs before and after perihelion. For each of them, we determined a series of orbits using at least three basic types of data sets selected from available positional data (pre- and post-perihelion data and the entire data set), and a few forms of NG acceleration representing water ice or CO sublimation. Results: We found that the motion of comets is often measurably affected by NG forces at heliocentric distances beyond 5 au from the Sun. The most spectacular example is C/2010 U3 (Boattini), whose perihelion distance is 8.44 au. NG effects are detectable for 19 of the 32 comets within the positional data. For five comets, we found asymmetric effects of NG forces - in three cases significantly greater before perihelion than afterward (C/2017 M4, C/2000 SV$_{75}$, and C/2015 O1), and in two others the opposite (C/1997 BA$_6$ and C/2006 S3). We also find that the well-known systematic effect of finding more tightly bound original orbits when including the NG acceleration than in purely gravitational solutions may be related to the specific form of the standard $g(r)$ function describing the sublimation of ices.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing X-ray binaries make an ideal condition to study reprocessed X-rays, as the X-rays detected during eclipse are purely reprocessed while the much brighter primary X-rays are blocked by the companion star. We carried out a comprehensive study of X-ray reprocessing with four eclipsing Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) systems by comparing X-ray spectra during and outside eclipse with \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC pn observations. The 17 observations of MXB 1659$-$298, AX J1745.6$-$2901, EXO 0748$-$676 and XTE J1710$-$281 give unique features of the systems. For example, X-ray reprocessing characteristics in AX J1745.6$-$2901 is found to be nearly same irrespective of the intensity state; there is an indication of different types of variable warp structures in the inner accretion disk in EXO 0748$-$676, a high out-of-eclipse to eclipse flux ratio in XTE J1710$-$281 inspite of a large size of the accretion disk perhaps indicates low scale height of the accretion disk. The eclipse spectra for some of the LMXB sources are reported for the first time. We have derived the fractional visible area of the accretion disk during maximum eclipse phase for various obscuration geometries. The out-of-eclipse to eclipse flux ratio in LMXBs observed to be smaller compared to that found in High Mass X-ray Binaries. This indicates greater reprocessing in LMXBs despite having less dense, less extended stellar wind from the companion. The X-ray reprocessing efficiencies observed in LMXBs indicate large dependencies of X-ray reprocessing on the scale height of the accretion disk, relative size of the disk compared to the companion and some other unknown factors.

 - **Abstract**
 Zirconium monoxide (ZrO) absorption lines define rare S-type stars and are currently being sought on exoplanets. Successful detection is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive line list, with existing data not ideal for many applications. Specifically, the Plez \etal{} line list is near-complete but has insufficient accuracy for high-resolution cross-correlation, while the Sorensen \& Bernath data has high accuracy but only considers a small number of spectral bands. This article presents a novel spectroscopic model, variational line list and trihybrid line list for the main \ZrO{} isotopologue, as well as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the \isoa{}, \isob{}, \isoc{}, \isod{}~and \isoe{} isotopologues. These were constructed using \DUO{} based on icMRCI-SD/CASSCF~\abinitio{} electronic data calculated using \MOLPRO{}, experimental energies obtained from a previous \Marvel{} data compilation and perturbative energies from Sorensen \& Bernath. The new \ZrO{} \EXOMOL{}-style trihybrid line list, \LLname{}, comprises \noenergies{} energies (\noMaenergies{} experimental) and \notransitions{} transitions up to 30,000~\cm{} (333~nm) between ten low-lying electronic states (\ZrOX{}, \ZrOaa{}, \ZrOA{}, \ZrObb{}, \ZrOB{}, \ZrOC{}, \ZrOdd{}, \ZrOee{}, \ZrOff{} and \ZrOF{}). The inclusion of experimental energy levels in \LLname{} means ZrO will be much easier to detect using high-resolution ground-based telescopes in the 12,500 -- 17,500~\cm{} (571 -- 800~nm) spectral region. The inclusion of variational energy levels means that the ZorrO line list has very high completeness and can accurately model molecular absorption cross-sections even at high temperatures. The \LLname{} data will hopefully facilitate the first detection of ZrO in the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter exoplanet, or alternatively more conclusively exclude its presence.
#### Spectrum Sharing Dynamic Protection Area Neighborhoods for Radio  Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 To enforce incumbent protection through a spectrum access system (SAS) or future centralized shared spectrum system, dynamic protection area (DPA) neighborhood distances are employed. These distances are distance radii, in which citizen broadband radio service devices (CBSDs) are considered as potential interferers for the incumbent spectrum users. The goal of this paper is to create an algorithm to define DPA neighborhood distances for radio astronomy (RA) facilities with the intent to incorporate those distances into existing SASs and to adopt for future frameworks to increase national spectrum sharing. This paper first describes an algorithm to calculate sufficient neighborhood distances. Verifying this algorithm by recalculating previously calculated and currently used neighborhood distances for existing DPAs then proves its viability for extension to radio astronomy facilities. Applying the algorithm to the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO) with customized parameters results in distance recommendations, 112 kilometers for category A (devices with 30 dBm/10 MHz max EIRP) and 144 kilometers for category B (devices with 47 dBm/10MHz max EIRP), for HCRO's inclusion into a SAS and shows that the algorithm can be applied to RA facilities in general. Calculating these distances identifies currently used but likely out-of-date metrics and assumptions that should be revisited for the benefit of spectrum sharing.

 - **Abstract**
 A new molecular line list for lithium hydroxide ($^{7}$Li$^{16}$O$^{1}$H) covering wavelengths $\lambda > 1 \mu$m (the 0-10000 cm$^{-1}$ range) is presented. The OYT7 line list contains over 331 million transitions between rotation-vibration energy levels with total angular momentum up to $J=95$ and is applicable for temperatures up to $T\approx 3500$ K. Line list calculations are based on a previously published, high-level \textit{ab initio} potential energy surface and a newly computed dipole moment surface of the ground $\tilde{X}\,^1\Sigma^+$ electronic state. Lithium-containing molecules are important in a variety of stellar objects and there is potential for LiOH to be observed in the atmospheres of exoplanets. This work provides the first, comprehensive line list of LiOH and will facilitate its future molecular detection. The OYT7 line list along with the associated temperature- and pressure-dependent opacities can be downloaded from the ExoMol database at www.exomol.com and the CDS astronomical database.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.
#### Closure Relations of Synchrotron Self-Compton in Afterglow stratified  medium and Fermi-LAT Detected Gamma-Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 The Second Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) was announced by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) Collaboration. It includes 29 bursts with photon energy higher than 10 GeV. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations have been adequately explained by the classic synchrotron forward-shock model, however, photon energies greater than 10 GeV from these transient events are challenging, if not impossible, to characterize using this afterglow model. Recently, the closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) forward-shock model evolving in a stellar wind and homogeneous medium was presented to analyze the evolution of the spectral and temporal indexes of those bursts reported in 2FLGC. In this work, we provide the CRs of the same afterglow model, but evolving in an intermediate density profile ($\propto {\rm r^{-k}}$) with ${\rm 0\leq k \leq2.5}$, taking into account the adiabatic/radiative regime and with/without energy injection for any value of the electron spectral index. The results show that the current model accounts for a considerable subset of GRBs that cannot be interpreted in either stellar-wind or homogeneous afterglow SSC model. The analysis indicates that the best-stratified scenario is most consistent with ${\rm k=0.5}$ for no-energy injection and ${\rm k=2.5}$ for energy injection.
#### Aliphatics and Aromatics in the Universe: The Pre-JWST Era

 - **Abstract**
 The so-called "unidentified infrared emission" (UIE) features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions are generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. Astronomical PAHs often have an aliphatic component (e.g., aliphatic sidegroups like methyl --CH3 may be attached as functional groups to PAHs) as revealed by the detection in many UIE sources of the aliphatic C--H stretching feature at 3.4 micron. With its unprecedented sensitivity, unprecedented spatial resolution and high spectral resolution, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) holds great promise for evolutionizing the studies of aliphatics and aromatics in the universe. To facilitate analyzing JWST observations, we present a theoretical framework for determining the aliphatic fractions (\eta_ali) of PAHs, the fractions of C atoms in aliphatic units, from the emission intensity ratios of the 3.4 micron feature to the 3.3 micron feature. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we compile the 3.3 and 3.4 micron UIE data obtained in the pre-JWST era for an as complete as possible sample, and then apply the framework to these pre-JWST data. We derive a median aliphatic fraction of <\eta_ali>=5.4\% and find that the aliphatic fractions are the highest in protoplanetary nebulae illuminated by cool stars lacking ultraviolet radiation. Nevertheless, the "hardness" of stellar photons is not the only factor affecting the PAH aliphaticity, other factors such as the starlight intensity may also play an important role.
#### The 2175 Angstrom Interstellar Extinction Bump: Is the Wavelength  Variable?

 - **Abstract**
 The most striking characteristics of the mysterious 2175 Angstrom extinction bump, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature seen on the interstellar extinction curve, are the invariant central wavelength and variable bandwidth: its peak position at 2175 Angstrom is remarkably constant while its bandwidth varies from one line of sight to another. However, recent studies of the lines of sight toward a number of Herbig Ae/Be stars have revealed that the extinction bump exhibits substantial shifts from the canonical wavelength of 2175 Angstrom. In this work we revisit these lines of sight and take a physical approach to determine the ultraviolet (UV) extinction curve for each line of sight. It is found that the wavelengths of the derived UV extinction bumps are around 2200 Angstrom and the scatters are considerably smaller than that of the previous study based on the same set of Herbig Ae/Be stars, consistent with the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, the scatters are still appreciably larger than that associated with the nominal bump position of 2175 Angstrom. This is discussed in the context that Herbig Ae/Be stars are not well-suited for interstellar extinction studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The exact nature of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, remains unknown ever since its discovery in 1965. Popular candidate carriers for the extinction bump include nano-sized graphitic grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. To quantitatively evaluate PAHs as a possible carrier, we perform quantum chemical computations for the electronic transitions of 30 compact, pericondensed PAH molecules and their cations as well as anions with a wide range of sizes from 16 to 96 C atoms and a mean size of 43 C atoms. It is found that a mixture of such PAHs, which individually exhibit sharp absorption features, show a smooth and broad absorption band that resembles the 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction bump. Arising from $\pi^*\leftarrow\pi$ transitions, the width and intensity of the absorption bump for otherwise randomly-selected and uniformly-weighted PAH mixtures, do not vary much with PAH sizes and charge states, whereas the position shifts to longer wavelengths as PAH size increases. While the computed bump position, with the computational uncertainty taken into account, appears to agree with that of the interstellar extinction bump, the computed width is considerably broader than the interstellar bump which remains unaccounted for as far as the PAH mixtures considered here are concerned. It appears that, to account for the observed bump width, one has to resort to PAH species of specific sizes and structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium (D) was exclusively generated in the Big Bang and the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) model predicts a primordial abundance of D/H~26ppm. As the Galaxy evolves, D/H gradually decreases because of astration. The Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model predicts a present-day abundance of D/H~20ppm. However, observations of the local interstellar medium (ISM) have revealed that the gas-phase interstellar D/H varies considerably from one region to another and has a median abundance of D/H~13ppm, substantially lower than predicted from the BBN and GCE models. It has been suggested that the missing D atoms of D/H~7ppm could have been locked up in deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, we have previously demonstrated that PAHs with aromatic C--D units are insufficient to account for the missing D. Here we explore if PAHs with aliphatic C--D units could be a reservoir of D. We perform quantum chemical computations of the vibrational spectra of "superdeuterated" PAHs (in which one D and one H share an C atom) and PAHs attached with D-substituted methyl group, and derive the band strengths of the aliphatic C--D stretch (A_4.65). By applying the computationally derived A_4.65 to the observed aliphatic C--D emission at ~4.6--4.8 micron, we find that PAHs with aliphatic C--D units could have tied up a substantial amount of D/H and marginally account for the missing D. The possible routes to generate PAHs with aliphatic C--D units are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-outburst signal (a decrease of the optical brightness) just before the outburst is clearly detected in the observations of the T CrB obtained before and during the 1946 outburst. A similar decrease is also visible in the light curve of RS Oph during the 2021 outburst. We suppose that this is due to formation of a thick, dense envelope around the white dwarf, and we estimate its size (1000 - 2000 km), mass (5.10$^{-8}$ - 6.10$^{-7}$ M$_\odot$) and average density (5 - 16 g cm$^{-3}$).

 Comprehensive and accurate rovibronic line lists for the X $^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ and A $^{1}\Pi$ states of $^{12}$C$^{1}$H$^{+}$ and $^{13}$C$^{1}$H$^{+}$ which should be applicable up to temperatures of 5000 K are presented. Available empirical potential energy curves and high-level ab initio dipole and transition dipole moment curves are used with the program LEVEL to compute rovibronic energy levels and Einstein $A$ coefficients. $\Lambda$-doubling is incorporated into the energy levels and $A$-coefficients involving the A $^{1}\Pi$ state using an empirical method. For $^{12}$C$^{1}$H$^{+}$, line positions are improved by using both laboratory and astronomical observational spectra as input to the MARVEL procedure. The $^{12}$C$^{1}$H$^{+}$ line list contains 1505 states and 34194 transitions over the frequency range of 0 - 33010 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda > 300$ nm). Comparisons with observed astronomical and laboratory spectra give very good agreement. The PYT CH$^{+}$ line lists and partition functions are available from the ExoMol database at www.exomol.com.

 - **Abstract**
 Empirical line lists for the open shell molecule $^{89}$Y$^{16}$O (yttrium oxide) and its isotopologues are presented. The line list covers the 6 lowest electronic states: $X {}^{2}\Sigma^{+}$, $A {}^{2}\Pi$, $A' {}^{2}\Delta$, $B {}^{2}\Sigma^{+}$, $C {}^{2}\Pi$ and $D {}^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ up to 60000 cm$^{-1}$ ($<0.167$ $\mu$m) for rotational excitation up to $J = 400.5$. An \textit{ab initio} spectroscopic model consisting of potential energy curves (PECs), spin-orbit and electronic angular momentum couplings is refined by fitting to experimentally determined energies of YO, derived from published YO experimental transition frequency data. The model is complemented by empirical spin-rotation and $\Lambda$-doubling curves and \textit{ab initio} dipole moment and transition dipole moment curves computed using MRCI. The \textit{ab initio} PECs computed using the complete basis set limit extrapolation and the CCSD(T) method with its higher quality provide an excellent initial approximation for the refinement. Non-adiabatic coupling curves for two pairs of states of the same symmetry $A$/$C$ and $B$/$D$ are computed using a state-averaged CASSCF and used to built diabatic representations for the $A {}^{2}\Pi$, $C {}^{2}\Pi$, $B {}^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ and $D {}^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ curves. Calculated lifetimes of YO are tuned to agree well with the experiment, where available. The BRYTS YO line lists for are included into the ExoMol data base (www.exomol.com).

 - **Abstract**
 N-body numerical simulations code for the orbital motion of asteroids/planetesimals within the asteroid belt under the gravitational influence of the sun and the accreting planets has been developed. The aim is to make qualitative, and to an extent a semi-quantitative argument, regarding the possible extent of radial mixing and homogenization of planetesimal reservoirs of the two observed distinct spectral types , viz., the S-type and C-type, across the heliocentric distances due to their dynamical orbital evolution, thereby, eventually leading to the possible accretion of asteroids having chemically diverse constituents. The spectral S-type and C-type asteroids are broadly considered as the parent bodies of the two observed major meteoritic dichotomy classes, namely, the non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites, respectively. The present analysis is performed to understand the evolution of the observed dichotomy and its implications due to the nebula and early planetary processes during the initial 10 Myrs (Million years). The homogenization across the two classes is studied in context to the accretion timescales of the planetesimals with respect to the half-life of the potent planetary heat source, 26Al. The accretion over a timescale of ~1.5 Myr. possibly resulted in the planetary-scale differentiation of planetesimals to produce CC and NC achondrites and iron meteorite parent bodies, whereas, the prolonged accretion over a timescale of 2-5 Myrs. resulted in the formation of CC and NC chondrites. Our simulation results indicate a significant role of the initial eccentricities and the masses of the accreting giant planets, specifically, Jupiter and Saturn, in triggering the eccentricity churning of the planetesimals across the radial distances......

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler space telescope leaves a legacy of tens of thousands of stellar rotation period measurements. While many of these stars show strong periodicity, there exists an even bigger fraction of stars with irregular variability for which rotation periods are unknown. As a consequence, many stellar activity studies might be strongly biased toward the behavior of more active stars with measured rotation periods. To at least partially lift this bias, we apply a new method based on the Gradient of the Power Spectrum (GPS). The maximum of the gradient corresponds to the position of the inflection point (IP). It was shown previously that the stellar rotation period $P_{rot}$ is linked to the inflection point period $P_{IP}$ by the simple equation $P_{rot} = P_{IP}/\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a calibration factor. The GPS method is superior to classical methods (such as auto-correlation functions (ACF)) because it does not require a repeatable variability pattern in the time series. From the initial sample of 142,168 stars with effective temperature $T_{eff}\leq6500K$ and surface gravity $log g\geq4.0$ in the Kepler archive, we could measure rotation periods for 67,163 stars by combining the GPS and the ACF method. We further report the first determination of a rotation period for 20,397 stars. The GPS periods show good agreement with previous period measurements using classical methods, where these are available. Furthermore, we show that the scaling factor $\alpha$ increases for very cool stars with effective temperatures below 4000K, which we interpret as spots located at higher latitudes. We conclude that new techniques (such as the GPS method) must be applied to detect rotation periods of stars with small and more irregular variabilities. Ignoring these stars will distort the overall picture of stellar activity and, in particular, solar-stellar comparison studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a methodological study for statistically comparing the sensitivities of two periodograms for weak signal planet detection in transit surveys: the widely used Box-Least Squares (BLS) algorithm following light curve detrending and the Transit Comb Filter (TCF) algorithm following autoregressive ARIMA modeling. Small depth transits are injected into light curves with different simulated noise characteristics. Two measures of spectral peak significance are examined: the periodogram signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a False Alarm Probability (FAP) based on the generalized extreme value distribution. The relative performance of the BLS and TCF algorithms for small planet detection is examined for a range of light curve characteristics, including orbital period, transit duration, depth, number of transits, and type of noise. The TCF periodogram applied to ARIMA fit residuals with the SNR detection metric is preferred when short-memory autocorrelation is present in the detrended light curve and even when the light curve noise had white Gaussian noise. BLS is more sensitive to small planets only under limited circumstances with the FAP metric. BLS periodogram characteristics are inferior when autocorrelated noise is present. Application of these methods to TESS light curves with small exoplanets confirms our simulation results. The study ends with a decision tree that advises transit survey scientists on procedures to detect small planets most efficiently. The use of ARIMA detrending and TCF periodograms can significantly improve the sensitivity of any transit survey with regularly spaced cadence.

 - **Abstract**
 As more Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are being localised, we are learning that some fraction have persistent radio sources (PRSs). Such a discovery motivates an improvement in our understanding of the nature of those counterparts, the relation to the bursts themselves and why only some FRBs have PRSs. We report on observations made of FRB 20121102A with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Across five epochs, we detect the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A. Our observations are split into a cluster of four epochs (MJD 58732 - 58764) and a separate single epoch about 1000days later. The measured flux density is constant across the first four observations but then decays by more than one-third in the final observation. Our observations on MJD 58736 coincided with the detections of 11 bursts from FRB 20121102A by the MeerTRAP backend, seven of which we detected in the image plane. We discuss the importance of image plane detections when considering the commensal transient searches being performed with MeerKAT and other radio facilities. We find that MeerKAT is so sensitive that within a two-second image, we can detect any FRB with a flux density above 2.4mJy at 1.3GHz and so could localise every FRB that has been detected by CHIME to date.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, evidence has accumulated that some high-energy cosmic neutrinos can be associated with blazars. The strongest evidence for an individual association was found in the case of the blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017. In July 2019, another track-like neutrino event (IC190730A) was found spatially coincident with the well-known bright flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1502+106. PKS 1502+106 was not found to be in a particularly elevated gamma-ray state, but exhibited a remarkably bright radio outburst at the time of the neutrino detection, similar to TXS 0506+056. We have performed a multi-frequency VLBI study from 15 GHz up to 86 GHz on TXS 0506+056, PKS 1502+106 and one additional neutrino-candidate blazar (PKS 0215+015) to study the radio structure of neutrino candidate blazars in response to their neutrino association. We have obtained target of opportunity observations with the VLBA for all three sources within $\sim$1 month from their associated neutrino events and are performing multi-epoch studies of the jet kinematics at 15 GHz as part of the MOJAVE program. Here, we present first results on TXS 0506+056 at 86 GHz and one additional 43 GHz image obtained 27 days after IC170922A, closer in time to the neutrino event than previously published images. We also give an overview about our recent work on PKS 1502+106 and PKS 0215+015.
#### Predicting gravitational waves from jittering-jets-driven core collapse  supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 I estimate the frequencies of gravitational waves from jittering jets that explode core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to crudely be 5-30 Hz, and with strains that might allow detection of Galactic CCSNe. The jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) asserts that most CCSNe are exploded by jittering jets that the newly born neutron star (NS) launches within few seconds. According to the JJEM, instabilities in the accreted gas lead to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch the jittering jets. Earlier studies that did not include jets calculated the gravitational frequencies that instabilities around the NS emit to have a peak in the crude frequency range of 100-2000 Hz. Based on a recent study, I take the source of the gravitational waves of jittering jets to be the turbulent bubbles (cocoons) that the jets inflate as they interact with the outer layers of the core of the star at thousands of kilometres from the NS. The lower frequencies and larger strain than those of gravitational waves from instabilities in CCSNe allow future, and maybe present, detectors to identify the gravitational wave signals of jittering jets. Detection of gravitational waves from local CCSNe might distinguish between the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and the JJEM.
#### A time variability test for neutrino sources identified by IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has reported evidence for neutrino emission from the Seyfert-II galaxy NGC 1068 and the blazar TXS 0506+056. The former was identified in a time-integrated search, and the latter using time-dependent and multi-messenger methods. A natural question is: are sources identified in time-integrated searches consistent with a steady neutrino source? We present a non-parametric method, TAUNTON, to answer this question. Motivated by the Cram\'er-von Mises test, TAUNTON is an unbinned single-hypothesis method to identify deviations in neutrino data from the steady hypothesis. An advantage of TAUNTON is that it is sensitive to arbitrary deviations from the steady hypothesis. Here we present results of TAUNTON applied to a 8.7 year data-set of muon neutrino track events; the same data used to identify NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$. We use TAUNTON on 51 objects, a subset (with >4 signal neutrinos) of the 110 objects studied in the NGC 1068 publication. We set a threshold of 3$\sigma$ pre-trial to identify sources inconsistent with the steady hypothesis. TAUNTON reports a p-value of 0.9 for NGC 1068, consistent with the steady hypothesis. Using the time integrated fit, data for TXS 0506+056 is consistent with the steady hypothesis at 1.7$\sigma$. Time variability is not identified for TXS 0506+056 because there are few neutrino events.
