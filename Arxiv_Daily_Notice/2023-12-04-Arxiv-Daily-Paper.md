 - **Abstract**
 A critically important process affecting the climate evolution and potential habitability of an exoplanet is atmospheric escape, in which high-energy radiation from a star drives the escape of hydrogen atoms and other light elements from a planet's atmosphere. L 98-59 is a benchmark system for studying such atmospheric processes, with three transiting terrestrial-size planets receiving Venus-like instellations (4-25 S$_\oplus$) from their M3 host star. We use the VPLanet model to simulate the evolution of the L 98-59 system and the atmospheric escape of its inner three small planets, given different assumed initial water quantities. We find that, regardless of their initial water content, all three planets accumulate significant quantities of oxygen due to efficient water photolysis and hydrogen loss. All three planets also receive enough XUV flux to drive rapid water loss, which considerably affects their developing climates and atmospheres. Even in scenarios of low initial water content, our results suggest that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sensitive to observations of retained oxygen on the L 98-59 planets in its future scheduled observations, with planets b and c being the most likely targets to possess an extended atmosphere. Our results constrain the atmospheric evolution of these small rocky planets, and they provide context for current and future observations of the L 98-59 system to generalize our understanding of multi-terrestrial planet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 According to a standard initial mass function, stars in the range 7-12 Msun constitute ~50% (by number) of the stars more massive than ~7 Msun, but, in spite of this, their evolutionary properties, and in particular their final fate, are still scarcely studied. In this paper we present a detailed study of the evolutionary properties of solar metallicity, non rotating stars in the range 7-15 Msun, from the pre main sequence phase up to the presupernova stage or up to an advanced stage of the thermally pulsing phase, depending on the initial mass. We find that (1) the 7.00 Msun develops a degenerate CO core and evolves as a classical AGB star in the sense that it does not ignite the C burning reactions; (2) stars with the initial mass M >= 9.22 Msun end their life as core collapse supernovae; (3) stars in the range 7.50 <= M/Msun <= 9.20 develop a degenerate ONeMg core and evolve through the thermally pulsing SAGB phase; 4) stars in the mass range 7.50 <= M/Msun <= 8.00 end their life as hybrid CO/ONeMg- or ONeMg- WD; (5) stars with the initial mass in the range 8.50 <= M/Msun <= 9.20 may potentially explode as electron capture supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The intergalactic helium became fully ionized by the end of cosmic noon ($z\sim2$). Similarly to the reionization of hydrogen, helium reionization is expected to be patchy, driven by luminous quasars that ionize the intergalactic gas in their surrounding environment. Probing the morphology of ionized electrons during this epoch can provide crucial information about early structure formation, including the clustering and luminosities of quasars, the accretion rates, variability, and lifetimes of active galactic nuclei, as well as the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. In this study, we present how measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to reconstruct the optical-depth fluctuations resulting from patchy helium reionization. As helium reionization occurred at lower redshifts, upcoming probes of large-scale structure surveys will present a significant opportunity to enhance the prospects of probing this epoch by their combined analysis with the CMB. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of hydrogen and helium reionization, we show that near-future galaxy and CMB surveys will have enough statistical power to detect optical-depth fluctuations due to doubly-ionized helium, providing a way of measuring the redshift and duration of helium reionization to high significance. We also show that modeling uncertainties in helium reionization can impact the measurement precision of parameters characterizing hydrogen reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar physics community is entering a golden era that is ripe with next-generation ground- and space-based facilities. With ever-increasing resolving power stemming from the newest observational telescopes, it becomes more challenging to obtain (near-)simultaneous measurements at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions, while operating at the diffraction limit of these new facilities. Hence, in recent years there has been increased interest in the capabilities integral field units (IFUs) offer towards obtaining the trifecta of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions contemporaneously. To date, IFUs developed for solar physics research have focused on mid-optical and infrared measurements. Here, we present an IFU prototype that has been designed for operation within the near-ultraviolet to mid-optical wavelength range, hence providing additional spectral coverage to the instrument suites developed to date. The IFU was constructed as a low-budget proof-of-concept for the upcoming 2m class Indian National Large Solar Telescope and employs circular cross-section fibres to guide light into a Czerny-Turner configuration spectrograph, with the resulting spectra captured using a high quantum efficiency scientific CMOS camera. Mapping of each input fibre allows for the reconstruction of two-dimensional spectral images, with frame rates exceeding 20 per second possible while operating in a non-polarimetric configuration. The science verification data presented here highlights the suitability of fibre-fed IFUs operating at near-ultraviolet wavelengths for solar physics research. Importantly, the successful demonstration of this type of instrument paves the way for further technological developments to make a future variant suitable for upcoming ground-based and space-borne telescope facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array have the potential to unlock scientific discoveries thanks to their unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. One key to unlocking their potential resides in handling the deluge and complexity of incoming data. This challenge requires building radio interferometric imaging methods that can cope with the massive data sizes and provide high-quality image reconstructions with uncertainty quantification (UQ). This work proposes a method coined QuantifAI to address UQ in radio-interferometric imaging with data-driven (learned) priors for high-dimensional settings. Our model, rooted in the Bayesian framework, uses a physically motivated model for the likelihood. The model exploits a data-driven convex prior, which can encode complex information learned implicitly from simulations and guarantee the log-concavity of the posterior. We leverage probability concentration phenomena of high-dimensional log-concave posteriors that let us obtain information about the posterior, avoiding MCMC sampling techniques. We rely on convex optimisation methods to compute the MAP estimation, which is known to be faster and better scale with dimension than MCMC sampling strategies. Our method allows us to compute local credible intervals, i.e., Bayesian error bars, and perform hypothesis testing of structure on the reconstructed image. In addition, we propose a novel blazing-fast method to compute pixel-wise uncertainties at different scales. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing radio-interferometric images in a simulated setting and carrying out fast and scalable UQ, which we validate with MCMC sampling. Our method shows an improved image quality and more meaningful uncertainties than the benchmark method based on a sparsity-promoting prior.

 - **Abstract**
 We present here broadband radio observations of the CSM interacting SN2019oys. SN2019oys was first detected in the optical and was classified as a Type Ib SN. Then, about $\sim 100$ days after discovery, it showed an optical rebrightening and a spectral transition to a spectrum dominated by strong narrow emission lines, which suggests strong interaction with a distant, dense, CSM shell. We modeled the broadband, multi-epoch, radio spectra, covering 2.2 to 36 GHz and spanning from 22 to 1425 days after optical discovery, as a synchrotron emitting source. Using this modeling we characterized the shockwave and the mass-loss rate of the progenitor. Our broadband radio observations show strong synchrotron emission. This emission, as observed 201 and 221 days after optical discovery, exhibits signs of free-free absorption from the material in front of the shock traveling in the CSM. In addition, the steep power law of the optically thin regime points towards synchrotron cooling of the radiating electrons. Analyzing these spectra in the context of the SN-CSM interaction model gives a shock velocity of 14,000 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$, and an electron number density of $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \rm cm^{-3}$ at a distance of $2.6 \times 10^{16}$ cm. This translates to a high mass-loss rate from the progenitor massive star of $6.7 \times 10^{-4} \, \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ for an assumed wind of 100 $\rm km s^{-1}$ (assuming constant mass-loss rate in steady winds). The late-time radio spectra, 392 and 557 days after optical discovery, are showing broad spectral peaks. We show that this can be explained by introducing a non-homogeneous CSM structure.
#### $\texttt{tdescore}$: An Accurate Photometric Classifier for Tidal  Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 Optical surveys have become increasingly adept at identifying candidate Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in large numbers, but classifying these generally requires extensive spectroscopic resources. We here present $\texttt{tdescore}$, a simple photometric classifier that is trained using a systematic census of $\sim$3000 nuclear transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The sample is highly imbalanced, with TDEs representing $<$2% of the total. $\texttt{tdescore}$ is nonetheless able to reject non-TDEs with 99.6% accuracy, yielding a sample of probable TDEs with completeness of 77.0% and a purity of 80.3%. $\texttt{tdescore}$ is thus substantially better than any available TDE photometric classifier scheme in the literature, and performs comparably well to the single-epoch spectroscopy as a method for classifying ZTF nuclear transients, despite relying solely on ZTF data and multi-wavelength catalogue crossmatching. In a novel extension, we use 'SHapley Additive exPlanations' (SHAP) to provide a human-readable justification for each individual $\texttt{tdescore}$ classification, enabling users to understand and form opinions about the underlying classifier reasoning. $\texttt{tdescore}$ serves as a model for photometric identification of TDEs with time-domain surveys, such as the upcoming Rubin observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution $K$-band emission spectra of the quintessential hot Jupiter HD 189733 b from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC). Using a Bayesian retrieval framework, we fit the dayside pressure-temperature profile, orbital kinematics, mass-mixing ratios of H$_2$O, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, HCN, and H$_2$S, and the $\rm ^{13}CO/^{12}CO$ ratio. We measure mass fractions of $\rm \log H_2O = -2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ and $\rm \log CO = -2.2^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$, and place upper limits on the remaining species. Notably, we find $\rm \log CH_4 < -4.5$ at 99\% confidence, despite its anticipated presence at the equilibrium temperature of HD 189733 b assuming local thermal equilibrium. We make a tentative ($\sim3\sigma$) detection of $\rm ^{13}CO$, and the retrieved posteriors suggest a $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio similar to or substantially less than the local interstellar value. The possible $\rm ^{13}C$ enrichment would be consistent with accretion of fractionated material in ices or in the protoplanetary disk midplane. The retrieved abundances correspond to a substantially sub-stellar atmospheric $\rm C/O = 0.3\pm0.1$, while the carbon and oxygen abundances are stellar to slightly super-stellar, consistent with core-accretion models which predict an inverse correlation between C/O and metallicity. The specific combination of low C/O and high metallicity suggests significant accretion of solid material may have occurred late in the formation process of HD 189733 b.

 - **Abstract**
 The classification of variable objects provides insight into a wide variety of astrophysics ranging from stellar interiors to galactic nuclei. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) provides time series observations that record the variability of more than a billion sources. The scale of these data necessitates automated approaches to make a thorough analysis. Building on previous work, this paper reports the results of the ZTF Source Classification Project (SCoPe), which trains neural network and XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithms to perform dichotomous classification of variable ZTF sources using a manually constructed training set containing 170,632 light curves. We find that several classifiers achieve high precision and recall scores, suggesting the reliability of their predictions for 112,476,749 light curves across 40 ZTF fields. We also identify the most important features for XGB classification and compare the performance of the two ML algorithms, finding a pattern of higher precision among XGB classifiers. The resulting classification catalog is available to the public, and the software developed for SCoPe is open-source and adaptable to future time-domain surveys.
#### Spectroastrometry and Imaging Science with Photonic Lanterns on  Extremely Large Telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 Photonic lanterns (PLs) are tapered waveguides that gradually transition from a multi-mode fiber geometry to a bundle of single-mode fibers. In astronomical applications, PLs can efficiently couple multi-mode telescope light into a multi-mode fiber entrance and convert it into multiple single-mode beams. The output beams are highly stable and suitable for feeding into high-resolution spectrographs or photonic chip beam combiners. For instance, by using relative intensities in the output cores as a function of wavelength, PLs can enable spectroastrometry. In addition, by interfering beams in the output cores with a beam combiner in the backend, PLs can be used for high-throughput interferometric imaging. When used on an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), with its increased sensitivity and angular resolution, the imaging and spectroastrometric capabilities of PLs will be extended to higher contrast and smaller angular scales. We study the potential spectroastrometry and imaging science cases of PLs on ELTs, including study of exomoons, broad-line regions of quasars, and inner circumstellar disks.
#### The IACOB project X. Large-scale quantitative spectroscopic analysis of  Galactic blue supergiants

 - **Abstract**
 Blue supergiants (BSGs) are key objects for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical observations have opened up important questions yet to be answered. Studying statistically significant and unbiased samples of BSGs can help to improve the situation. We aim to perform a homogeneous and comprehensive quantitative spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of Galactic BSGs from the IACOB spectroscopic database. We derive the projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$) and macroturbulent broadening ($v_{\rm mac}$) using IACOB-BROAD. We used FASTWIND computations to derive effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravities, microturbulences ($\xi$), Si and He surface abundances, and the wind-strength parameter. We provide estimates of the above-mentioned quantities for the largest sample of Galactic BSGs spectroscopically analyzed to date, comprising 538 O9-B5 type stars. We find a drop in the relative number of BSGs at ~21 kK, coinciding with a scarcity of fast rotating stars below that temperature. We speculate that this feature might be roughly delineating the location of the empirical Terminal-Age-Main-Sequence in the 15-85Msol range. By investigating the main characteristics of the $v\sin i$ distribution of O stars and BSGs as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$, we propose that an efficient mechanism transporting angular momentum from the stellar core to the surface might be operating along the main sequence. We find correlations between $\xi$, $v_{\rm mac}$ and the spectroscopic luminosity. We also find that no more than 20% of the BSGs have atmospheres enriched in He, and suggest that the origin of this specific sub-sample of BSGs might be in binary evolution. We do not find clear empirical evidence of an increase in the wind-strength over the wind bi-stability region towards lower $T_{\rm eff}$.
#### SN~2015da: Late-time observations of a persistent superluminous Type~IIn  supernova with post-shock dust formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00253
 - **Abstract**
 We present photometry and spectroscopy of the slowly evolving superluminous Type IIn SN2015da. SN2015da is extraordinary for its very high peak luminosity, and also for sustaining a high luminosity for several years. Even at 8\,yr after explosion, SN2015da remains as luminous as the peak of a normal SNII-P. The total radiated energy integrated over this time period (with no bolometric correction) is at least 1.6 FOE. Including a mild bolometric correction, adding kinetic energy of the expanding cold dense shell of swept-up circumstellar material (CSM), and accounting for asymmetry, the total explosion kinetic energy was likely 5-10 FOE. Powering the light curve with CSM interaction requires an energetic explosion and 20 Msun of H-rich CSM, which in turn implies a massive progenitor system above 30 Msun. Narrow P Cyg features show steady CSM expansion at 90 km/s, requiring a high average mass-loss rate of roughly 0.1 Msun/yr sustained for 2 centuries before explosion (although ramping up toward explosion time). No current theoretical model for single-star pre-SN mass loss can account for this. The slow CSM, combined with broad wings of H$\alpha$ indicating H-rich material in the unshocked ejecta, disfavor a pulsational pair instability model for the pre-SN mass loss. Instead, violent pre-SN binary interaction is a likely cuprit. Finally, SN2015da exhibits the characteristic asymmetric blueshift in its emission lines from shortly after peak until the present epoch, adding another well-studied superluminous SNeIIn with unambiguous evidence of post-shock dust formation.
#### Short Review of the main achievements of the Scalar Field, Fuzzy,  Ultralight, Wave, BEC Dark Matter model

 - **Abstract**
 The Scalar Field Dark Matter model has been known in various ways throughout its history; Fuzzy, BEC, Wave, Ultralight, Axion-like Dark Matter, etc. All of them consist in proposing that the dark matter of the universe is a spinless field $\Phi$ that follows the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation of motion $\Box\Phi-dV/d\Phi=0$, for a given scalar field potential $V$. The difference between different models is sometimes the choice of the scalar field potential $V$. In the literature we find that people usually work in the nonrelativistic, weak-field limit of the KG equation where it transforms into the Schr\"odinger equation and the Einstein equations into the Poisson equation, reducing the KG-Einstein system, to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system. In this paper, we review some of the most interesting achievements of this model from the historical point of view and its comparison with observations, showing that this model could be the last answer to the question about the nature of dark matter in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Large widefield surveys make possible the serendipitous discovery of rare sub-classes of pulsars. One such class are "spider"-type pulsar binaries, comprised of a pulsar in a compact orbit with a low-mass (sub)stellar companion. In a search for circularly-polarized radio sources in ASKAP Pilot Survey observations, we discovered highly variable and circularly polarized emission from a radio source within the error region of the $\gamma$-ray source {4FGL}~J1646.5$-$4406. The variability is consistent with the eclipse of a compact, steep-spectrum source behind ablated material from a companion in a $\sim 5.3\,$h binary orbit. Based on the eclipse properties and spatial coincidence with {4FGL} J1646.5$-$4406, we argue that the source is likely a recycled pulsar in a "redback" binary system. Using properties of the eclipses from ASKAP and Murchison Widefield Array observations, we provide broad constraints on the properties of the eclipse medium. We identified a potential optical/infra-red counterpart in archival data consistent with a variable low-mass star. Using the Parkes Radio Telescope "Murriyang" and MeerKAT, we searched extensively for radio pulsations but yielded no viable detections of pulsed emission. We suggest that the non-detection of pulses is due to scattering in the intra-binary material, but scattering from the ISM can also plausibly explain the pulse non-detections if the interstellar dispersion measure exceeds $\sim$600$\,$pc$\,$cm$^{-3}$. Orbital constraints derived from optical observations of the counterpart would be highly valuable for future $\gamma$-ray pulsation searches, which may confirm the source nature as a pulsar.
#### Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Weak-Lensing Mass Maps with a  Sparsity Prior. II. Weighing Triaxial Cluster Halos

 - **Abstract**
 Continuing work presented in Li et al. (2021), we performed a series of tests to our high-resolution three-dimensional mass map reconstruction algorithm \splinv{}. We test the mass reconstruction accuracy against realistic mock catalogs generated using shear field produced by triaxial halos with the inner density profile of $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ and of $\rho \propto r^{-1.5}$. The galaxy shape noise is modeled based on the Year-1 Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey. After reviewing mathematical details of our algorithm and dark matter halo models, we determine an optimal value of the coefficient of the adaptive LASSO regression penalty term for single halo reconstruction. We successfully measure halo masses for massive triaxial halos; the mass determination accuracy is 5 percent for halos with $M = 10^{14.6}~M_\odot$ at $0.0625\leq z \leq 0.2425$, and 5 percent for those with $10^{14.8}~M_\odot$ at $0.0625\leq z \leq 0.4675$, and 20 percent for $M= 10^{15.0} ~M_\odot$ and $M=10^{15.2}~M_\odot$ in the redshift range $0.0625\leq z \leq 0.4675$. The redshift estimate accuracy is consistently below $\Delta z /z \leq 0.05$ for the above halo masses in the range $0.1525\leq z \leq 0.4675$. We also demonstrate that the orientation of triaxial halos and systematic error in our halo model do not affect reconstruction result significantly. Finally, we present results from reconstruction of mass distribution using shear catalogs produced by multiple halos, to show \splinv{}'s capability using realistic shear maps from ongoing and future galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The probability that the primordial black hole (PBH) binaries formed in the early Universe can be affected by the Hubble expansion of background, which is non-negligible when the number density of PBHs is very low (it is actually this case for supermassive PBHs). In this paper, taking into account the effect of cosmic expansion on the comoving distance of PBH pairs, we worked out the merger rate of PBHs with any extended mass function. The torques by all PBHs and linear density perturbations are also considered. It is found that the merger rate of PBH, $M\gtrsim 10^6M_\odot$, binaries is significantly lower for $f_\text{pbh}\lesssim 0.01$ than expected.

 In contrast to our understanding of density field tracers, the modelling of direct statistics pertaining to the cosmic velocity field remains open to significant opportunities for improvement. The lack of accurate modelling for the non-linear domain of pairwise velocities restricts our capacity to fully exploit the information encoded in this observable. We present a robust approach for modelling the mean infall velocities, $v_{12}(r,a)$, with broad applicability spanning sub-megaparsec scales and cosmologies extending beyond the standard LCDM paradigm. Our approach involves solving the full pair-conservation equation using accurate non-linear power spectrum descriptions. To assess the robustness of our model, we extend it to cosmologies beyond the standard LCDM, in particular, the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$-gravity and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) modified gravity models. Remarkably, our predictions for pairwise velocities of dark matter particles at kilo-parsec scales exhibit excellent agreement with N-body simulations throughout the entire dynamical range ($0.1 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 1000$, or $r\geq0.4$Mpc/h). Furthermore, we show that different gravity models leave distinct signatures in the shape and dynamics of the mean pairwise velocities, providing a potent test of cosmological gravity laws.

 - **Abstract**
 Some ideas for onboard processing and photometry with an astrometry satellite are presented, especially designed for GaiaNIR which may be launched about 2045 as a successor of Gaia. - Increased sensitivity, reduced image overlap, and simpler PSF calibration in GaiaNIR will result if the proposed initial processing of data from the detectors is implemented, because the across-scan smearing will become insignificant. - Filter photometry is required for high angular resolution as needed for astrometric and astrophysical reasons. Low-dispersion spectra are questioned because they fail at high star density. This will be a much greater problem with GaiaNIR than it is with Gaia because of the larger number of stars expected. It was the aim to collect in this note all arguments about GaiaNIR photometry which can be stated with words only, in correspondence with readers. The remaining work to be done for the definition of photometric equipment on the satellite requires further quantitative assessments and comparison of various options. Finally, 1) an advantage of filters is that the photometric observations can also be used for astrometry, 2) the XP spectra in Gaia will give very good astrophysical data for about 400 million single stars with G <~ 18.5 mag, but filters would have been better for all fainter and for all multiple stars, and 3) it is presently not clear which advantages for astrophysics low-dispersion spectra in the NIR might have over filters.

 - **Abstract**
 In July 2021, faculty from the UAlbany Department of Physics participated in a week-long field expedition with the organization UAPx to collect data on UAPs in Avalon, California, located on Catalina Island, and nearby. This paper reviews both the hardware and software techniques which this collaboration employed, and contains a frank discussion of the successes and failures, with a section about how to apply lessons learned to future expeditions. Both observable-light and infrared cameras were deployed, as well as sensors for other (non-EM) emissions. A pixel-subtraction method was augmented with other similarly simple methods to provide initial identification of objects in the sky and/or the sea crossing the cameras' fields of view. The first results will be presented based upon approximately one hour in total of triggered visible/night-vision-mode video and over 600 hours of untriggered (far) IR video recorded, as well as 55 hours of (background) radiation measurements. Following multiple explanatory resolutions of several ambiguities that were potentially anomalous at first, we focus on the primary remaining ambiguity captured at approximately 4am Pacific Time on Friday, July 16: a dark spot in the visible/near-IR camera possibly coincident with ionizing radiation that has thus far resisted a prosaic explanation. We conclude with quantitative suggestions for serious researchers in this still-nascent field of hard-science-based UAP studies, with an ultimate goal of identifying UAPs without confirmation bias toward either mundane or speculative conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to the mid-infrared capability offered by Spitzer, systematic searches of dust in SNe have been carried out over the past decade. Studies have revealed the presence of a substantial amount of dust over a broad range of SN subtypes. How normal SNe present mid-IR excess at later time and turn out to be dusty SNe can be affected by several factors, such as mass-loss history and envelope structure of progenitors and their explosion environment. All these can be combined and related to their environmental properties. A systematic analysis of SNe that exploded under a dusty environment could be of critical importance to measure the properties of the dust-veiled exploding stars, and whether such an intense dust production process is associated with the local environment. In this work, we firstly use the IFS data to study the environmental properties of dusty SNe compared to those of normal ones, and analyze correlations between the environmental properties and their dust parameters. We find that dusty SNe have a larger proportion located at higher SFR regions compared to the normal types. The occurrence of dusty SNe is less dependent on metallicity, with the oxygen abundance spanning from subsolar to oversolar metallicity. We also find the host extinction of dusty SNe scatters a lot, with about 40% of dusty SN located at extremely low extinction environments, and another 30% of them with considerably high host extinction of E(B-V)>0.6 mag.
