#### Analyzing Variation in Phase Delays Across Phase Plates With a  Quadrature Polarization Interferometer

 - **Abstract**
 In order for telescopes to obtain good and precise images they need to see through atmospheric turbulence. To accomplish this and compensate for atmospheric turbulence we use Adaptive Optics technologies. In this thesis we analyze the variations in phase delays across phase plates which simulate atmospheric turbulence in order to characterize them and determine how well these phase plates reproduce the phase delay variation of the atmosphere. This experiment was conducted using the Quadrature Polarization Interferometer (QPI) testbed in the Lab of Adaptive Optics (LAO) at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC). Using the QPI lab setup allowed us to be able to develop and refine a final algorithm for determining the phase delay of the phase plates. The characterization of the phase plates was accomplished by using the interference patterns between a test and reference path and measuring their pathlength variations. This was achieved by calculating the intensity of the two paths of the Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser, modifying those values in order to obtain phase values between the beam, and from the phase values we are able to determine the path length variations, or phase delays, of the phase plates. This allows us to determine Fried's parameter, $r_o$, by analyzing any given separation on the phase plate and determining the path length variations between those separations.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter self-interactions may have the capability to solve or at least mitigate small-scale problems of the cosmological standard model, {\Lambda}CDM. There are a variety of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models that lead to distinguishable astrophysical predictions and hence varying success in explaining observations. Studies of dark matter (DM) density cores on various mass scales suggest a velocity-dependent scattering cross-section. In this work we investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM distribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the velocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively different using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density profile of idealised DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to larger core sizes and different time scales of core formation and core collapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of velocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range of $\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites, density and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between velocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between frequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent cross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves, independent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section. We further find that the abundance of satellites in general depends on both the velocity dependence and the scattering angle, although the latter is less important for strongly velocity-dependent cross-sections.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the SDSS/APOGEE Value Added Catalogue of Galactic Globular Cluster (GC) Stars. The catalogue is the result of a critical search of the APOGEE data release 17 (DR17) catalogue for candidate members of all known Galactic GCs. Candidate members are assigned to various GCs on the basis of position on the sky, proper motion, and radial velocity. The catalogue contains a total of 7,737 entries for 6,422 unique stars associated with 72 Galactic GCs. Full APOGEE DR17 information is provided, including radial velocities and abundances for up to 20 elements. Membership probabilities estimated on the basis of precision radial velocities are made available. Comparisons with chemical compositions derived by the GALAH survey, as well as optical values from the literature, show good agreement. This catalogue represents a significant increase in the public database of GC star chemical compositions and kinematics, providing a massive homogeneous data set that will enable a variety of studies. The catalogue in fits format is available for public download from the SDSS-IV DR17 value added catalogue website.

 - **Abstract**
 Confronting measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations has produced stringent constraints on models of particle dark matter and the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium. We investigate the robustness of such models of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, focussing on the effect of particle initial conditions on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest statistics in cosmological SPH simulations. We study multiple particle initialization algorithms in simulations that are designed to be identical in other respects. In agreement with the literature, we find that the correct linear theory evolution is obtained when a glass-like configuration is used for initial unperturbed gas particle positions alongside a regular grid configuration for dark matter particles and the use of non-identical initial density perturbations for gas and dark matter. However, we report that this introduces a large scale-dependent distortion in the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission power spectrum at small scales ($k > 0.05$s/km). The effect is close to $50\%$ at $k\sim 0.1$s/km, and persists at higher resolution. This can severely bias inferences in parameters such as the dark matter particle mass. By considering multiple initial conditions codes and their variations, we also study the impact of a variety of other assumptions and algorithmic choices, such as adaptive softening, background radiation density, particle staggering, and perturbation theory accuracy, on the matter power spectrum, the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux PDF. This work reveals possible pathways towards more accurate theoretical models of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to match the quality of upcoming measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes are the remnants of massive star explosions. Most massive stars reside in close binary systems, and the interplay between the companion star and the newly formed compact object has been theoretically explored, but signatures for binarity or evidence for the formation of a compact object during a supernova explosion are still lacking. Here we report a stripped-envelope supernova, SN 2022jli, which shows 12.4-day periodic undulations during the declining light curve. Narrow H$\alpha$ emission is detected in late-time spectra with concordant periodic velocity shifts, likely arising from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the compact remnant. A new Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray source is temporally and positionally consistent with SN 2022jli. The observed properties of SN 2022jli, including periodic undulations in the optical light curve, coherent H$\alpha$ emission shifting, and evidence for association with a $\gamma$-ray source, point to the explosion of a massive star in a binary system leaving behind a bound compact remnant. Mass accretion from the companion star onto the compact object powers the light curve of the supernova and generates the $\gamma$-ray emission.
#### Three Dimensional Natures of Massive Star Envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 We review our current understanding on the outer envelope structures of massive stars based on three dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We briefly summarize the fundamental issues to construct hydrostatic one dimensional (1D) stellar evolution models when stellar luminosity approaches the Eddington value. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations in 3D covering the mass range from $13M_{\odot}$ to $80M_{\odot}$ always find a dynamic envelope structure with the time-averaged radial profiles matching 1D models with an adjusted mixing length parameter when convection is subsonic. Supersonic turbulence and episodic mass loss are generally found in 3D models when stellar luminosity is super-Eddington locally due to the opacity peaks and convection is inefficient. Turbulent pressure plays an important role in supporting the outer envelope, which makes the photosphere more extended than predictions from 1D models. Massive star lightcurves are always found to vary with a characteristic timescale consistent with the thermal time scale at the location of the iron opacity peak. The amplitude of the variability as well as the power spectrum can explain the commonly observed stochastic low frequency variability of mass stars observed by TESS over a wide range of parameters in the HR diagram. The 3D simulations can also explain the ubiquitous macro-turbulence that is needed for spectroscopic fitting in massive stars. Implications of the 3D simulations for improving 1D stellar evolution models are also discussed.
#### A rotating accretion disk around MWC297, a young B1.5 Ve star

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution spectra with iSHELL on IRTF in the K and M band of the young, heavily accreting B 1.5e star MWC297 show numerous double-peaked CO lines. These CO lines originate in an inclined gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation. MWC297 is the only early B star known to show a Keplerian disk in CO. Analysis of the spectra show that 12CO 1 - 0 is optically thick for the low excitation lines. Even the 13CO 1 - 0 and 12CO 2 - 1 have somewhat optically thick lines at low J levels. We find that the CO emission in the disk can be fitted with CO being in a narrow ring at a radius of 12 AU, with a temperature of 1500 K, and a CO column density of 1.6 e18 cm-2. This model underestimates the line strength of high J lines, indicating that they are excited by fluorescence. The CO overtone lines have a similar temperature, The 13CO lines are much brighter than expected from interstellar isotope ratios. The 13CO lines are wider than the 12CO ones suggesting different excitation conditions. The same is true for 12CO 2 - 1. We see strong absorption in 12CO and 13CO 1 - 0 at low J levels, which is due to two two cold foreground clouds. These clouds, one with a temperature of 8.3 K and a column density of 6.7 e17 cm-2, and the other one colder and with lower column density, can fully account for the observed extinction toward MWC297.
#### The Pristine survey -- XXII. A serendipitous discovery of an extremely  Li-rich very metal-poor giant and a new method of $^6$Li/$^7$Li isotope  measurement

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a very metal-poor (VMP) Li-rich giant star ($T_{\rm eff}$ = 4690$\pm$80 K, log g = 1.34$\pm$0.13, [Fe/H] = $-2.43\pm$0.07). We analyse the Li I 6103 and 6707 \r{A} lines accounting for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) and correcting for 3D effects using literature data, which yields a lithium abundance $\log\varepsilon_{Li} = 3.42\pm0.07$. Comparing lithium abundances from the two lines, in 1D NLTE we measure the isotope ratio $^6$Li/$^7$Li = 1.64$^{+1.49}_{-1.08}$ %. When correcting for 3D effects, we detect the fragile $^6$Li isotope at $2$-sigma level and the ratio $^6$Li/$^7$Li = 5.65$^{+5.05}_{-2.51}$ %. To our knowledge, this is the first $^6$Li/$^7$Li measurement in an extremely Li-rich VMP star. The Cameron-Fowler mechanism, which is proposed to produce Li-rich stars, does not imply $^6$Li production and is therefore inconsistent with our measurement when applying 3D corrections. We also derive NLTE abundances for 16 elements, most of which show similar abundances to those found in VMP stars. Sodium is an exception: [Na/Fe]$_{\rm NLTE, 1D}$ = 0.07 $\pm 0.03$, which is 0.5 dex higher than what is typical for VMP stars. This star joins the sample of rare Li-rich VMP stars, and we offer a novel way to constrain the source of lithium in such stars through isotope ratio measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 While secondary mass inferences based on single-lined spectroscopic binary (SB1) solutions are subject to $\sin{i}$ degeneracies, this degeneracy can be lifted through the observations of eclipses. We combine the subset of Gaia Data Release (DR) 3 SB1 solutions consistent with brown dwarf-mass secondaries with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Object of Interest (TOI) list to identify three candidate transiting brown dwarf systems. Ground-based precision radial velocity follow-up observations confirm that TOI-2533.01 is a transiting brown dwarf with $M=72^{+3}_{-3}~M_{\text{Jup}}= 0.069^{+0.003}_{-0.003}~M_\odot$ orbiting TYC 2010-124-1 and that TOI-5427.01 is a transiting very low-mass star with $M=93^{+2}_{-2}~M_{\text{Jup}}=0.088^{+0.002}_{-0.002}~M_\odot$ orbiting UCAC4 515-012898. We validate TOI-1712.01 as a very low-mass star with $M=82^{+7}_{-7}~M_{\text{Jup}}=0.079^{+0.007}_{-0.007}~M_\odot$ transiting the primary in the hierarchical triple system BD+45 1593. Even after accounting for third light, TOI-1712.01 has radius nearly a factor of two larger than predicted for isolated stars with similar properties. We propose that the intense instellation experienced by TOI-1712.01 diminishes the temperature gradient near its surface, suppresses convection, and leads to its inflated radius. Our analyses verify Gaia DR3 SB1 solutions in the low Doppler semiamplitude limit, thereby providing the foundation for future joint analyses of Gaia radial velocities and Kepler, K2, TESS, and PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations (PLATO) light curves for the characterization of transiting massive brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive air showers induced from high-energy cosmic rays provide a window into understanding the most energetic phenomena in the universe. We present a new method for observing these showers using the silicon imaging detector Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). This method has the advantage of being able to measure individual secondary particles. When paired with a surface detector array, silicon imaging detectors like Subaru HSC will be useful for studying the properties of extensive air showers in detail. The following report outlines the first results of observing extensive air showers with Subaru HSC. The potential for reconstructing the incident direction of primary cosmic rays is demonstrated and possible interdisciplinary applications are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The signal to noise ratio efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ in axion dark matter searches has been estimated using large-statistic simulation data reflecting the background information and the expected axion signal power obtained from a real experiment. This usually requires a lot of computing time even with the assistance of powerful computing resources. Employing a Savitzky-Golay filter for background subtraction, in this work, we estimated a fully analytical $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ without relying on large-statistic simulation data, but only with an arbitrary axion mass and the relevant signal shape information. Hence, our work can provide $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ using minimal computing time and resources prior to the acquisition of experimental data, without the detailed information that has to be obtained from real experiments. Axion haloscope searches have been observing the coincidence that the frequency independent scale factor $\xi$ is approximately consistent with the $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$. This was confirmed analytically in this work, when the window length of the Savitzky-Golay filter is reasonably wide enough, i.e., at least 5 times the signal window.
#### An improved dynamical Poisson equation solver for self-gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Since self-gravity is crucial in the structure formation of the universe, many hydrodynamics simulations with the effect of self-gravity have been conducted. The multigrid method is widely used as a solver for the Poisson equation of the self-gravity; however, the parallelization efficiency of the multigrid method becomes worse when we use a massively parallel computer, and it becomes inefficient with more than $10^4$ cores, even for highly tuned codes. To perform large-scale parallel simulations ($> 10^4$ cores), developing a new gravity solver with good parallelization efficiency is beneficial. In this article, we develop a new self-gravity solver using the telegraph equation with a damping coefficient, $\kappa$. Parallelization is much easier than the case of the elliptic Poisson equation since the telegraph equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation. We analyze convergence tests of our telegraph equations solver and determine that the best non-dimensional damping coefficient of the telegraph equations is $\tilde{\kappa} \simeq 2.5$. We also show that our method can maintain high parallelization efficiency even for massively parallel computations due to the hyperbolic nature of the telegraphic equation by weak-scaling tests. If the time step of the calculation is determined by heating/cooling or chemical reactions, rather than the CFL condition, our method may provide the method for calculating self-gravity faster than other previously known methods such as the fast Fourier transform and multigrid iteration solvers because gravitational phase velocity determined by the CFL condition using these timescales is much larger than the fluid velocity plus sound speed.
#### Collisional excitation of PO$^+$ by $para$-H$_2$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the derivation of rate coefficients for the rotational (de-)excitation of PO$^+$ induced by collisions with H$_2$. The calculations were performed on a four-dimensional potential energy surface, obtained on top of highly accurate $ab$ $initio$ energy points. Preliminary tests pointed out the low influence of the coupling between $j=0$ and the higher rotational levels of H$_2$ on the cross sections values, thus allowing to neglect the rotational structure of H$_2$. On this basis, state-to-state collisional rate coefficients were derived for temperatures ranging from 5 to 200 K. Radiative transfer calculations have been used to model the recent observation of PO$^+$ in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, in order to evaluate the possible impact of non-LTE models on the determination of its physical conditions. The derived column density was found to be approximately $\sim 3.7\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is 60\% (a factor of $\sim 1.7$) smaller than the previously LTE-derived value. Extensive simulations show that PO$^+$ low-$j$ rotational lines exhibit maser behavior at densities between $10^4$ and $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, thus highlighting the importance of a proper treatment of the molecular collisions to accurately model PO$^+$ emissions in the interstellar medium.
#### An SiO Toroid and Wide-angle Outflow associated with the Massive  Protostar W75N(B)-VLA2

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out ALMA observations of the massive star-forming region W75N(B), which contains the massive protostars VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. Particularly, VLA2 is an enigmatic protostar associated with a wind-driven H$_2$O maser shell, which has evolved from an almost isotropic outflow to a collimated one in just 20 years. The shell expansion seemed to be halted by an obstacle located to the northeast of VLA2. Here we present our findings from observing the 1.3~mm continuum and H$_2$CO and SiO emission lines. Within a region of ~30" (~39,000 au) diameter, we have detected 40 compact mm-continuum sources, three of them coinciding with VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. While the H$_2$CO emission is mainly distributed in a fragmented structure around the three massive protostars, but without any of the main H$_2$CO clumps spatially coinciding with them, the SiO is highly concentrated on VLA2, indicating the presence of very strong shocks generated near this protostar. The SiO emission is clearly resolved into an elongated structure (~ 0.6"*0.3"; ~780 au * 390 au) perpendicular to the major axis of the wind-driven maser shell. The structure and kinematics of the SiO emission are consistent with a toroid and a wide-angle outflow surrounding a central mass of ~10 Msun, thus supporting previous theoretical predictions regarding the evolution of the outflow. Additionally, we have identified the expected location and estimated the gas density of the obstacle that is hindering the expansion of the maser shell.
#### Time-Variable Diffuse $γ$-ray Foreground

 - **Abstract**
 While the data analysis of $\gamma$-ray telescopes has now become more robust, some signals may be misinterpretations of a time-variable foreground emission from the Solar System, induced by low-energy cosmic-ray interactions with asteroids. Our goal is to provide emission templates for this time-variable diffuse $\gamma$-ray foreground by considering the populations of Main Belt Asteroids, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, Kuiper Belt Objects, and the Oort Cloud. We model the spatial distribution of all known asteroids by performing 3D-fits to determine their density profiles and calculate their appearances by line-of-sight integrations. Because Earth and the asteroids are moving with respect to each other, we obtain diffuse emission templates varying on timescales of days to decades. We find that the temporal variability can lead to flux enhancements which may mimic emission features unless properly taken into account. This variation is further enhanced by the Solar cycle as the cosmic-ray spectrum is attenuated by the Solar modulation potential, leading to a relative flux increase of the outer asteroids. The cumulative effect of the time-dependent emission is illustrated for the case of the 511 keV OSSE fountain, and for emission features near the Galactic Centre, both being possible misinterpretations of the Solar System albedo. We recommend that $\gamma$-ray data analyses should always take into account the possibility of a time-variable foreground. Due to the ecliptic overlap with the Galactic plane, the Galactic emission is expected to be weaker by 0.1-20%, depending on time (relative planetary motion), energy, and Solar cycle, which has immense consequences for the interpretation of dark matter annihilation cross sections, cosmic-ray spectra and amplitudes, as well as nucleosynthesis yields and related parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Type II radio bursts are solar radio burst associated with coronal shocks. Type II bursts usually exhibit fine structures in dynamic spectra that represent signatures of accelerated electron beams. So far, the sources of individual fine structures in type II bursts have not been spatially resolved in high-resolution low-frequency radio imaging. Aims. The objective of this study is to resolve the radio sources of the herringbone bursts found in type II solar radio bursts and investigate the properties of the acceleration regions in coronal shocks Methods. We use low-frequency interferometric imaging observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to provide a spatially resolved analysis for three herringbone groups (marked as A, B, and C) in a type II radio burst that occurred on 2015 October 16th. Results. The herringbones in groups A and C have a undiversified frequency drift direction and propagation direction along frequency. They have similar value of frequency drift rates corresponding to that of type III bursts and previously studied herringbones. Group B has a more complex spatial distribution, with two distinct sources separated by 50 arcsec and no clear spatial propagation with frequency. One of the herringbones in group B was found to have an exceptionally large frequency drift rate. Conclusions. The characteristics deroved from imaging spectroscopy suggest that the studied herringbones originate from different processes. The herringbone groups A and C most likely originate from single-direction beam electrons, while group B may be explained by counterstreaming beam electrons

 - **Abstract**
 Compositional convection is atmospheric mixing driven by density variations caused by compositional gradients. Previous studies have suggested that compositional gradients of atmospheric trace species within planetary atmospheres can impact convection and the final atmospheric temperature profile. In this work, we employ 3D convection resolving simulations using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to gain a fundamental understanding of how compositional variation influences convection and the final atmospheric state of exoplanet atmospheres. We perform 3D initial value problem simulations of non-condensing compositional convection for Earth-Air, $\rm H_2$, and $\rm CO_2$ atmospheres. Conventionally, atmospheric convection is assumed to mix the atmosphere to a final, marginally stable state defined by a unique temperature profile. However, when there is compositional variation within an atmosphere, a continuous family of stable end states is possible, differing in the final state composition profile. Our CM1 simulations are used to determine which of the family of possible compositional end states is selected. Leveraging the results from our CM1 simulations, we develop a dry convective adjustment scheme for use in General Circulation Models (GCMs). This scheme relies on an energy analysis to determine the final adjusted atmospheric state. Our convection scheme produces results that agree with our CM1 simulations and can easily be implemented in GCMs to improve modelling of compositional convection in exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 A gamma-ray burst, named GRB 221009A, occurred on 9 October 2022 and is the brightest ever observed GRB, whose frequency is now estimated as once in 10,000 years. This GRB was reported to be observed from many space missions, VLF receivers, and ground observations in optical and radio data. Additionally, a strikingly large number of very high energy (VHE) photons associated with this GRB were observed by the gamma-ray and cosmic ray observatory LHAASO. Though gamma rays of cosmic origin usually tend to be absorbed by the atmosphere, the high fluence of this GRB, along with the observation of more than 5000 VHE photons (0.5 to 18 TeV) by LHAASO from the ground, emphasises the need to explore other possible ground observations of this GRB. The present paper examines the effect of this GRB using gamma-ray data in a low energy range (0.2-6) MeV obtained using NaI (Tl) detectors located at Tirunelveli (Geographic coordinates: 8.71{\deg}N, 77.76{\deg}E), India. With RA = 288.3{\deg} and Dec = 19.8{\deg}, the exceptionally bright fluence of this GRB was geographically centred on India. We report no significant change in the observations associated with GRB 221009A. We discuss the extent of attenuation of gamma rays in the atmosphere that could explain the reported observations. Further, we estimate the parameters of a hypothetical GRB for which photons of similar energies would reach the ground.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a 5-year monitoring program of 42 sources targeted at 6.7 GHz methanol masers, conducted from March 2017 to October 2022 using the Irbene 32 and 16 meter radio telescopes. Sources were observed with irregular intervals where time between two consecutive observation ranged from twenty four hours to thirty five days. We found that more than 55 per cent of the sources showed significant variability, but often only one or a few spectral features were varying significantly. Numerous type of variability were found in our sample: low-variable, periodic, irregular, synchronised and anti-correlated between features and steadily raising or falling flux. Our analysis techniques also uncover new variability trends for several sources. The maser monitoring program is one of the first single-dish science initiatives at the Irbene radio telescope complex, initiated shortly after the instrument's reconstruction and upgrades. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate its suitability for maser research purposes.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets grow in rotating disks of dust and gas around forming stars, some of which can subsequently collide in giant impacts after the gas component is removed from the disk. Monitoring programs with the warm Spitzer mission have recorded significant and rapid changes in mid-infrared output for several stars, interpreted as variations in the surface area of warm dusty material ejected by planetary-scale collisions and heated by the central star: e.g., NGC 2354-ID8, HD 166191 and V844 Persei. Here we report combined observations of the young (about 300 Myr), solar-like star ASASSN-21qj: an infrared brightening consistent with a blackbody temperature of 1000 K and a luminosity of 4 percent of that of the star lasting for about 1000 days, partially overlapping in time with a complex and deep wavelength-dependent optical eclipse that lasted for about 500 days. The optical eclipse started 2.5 years after the infrared brightening, implying an orbital period of at least that duration. These observations are consistent with a collision between two exoplanets of several to tens of Earth masses at 2 to 16 au from the central star. Such an impact produces a hot, highly-extended post-impact remnant with sufficient luminosity to explain the infrared observations. Transit of the impact debris, sheared by orbital motion into a long cloud, causes the subsequent complex eclipse of the host star.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity predicts that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. Although ground-based gravitational-wave detectors have successfully constrained the velocity of gravitational waves in the high-frequency range, extending this constraint to the lower frequency range remains a challenge. In this work, we utilize the deviations in the overlap reduction function for a gravitational-wave background within pulsar timing arrays to investigate the velocity of gravitational waves in the nanohertz frequency band. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we obtain a well-constrained lower bound for the velocity of gravitational waves that $v \gtrsim 0.87\,c$, where $c$ is the speed of light.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a complementary nested sampling analysis for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing data release 6. This allows the quantification of global consistency statistics between ACT lensing and alternative datasets. In the context of flat $\Lambda$CDM, we find no inconsistency between ACT, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, Planck anisotropies, weak lensing datasets, or NPIPE lensing. As part of our analysis, we also investigate the effect of the prior widths used in the ACT analysis and find that the headline results are quantitatively but not qualitatively affected by the chosen priors. We use both Bayes factors and the suspiciousness statistic to quantify the possibility of tension, and find suspiciousness unsuitable in the case of strong agreement between ACT DR6 and NPIPE. Nested sampling provides a competitive alternative to Metropolis Hastings and we recommend it be used alongside existing analyses. We release the chains and plotting source for the analysis using anesthetic.

 - **Abstract**
 Diverse protoplanetary disk morphology can result from planet-disk interaction, suggesting planetary presence. To date, most scattered light imaging campaigns have probed polarized light, which is only a fraction of the total light and not very sensitive to planets. To observe and characterize protoplanetary disk systems in the near-infrared in both polarized and total intensity light, we carried out an unprecedented study of scattering properties of disks, as well as of any planetary companions. Using SPHERE with star-hopping at the Very Large Telescope, we observed 29 disk hosts and their reference stars in $K_s$-band polarized light. We extracted disks in total intensity by adopting the data imputation concept with sequential non-negative matrix factorization (DI-sNMF). We obtained high-quality disk images in total intensity for 15 systems and in polarized light for 23. For well-recovered disks in polarized light and total intensity, we parameterized the polarization fraction phase functions using scaled beta distribution: the peak of polarization fraction tentatively correlates with the peak scattering angle, which could be reproduced using certain compact dust, yet more detailed modeling studies are needed. We investigated the empirical DI-sNMF detectability of disks using logistic regression: total intensity detectability of disks primarily depends on host star brightness. For disks with SPHERE data in $Y$-/$J$-/$H$-band, we summarized their polarized color at ~90 deg scattering angle: most of disks are blue in polarized $J-K_s$ color, and they are relatively redder as stellar luminosity increases, indicating larger scatterers. High-quality disk imagery in both total intensity and polarized light thus allows for disk characterization in polarization fraction, and reduces the confusion between disk and planetary signals.
