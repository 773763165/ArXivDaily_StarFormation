 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars convert a significant fraction of their total spin-down power into very high-energy electrons, leading to the formation of TeV halos. It is not yet known, however, whether these sources also efficiently accelerate electrons at lower energies and, if so, how those particles propagate through the surrounding environment. If pulsars produce $\sim 50-300 \, {\rm GeV}$ electrons, these particles would produce a spatially extended halo of synchrotron emission in the frequency range measured by Planck. Such emission could be used to constrain the low-energy diffusion coefficient in the regions surrounding these pulsars, as well as the spectrum and intensity of the electrons that are accelerated in this energy range. In this study, we attempt to use Planck data to constrain the nature of the Geminga pulsar's TeV halo. We find no conclusive evidence of this emission in Planck's frequency range, however, and calculate that the synchrotron flux from Geminga should be well below the total flux measured by Planck, even for models with favorable diffusion parameters or soft injection spectra. At this time, these measurements are not capable of significantly constraining the values of these parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Lyman-$\alpha$ Continuum Analysis Network (LyCAN), a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts the unabsorbed quasar continuum within the rest-frame wavelength range of $1040-1600$ Angstroms based on the red side of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line ($1216-1600$ Angstroms). We developed synthetic spectra based on a Gaussian Mixture Model representation of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) coefficients. These coefficients were derived from high-resolution, low-redshift ($z<0.2$) Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph quasar spectra. We supplemented this COS-based synthetic sample with an equal number of DESI Year 5 mock spectra. LyCAN performs extremely well on testing sets, achieving a median error in the forest region of 1.5% on the DESI mock sample, 2.0% on the COS-based synthetic sample, and 4.1% on the original COS spectra. LyCAN outperforms Principal Component Analysis (PCA)- and NMF-based prediction methods using the same training set by a factor of two or more. We predict the intrinsic continua of 83,635 DESI Year 1 spectra in the redshift range of $2.1 \leq z \leq 4.2$ and perform an absolute measurement of the evolution of the effective optical depth. This is the largest sample employed to measure the optical depth evolution to date. We fit a power-law of the form $\tau(z) = \tau_0 (1+z)^\gamma$ to our measurements and find $\tau_0 = (2.46 \pm 0.14)\times10^{-3}$ and $\gamma = 3.62 \pm 0.04$. Our results show particular agreement with high-resolution, ground-based observations around $z = 2$, indicating that LyCAN is able to predict the quasar continuum in the forest region with only spectral information outside the forest.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark energy can be characterized by a canonical scalar field, known as quintessence. Quintessence allows for a dynamical equation of state $-1 \le \omega \le -\frac{1}{3}$. In this work, we consider a quintessence model with a specific potential of the Woods-Saxon form. The model is studied at late phase assuming flat cosmology, and the model parameters are constrained using Type Ia supernova data and Observational Hubble data. In particular we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for the Bayesian inference of these parameters. We obtain the value of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.10 \pm 0.74\,km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and the matter energy density parameter $\Omega_{m_0} = 0.31 \pm 0.01 $, which are consistent with the values obtained using base $\Lambda$CDM using the same dataset. Computation of the $\chi^2_{min}$, AIC and BIC reveal that this model is preffered according to AIC and $\chi^2_{min}$ criteria, while the $\Lambda$CDM is preferred according to BIC. We also show that this model can explain late-time accelerated expansion. Statefinder analysis reveals a Chaplygin gas behaviour in the past, in addition to the quintessence behaviour of the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Ring seismology has recently revealed the presence of internal gravity waves inside Saturn that extend up to 60% of Saturn's radius starting from the center, in what is recognized today as Saturn's stably-stratified dilute core. Similarly, gravity measurements on Jupiter suggest the existence of a dilute core of still poorly constrained radial extent. These cores are likely in a double-diffusive regime, which prompt the question of their long-term stability. Indeed, previous DNS (Direct Numerical Simulations) studies in triply-periodic domains have shown that, in some regimes, double-diffusive convection tends to spontaneously form shallow convective layers, which coarsen until the region becomes fully convective. In this letter, we study the conditions for layering in double-diffusive convection using different boundary conditions, in which temperature and composition fluxes are fixed at the domain boundaries. We run a suite of DNS varying microscopic diffusivities of the fluid and the strength of the initial stratification. We find that convective layers still form as a result of the previously discovered gamma-instability which takes place whenever the local stratification drops below a critical threshold that only depends on the fluid diffusivities. We also find that the layers grow once formed, eventually occupying the entire domain. Our work thus recovers the results of previous studies, despite the new boundary conditions, suggesting that this behavior is universal. The existence of Saturn's stably-stratified core, today, therefore suggests that this threshold has never been reached, which places a new constraint on scenarios for the planet's formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of astrophysical emissions in microwave observations forces us to perform component separation to extract the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal. However, even in the most optimistic cases, there are still strongly contaminated regions, such as the Galactic plane or those with emission from extragalactic point sources, which require the use of a mask. Since many CMB analyses, especially the ones working in harmonic space, need the whole sky map, it is crucial to develop a reliable inpainting algorithm that replaces the values of the excluded pixels by others statistically compatible with the rest of the sky. This is especially important when working with $Q$ and $U$ sky maps in order to obtain $E$- and $B$-mode maps which are free from $E$-to-$B$ leakage. In this work we study a method based on Gaussian Constrained Realizations (GCR), that can deal with both intensity and polarization. Several tests have been performed to asses the validation of the method, including the study of the one-dimensional probability distribution function (1-PDF), E- and B-mode map reconstruction, and power spectra estimation. We have considered two scenarios for the input simulation: one case with only CMB signal and a second one including also Planck PR4 semi-realistic noise. Even if we are limited to low resolution maps, $N_{\mathrm{side}} = $ 64 if $T$, $Q$ and $U$ are considered, we believe that this is a useful approach to be applied to future missions such as LiteBIRD, where the target are the largest scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The ComPair gamma-ray telescope is a technology demonstrator for a future gamma-ray telescope called the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO). The instrument is composed of four subsystems, a double-sided silicon strip detector, a virtual Frisch grid CdZnTe calorimeter, a CsI:Tl based calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The CsI calorimeter's goal is to measure the position and energy deposited from high-energy events. To demonstrate the technological readiness, the calorimeter has flown onboard a NASA scientific balloon as part of the GRAPE-ComPair mission and accumulated around 3 hours of float time at an altitude of 40 km. During the flight, the CsI calorimeter observed background radiation, Regener-Pfotzer Maximum, and several gamma-ray activation lines originating from aluminum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.

          Light curves of the explosion of ONe WD+CO WD merger remnant and type Icn supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Icn supernovae (SNe Icn) are a newly detected rare subtype of interacting stripped-envelope supernovae which show narrow P-Cygni lines of highly ionized carbon, oxygen, and neon in their early spectra due to the interactions of the SNe ejecta with dense hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material (CSM). It has been suggested that SNe Icn may have multiple progenitor channels, such as the explosion of carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, or the explosion of stripped-envelope SNe which undergo binary interactions. Among the SNe Icn, SN 2019jc shows unique properties, and previous work inferred that it may stem from the ultra-stripped supernova, but other possibilities still exist. In this work, we aim to simulate the light curves from the explosions of oxygen-neon and carbon-oxygen double white dwarf (WD) merger remnants, and to further investigate whether the corresponding explosions can appear as some particular SNe Icn. We generate the light curves from the explosive remnants and analyse the influence of different parameters on the light curves, such as the ejecta mass, explosion energy, mass of Ni56 and CSM properties. Comparing our results with some SNe Icn, we found that the light curves from the explosions of double WD merger remnants can explain the observable properties of SN 2019jc, which inferred that this special SN Icn may have a different progenitor. Our results indicated that double WD merger may be an alternative model in producing at least one of the SNe Icn.

          Systematic Search and Study of Short-Timescale Flare Structures in BL Lac object Gamma-ray Emission

 - **Abstract**
 We present here the first systematic search of short timescale $\gamma$-ray flares from 29 high Galactic latitude BL Lac objects over 14 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. Using a combined Bayesian Blocks and HOP algorithm, we identified seven high-quality orbital timescale flare segments from three sources and quantified 24 short-timescale flare structures. We then performed a comprehensive analysis of flare symmetry, power spectral density (PSD) of variability, and flux-photon index relation. The main results are as follows: (1) The flare symmetry parameter $A$ shows a "U-shaped" distribution. Short timescale flares are symmetric while long timescale flares are asymmetric. The number of fast-rise slow-decay and slow-rise fast-decay type flares are equal. No correlation is found between $A$ and peak/integral flux. No parameter evolution is seen between consecutive flares either. The observations support a scenario where longer timescale flares originate from superposition of short, symmetric sub-hour flares. (2) PSD from yearly to hourly timescales is modeled using the CARMA process. At lower frequencies, the PSD follows the typical broken power-law form. The high-frequency region of the PSD exhibits a continuous power-law shape, indicating that $\gamma$-ray variability originates from a single physical process across all probed timescales. (3) The flux-photon index distribution shows a pattern of "harder-when-brighter" or "softer-when-brighter," but becomes flat above a certain critical flux, with $\Gamma$ $\approx$ 2. This behavior cannot be simply explained by a two-component or blazar sequence model, and we speculate it may be related to complex interplay between electron acceleration and cooling.

          Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of \lcdm best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a cosmological test of Cotton gravity, which describes gravity by cotton tensor. The model we consider allows for the same background evolution as the $\Lambda$CDM model. We derive the cosmological perturbation theory of the scalar mode at the linear level, where the difference from the $\Lambda$CDM model is characterized by the parameter $\beta$. We incorporate Cotton gravity with a neutrino model and perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis constrains parameter $\beta=-0.00008^{+0.00080}_{-0.00104}$ at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence level. We conclude that currently, there is no obvious deviation between Cotton gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear cosmological perturbation level for observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Position calibration in the deep sea is typically done by means of acoustic multilateration using three or more acoustic emitters installed at known positions. Rather than using hydrophones as receivers that are exposed to the ambient pressure, the sound signals can be coupled to piezo ceramics glued to the inside of existing containers for electronics or measuring instruments of a deep sea infrastructure. The ANTARES neutrino telescope operated from 2006 until 2022 in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth exceeding 2000m. It comprised nearly 900 glass spheres with 432mm diameter and 15mm thickness, equipped with photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light from tracks of charged elementary particles. In an experimental setup within ANTARES, piezo sensors have been glued to the inside of such - otherwise empty - glass spheres. These sensors recorded signals from acoustic emitters with frequencies from 46545 to 60235Hz. Two waves propagating through the glass sphere are found as a result of the excitation by the waves in the water. These can be qualitatively associated with symmetric and asymmetric Lamb-like waves of zeroth order: a fast (early) one with $v_e \approx 5$mm/$\mu$s and a slow (late) one with $v_\ell \approx 2$mm/$\mu$s. Taking these findings into account improves the accuracy of the position calibration. The results can be transferred to the KM3NeT neutrino telescope, currently under construction at multiple sites in the Mediterranean Sea, for which the concept of piezo sensors glued to the inside of glass spheres has been adapted for monitoring the positions of the photomultiplier tubes.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent exoplanet observations have revealed a diversity of exoplanetary systems, which suggests the ubiquity of radial planetary migration. One powerful known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which makes planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering with planetesimals. Here, we present the results of our high-resolution self-consistent $N$-body simulations of PDM, in which gravitational interactions among planetesimals, the gas drag, and Type-I migration are all taken into account. Our results show that even small protoplanets can actively migrate through PDM. Moreover, a fair fraction of them migrate outward. This outward migration can give a solution for the ''planet migration problem'' caused by Type-I migration and explain the origin of Jovian planets.

          Structure of proper motions in a sunspot penumbra

 - **Abstract**
 We study the structure and evolution of the horizontal proper motions in a regular sunspot penumbra, very close to the solar disc center, in active region NOAA 11092 using a 48 min time sequences of blue continuum images recorded by Hinode/SOT in 2010 August 3. We apply local correlation tracking (LCT). The penumbra shows a slow (fast) flow field with an average speed of 0.2 (0.4) km/s starting at its middle towards the umbra (outer penumbral boundary) as an inward (outward) motion in accordance with previous findings. This behavior defines a continuous divergence line at the middle of the penumbra (r~2R_spot/3). A distorted ringlike feature with very slow flows (~50 m/s; zero-flow ring: ZFR) co-spatial with the divergence line is clearly seen. Deep intrusion of coordinated penumbral filaments into the umbra can cause the ZFR to be a) significantly displaced towards the umbra or b) discontinuous, showing considerable speeds there (~150 m/s). Where the ZFR shows discontinuity, the divergence line does not move toward the umbra. Also, because of the different evolutionary flows of adjacent penumbral filaments, the ZFR and the divergence line show a stable backward/forward displacement along itself during the 48 min observation. The radial variations of the azimuthally averaged brightness show a local bright ring with a weak contrast of 1% close to the ZFR. At the outer penumbra, we find that the converging filamentary flow occurs in a dark radial channel and the filamentary diverging flows are formed by the evolution of thin bright fibrils. Also, the large speeds at the penumbra boundary are produced by the displacement and/or the fragmentation of the bright fibrils in developing filamentary flows. In surrounding granulation, some divergence centers are strongly pushed away as a whole with an average speed of about 0.6 km/s by these developing filamentary flows.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks are routinely described as finite mass reservoirs left over by the gravitational collapse of the protostar, an assumption that strongly constrains both disk evolution and planet formation models. We propose a different scenario where protoplanetary disks of pre-main sequence stars are assembled primarily by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the parent gas cloud. We demonstrate that Bondi-Hoyle accretion can supply not only the mass, but also the angular momentum necessary to explain the observed size of protoplanetary disks, and we predict the dependence of the disk specific angular momentum on the stellar mass. Our results are based on an analytical derivation of the scaling of the angular momentum in a turbulent flow, which we also confirm with a numerical simulation of supersonic turbulence. This new scenario for disk formation and evolution may alleviate a number of observational problems as well as compel major revisions of disk and planet formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the evolution of dark energy poses a significant challenge in modern cosmology, as it is responsible for the universe's accelerated expansion. In this study, we focus on a specific $f(T)$ cosmological model and analyze its behavior using observational data, including 31 data points from the CC dataset, 1048 points from the Pantheon SNe Ia samples, and 6 points from the BAO dataset. By considering a linear $f(T)$ model with an additional constant term, we derive the expression for the Hubble parameter as a function of cosmic redshift for non-relativistic pressureless matter. We obtain the best-fit values for the Hubble constant, $H_0$, and the model parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, indicating a stable model capable of explaining late-time cosmic acceleration without invoking a dark energy component. This is achieved through modifying field equations to account for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Discovering transiting exoplanets with relatively long orbital periods ($>$10 days) is crucial to facilitate the study of cool exoplanet atmospheres ($T_{\rm eq} < 700 K$) and to understand exoplanet formation and inward migration further out than typical transiting exoplanets. In order to discover these longer period transiting exoplanets, long-term photometric and radial velocity campaigns are required. We report the discovery of TOI-2447 b ($=$ NGTS-29b), a Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright (T=10.0) Solar-type star (T$_{\rm eff}$=5730 K). TOI-2447 b was identified as a transiting exoplanet candidate from a single transit event of 1.3% depth and 7.29 h duration in $TESS$ Sector 31 and a prior transit event from 2017 in NGTS data. Four further transit events were observed with NGTS photometry which revealed an orbital period of P=69.34 days. The transit events establish a radius for TOI-2447 b of $0.865 \pm 0.010\rm R_{\rm J}$, while radial velocity measurements give a mass of $0.386 \pm 0.025 \rm M_{\rm J}$. The equilibrium temperature of the planet is $414$ K, making it much cooler than the majority of $TESS$ planet discoveries. We also detect a transit signal in NGTS data not caused by TOI-2447 b, along with transit timing variations and evidence for a $\sim$150 day signal in radial velocity measurements. It is likely that the system hosts additional planets, but further photometry and radial velocity campaigns will be needed to determine their parameters with confidence. TOI-2447 b/NGTS-29b joins a small but growing population of cool giants that will provide crucial insights into giant planet composition and formation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploratory missions have found that regolith on interplanetary bodies can be loosely packed and freely flowing, a state that strongly affects mission plans and that may also influence the large scale shapes of these bodies. We investigate whether notable circumferential ridges seen on Saturn's moons may be a byproduct of free flow of loosely packed regolith. Such ridges and other features likely record the history of the moons, and we find that if surface grains are freely flowing, then the combined gravity of Saturn itself and its tenuous ring generate similar circumferential features. Moreover, analysis of these features reveals the possibility of previously unreported morphologies, for example a stationary torus around a non rotating satellite. Some of these features persist even for a very low density and distant disk. This raises the prospect that nonlinear analysis of interactions from disks to moons and back again may lead to new insights.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the energy sources, the physical properties of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM), as well as the mass-loss history of the progenitor of SN 2017dio which is a broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) having unusual light curves (LCs) and signatures of hydrogen-rich CSM in its early spectrum. We find that the temperature of SN 2017dio began to increase linearly about 20 days after the explosion. We use the $^{56}$Ni plus the ejecta-CSM interaction (CSI) model to fit the LCs of SN 2017dio, finding that the masses of the ejecta, the $^{56}$Ni, and the CSM are $\sim$ 12.41 M$_\odot$, $\sim$ 0.17 M$_\odot$, and $\sim$ 5.82 M$_\odot$, respectively. The early-time photosphere velocity and the kinetic energy of the SN are respectively {$\sim$ 1.89 $\times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$} and $\sim$ 2.66 $\times 10^{52}$ erg, which are respectively comparable to those of SNe Ic-BL and hypernovae (HNe). We suggest that the CSM of SN 2017dio might be {from an luminous-blue-variable-like outburst or} pulsational pair instability $\sim$ 1.2$-$11.4 yr prior to the SN explosion{, or binary mass transfer}. {Moreover,} we find that its ejecta mass is larger than those of many SNe Ic-BL, and that its $^{56}$Ni mass ($M_{\rm Ni}$) is approximately equal to the mean (or median) value of $M_{\rm Ni}$ of SNe Ic-BL in the literature, but lower than $M_{\rm Ni}$ of prototype HNe (e.g., SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh).

 - **Abstract**
 The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as $v_{\rm avg}$ increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of $t_{\rm E} > 200~$ days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mróz et al. (2017, 2019) and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.26, 0.19, 0.095, 0.020, and $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ events occurring for $v_{\rm avg} =$ 25 km/sec, 50 km/sec, 100 km/sec, 200 km/sec, and 400 km/sec, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be $v_{\rm avg} \lesssim 100~{\rm km/sec}$. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luckiness of finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by e.g. the Roman space telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the nature of the short-term anomaly that appears in the lensing light curve of KMT-2023-BLG-1866. The anomaly was only partly covered due to its short duration, less than a day, coupled with cloudy weather conditions and restricted nighttime duration. Considering intricacy of interpreting partially covered signals, we thoroughly explore all potential degenerate solutions. Through this process, we identify three planetary scenarios that equally well account for the observed anomaly. These scenarios are characterized by the specific planetary parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [0.9740 \pm 0.0083, (2.46 \pm 1.07) \times 10^{-5}]$, $(s, q)_{\rm intermediate} = [0.9779 \pm 0.0017, (1.56 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-5}]$, and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [0.9894 \pm 0.0107, (2.31 \pm 1.29)\times 10^{-5}]$, where $s$ and $q$ denote the projected separation (scaled to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the planet and its host, respectively. We identify that the ambiguity between the inner and outer solutions stems from the inner-outer degeneracy, while the similarity between the intermediate solution and the others is due to an accidental degeneracy caused by incomplete anomaly coverage. Through Bayesian analysis utilizing the constraints derived from measured lensing observables and blending flux, our estimation indicates that the lens system comprises a very low-mass planet orbiting an early M-type star situated approximately (6.2 -- 6.5)~kpc from Earth in terms of median posterior values for the different solutions. The median mass of the planet host is in the range of (0.48 -- 0.51)~$M_\odot$, and that of the planet's mass spans a range of (2.6 -- 4.0)~$M_{\rm E}$, varying across different solutions. The detection of KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb signifies the extension of the lensing surveys to very low-mass planets that have been difficult to be detected from earlier surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we report a study on the relationship between flux and intensity for molecular clouds. Our analysis is established on high-quality CO images from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. The new flux-intensity relation characterizes the flux variation of molecular clouds above specific intensity levels. We found that the flux-intensity relation exhibits two prominent features. First, the flux-intensity relation generally follows exponential shapes; secondly, hierarchical structures of molecular clouds are imprinted on flux-intensity relations. Specifically, 12CO flux-intensity relations are composed of one or more exponential segments, and for molecular clouds with segmented flux-intensity relations, the edge and the flux of the high-temperature component are strikingly consistent with 13CO emission. Further analysis shows that a similar relationship also exists between 13CO flux-intensity relations and C18O emission. The mean brightness temperature of molecular clouds is tightly associated with the decay rate of flux, the break temperature of exponential segments, and, to a certain extent, the flux fraction of the high-temperature component. Broadly, the flux-intensity relation of a molecular tracer, either in optically thick or in optically thin cases, has the capability to outline the silhouette of internal structures of molecular clouds, proving to be a potent tool for probing structures of molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The Oceanus Procellarum region, characterized by its vast basaltic plains and pronounced volcanic activity, serves as a focal point for understanding the volcanic history of the Moon. Leveraging the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission data, we imaged the magmatic structures beneath the Oceanus Procellarum region. Our 3D density models uncover pronounced linear magmatic structures along the Procellarum's western border and significant intrusions within the northern and southern Marius Hills. Crucially, they reveal three narrow near-horizontal sheeted magmatic structures, 80-150 km long, extending from near-surface to 6- 7 km depth, which we identified as sill-like magmatic conduits. These magmatic conduits connect the Marius Hills' northern and southern intrusions and bridge them with the Procellarum's western border structures. These discoveries suggest that sill-like magmatic conduits likely serve as central pathways facilitating magma transport across various volcanic systems and furthermore indicate widespread magmatic connectivity beneath the Oceanus Procellarum.

          Tidal disruption event AT2020ocn: early-time X-ray flares caused by a possible disc alignment process

 - **Abstract**
 A tidal disruption event (TDE) may occur when a star is torn apart by the tidal force of a black hole (BH). Eventually, an accretion disc is thought to form out of stellar debris falling back towards the BH. If the star's orbital angular momentum vector prior to disruption is not aligned with the BH spin angular momentum vector, the disc will be tilted with respect to the BH equatorial plane. The disc will eventually be drawn into the BH equatorial plane due to a combination of the Bardeen-Petterson effect and internal torques. Here, we analyse the X-ray and UV observations of the TDE AT2020ocn obtained by Swift, XMM-Newton, and NICER. The X-ray light curve shows strong flares during the first $\approx100$ days, while, over the same period, the UV emission decays gradually. We find that the X-ray flares can be explained by a model that also explains the spectral evolution. This model includes a slim disc viewed under a variable inclination plus an inverse-Comptonisation component processing the slim disc emission. A scenario where the ongoing Lense-Thirring precession during the disc alignment process is responsible for the observed inclination variations is consistent with the data. In later observations, we find that the X-ray spectrum of AT2020ocn becomes harder, while the mass accretion rate remains at super-Eddington levels, suggesting the formation of a corona in line with accretion onto other compact objects. We constrain the BH mass to be $(7^{+13}_{-3})\times10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ at the 1$\sigma$ (68%) confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), $\sim$ 100 - 1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (XFs; in long GRBs) or extended emission (EEs; in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius ($r_{\rm diss}$), Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$), and cosmic-ray loading factor ($\xi_p$), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multi-messenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$, assuming $\xi_p=10$. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of $\sim 1000-2000$ events, for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of non-detection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.

          Optimal bolometer transfer function deconvolution for CMB experiments through maximum likelihood mapmaking

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the impact of finite time responses of bolometric detectors used for deep observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Until now, bolometer transfer functions have been accounted for through a two-step procedure by first deconvolving an estimate of their Fourier-space representation from the raw time-ordered data (TOD), and then averaging the deconvolved TOD into pixelized maps. However, for many experiments, including the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI), it is necessary to apply an additional low-pass filter to avoid an excessive noise boost, which leads to an asymmetric effective beam. In this paper we demonstrate that this effect can be avoided if the transfer function deconvolution and pixelization operations are performed simultaneously through integrated maximum likelihood mapmaking. The resulting algorithm is structurally identical to the artDeco algorithm introduced by Keihänen & Reinecke (2012) for beam deconvolution. We illustrate the relevance of this method with simulated Planck HFI 143 GHz data, and find that the resulting effective beam is both more symmetric than with the two-step procedure, resulting in a sky-averaged ellipticity that is 64 % lower, and an effective beam full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) that is 2.3 % smaller. Similar improvements are expected for any other bolometer-based CMB experiments with long time constants.

 - **Abstract**
 The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring campaign of Cyg X-1 allows us to study its spectral-timing behavior at energies ${<}1$ keV across all states. The hard state power spectrum can be decomposed into two main broad Lorentzians with a transition at around 1 Hz. The lower-frequency Lorentzian is the dominant component at low energies. The higher-frequency Lorentzian begins to contribute significantly to the variability above 1.5 keV and dominates at high energies. We show that the low- and high-frequency Lorentzians likely represent individual physical processes. The lower-frequency Lorentzian can be associated with a (possibly Comptonized) disk component, while the higher-frequency Lorentzian is clearly associated with the Comptonizing plasma. At the transition of these components, we discover a low-energy timing phenomenon characterized by an abrupt lag change of hard (${\gtrsim}2$ keV) with respect to soft (${\lesssim}1.5$ keV) photons, accompanied by a drop in coherence, and a reduction in amplitude of the second broad Lorentzian. The frequency of the phenomenon increases with the frequencies of the Lorentzians as the source softens and cannot be seen when the power spectrum is single-humped. A comparison to transient low-mass X-ray binaries shows that this feature does not only appear in Cyg X-1, but that it is a general property of accreting black hole binaries. In Cyg X-1, we find that the variability at low and high energies is overall highly coherent in the hard and intermediate states. The high coherence shows that there is a process at work which links the variability, suggesting a physical connection between the accretion disk and Comptonizing plasma. This process fundamentally changes in the soft state, where strong red noise at high energies is incoherent to the variability at low energies.

          A dynamic view of V Hydrae. Monitoring of a spectroscopic-binary AGB star with an alkaline jet

 - **Abstract**
 The well studied carbon star V Hydrae is known to exhibit a complex asymmetric environment made of a dense equatorial wind and high-velocity outflows, hinting at its transition from the AGB phase to the asymmetric planetary nebula phase. In addition, V Hydrae also exhibits a long secondary period of 17 years in its light curve, suggesting the presence of a binary companion that could shape the circumstellar environment. In this paper, we aim to confirm the binary nature of V Hydrae by deriving its orbital parameters and investigating the effect of the orbital motion on the circumbinary environment. In a first step, we used a radial-velocity monitoring performed with the HERMES spectrograph to disentangle the pulsation signal of the AGB from its orbital motion and to obtain the spectroscopic orbit. We combined the spectroscopic results with astrometric information to get the complete set of orbital parameters, including the system inclination. Next, we reported the time variations of the sodium and potassium resonance doublets. Finally, following the methods used for post-AGB stars, we carried out spatio-kinematic modelling of a conical jet to reproduce the observed spectral-line modulation. We found the orbital solution of V Hydrae for a period of 17 years. We correlated the companion passage across the line of sight with the obscuration event and the blue-shifted absorption of alkaline resonant lines. Those variations were modelled by a conical jet emitted from the companion, whose opening angle is wide and whose sky-projected orientation is found to be consistent with the axis of the large-scale bipolar outflow previously detected in the radio-emission lines of CO. We show that the periodic variation seen for V Hydrae is likely to be due to orbital motion. The presence of a conical jet offers a coherent model to explain the various features of V Hydrae environment.

 Our purpose is to study the effect of binary companions located within the first 10 stellar radii from the primary AGB star. In this work, we target the mass-losing carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya), looking for signatures of its companion in the dust forming region of the atmosphere. The star was observed in the L- and N-bands with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument at low spectral resolution. We reconstructed images of V Hya's photosphere and surroundings using the two bands and compared our interferometric observables with VLTI/MIDI and VISIR archival data. To constrain the dust properties, we used DUSTY to model the spectral energy distribution. The star is dominated by dust emission in the L- and N- bands. The VISIR image confirms the presence of a large-scale dusty circumstellar envelope surrounding V Hya. The MATISSE reconstructed images show asymmetric and elongated structures in both infrared bands. In the L-band, we detected an elongated shape of approximately 15 mas, likely to be of photospheric origin. In the N-band, we found a 20 mas extension North-East from the star, and perpendicular to the L-band elongated axis. The position angle and the size of the N-band extension match the prediction of the companion position at MATISSE epoch. By comparing MATISSE N-band with MIDI data, we deduce that the elongation axis in the N-band has rotated since the previous interferometric measurements 13 years ago, supporting the idea that the particle enhancement is related to the dusty clump moving along with the companion. The MATISSE images unveil the presence of a dust enhancement at the companion position, opening new doors for further analysis on the binary interaction with an AGB component.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization imaging can yield crucial information in multiple applications of remote sensing, such as characterization of clouds, aerosols, and the Aurora Borealis. Some applications require sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity and accuracy in determining the Stokes parameters, which can be a challenge to attain. In 2018, Sony released a low-cost CMOS-based imaging chip with integrated micro-polarizer array for general polarization measurements. We implement the calibration steps required for these Sony chips to reach sub-percent polarimetric accuracies. To analyze their performances, we have compared the characteristics of four different detector packages by three manufacturers housing either the monochromatic version or the RGB color variant. We present a comprehensive overview of the effects that these characteristics have on the polarimetric performance of the camera. They include dark noise, behavior over different gain settings, detector/pixel artifacts, and polarimetric effects determined by polarizer extinction ratios, polarizer orientations, and accuracy of polarimetric zero points due to differential pixel gains. In addition to calibrations using unpolarized light and fully linearly polarized light, we assess the polarimetric sensitivity within a tilting and rotating glass-plate set-up. We discuss the benefits of adding a rotating half-wave plate as an additional temporal modulator to generically mitigate some of the detector effects, and achieve better polarimetric sensitivity/accuracy albeit at the expense of lower temporal resolution. We conclude by presenting and discussing the polarimetric limits to which we were able to calibrate the detector effects for practical purposes. By reaching a compound absolute polarimetric uncertainty of less than a percent, these very compact, low-cost detectors are enabled for a multitude of scientific goals.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a coherent, re-usable python framework which further builds on the cosmological emulator code CosmoPower. In the current era of high-precision cosmology, we require high-accuracy calculations of cosmological observables with Einstein-Boltzmann codes. For detailed statistical analyses, such codes often incur high costs in terms of computing power, making parameter space exploration costly, especially for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM analyses. Machine learning-enabled emulators of Einstein-Boltzmann codes have emerged as a solution to this problem and have become a common way to perform fast cosmological analyses. To enable generation, sharing and use of emulators for inference, we define standards for robustly describing, packaging and distributing them, and present software for easily performing these tasks in an automated and replicable manner. We provide examples and guidelines for generating your own sufficiently accurate emulators and wrappers for using them in popular cosmological inference codes. We demonstrate our framework by presenting a suite of high-accuracy emulators for the CAMB code's calculations of CMB $C_\ell$, $P(k)$, background evolution, and derived parameter quantities. We show that these emulators are accurate enough for both $\Lambda$CDM analysis and a set of single- and two-parameter extension models (including $N_{\rm eff}$, $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $w_0 w_a$ cosmologies) with stage-IV observatories, recovering the original high-accuracy Einstein-Boltzmann spectra to tolerances well within the cosmic variance uncertainties across the full range of parameters considered. We also use our emulators to recover cosmological parameters in a simulated cosmic-variance limited experiment, finding results well within $0.1 \sigma$ of the input cosmology, while requiring typically $\lesssim1/50$ of the evaluation time than for the full Einstein-Boltzmann computation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.
