#### Title:
          And if Vulcan was a primordial black hole of planetary-mass ?

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, I re-examine the question of a possible explanation for the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion by the existence of a hypothetical planet, Vulcan, which I consider to be a kind of primordial black hole of planetary-mass. The detection of this kind of celestial body has become possible with modern experimental techniques, inter alia, such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Recently, an excess of ultra-short microlensing events with crossing times of 0.1 to 0.3 days has been reported, suggesting the possible existence of sub-Earth-mass primordial black holes in our solar system. The primordial black hole Vulcan planetary mass hypothesis could then explain the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion under the influence of its gravitational attraction, still remaining hidden from astronomers' telescopes. But in this case, it will also influence the perihelion advance of the other planets. To this end, I first calculate the mutual partial contributions to the perihelion motion of all the planets by two different methods without Vulcan in a model of simplified solar system consisting of the Sun and eight planets. Next, I include Vulcan in this model within the framework of the Newtonian theory of classical gravitation and analyze Vulcan's influence on the perihelion advance of the inner planets, using Vulcan parameters from my previous work. These results are compared with the perihelion advances of the inner planets predicted by the theory of general relativity, and with the data obtained by modern observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.

 - **Abstract**
 Assessing the prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets around M-dwarf stars is a top priority of exoplanet science. High-energy activity from M-dwarfs can destroy the atmospheres of these planets, which could explain the lack of atmosphere detections to date. Volcanic outgassing has been proposed as a mechanism to replenish the atmospheres of tidally-heated rocky planets. L 98-59 b, a sub-Earth transiting a nearby M dwarf, was recently identified as the most promising exoplanet to detect a volcanic atmosphere. We present the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 b from four transits observed with JWST NIRSpec G395H. Although the airless model provides an adequate fit to the data based on its $\chi^2$, an SO$_2$ atmosphere is preferred by 3.6$\sigma$ over a flat line in terms of the Bayesian evidence. Such an atmosphere would likely be in a steady state where volcanism balances escape. If so, L 98-59 b must experience at least eight times as much volcanism and tidal heating per unit mass as Io. If volcanism is driven by runaway melting of the mantle, we predict the existence of a subsurface magma ocean in L 98-59 b extending up to $R_p\sim 60-90\%$. An SO$_2$-rich volcanic atmosphere on L 98-59 b would be indicative of an oxidized mantle with an oxygen fugacity of $f\rm{O}_2>IW+2.7$, and it would imply that L 98-59 b must have retained some of its volatile endowment despite its proximity to its star. Our findings suggest that volcanism may revive secondary atmospheres on tidally heated rocky planets around M-dwarfs.

          Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, BBHs with $\rm SNR\gtrsim 20$ can be confidently localized to specific GCs within the Milky Way, with an angular resolution of $\sim 10-100$ arc minutes. The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era for the study of compact objects. Upcoming detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to add thousands of binary coalescences to the list. However, from a theoretical perspective, our understanding of compact objects is hindered by many uncertainties, and a comprehensive study of the nature of stellar remnants from core-collapse supernovae is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the properties of stellar remnants using a homogeneous grid of rotating and non-rotating massive stars at various metallicities from Limongi and Chieffi 2018. We simulate the supernova explosion of the evolved progenitors using the HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION (HYPERION) code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020), assuming a thermal bomb model calibrated to match the main properties of SN1987A. We find that the heaviest black hole that can form depends on the initial stellar rotation, metallicity, and the assumed criterion for the onset of pulsational pair-instability supernovae. Non-rotating progenitors at $\big[\rm Fe/H \big]=-3$ can form black holes up to $\sim 87 M_\odot$, falling within the theorized pair-instability mass gap. Conversely, enhanced wind mass loss prevents the formation of BHs more massive than $\sim 41.6 M_\odot$ from rotating progenitors. We use our results to study the black hole mass distribution from a population of $10^6$ isolated massive stars following a Kroupa initial mass function. Finally, we provide fitting formulas to compute the mass of compact remnants as a function of stellar progenitor properties. Our up-to-date prescriptions can be easily implemented in rapid population synthesis codes.

          Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.

          Updated Mass, Eccentricity, and Tidal Heating Constraints for the Earth-sized Planet LP 791-18 d

 - **Abstract**
 LP 791-18 d is a temperate Earth-sized planet orbiting a late M dwarf, surrounded by an interior super-Earth (LP 791-18 b, $R_P$ = 1.2 $R_{\oplus}$, $P=0.95$ days) and an exterior sub-Neptune (LP 791-18 c, $R_P$ = 2.5 $R_{\oplus}$, $P=4.99$ days). Dynamical interactions between LP 791-18 d and c produce transit timing variations (TTVs) that can be used to constrain the planet masses and eccentricities. These interactions can also force a non-zero eccentricity for LP 791-18 d, which raises its internal temperature through tidal heating and could drive volcanic outgassing. We present three new transit observations of LP 791-18 c with Palomar/WIRC, including the most precise TTV measurements ($<$ 6 seconds) of this planet to date. We fit these times with a TTV model to obtain updated constraints on the mass, eccentricity, and tidal heat flux of LP 791-18 d. We reduce the mass uncertainty by more than a factor of two ($M_d$ = 0.91 $\pm$ 0.19 $M_{\oplus}$). We perform an updated fit assuming tidally damped free eccentricities and find $e_d = 0.0011^{+0.0010}_{-0.0008}$ and $e_c = 0.0001 \pm 0.0001$, consistent with circular orbits. We find that the observed TTVs are not sensitive to $e \leq$ $\sim$0.01. Without a tidally damped eccentricity prior, $e_d = 0.056^{+0.015}_{-0.014}$, much higher than the eccentricity predicted by n-body simulations incorporating the effects of dynamical excitation and tidal damping. We predict the timing of upcoming JWST secondary eclipse observations for LP 791-18 d, which could tightly constrain the eccentricity and tidal quality factor of this Earth-sized exoplanet.

          Tidal disruption events as origin of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The recently discovered spherical eROSITA bubbles arise up to a latitude of $\pm$80°-85°in the X-ray regime of the Milky Way halo. Similar to the $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles, they evolve around the Galactic center, making a common origin plausible. However, the driving mechanism and evolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We want to investigate whether hydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal disruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100 kyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a shock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining density distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble blown out of the disk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the Galaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering different Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray maps and compare them to observations. Results: Our simulation results of a $\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by regular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can have a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates for the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent to the Fermi bubbles. The $\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions at the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by first order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in the past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow resulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the $\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to grow through accretion of matter and mergers. Models of SMBH mergers have long suffered the final parsec problem, where SMBH binaries may stall before energy loss from gravitational waves (GW) becomes significant, leaving the pair unmerged. Direct evidence of coalesced SMBH remains elusive. Theory predicts that GW recoiling black holes can occur following a black hole merger. Here we present decisive spectroscopic evidence that the gas bound to the SMBH in the spatially offset quasar 3C 186 is blue-shifted relative to the host galaxy. This is exclusively explained by the GW recoil super-kick scenario. This confirmation of the ejection process implies that the final parsec problem is resolved in nature, providing evidence that even the most massive black holes can merge.

          A Novel Method to Estimate the FUV Flux and a Catalogue for Star-Hosting Discs in Nearby Star-Forming Regions

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV) photons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds, reducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the link between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires accurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be challenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a star-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and assuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and massive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it significantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute FUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc, 6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible catalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A stars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100 G0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of a negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we emphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at >10^2 G0 to probe the dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including average interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly attenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction maps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that can be expanded to additional regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon stars (with atmospheric C/O$>1$) range widely in temperature and luminosity, from low mass dwarfs to asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). The main sequence dwarf carbon (dC) stars have inherited carbon-rich material from an AGB companion, which has since transitioned to a white dwarf. The dC stars are far more common than C giants, but no reliable estimates of dC space density have been published to date. We present results from an all-sky survey for carbon stars using the low-resolution XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We developed and measured a set of spectral indices contrasting C$_{\rm 2}$ and CN molecular band strengths in carbon stars against common absorption features found in normal (C/O$<1$) stars such as CaI, TiO and Balmer lines. We combined these indices with the XP spectral coefficients as input to supervised machine-learning algorithms trained on a vetted sample of known C stars from LAMOST. We describe the selection of the carbon candidate sample, and provide a catalog of 43,574 candidates dominated by cool C giants in the Magellanic Clouds and at low galactic latitude in the Milky Way. We report the confirmation of candidate C stars using intermediate ($R\sim 1800$) resolution optical spectroscopy from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, and provide estimates of sample purity and completeness. From a carefully-vetted sample of over 600 dCs, we measure their local space density to be $\rho_0\,=\,1.96^{+0.14}_{-0.12}\times10^{-6}\,\text{pc}^{-3}$ (about one dC in every local disk volume of radius 50\,pc), with a relatively large disk scale height of $H_z\,=\,856^{+49}_{-43}\,$pc.

          Spectral Insights and Evolutionary Pathways of Globular Cluster ULX in NGC 1399: A Two-Decade X-ray and Optical Study

 - **Abstract**
 We present new multi-wavelength observations of two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) hosted by globular clusters (GCs) in the giant elliptical NGC 1399, focusing on CXO J0338318-352604 (GCU7), only the second GC ULX known to have luminous optical emission lines. Notably, only NII and OIII emission is observed in the optical spectra, suggesting H-poor material. Previous work suggested the possibility that the properties of GCU7 could be explained by the tidal disruption of a horizontal branch star by an intermediate-mass black hole. We use new data to show that the lack of evolution in the X-ray or optical properties of the source over the last 20 years rules out this scenario. Instead, we use CLOUDY simulations to demonstrate that the optical emission lines are consistent with an outflow from an ultra-compact X-ray binary where a compact object - likely a neutron star (NS) - is accreting above the Eddington limit from a helium white dwarf (He WD). This binary would have dynamically formed from a direct collision between a NS and a red giant, or else via an exchange interaction. The ULX is predicted to evolve to lower mass transfer rates over time and eventually become a doppelganger to the well-studied ultra-compact X-ray binaries in Galactic GCs such as 4U 1820-30. These results show the utility of using extragalactic GCs to study short-lived phases in dynamical binary evolution that occur too rarely to be observed in Galactic clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has conducted measurements of the energy spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays using different methods. Utilizing both surface and fluorescence detectors (SD and FD), the Observatory provides unprecedented precision in understanding these particles. While primarily designed to measure ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the FD's high-elevation telescopes and the dense arrays of SD stations enable observations down to 6 PeV and 60 PeV, respectively. To determine the depth of shower maximum, a critical parameter for identifying primary particle types, both direct longitudinal profile measurements from the FD and indirect signal analyses from the SD are employed. An energy evolution of the mass of primary particles, as well as of the spectral index of the flux intensity, are observed and characterized by features described in the presented work. The measurements benefit from the joint operation of the FD and SD, delivering a systematic uncertainty of 14% in energy determination and an accumulated exposure reaching 80 000 km$^2$ sr yr at the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Cepheid circumstellar emissions have previously been detected via both infrared excess and infrared interferometric observations at a few stellar radii. Those studies have shown that these circumstellar emission can be produced by ionized gas, however there is no direct observational evidence to confirm this hypothesis. In this letter we explore the continuum emission and a spectrum of the bright and long-period Cepheid, $\ell$~Car ($P=35.56\,$day) at millimeter-wavelengths in order to detect possible effects of ionized gas emission. We presented ALMA observations of $\ell$ Car in two spectral setups in Band~6 (near 212 and 253\,GHz, respectively) and we compared the measured flux density to one expected for the stellar continuum. We also derived the spectral index and probed the presence of Radio Recombination Lines (RRL). We report statistically significant emission of about 3.5$\,$mJy in the two spectral ranges, which is about 2.5 times the stellar continuum emission. For the first time, we are also able to derive the spectral index of the flux density ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), $\alpha=+1.26\pm$0.44 ($\sim$3$\sigma$ error), which is characteristic of partially optically thick ionized gas emission. Additionally, we discovered an emission line from a RRL of hydrogen H29$\alpha$ centered on the stellar rest velocity, smaller in spatial extent than about 0\farcs2 ($\lesssim 100\,$AU), with a symmetric profile with a width at half power of 55.3$\pm$7.5\,\kms (1$\sigma$ error). It confirms the presence of ionized gas emission near $\ell$~Car. The millimeter emission detected from $\ell$ Car can be attributed to ionized gas emission from the Cepheid's chromosphere. Further radio interferometric observations are necessary to confirm the occurrence of these ionized gas envelopes around Cepheids of different pulsation periods.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ < M$_{\star}$ < 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.

 - **Abstract**
 The first few hours of a supernova contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted to the Gran Telescopio de Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernova at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra for 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48 hours. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from ZTF and ATLAS. This programme shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme to existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the supernova candidate. Both the future La Silla Southern Supernova Survey (LS4) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) both located in Chile will be providing discovery and follow up of most of the transients in the southern hemisphere. This paper demonstrates that with a rapid spectroscopic programme and stringent triggering criteria, obtaining a sample of SN with spectra within a day of the explosion is possible.

 - **Abstract**
 There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity models, in which the matter side of Einstein's equations includes a term proportional to some power, $n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term. Previous works have suggested that these models can lead to a recent accelerating universe without a cosmological constant, but they can also be seen as phenomenological extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, which are observationally constrained to be close to the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Here we show that these models violate the temperature-redshift relation, and are therefore further constrained by astrophysical measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We provide joint constraints on these models from the combination of astrophysical and background cosmological data, showing that this power is constrained to be about $|n|<0.01$ and $|n|<0.1$, respectively in models without and with a cosmological constant, and improving previous constraints on this parameter by more than a factor of three. By breaking degeneracies between this parameter and the matter density, constraints on the latter are also improved by a factor of about two.

 - **Abstract**
 Young low-mass protostars often possess hot corinos, compact, hot and dense regions bright in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs). Besides of their prebiotic role, iCOMs can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the chemical and physical properties of hot corinos. Using ALMA/FAUST data we aim to explore the iCOMs emission at < 50 au scale around the Class 0 prototypical hot corino IRAS 4A2. We imaged IRAS 4A2 in six abundant, common iCOMs (CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_2$OHCHO, and NH$_2$CHO), and derived their emitting size. The column density and gas temperature for each species were derived at 1$\sigma$ from a multi-line analysis by applying a non-LTE approach for CH$_3$OH, and LTE population or rotational diagram analysis for the other iCOMs. Thanks to the unique estimates of the absorption from foreground millimeter dust toward IRAS 4A2, we derived for the first time unbiased gas temperatures and column densities. We resolved the IRAS 4A2 hot corino finding evidence for a chemical spatial distribution in the inner 50 au, with the outer emitting radius increasing from ~ 22-23 au for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_2$OHCHO, followed by CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (~ 27 au), CH$_3$CHO (~ 28 au), HCOOCH$_3$ (~ 36 au), and out to ~ 40 au for CH$_3$OH. Combining our estimate of the gas temperature probed by each iCOM with their beam-deconvolved emission sizes, we inferred the gas temperature profile of the hot corino on scales of 20-50 au in radius, finding a power-law index $q$ of approximately -1. We observed, for the first time, a chemical segregation in iCOMs of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino, and derived the gas temperature profile of its inner envelope. The derived profile is steeper than when considering a simple spherical collapsing and optically-thin envelope, hinting at a partially optically-thick envelope or a gravitationally unstable disk-like structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation with reactions terminating either after burning of C$^{12}$ in the leading C$^{12}$ + C$^{12}$ reaction or after burning of C$^{12}$ and O$^{16}$ to Si-group elements may occur in the low-density outer layers of exploding white dwarfs and be responsible for the production of intermediate-mass elements observed in the outer layers of Type Ia supernovae. Basic one-dimensional properties of CO-detonations have been summarized in our previous work. This paper presents the results of two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of low-density CO-detonations and discusses their multidimensional stability, cellular structure, and propagation through a constant low-density background. We find three-dimensional CO detonations to be strikingly different from their one-dimensional and two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional detonations are significantly more robust and capable of propagating without decay compared to highly unstable and marginal one- and two- dimensional detonations. The detonation cell size and whether burning of C$^{12}$ in a three-dimensional detonation wave is followed by the subsequent O$^{16}$ burning is sensitive to both the background density and the initial C$^{12}$ to O$^{16}$ mass ratio. We also discuss the possible implications for understanding the observed early time bumps in light-curves.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between stellar multiplicity and protoplanetary discs represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, offering key insights into the processes of planet formation. Protoplanetary discs act as cradles for planetary systems, yet their evolution and capacity to form planets are profoundly affected by gravitational forces within multiple stellar systems. This review synthesises recent advancements in observational and theoretical studies to explore the rich diversity of circumstellar and circumbinary discs within multiple stellar systems. We examine how stellar companions shape disc morphology through truncation, spirals, and misalignment. We also outline how dust dynamics and planetesimal formation are impacted by stellar multiplicity. On top of this, observations at high angular resolution reveal detailed disc structures, while simulations offer key insights into their evolution. Last, we consider the implications of stellar multiplicity for planetary system architectures, emphasising the diversity of planetary outcomes in such environments. Looking ahead, coordinated efforts combining high-resolution observations with advanced numerical models will be critical for unravelling the role of multiple stellar systems in shaping planetary formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonova is an optical-infrared transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei from binary neutron star mergers. Its observational characteristics depend on the mass and the nuclide composition of meger ejecta, which are sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star. We use astrophysical conditions derived from different EoSs as nucleosynthesis inputs to explore the impact of various EoS on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis and the kilonova emission. Our results show that both the abundance patterns of merger ejecta and kilonova light curves are strongly dependent on the neutron star EoSs. Given the mass of two neutron stars, the merger with a softer EoS tends to generate a larger amount of ejected material, and may lead to a brighter kilonova peak luminosity. The relationship between the neutron star EoS and the peak luminosity provides a probe for constraining the properties of EoS in multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Various phenomena of physics beyond that of the Standard Model could occur at high scale. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays are the only particles available to explore scales above a few dozens of TeV. Although these explorations are much more limited than those carried out with colliders, they provide a series of constraints in several topics such as tests of Lorentz invariance, dark matter, phase transitions in the early universe or sterile neutrinos. Several of these constraints are reviewed in these proceedings of UHECR2024 based on searches for anomalous characteristics in extensive air showers or searches for ultra-high energy gamma rays and neutrinos.
