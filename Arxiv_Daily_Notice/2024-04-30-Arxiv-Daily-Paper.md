 - **Abstract**
 We present a concise report on the '2DHybrid' method, an innovative extension of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D COS), tailored for quasar light curve analysis. Addressing the challenge of discerning periodic variations against the background of intrinsic "red" noise fluctuations, this method employs cross-correlation of wavelet transform matrices to reveal distinct correlation patterns between underlaying oscillations, offering new insights into quasar dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer (RT) is a crucial ingredient for self-consistent modelling of numerous astrophysical phenomena across cosmic history. However, on-the-fly integration into radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations is computationally demanding, particularly due to the stringent time-stepping conditions and increased dimensionality inherent in multi-frequency collisionless Boltzmann physics. The emergence of exascale supercomputers, equipped with extensive CPU cores and GPU accelerators, offers new opportunities for enhancing RHD simulations. We present a novel optimization of AREPO-RT explicitly tailored for such high-performance computing environments. We implement a novel node-to-node communication strategy that utilizes shared memory to substitute intra-node communication with direct memory access. Furthermore, combining multiple inter-node messages into a single message substantially enhances network bandwidth utilization and performance for large-scale simulations on modern supercomputers. The single-message node-to-node approach also improves performance on smaller-scale machines with less optimized networks. Furthermore, by transitioning all RT-related calculations to GPUs, we achieve a significant computational speedup of around 15 for standard benchmarks compared to the original CPU implementation. As a case study, we perform cosmological RHD simulations of the Epoch of Reionization, employing a similar setup as the THESAN project. In this context, RT becomes sub-dominant such that even without modifying the core AREPO codebase, there is an overall threefold improvement in efficiency. The advancements presented here have broad implications, potentially transforming the complexity and scalability of future simulations for a wide variety of astrophysical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous models of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) exist based on different superdense-matter physics approaches. Nevertheless, some NS properties show universal (EoS-independent) relations. Here, we propose a novel class of such universalities. Despite different physics inputs, a wide class of realistic nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models can be accurately described using only three parameters. For a given EoS, these are the mass and radius of the maximum-mass NS (or pressure and density in its center) and the radius of a half-maximum-mass star. With such a parametrization, we build universal analytic expressions for mass-radius and pressure-density relations. They form a semi-analytic mapping from the mass-radius relation to the EoS in NS cores (the so-called inverse Oppenheimer-Volkoff mapping). This mapping simplifies the process of inferring the EoS from observations of NS masses and radii. Applying it to current NS observations we set new limits on the high end of the EoS.

 - **Abstract**
 The Spectroscopic Investigation of Nebular Gas (SING) is a near-ultraviolet (NUV) low-resolution spectrograph payload designed to operate in the NUV range, 1400 $\unicode{x212B}$ -- 2700 $\unicode{x212B}$, from a stable space platform. SING telescope has a primary aperture of 298 mm, feeding the light to the long-slit UV spectrograph. SING has a field of view (FOV) of 1$^{\circ}$, achieving a spatial resolution of 1.33 arc minute and spectral resolution of 3.7 $\unicode{x212B}$ ($R\sim600$) at the central wavelength. SING employs a micro-channel plate (MCP) with a CMOS readout-based photon-counting detector. The instrument is designed to observe diffuse sources such as nebulae, supernova remnants, and the interstellar medium (ISM) to understand their chemistry. SING was selected by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to be hosted on the Chinese Space Station. The instrument will undergo qualification tests as per the launch requirements. In this paper, we describe the hardware design, optomechanical assembly, and calibration of the instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled (NMC) scalar spectator field in non-oscillatory inflationary scenarios, where there is a transition from inflation to kination domination (KD). Engineering a realistic finite-duration transition through a CMB-compatible inflaton potential, we calculate the initial tachyonic growth of the NMC field during KD and perform lattice simulations of the subsequent non-linear dynamics. We characterize the regularization effect on the tachyonic growth, either due to self-interactions, or via gravitational backreaction when the NMC field grows to dominate the energy of the universe. Our study provides the first realistic treatment of the dynamics, with significant improvements compared to previous work, where one or more of the following aspects were assumed: ($i$) the background expansion can be neglected during the tachyonic growth, ($ii$) coherence of the NMC field, ($iii$) coherence of the inflaton, ($iv$) instantaneous transition, and ($v$) a KD equation of state of exactly $w = 1$. Using our methodology, which requires none of the above assumptions, we determine the conditions to achieve proper reheating, i.e. energetic dominance of the NMC field over the inflaton. We characterize the time and energy scales of the problem, either for backreaction due to self-interactions, or (as a novelty of this work) due to gravitational effects. Finally, we calculate $\mathcal{O}(1)$ lattice correction factors to analytic scaling relations derived by some of us in previous work. This enables simple future studies without the need to run lattice simulations.
#### The atmosphere of HD 149026b: Low metal-enrichment and weak energy  transport

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST eclipse spectra of the high-density hot Saturn HD 149026b between 2.35 and 5.08 $\mu$m has allowed for in-depth study of its atmosphere. To understand its atmospheric properties, we have created a grid of 1D radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium atmosphere models and spectra with PICASO 3.0. In agreement with previous work, we find that the presence of gaseous TiO creates a thermal inversion, which is inconsistent with the data. The presence of gaseous VO, however, which condenses at temperatures 200 K cooler, does not cause such inversions but alters the temperature-pressure profile of the atmosphere. We estimate an atmospheric metallicity of $14^{+12}_{-8}\times$ solar without VO and $20^{+11}_{-8}\times$ solar with VO, a factor of $\sim 10$ times smaller than previous work from Bean et al. (2023), who relied on atmosphere retrievals. We attribute this significant difference in metallicity to a larger temperature gradient at low pressures in radiative equilibrium models. Such models with lower metallicities readily fit the strong CO$_2$ feature at 4.3 $\mu$m. Our lower estimated metallicity makes HD 149026b more consistent with the mass-metallicity relationship for other giant planets. We find a C/O ratio of $0.67^{+0.06}_{-0.27}$ with and without VO. The best-fit heat redistribution factor without VO is $1.17$, a very high value suggesting very little dayside energy transport and no energy transport to the night side. The heat redistribution factor shrinks to a more plausible value of $0.91^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, with VO, which we regard as circumstantial evidence for the molecule in the atmosphere of HD 149026b.
#### Effects of an Explicit Time-Dependent Radiation Pressure Force on  Trajectories of Primary Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17659
 - **Abstract**
 Radiation pressure exerted by solar photon output is salient to the motion of primary neutral hydrogen atoms streaming into the inner heliosphere directly from the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM). The action of a time-dependent radiation pressure force, when coupled with the usual gravitational force, changes the characteristic velocities, and therefore energies, of the atoms when they reach regions in which explorer probes are present. A study is presented that uses a 2D code to backtrace neutral hydrogen trajectories from representative target points located 1 au from the Sun. It makes use of both a radiation pressure function and a function for the photoionization rate at 1 au that oscillate with time based on measurements over a typical solar cycle, as well as a time-independent charge exchange ionization rate at 1 au. Assuming a Maxwellian distribution in the distant upwind direction, phase space data is calculated at the target points, at different moments in time. The dependence of the force on the radial particle velocity has been omitted in the analysis, such that the emphasis is on the effects of the global solar UV intensity variations through the solar cycle. This process allows for analysis of direct and indirect Maxwellian components through time and space in the time-dependent force environment. Additionally, pseudo-bound orbits caused by energy losses associated with this force environment are observed and their properties evaluated with the aim of determining their effects on potential measurements by explorer probes.
#### Deneb is a Large Amplitude Polarimetric Variable

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17707
 - **Abstract**
 We write to report the discovery that Deneb is a large amplitude polarization variable. Over a ~400 d time span from August 2022 Deneb's polarization was typically around 3900 parts-per-million (ppm) in the SDSS g'-band. Yet, it varied by several hundred ppm in an irregular way on a timescale of weeks. The largest polarization change, amounting to 2500 ppm, occurred shortly after the last pulsation ``resumption'' event identified by Abt et al. (2023) in TESS photometry. The relationship between the observed polarization -- particularly corresponding to the resumption event -- and its brightness and H-alpha spectra suggests a mechanism involving density changes in its wind and/or extended atmosphere. Smaller effects due to pulsations are not ruled out and further study is recommended.
#### Shaping the nebula around the symbiotic system R Aquarii

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) at the 2.1 m telescope of the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory (Mexico). An interpretation of these data is presented by means of the shape software to disclose the morpho-kinematics of the nebulosities associated with R Aqr. The best model that reproduces narrow-band images and position-velocity diagrams is composed by three structures: an outer (large) hourglass structure surrounding an inner bipolar with a spiral-like filament entwined around the later. Different expansion velocity patterns are predefined for each structure, which predict kinematic ages of $\tau_{1}$=450$\pm$25 yr (outer hourglass), $\tau_{2}$=240$\pm$20 yr (inner bipolar) and $\tau_{3}$=215$\pm$20 yr (spiral-like filament). We suggest that the spiral-like filament is tracing the regions of interaction of the precessing jet with the circumstellar material, which simultaneously carves the inner bipolar structure. If a similar process created the large hourglass structure, it means that the action of the jet ceased for about 230 yr. We discuss the implication for other unresolved symbiotic systems detected in X-rays.
#### Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators and Other Short-Period Variable Stars in  OGLE-IV Fields for the Outer Galactic Bulge

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we search the OGLE-IV outer Galactic bulge fields for short-period variable objects. The investigation focuses on unexplored timescales roughly below one hour in an area containing about 700 million stellar sources down to approximately I=20 mag. We concentrate mainly on Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs), which represent a recently discovered enigmatic class of short-period hot subluminous stars. We find 33 BLAPs in the period range from 7.5 to 66.5 min. Thirty-one of them are new discoveries, which increases the number of known stars of this class to over one hundred. Additional eighteen objects with pulsation-like light curve shapes and periods ranging from 17.3 to 53.7 min are presented. Very likely, these are $\delta$ Sct/SX Phe-type stars, but some of them could be pulsating hot subdwarfs or BLAPs. We also report on the detection of five eclipsing binary systems with orbital periods between 61.2 and 121.9 min and three mysterious variable objects with I-band amplitudes larger than 0.9 mag. A spectroscopic follow-up would help in the final classification of the variables.
#### Multimodal photometry and spectroscopy: a new approach to data analysis  in Astrophysics

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decade, the multi-sensory approach to data analysis has gained relevance. The possibility of including people with vision difficulties in the field of education and the dissemination of science is part of it. However, in the field of scientific research, the topic is not yet accepted, mainly due to the lack of conclusive evidence related to its robustness and performance, except for a few exceptions. On the other hand, very few of the tools that allow data to be sonifyed are focused on the user or have an interface that allows controlling the sound production process and, at the same time the visualization of data. Of those that meet this requirement and present application in the field of astronomy and astrophysics, only four have included people with visual disabilities in the design and only two of them have carried out tests with users in Focus Groups during its development. This work details the characteristics of sonoUno, with its end-user-focused design, its capabilities in specific use cases in astrophysical data analysis related to spectroscopy and photometry, following the basic software functionalities while also introducing some innovation.
#### A broken debris cascade as a possible source of hot dust emission in  transitioning planet-forming disks
 - **Authors:** Niels Swinkels, Carsten Dominik

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17816
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17816
 - **Abstract**
 Planet-forming disks turn from gas-rich, massive disks made of dust and gas into planetary systems containing only small amounts dust produced by collisions between smaller planetary objects like planetesimals, asteroids, or comets. Traditionally we talk about protoplanetary (age $\sim$1 Myr), transitional ($\sim$ 5-10 Myr), and debris disks ($\sim$ 10-hundreds of Myr), even though the overlap between these phases may be relevant. We aim to show that in the transition phase of a disk, when gas surface densities are reduced but not yet negligible, a seemingly small amount of collisional activity may lead to the production of dust on a level that is observationally relevant by creating regions of optical depth 1 or above. In particular, we aim to show that the hot dust emission component of transitional disks may in fact be debris dust produced in such collisions. We develop an analytical model to derive the conditions under which observationally relevant amounts of dust can be produced. We focus on the effect of the gas surface density during the transition phase of a disk from fully gas-dominated to the gas-poor debris stage. We show that the decrease of the gas surface density has an important effect. It allows smaller planetesimals to become collisional, starting a cascade. At the same time, small particles are not destroyed by collisions. That interrupted cascade is critical to preserve the produced dust for significant time intervals, allowing a seemingly minor amount of planetesimal collisions to be effective in producing detectable amounts of dust. The warm emission of low amounts of dust in many transitional planet-forming disks might be caused entirely by second-generation dust, exposing planetary material at a time much earlier than the age of what are traditionally considered as debris disks.
#### The Rotation Curve and Spiral Structure of Milky Way from the Hydrogen  21-cm Line Detection with Campus Radio Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation curve is significant to research on dark matter and the structure of the Milky Way. But it is a great challenge to measure rotation curve accurately, and different ways obtain distinct results. In this work, we use a DIY small radio telescope to carry out hydrogen 21-cm line observations on campus, and calculate the rotation curve of inner disk by tangent method based on the model of Przemek et al. (the rotation speed of the Sun $v(R_0)=233.6\pm2.8$ km/s, and distance to the Galactic center $R_0=8.122\pm0.031$ kpc). Furthermore, we obtain the distribution of spiral arms in the Milky Way with our data by adopting different rotation curve models. We also compare our rotation curve result with previous works, analyse the possible measurement error in the tangent method, and discuss the consistence of our result with others.
#### Radio Frequency Interference from Radio Navigation Satellite Systems:  simulations and comparison to MeerKAT single-dish data

 - **Abstract**
 Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is emitted from various sources, terrestrial or orbital, and create a nuisance for ground-based 21cm experiments. In particular, single-dish 21cm intensity mapping experiments will be highly susceptible to contamination from these sources due to its wide primary beam and sensitivity. This work aims to simulate the contamination effects emitted from orbital sources in the Radio Navigational Satellite System within the 1100-1350 MHz frequency. This simulation can be split into two parts: (I) satellite positioning, emission power, and beam response on the telescope and (II) fitting of the satellite signal to data in order to improve the original model. We use previously observed single dish MeerKAT L-band data which needs to be specially calibrated to include data contaminated by satellite-based RFI. We find that due to non-linearity effects, it becomes non-trivial to fit the satellite power. However, when masking regions where this non-linearity is problematic, we can recreate the satellite contamination with high accuracy around its peak frequencies. The simulation can predict satellite movements and signal for past and future observations, which can help in RFI avoidance and testing novel cleaning methods. The predicted signal from simulations sits below the noise in the target cosmology window for the L-band (970 - 1015 MHz) making it difficult to confirm any out-of-band emission from satellites. However, a power spectrum analysis shows that such signal can still contaminate the 21cm power spectrum at these frequencies. In our simulations, this contamination overwhelms the auto-power spectrum but still allows for a clean detection of the signal in cross-correlations with mild foreground cleaning. Whether such contamination does exist one will require further characterization of the satellite signals far away from their peak frequencies.
#### A comparative analysis of two peculiar long Gamma-ray bursts: GRB  230307A and GRB 211211A

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17913
 - **Abstract**
 GRB 211211A is a peculiar long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) with very high brightness and short burst properties. It's full lightcurve consists of three emission episodes, i.e. a precursor, a main burst and a extended emission. We find a recently detected long-duration GRB 230307A also includes the three consistent emission episodes. Furthermore, the two bursts have similar redshift 0.076 and 0.065, respectively. We perform a detail temporal and spectral analysis of the two GRBs to compare their temporal and spectral properties. Our analysis shows that the two bursts share great similarities for both the whole emission and the three corresponding emission phases, which are listed as follows: (1) they have near zero spectral lag, (2) they have very short minimum variability timescale (MVT), (3) they lie in the same region of in the MVT-$T_{90}$, Amati relation, and hardness-$T_{90}$ planes, (4) the three phases are quasi-thermal spectra, (5) both the peak energy and the low-energy index track the flux, (6) the time-resolved spectra are much wider than those of the blackbody prediced by theory model, (7) there are strong correlations between thermal flux and total flux and the correlation coefficients as well as the slopes for the corresponding stages are very consistent, (8) the photosphere emission properties are very consistent. Other investigations and observations suggest the two GRBs indeed belong to short burst with a compact star merger origin. Therefore, we think that GRB 230307A and GRB 211211A are the rare and similar GRBs and the photospheric radiation can interpret their radiation mechanisms.
#### Multiline observations of hydrogen, helium, and carbon  radio-recombination lines toward Orion A: A detailed dynamical study and  direct determination of physical conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of hydrogen, helium, and carbon millimeter-wave radio-recombination lines (RRLs) toward ten representative positions throughout the Orion Nebula complex, using the Yebes 40m telescope in the Q band (31.3 GHz to 50.6 GHz) at an angular resolution of about $45\arcsec$ ($\sim$0.09\,pc). The observed positions include the Orion Nebula (M42) with the Orion Molecular Core 1, M43, and the Orion Molecular Core 3 bordering on NGC 1973, 1975, and 1977. While hydrogen and helium RRLs arise in the ionized gas surrounding the massive stars in the Orion Nebula complex, carbon RRLs stem from the neutral gas of the adjacent photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). The high velocity resolution ($0.3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) enables us to discern the detailed dynamics of the RRL emitting neutral and ionized gas. We compare the carbon RRLs with SOFIA/upGREAT observations of the [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ line and IRAM 30m observations of the $^{13}$CO (J=2-1) line. Using the [CII] and [$^{13}$CII] intensities with the carbon RRL intensities, we can infer physical conditions (electron temperature and electron density) in the PDR gas using non-LTE excitation models. Our observations are sensitive enough to detect faint lines toward two positions in OMC1, that may be attributed to RRLs of C$^+$ or O$^+$. In general, the RRL line widths of both the ionized and neutral gas, as well as the [CII] and $^{13}$CO line widths, are broader than thermal, indicating significant turbulence in the interstellar medium, which transitions from super-Alfv\'enic and subsonic in the ionized gas to sub-Alfv\'enic and supersonic in the molecular gas. At the scales probed by our observations, the turbulent pressure dominates the pressure balance in the neutral and molecular gas, while in the ionized gas the turbulent pressure is much smaller than the thermal pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of the James Webb Space Telescope and the development of other advanced observatories (e.g., ELTs, LIFE and HWO) marks a pivotal moment in the quest to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. Motivated by these advancements, we conduct theoretical explorations of exoplanetary atmospheres, focusing on refining our understanding of planetary climate and habitability. Our study investigates the impact of ozone on the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b in a synchronous orbit, utilizing coupled climate chemistry model simulations and dynamical systems theory. The latter quantifies compound dynamical metrics in phase space through the inverse of co-persistence ($\theta$) and co-dimension (d), of which low values correspond to stable atmospheric states. Initially, we scrutinized the influence of ozone on temperature and wind speed. Including interactive ozone (i.e., coupled atmospheric (photo)chemistry) reduces the hemispheric difference in temperature from 68 K to 64 K, increases ($\sim+$7 K) atmospheric temperature at an altitude range of $\sim$20-50 km, and increases variability in the compound dynamics of temperature and wind speed. Moreover, with interactive ozone, wind speed during highly temporally stable states is weaker than for unstable ones, and ozone transport to the nightside gyres during unstable states is enhanced compared to stable ones ($\sim+$800 DU). We conclude that including interactive ozone significantly influences Earth-like exoplanets' chemistry and climate dynamics. This study establishes a novel pathway for comprehending the influence of photochemical species on the climate dynamics of potentially habitable Earth-like exoplanets. We envisage an extension of this framework to other exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 With three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations we show that the size of the decretion disc and the structure of the accretion flow onto the neutron star in a Be/X-ray binary strongly depends upon the disc aspect ratio, $H/R$. We simulate a Be star disc that is coplanar to the orbit of a circularly or moderately eccentric neutron star companion, thereby maximising the effects of tidal truncation. For low disc aspect ratio, $H/R\lesssim 0.1$, the disc is efficiently tidally truncated by the neutron star. Most material that escapes the Roche lobe of the Be star is accreted by the neutron star through tidal streams. For larger disc aspect ratio, the outflow rate through the Be star disc is higher, tidal truncation becomes inefficient, the disc fills the Roche lobe and extends to the orbit of the companion. Some material escapes the binary as a gas stream that begins near the L2 point. While the accretion rate onto the neutron star is higher, the fraction of the outflow that is accreted by the neutron star is smaller. Low density Be star discs are expected to be approximately isothermal, such that $H/R$ increases with radius. Tidal truncation is therefore weaker for larger separation binaries, and lower mass primaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a $8' \times 12'$ emission shell brightest in [O III] centered on the X-ray binary B[e] star, CI Cameleopardalis (CI Cam). This shell, detected during a survey of optical emission associated with the Galactic supernova remnant G150.3+4.5, is seen outside but immediately adjacent to the remnant's optical filaments along its northwestern edge. Assuming this shell is related to CI Cam's strong winds and transient outbursts, the adoption of CI Cam's Gaia DR3 statistically corrected distance of 4.1$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc yields shell dimensions $\simeq$ 9.5 pc $\times$ 14.3 pc. While the distance to the G150.3+4.5 remnant is uncertain, the appearance of CI Cam's emission shell so close to the SNR's optical filaments appears likely to be a chance coincidence.

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize the current best polychromatic (10 to 20 % bandwidth) contrast performance demonstrated in the laboratory by different starlight suppression approaches and systems designed to directly characterize exoplanets around nearby stars. We present results obtained by internal coronagraph and external starshade experimental testbeds using entrance apertures equivalent to off-axis or on-axis telescopes, either monolithic or segmented. For a given angular separation and spectral bandwidth, the performance of each starlight suppression system is characterized by the values of raw contrast (before image processing), off-axis (exoplanet) core throughput, and post-calibration contrast (the final 1 sigma detection limit of off-axis point sources, after image processing). To place the current laboratory results in the perspective of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission, we simulate visible observations of a fiducial Earth/Sun twin system at 12 pc, assuming a 6m (inscribed diameter) collecting aperture and a realistic end-to-end optical throughput. The exposure times required for broadband exoearth detection (20% bandwidth around a wavelength of 0.55 microns) and visible spectroscopic observations (R=70) are then computed assuming various levels of starlight suppression performance, including the values currently demonstrated in the laboratory. Using spectroscopic exposure time as a simple metric, our results point to key starlight suppression system design performance improvements and trades to be conducted in support of HWO exoplanet science capabilities. These trades may be explored via numerical studies, lab experiments, as well as high contrast space-based observations and demonstrations.

 - **Abstract**
 Current sheet is a common structure involved in solar eruptions. However, it is observed in minority of the events and the physical properties of its fine structures during a solar eruption are rarely investigated. Here, we report an on-disk observation that displays 108 compact, circular or elliptic bright structures, presumably plasma blobs, propagating bidirectionally along a flare current sheet during a period of $\sim$24 minutes. From extreme ultraviolet images, we have investigated the temporal variation of the blob number around the flare peak time. The current sheet connects the flare loops and the erupting filament. The width, duration, projected velocity, temperature, and density of these blobs are $\sim$1.7$\pm$0.5\,Mm, $\sim$79$\pm$57\,s, $\sim$191$\pm$81\,\kms, $\sim$10$^{6.4\pm0.1}$ K, and $\sim$10$^{10.1\pm0.3}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The reconnection site rises with a velocity of $\leqslant$69\,\kms. The observational results suggest that plasmoid instability plays an important role in the energy release process of solar eruptions.

 An ingeniously designed autoencoder (PrimeNet) using simulated observations of future generation ECHO satellite mission recovers CMB B mode map, angular spectrum for multipoles $\ell \lesssim 9$ and tensor to scalar ratio $r$ {\it limited only by cosmic variance down to $r= 0.0001$ and below}. We use diverse, realistically complex and detailed foreground models. PrimeNet predicts accurate results even when data with $r=0$ are tested which were not used in training, implying robust and efficient predictive power. The work eliminates a major bottleneck of weak CMB B mode reconstruction and takes a leap forward for understanding fundamental physics of the primordial Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally accepted that the Moon accreted from the disk formed by an impact between the proto-Earth and impactor, but its details are highly debated. Some models suggest that a Mars-sized impactor formed a silicate melt-rich (vapor-poor) disk around Earth, whereas other models suggest that a highly energetic impact produced a silicate vapor-rich disk. Such a vapor-rich disk, however, may not be suitable for the Moon formation, because moonlets, building blocks of the Moon, of 100 m-100 km may experience strong gas drag and fall onto Earth on a short timescale, failing to grow further. This problem may be avoided if large moonlets ($\gg 100$ km) form very quickly by streaming instability, which is a process to concentrate particles enough to cause gravitational collapse and rapid formation of planetesimals or moonlets. Here, we investigate the effect of the streaming instability in the Moon-forming disk for the first time and find that this instability can quickly form $\sim 100$ km-sized moonlets. However, these moonlets are not large enough to avoid strong drag and they still fall onto Earth quickly. This suggests that the vapor-rich disks may not form the large Moon, and therefore the models that produce vapor-poor disks are supported. This result is applicable to general impact-induced moon-forming disks, supporting the previous suggestion that small planets ($<1.6 R_\oplus$) are good candidates to host large moons because their impact-induced disks would be likely vapor-poor. We find a limited role of streaming instability in a satellite formation in an impact-induced disk, whereas it plays a key role during planet formation.

 Eclipsing binary systems have a unique feature, which enables scientists to obtain precise fundamental star parameters, which opens to greater area of astrophysics studies. In this study, we have derived the fundamental parameters, the evolutionary status, and the birthplace of V454 Aur in the Galaxy by combining radial velocity, photometric, and spectral energy distribution data. We have updated ephemerides and period of V454 Aur as $2458850.80136_{-0.00001}^{\,+0.00001}$ and $27.0198177_{-0.0000003}^{\,+0.0000003}$, respectively. We obtain $1.173^{\,+0.016}_{-0.016}$ $M_\odot$ and $1.203^{\,+0.022}_{-0.026}$ $R_\odot$ for the primary component and $1.045^{\,+0.015}_{-0.014}$ $M_\odot$ and $0.993^{\,+0.034}_{-0.027}$ $R_\odot$ for the secondary component. The effective temperatures for the components are accurately determined via SED data as $6250^{\,+150}_{-150}$ K and $5966^{\,+109}_{-89}$ K for the primary component and the secondary component, respectively. The metallicity of the components is derived from evolutionary tracks, which implies slightly higher than Solar metallicity. According to analysis, the components of V454 Aur are on the main sequence. Our distance calculation for the system is, which is $65.07^{\,+2}_{-3}$ pc, in excellent agreement with \textit{Gaia} astrometric data, which is $65.07^{\,+0.09}_{-0.09}$ pc. The current age of the system is $1.19_{-0.09}^{\,+0.08}$ Gyr, and it will start to mass transfer between components in 5 Gyr from now on. Dynamical orbital analysis shows that V454 Aur follows a boxy pattern around the Galactic centre and is a member of the thin-disc component of the Galaxy. Considering the age and metallicity of this system, it was found to have formed just outside the Solar circle.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses of cosmic shear typically condense weak lensing information over a range of scales to a single cosmological parameter, $S_8$. This paper presents a method to extract more information from Stage-IV cosmic shear measurements by directly reconstructing the matter power spectrum from linear to non-linear scales. We demonstrate that cosmic shear surveys will be sensitive to the shape of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales. We show that it should be possible to distinguish between different models of baryonic feedback and we investigate the impact of intrinsic alignments and observational systematics on forecasted constraints. In addition to providing important information on galaxy formation, power spectrum reconstruction should provide a definitive answer to the question of whether weak lensing measurements of $S_8$ on linear scales are consistent with the $\textit{Planck}$ $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In addition, power spectrum reconstruction may lead to new discoveries on the composition of the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multi-messenger observations of supernovae. Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to supernovae using quantitative analysis techniques for supernova neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star and the distance to the supernova. The radius of a neutron star is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the supernova can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of supernovae, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multi-messenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to supernovae through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of neutron star radii. This data, via the neutron star mass-radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.

 - **Abstract**
 $ $Low density cosmic voids gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB), leaving a negative imprint on the CMB convergence $\kappa$. This effect provides insight into the distribution of matter within voids, and can also be used to study the growth of structure. We measure this lensing imprint by cross-correlating the Planck CMB lensing convergence map with voids identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data set, covering approximately 4,200 deg$^2$ of the sky. We use two distinct void-finding algorithms: a 2D void-finder which operates on the projected galaxy density field in thin redshift shells, and a new code, Voxel, which operates on the full 3D map of galaxy positions. We employ an optimal matched filtering method for cross-correlation, using the MICE N-body simulation both to establish the template for the matched filter and to calibrate detection significances. Using the DES Y3 photometric luminous red galaxy sample, we measure $A_\kappa$, the amplitude of the observed lensing signal relative to the simulation template, obtaining $A_\kappa = 1.03 \pm 0.22$ ($4.6\sigma$ significance) for Voxel and $A_\kappa = 1.02 \pm 0.17$ ($5.9\sigma$ significance) for 2D voids, both consistent with $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We additionally invert the 2D void-finding process to identify superclusters in the projected density field, for which we measure $A_\kappa = 0.87 \pm 0.15$ ($5.9\sigma$ significance). The leading source of noise in our measurements is Planck noise, implying that future data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT) and CMB-S4 will increase sensitivity and allow for more precise measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution VLBI observations revealed a quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the relativistic jets of many blazars, which represents a standing recollimation shock. The VLBA monitoring of the BL Lacertae jet at 15~GHz shows the QSC at a projected distance of about 0.26~mas from the radio core. We study the trajectory and kinematics of the QSC in BL Lacertae on sub-parsec scales using 15~GHz VLBA maps of 164 observations over 20 years from the MOJAVE program and 2~cm VLBA Survey. To reconstruct the QSC's intrinsic trajectory, we use moving average and trajectory refinement procedures to smooth out the effects of core displacement and account for QSC positioning errors. We identified 22 QSC reversal patterns on spatial scales ranging from 0.01~mas to 0.05~mas and with a frequency of $\sim 1.5$ per year. Most reversals have an acute angle $<90\degr$ at the turning point, and few have a loop-shaped or arc-shaped trajectory. The directions of reversals (clockwise or counterclockwise) appear to be random. Combinations of reversals show reversible and quasi-periodic motion. We propose a model in which the reverse motion of the QSC is due to the passage of a relativistic transverse jet wave through a fixed location of the QSC, similar to the transverse motion of a seagull on a wave. The QSC motion is governed by the amplitude, velocity, and tilt of the relativistic transverse wave. According to the model, relativistic waves are generated upstream of QSC. In the active state of the jet, the directions of the twisting waves are random, similar to the behaviour of the wave in a high-pressure hose, while in the jet stable state, the wave makes quasi-periodic oscillations with regular twisting. In this model the transverse speed of the QSC in the host galaxy frame is subluminal ($<0.3\,c$), but to an observer it appears superluminal ($\sim 2\,c$).

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Protostellar outflows exhibit large variations in their structure depending on the observed gas emission. This study analyzes the atomic jet and molecular outflow in the Class I protostar, TMC1A to characterize morphology and identify previously undetected spatial features with JWST's NIRSpec IFU. In addition to identifying a large number of Fe II and H2 lines, we have detected the bipolar Fe jet by revealing, for the first time, the presence of a red-shifted atomic jet. Similarly, the red-shifted component of the H2 slower wide-angle outflow is observed. Both Fe II and H2 red-shifted emission exhibit significantly lower flux densities compared to their blue-shifted counterparts. Additionally, we report the detection of a collimated high-velocity (100 km s-1), blue-shifted H2 outflow, suggesting the presence of a molecular jet in addition to the well-known wider angle low-velocity structure. The Fe II and H2 jets show multiple intensity peaks along the jet axis, which may be associated with ongoing or recent outburst events. In addition to the variation in their intensities, the H2 wide-angle outflow exhibits a "ring"-like structure. The blue-shifted H2 outflow also shows a left-right brightness asymmetry likely due to interactions with the surrounding ambient medium and molecular outflows. Using the Fe II line ratios, the extinction along the atomic jet is estimated to be between Av = 10-30 on the blue-shifted side, with a trend of decreasing extinction with distance from the protostar. A similar Av is found for the red-shifted side, supporting the argument for an intrinsic red-blue outflow lobe asymmetry rather than environmental effects such as extinction. This intrinsic difference revealed by the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST, suggests that younger outflows already exhibit the red-blue side asymmetry more commonly observed towards jets associated with Class II disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is ubiquitously turbulent across many physically distinct environments within the Galaxy. Turbulence is key in controlling the structure and dynamics of the ISM, regulating star formation, and transporting metals within the Galaxy. We present the first observational measurements of turbulence in neutral hydrogen entrained in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way. Using recent MeerKAT observations of two extra-planar HI clouds above (gal. lat.$\,\sim7.0^{\circ}$) and below (gal. lat.$\,\sim-3.9^{\circ}$) the Galactic disc, we analyse centroid velocity and column density maps to estimate the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v,\mathrm{3D}}$), the turbulent sonic Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), the volume density dispersion ($\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$), and the turbulence driving parameter ($b$). We also present a new prescription for estimating the spatial temperature variations of HI in the presence of related molecular gas. We measure these turbulence quantities on the global scale of each cloud, but also spatially map their variation across the plane-of-sky extent of each cloud by using a roving kernel method. We find that the two clouds share very similar characteristics of their internal turbulence, despite their varying latitudes. Both clouds are in the sub-to-trans-sonic Mach regime, and have primarily compressively-driven ($b\sim1$) turbulence. Given that there is no known active star-formation present in these clouds, this may be indicative of the way the cloud-wind interaction injects energy into the entrained atomic material on parsec scales.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents three distinct wave trains that occurred on 2023 April 21: a broad quasi-periodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave train and a bi-directional narrow QFP wave train. The broad QFP wave train expands outward in a circular wavefront, while bi-directional narrow QFP wave trains propagate in the northward and southward directions, respectively. The concurrent presence of the wave trains offers a remarkable opportunity to investigate their respective triggering mechanisms. Measurement shows that the broad QFP wave train's speed is 300- 1100 km/s in different propagating directions. There is a significant difference in the speed of the bi-directional narrow QFP wave trains: the southward propagation achieves 1400 km/s, while the northward propagation only reaches about 550 km/s accompanied by a deceleration of about 1- 2 kms-2. Using the wavelet analysis, we find that the periodicity of the propagating wave trains in the southward and northward directions closely matches the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) exhibited by the flares. Based on these results, the narrow QFP wave trains were most likely excited by the intermittent energy release in the accompanying flare. In contrast, the broad QFP wave train had a tight relationship with the erupting filament, probably attributed to the unwinding motion of the erupting filament or the leakage of the fast sausage wave train inside the filament body.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Magellan Telescope will use laser tomography adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric turbulence using artificial guide stars created in the sodium layer of the atmosphere (altitude ~95km). The sodium layer has appreciable thickness (~11km) and this results in the laser guide star being an elongated cylinder shape. Wavefront sensing with a Shack-Hartmann is challenging, as subapertures located further away from the laser launch position image an increasingly elongated perspective of the laser guide star. Large detectors can be used to adequately pack and sample the images on the detector, however, this increases readout noise and limits the design space available for the wavefront sensor. To tackle this challenge, we propose an original solution based on nano-engineered meta-optics tailored to produce a spatially varying anamorphic image scale compression. We present meta-lenslet array designs that can deliver ~100% of the full anamorphic image size reduction required for focal lengths down to 8mm, and greater than 50% image size reduction for focal lengths down to 2mm. This will allow greatly improved sampling of the available information across the whole wavefront sensor, while still being a viable design within the limits of current-generation fabrication facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The rising part of a tidal disruption event light curve provides unique insight into early emission and the onset of accretion. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain the pre-peak emission, including shocks from debris interaction and reprocessing of disk emission. We study the pre-peak emission and its influence on the gas circularization by a series of gray radiation hydrodynamic simulations with varying black hole mass. We find that given a super-Eddington fallback rate of 10\dot{M}_{Edd}, the stream-stream collision can occur multiple times and drive strong outflows of up to 9\dot{M}_{Edd}. By dispersing gas to \gtrsim 100rs, the outflow can delay gas circularization and leads to sub-Eddington accretion rates during the first few stream-stream collisions. The stream-stream collision shock and circularization shock can sustain a luminosity of ~10^{44}erg/s for days. The luminosity is generally sub-Eddington and shows a weak correlation with accretion rate at early time. The outflow is optically thick, yielding a reprocessing layer with a size of ~10^{14} cm and photospheric temperature of ~4\times10^{4}K.

 - **Abstract**
 New advancements in radio data post-processing are underway within the SKA precursor community, aiming to facilitate the extraction of scientific results from survey images through a semi-automated approach. Several of these developments leverage deep learning (DL) methodologies for diverse tasks, including source detection, object or morphology classification, and anomaly detection. Despite substantial progress, the full potential of these methods often remains untapped due to challenges associated with training large supervised models, particularly in the presence of small and class-unbalanced labelled datasets. Self-supervised learning has recently established itself as a powerful methodology to deal with some of the aforementioned challenges, by directly learning a lower-dimensional representation from large samples of unlabelled data. The resulting model and data representation can then be used for data inspection and various downstream tasks if a small subset of labelled data is available. In this work, we explored contrastive learning methods to learn suitable radio data representation from unlabelled images taken from the ASKAP EMU and SARAO MeerKAT GPS surveys. We evaluated trained models and the obtained data representation over smaller labelled datasets, also taken from different radio surveys, in selected analysis tasks: source detection and classification, and search for objects with peculiar morphology. For all explored downstream tasks, we reported and discussed the benefits brought by self-supervised foundational models built on radio data.

 - **Abstract**
 Explaining the origin of supermassive black holes via a primordial origin is severely challenged by the tight spectral distortion constraints on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations. Following the first calculation of how the $\mu$ constraints are modified by non-Gaussianity in a companion paper, we here make the first robust constraints on primordial black hole formation under large non-Gaussianity. Even the infinite $f_{\rm NL}$ limit is insufficiently non-Gaussian but much higher-order non-Gaussianity of the form ${\cal R}={\cal R}_{\rm G}^5$ may allow the formation of any mass primordial black hole without conflicting with distortion constraints. We caution that such extreme models face other challenges.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar intensity interferometry (SII) is based on the correlation of the light intensity fluctuations of a star detected at two or more telescopes, with no need to combine the collected photons directly. A measurement of the correlation in full "photon-counting mode" was experimented with fast photon counters in Italy (2016-2020) and is currently being adapted to the ASTRI Mini-Array. Performing image synthesis with "photon-counting" SII requires a series of preparatory activities that involve the optimization of the pipelines for the treatment of time series acquired at extremely high photon rates, the development of efficient and innovative algorithms for the cross-correlation of the arrival times in large time series and the development of a preliminary version of a dedicated pipeline for the synthesis of images starting from interferometric data. Here we present the project and the present status of the activities.

 - **Abstract**
 We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm's law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, the electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field, but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that are observed in some molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar corona has been judged to consist of free electrons and highly ionized ions with extremely high temperature as a widely accepted knowledge. This view is changed by our eclipse observations. Distributions of cool matter represented by neutral iron atoms in hot inner solar corona are presented via derived global maps of solar Fraunhofer(F-) and Emission(E-) coronae, compared with those of continuum(Kontinuierlich, K-) corona formed by free electrons. The maps are obtained from simultaneous observations of dual filtering bands centered respectively at 659.4nm and 660.1nm, performed from twin telescopes during the total solar eclipse on April 20, 2023 at Com town of East Timor, assisted for judgement via spectral images obtained by a portable spectrograph. They show respectively presences of these neutral iron atoms yielding 659.3nm and 659.4nm lines in both the quiet sun and active regions. The distribution of the cool matter in form of line depression forms an inner F-corona, different from that of the cool matter in form of line enhancement. Both the distributions show a crucial difference from that of the free electrons represented by the K-corona map. It is also found that intensities of the F-corona and the E-corona induced by these neutral atoms are only small fractions of the K-corona, and the diffusion can be seen clearly in all these maps. They uncover also that the coronal heating resources do not distribute pervasively but likely form a thermodynamic griddle where minor photospheric neutral atoms can escape from the heating into the corona globally.

 - **Abstract**
 We compile the catalog of Hvar Observatory solar observations in the time period corresponding to regular digitally stored chromospheric and photospheric observations 2010-2019. We make basic characterisation of observed phenomena and compare them to catalogs which are based on full disc solar images. We compile a catalog of observed ARs consisting of 1100 entries, where each AR is classified according to McIntosh and Mt Wilson classifications. We find that HVAR observations are biased towards more frequently observing more complex ARs and observing them in longer time periods, likely related to the small FOV not encompassing the whole solar disc. In H$\alpha$ observations we catalog conspicuous filaments/prominences and flares. We characterise filaments according to their location, chirality (if possible) and eruptive signatures. Analysis of the eruptive filaments reveals a slight bias in HVAR catalog towards observation of partial eruptions, possibly related to the observers tendency to observe filament which already showed some activity. In the flare catalog we focus on their observed eruptive signatures (loops or ribbons) and their shape. In addition, we associate them to GOES soft X-ray flares to determine their corresponding class. We find that HVAR observations seem biased towards more frequently observing stronger flares and observing them in longer time periods. We demonstrate the feasibility of the catalog on a case study of the flare detected on 2 August 2011 in HVAR H$\alpha$ observations and related Sun-to-Earth phenomena. Through flare-CME-ICME association we demonstrate the agreement of remote and in situ properties. The data used for this study, as well as the catalog, are made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 It might be necessary to access the impact of recent released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data on the state equation of dark energy in the Hubble-tension-free cosmologies. In this paper, we report the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM model with pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) using Planck+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES dataset. The results reveal that $H_0=72.43\pm 0.75$, $w_0=-0.971\pm0.035$, $w_a=-0.347\pm0.120$ for axion-like EDE, while $H_0=73.32\pm 0.64$, $w_0=-0.923\pm0.054$, $w_a=-0.435\pm0.132$ for AdS-EDE, and also not surprisingly the spectral index of primordial scalar perturbation moves towards $n_s=1$. It looks like that in corresponding models the bestfit $H_0$ are higher than those with pre-DESI BAO data, but without the further exacerbation of $S_8$ tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and its distribution is critical to understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In optical studies of ionized nebulae, the only way to determine the C/H abundance is by using faint CII recombination lines (RLs). However, these lines give systematically higher abundances than their collisionally excited counterparts, observable at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Therefore, a proper understanding of the excitation mechanisms of the faint permitted lines is crucial for addressing this long-standing abundance discrepancy (AD) problem. Aims. In this study, we investigate the excitation mechanisms of CII lines {\lambda}{\lambda}3918, 3920, 4267, 5342, 6151, 6462, 7231, 7236, 7237 and 9903. Methods. We use the DEep Spectra of Ionized REgions Database (DESIRED) that contains spectra of HII regions, planetary nebulae and other objects to analyze the fluorescence contributions to these lines and the accuracy of the atomic recombination data used to model the C+ ion. Results. We find that CII {\lambda}{\lambda}4267, 5342, 6151, 6462 and 9903 arise exclusively from recombinations with no fluorescent contributions. In addition, the recombination theory for these lines is consistent with the observations. Our findings show that the AD problem for C2+ is not due to fluorescence in the widely used CII lines or errors in their atomic parameters, but to other phenomena like temperature variations or chemical inhomogeneities. On the other hand, CII {\lambda}{\lambda}3918, 3920, 6578, 7231, 7236, 7237 have important fluorescent contributions, which are inadvisable for tracing the C2+ abundances. We also discuss the effects of possible inconsistencies in the atomic effective recombination coefficients of CII {\lambda}{\lambda}6578, 7231, 7236 and 7237.
#### The population of Galactic supernova remnants in the TeV range

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely to be significant sources of cosmic rays up to the knee of the local cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum. They produce gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) ($E>0.1$ TeV) range via: hadronic interactions with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions with soft photons. Current observations have lead to the detection of about a dozen of VHE SNRs and future instruments should increase this number. The details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing VHE gamma-rays at SNRs are poorly understood. We aim to study the population of SNRs detected in the TeV range and its properties, and to address fundamental questions of particle acceleration at SNR shocks: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of acceleration? Is the VHE emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic interactions? By means of Monte Carlo methods, we simulate the population of SNRs in the VHE domain and confront our simulations to H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). We explore the parameter space: the slope of accelerated particles $\alpha$, the electron-to-proton ratio $K_{\rm ep}$, and the efficiency of particle acceleration $\xi $. We found sets of parameters for which $\gtrsim 90$\% of realisations are found in agreements with the HGPS data. These parameters are found $ 4.2 \gtrsim \alpha \gtrsim 4.1 $, $10^{-5} \lesssim K_{\rm ep} \lesssim 10^{-4.5}$, and $0.03 \lesssim \xi\lesssim 0.1 $ . We were able to strongly argue against some regions of the parameter space: $\alpha \lesssim 4.05$, $\alpha \gtrsim 4.35$, or $K_{\rm ep} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$. Our model is so far able to explain the SNR population of the HGPS. Our approach, confronted to the results of future systematic surveys, will help remove degeneracy in the solutions, and to better understand particle acceleration at SNR shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 The correlation of light from two sources leads to an interference pattern if they belong to a specific time interval known as the coherence time, denoted as $\Delta \tau$. The relationship governing this phenomenon is $\Delta \tau \Delta \nu \approx 1$, where $\Delta \nu$ represents the bandwidth of the light. This requirement is not satisfied, and hence, interference fringes are not observable in the case of ordinary (thermal) light. In the 1950s, Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss explored interference phenomena using a narrow bandwidth of thermal light. This investigation led to the discovery of the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect (or the HBT effect in short), which has since found applications in various fields, particularly stellar observations and quantum optics. This article briefly traces the history of the HBT effect and its applications in various fields, including stellar observations. More importantly, it outlines the basic theoretical framework of this effect, followed by the design and results of the correlation in intensity fluctuation of a pseudo-thermal light in a college laboratory setting (Michelson interferometer).

 - **Abstract**
 Major European Union-funded research infrastructure and open science projects have traditionally included dissemination work, for mostly one-way communication of the research activities. Here we present and review our radical re-envisioning of this work, by directly engaging citizen science volunteers into the research. We summarise the citizen science in the Horizon-funded projects ASTERICS (Astronomy ESFRI and Research Infrastructure Clusters) and ESCAPE (European Science Cluster of Astronomy and Particle Physics ESFRI Research Infrastructures), engaging hundreds of thousands of volunteers in providing millions of data mining classifications. Not only does this have enormously more scientific and societal impact than conventional dissemination, but it facilitates the direct research involvement of what is often arguably the most neglected stakeholder group in Horizon projects, the science-inclined public. We conclude with recommendations and opportunities for deploying crowdsourced data mining in the physical sciences, noting that the primary goal is always the fundamental research question; if public engagement is the primary goal to optimise, then other, more targeted approaches may be more effective.
#### A comprehensive kinematic model of the LMC disk from star clusters and  field stars using Gaia DR3: Tracing the disk characteristics, rotation, bar,  and the outliers

 - **Abstract**
 The internal kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk have been modeled by several studies using different tracers with varying coverage, resulting in a range of parameters. Here, we modeled the LMC disk using 1705 star clusters and field stars, based on a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, using the Gaia DR3 data. The dependency of model parameters on the age, coverage, and strength of the clusters are also presented. This is the first comprehensive 2D kinematic study using star clusters. Red clump (RC) stars and young main-sequence stars are also modeled for comparison. The clusters and field stars are found to have distinctly different kinematic centers, disk inclination, position angle of the line of nodes, and scale radius. We also note a significant radial variation of the disk parameters. Clusters and young stars are found to have a large residual proper motion and a relatively large velocity dispersion when compared to the RC field population, which could be due to perturbation from the bar and spiral arms. We traced the presence of large residual proper motion and non-circular motion among clusters likely to be due to the bar and detected a decrease in the scale radius as a result of the possible evolution of the bar. The kinematically deviant clusters point to a spatio-temporal disturbance in the LMC disk, matching with the expected impact factor and time of the recent collision between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear reactions drive the stellar evolution and contribute to the stellar and galactic chemicals abundances. New determinations of the nuclear reaction rates for key fusion reactions of stellar evolution are now available, paving the way to improved stellar model predictions. We explore the impact of new C12+C12 reaction rates for massive stars evolution, structure, and nucleosynthesis during core carbon-burning phase. We analyse the consequences for stars of different masses including rotation-induced mixing. We computed a grid of massive stars at solar metallicity using the stellar evolution code GENEC. We explored the results using three different references for the rates, with or without rotation. We study the effect in terms of evolution, structure, and critical mass limit between intermediate and massive stars. We explored the consequences for nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase by means of a one-zone nucleosynthesis code. We confirm the significant impact of using the recent nuclear reaction rates following the hindrance hypothesis as well as the mass-dependent effect of a resonance at 2.14 MeV. This impacts the characteristics of the core of stars from the C-ignition and during all the core C-burning phase. The change of rates modifies the central nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase, resulting in an underproduction of s-process elements. The correct and accurate determination of the nuclear reaction rates, with especially the existence and location of resonances, impacts stellar evolution in many aspects affecting the model predictions. The choice of the nuclear reaction rates reference for the C12+C12 fusion reaction changes significantly the behaviour of the core during the C-burning phase. This choice is then to be taken carefully in order to interpret stellar evolution and fate of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the merger of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in numerical relativity, focusing on the properties of the remnant disk and the ejecta, varying the mass of compactness of the NS and the mass and spin of the BH. We find that within the precision of our numerical simulations, the remnant disk mass and ejecta mass normalized by the NS baryon mass ($\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$, respectively), and the cutoff frequency $f_{\rm{cut}}$ normalized by the initial total gravitational mass of the system at infinite separation approximately agree among the models with the same NS compactness $C_{\rm{NS}}=M_{\rm{NS}}/R_{\rm{NS}}$, mass ratio $Q=M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\rm{NS}}$, and dimensionless BH spin $\chi_{\rm{BH}}$ irrespective of the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ in the range of $1.092$--$1.691\,M_\odot$. This result shows that the merger outcome depends sensitively on $Q$, $\chi_{\rm BH}$, and $C_{\rm{NS}}$ but only weekly on $M_{\rm{NS}}$. This justifies the approach of studying the dependence of NS tidal disruptions on the NS compactness by fixing the NS mass but changing the EOS. We further perform simulations with massive NSs of $M_{\rm{NS}}=1.8M_{\odot}$, and compare our results of $\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$ with those given by existing fitting formulas to test their robustness for more compact NSs. We find that the fitting formulas obtained in the previous studies are accurate within the numerical errors assumed, while our results also suggest that further improvement is possible by systematically performing more precise numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We explore the dynamical friction on a test mass in gravitational systems in the Quasi linear formulation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (QuMOND). Methods. Exploiting the quasi linearity of QuMOND we derive a simple expression for the dynamical friction in akin to its Newtonian counterpart in the standard Chandrasekhar derivation. Moreover, adopting a mean field approach based on the Liouville equation we obtain a more rigorous (though in integral form) dynamical friction formula that can be evaluated numerically for a given choice of the QuMOND interpolation function. Results. Consistently with previous work, we observe that dynamical friction is stronger in MOND with respect to a baryon only Newtonian system with the same mass distribution. This amounts to a correction of the Coulomb logarithmic factor via extra terms proportional to the MOND radius of the system. Moreover, with the aid of simple numerical experiments we confirm our theoretical predictions and those of previous work on MOND.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultrahot Jupiters are a type of gaseous exoplanet that orbit extremely close to their host star, resulting in significantly high equilibrium temperatures. In recent years, high-resolution emission spectroscopy has been broadly employed in observing the atmospheres of ultrahot Jupiters. We used the CARMENES spectrograph to observe the high-resolution spectra of the dayside hemisphere of MASCARA-1b in both visible and near-infrared. Through cross-correlation analysis, we detected signals of \ion{Fe}{i} and \ion{Ti}{i}. Based on these detections, we conducted an atmospheric retrieval and discovered the presence of a strong inversion layer in the planet's atmosphere. The retrieved Ti and Fe abundances are broadly consistent with solar abundances. In particular, we obtained a relative abundance of [Ti/Fe] as $-1.0 \pm 0.8$ under the free retrieval and $-0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.8}$ under the chemical equilibrium retrieval, suggesting the absence of significant titanium depletion on this planet. Furthermore, we considered the influence of planetary rotation on spectral line profiles. The resulting equatorial rotation speed was determined to be $4.4^{+1.6}_{-2.0}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which agrees with the rotation speed induced by tidal locking.
#### Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions

 - **Abstract**
 The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.
#### Searching for planet-driven dust spirals in ALMA visibilities

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA (Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array) observations of the thermal emission from protoplanetary disc dust have revealed a wealth of substructures that could evidence embedded planets, but planet-driven spirals, one of the more compelling lines of evidence, remain relatively rare. Existing works have focused on detecting these spirals using methods that operate in image space. Here, we explore the planet detection capabilities of fitting planet-driven spirals to disc observations directly in visibility space. We test our method on synthetic ALMA observations of planet-containing model discs for a range of disc/observational parameters, finding it significantly outperforms image residuals in identifying spirals in these observations and is able to identify spirals in regions of the parameter space in which no gaps are detected. These tests suggest that a visibility-space fitting approach warrants further investigation and may be able to find planet-driven spirals in observations that have not yet been found with existing approaches. We also test our method on six discs in the Taurus molecular cloud observed with ALMA at 1.33 mm, but find no evidence for planet-driven spirals. We find that the minimum planet masses necessary to drive detectable spirals range from $\approx$ 0.03 to 0.5 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ over orbital radii of 10 to 100 au, with planet masses below these thresholds potentially hiding in such disc observations. Conversely, we suggest that planets $\gtrsim$ 0.5 to 1 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ can likely be ruled out over orbital radii of $\approx$ 20 to 60 au on the grounds that we would have detected them if they were present.
