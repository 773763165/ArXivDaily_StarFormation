 - **Abstract**
 After decades of dismissal and secrecy, it has become clear that a significant number of the world's governments take Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), seriously -- yet still seem to know little about them. As a result, these phenomena are increasingly attracting the attention of scientists around the world, some of whom have recently formed research efforts to monitor and scientifically study UAP. In this paper, we review and summarize approximately 20 historical government studies dating from 1933 to the present (in Scandinavia, WWII, US, Canada, France, Russia, China), several historical private research studies (France, UK, US), and both recent and current scientific research efforts (Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, US). In doing so, our objective is to clarify the existing global and historical scientific narrative around UAP. Studies range from field station development and deployment to the collection and analysis of witness reports from around the world. We dispel the common misconception that UAPs are an American phenomenon and show that UAP can be, and have been, scientifically investigated. Our aim here is to enable future studies to draw on the great depth of prior documented experience.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting the angles and orbits of remote targets precisely has been playing crucial roles in astrophysical research. Due to the resolution limitations imposed by the Airy disk in a single telescope, optical interferometric schemes with at least two telescopes have received considerable attention. We have extended the piecemeal method to reduce the required number of baselines for observation. Through the analysis of its performance under practical conditions, we demonstrate that both the original and extended piecemeal methods exhibit strong robustness against errors in baseline lengths and orientations. Under the same practical conditions, our approach achieves higher precision than other existing weak-light interference-based methods.

          Evolving dark energy models: Current and forecast constraints

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, have focused renewed attention on dark energy models with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$. In this paper, we describe the simplest, physically motivated models of evolving dark energy that are consistent with the recent data, a broad subclass of the so-called thawing scalar field models. We provide a quasi-universal, quasi-one-parameter functional fit to the scalar-field $w_\phi(z)$ that captures the behavior of these models more informatively than the standard $w_0w_a$ phenomenological parametrization; their behavior is completely described by the current value of the equation-of-state parameter, $w_0=w(z=0)$. Combining current data from SNe Ia (DES-SN5YR), BAO (SDSS + DESI Year 1), the CMB (Planck and ACT), large-scale structure (DES Year-3 $3\times2$pt), and strong lensing (TDCOSMO + SLACS), we obtain $w_0=-0.908\pm0.035$, 2.6$\sigma$ discrepant from the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The Bayesian evidence ratio substantially favors this $w_\phi$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM. The data combination that yields the strongest discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM is SNe Ia+BAO, for which $w_0=-0.840^{+0.048}_{-0.050}$, $3.2\sigma$ discrepant from $\Lambda$CDM and with a Bayesian evidence ratio strongly in favor. We find that the so-called $S_8$ tension between the CMB and large-scale structure is slightly reduced in these models, while the Hubble tension is slightly increased. We forecast constraints on these models from near-future surveys (DESI-extension and the Vera Rubin Observatory LSST), showing that the current best-fit $w_\phi$CDM model will be distinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM at over 9$\sigma$.

          Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck

 - **Abstract**
 Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} <1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.

          A fast and robust recipe for modeling non-ideal MHD effects in star-formation simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Non-ideal MHD effects are thought to be a crucial component of the star-formation process. Numerically, several complications render the study of non-ideal MHD effects in 3D simulations extremely challenging and hinder our efforts of exploring a large parameter space. We aim to overcome such challenges by proposing a novel, physically-motivated empirical approximation to model non-ideal MHD effects. We perform a number of 2D axisymmetric 3-fluid non-ideal MHD simulations of collapsing prestellar cores and clouds with non-equilibrium chemistry and leverage upon previously-published results. We utilize these simulations to develop a multivariate interpolating function to predict the ionization fraction in each region of the cloud depending on the local physical conditions. We subsequently use analytically-derived, simplified expressions to calculate the resistivities of the cloud in each grid cell. Therefore, in our new approach the resistivities are calculated without the use of a chemical network. We benchmark our method against additional 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with random initial conditions and a 3D non-ideal MHD simulation with non-equilibrium chemistry. We find excellent quantitative and qualitative agreement between our approach and the "full" non-ideal MHD simulations both in terms of the spatial structure of the simulated clouds and regarding their time evolution. We achieve a factor of 100-1000 increase in computational speed. Given that we ignore the contribution of grains, our approximation is valid up to number densities of 10^6 cm^(-3) and is therefore suitable for pc-scale simulations of molecular clouds. The tabulated data required for integrating our method in hydrodynamical codes, along with a fortran implementation of the interpolating function are publicly available at this https URL.

          Observational Constraints on Cool Gas Clouds in M82's Starburst-Driven Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation feedback can drive large-scale, multi-phase galactic outflows. The dynamical and thermodynamical interaction between the hot and cooler phases is a prime focus of both observational and theoretical work. Here, we analyze H$\alpha$-emitting structures in the extraplanar wind of the nearby starburst M82. We use high-resolution, narrow-band, observations from the Hubble Legacy Archive (Mutchler et al. 2007). Our analysis constrains the morphology, number density, and column density of the structures. We highlight conspicuous arc-like structures that differ significantly from the linear cometary clouds that emerge from galactic wind simulations and discuss their possible origins, such as bow shocks or instabilities driven by cosmic rays. The most prominent structures range in size from $\sim24 -110$ pc. Using the H$\alpha$ brightness and assumptions about the depth of the emitting structures, we estimate number densities of $\sim1-23$ cm$^{-3}$, which are lower than previous constraints from spectroscopic nebular line studies. The derived column densities, $\sim10^{20}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, along the path of the outflow are above theoretical thresholds for cool cloud survival in a hot supersonic background, but small enough that the structures could be accelerated by the hot wind momentum. Using diffuse X-ray emission maps from $\textit{Chandra}$, we also find that even on small ($\sim100$ pc) scales, the H$\alpha$ "leads" the X-rays, a behavior long noted in the literature on kiloparsec scales, and one we observe in the brightness profiles of the structures we analyze. This behavior, along with previous observational studies of ionization in the wind, may signal that shock ionization is responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission we observe.

          A comparison of abundance analyses of first generation stars in multiple populations in 47 Tuc and NGC 3201

 - **Abstract**
 The distinction of the stellar content in globular clusters (GCs) in multiple stellar populations characterized by different amounts of proton-capture elements has been well assessed since a long time. On the other hand, the existence of noticeable variations in metallicity among GC stars is still debated. In particular, recent spectroscopic analyses claimed the presence of a small variation in metallicity, ~0.1 dex, for the first generation (FG) stars in NGC 3201 and NGC 104. However, in both cases the claim is not robust because of the internal error of 0.1 dex associated to the [Fe/H] values. To verify the reality of a metallicity variation we compared the two analyses, performed by the same authors with identical methodology. We found trends of metallicity as a function of the spectroscopically derived effective temperatures. However they are in opposite directions; in NGC 3201 cooler (and brighter) stars have higher [Fe/H] values, whereas in 47 Tuc they show lower metallicities. The trend is not statistically significant in the former case, but it is in the latter. The dependence of metallicity on the luminosity along the red giant branch seems to indicate problems in the abundance analysis for 47 Tuc. Finally, effective temperature do not show a significant variation as a function of the color spread along the HST pseudo-colour map, which we should instead observe were the trends temperature-metallicity a real effects of intrinsic scatter in iron. According to this comparison, we conclude that with these analyses, and the associated spurious trends, the issue of metallicity variations in FG stars is hardly settled.

          Emergence of a neutrino flux above 5 PeV and implications for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays

 - **Abstract**
 The rare detections of astrophysical neutrinos with energies above 5 PeV by two neutrino telescopes underscore the existence of a flux at these energies. In addition to over a decade of data taken by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the KM3NeT neutrino telescope has recently highlighted their discovery of a possible $\mathcal{O}(100~\mathrm{PeV})$ neutrino candidate. A connection between the highest-energy astrophysical neutrinos and the highest-energy cosmic rays is expected, and well-established theoretically. Here, we model the global multimessenger dataset by simultaneously fitting the neutrino data and the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum and composition data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger). We show that the model is able to describe the combined data across these three observatories, and, depending on the true energy of the event detected by KM3NeT, suggests an additional cosmic ray source population not yet robustly detected by Auger. Although a measurement of the neutrino flux in this energy regime is at the sensitivity limit of cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino telescopes, next-generation observatories, such IceCube-Gen2, will have the sensitivity to make a significant detection of this flux.

 - **Abstract**
 The International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) is a pan-European radio interferometer with baselines up to 2,000 km. This provides sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies of <200 MHz. Since starting science operations in 2012, the ILT has carried out observations for the state-of-the-art LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, which has 6 arcsec resolution at 144 MHz. Wide-area surveys at low frequencies, while scientifically productive, have to compromise on resolution. Sub-arcsecond imaging with the ILT has become more accessible over the last decade, thanks to efforts to build a publicly available pipeline using LOFAR-specific tools, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of publications. The ILT's combination of resolution, field of view, and low observing frequency make it a unique instrument for a wide range of scientific applications, and it will remain unparalleled even in the era of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory. Here we provide an overview of the technical considerations and calibration methods sub-arcsecond imaging with the ILT. This is followed by a review of the unique capabilities unlocked by sub-arcsecond imaging with the ILT, using examples from the literature for demonstration. Finally we describe ongoing work including: surveying large areas of the sky at high resolution, going deeper in fields with excellent ancillary information, producing images of polarisation, and extending to lower frequencies (<100 MHz).

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets can form around low-mass stars contrary to canonical formation models. Here, we present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. Our data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\lambda\lesssim3.0$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination also prevented the definitive detection of any $\mathrm{H_2O}$, which has primary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength coverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of $\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. Our gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with both sub-solar metallicity ($\log\mathrm{[M/H]}\sim-2$ for a clear atmosphere) and super-solar C/O ratio ($\log\mathrm{[C/O]}\sim3$ for a clear or cloudy atmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that predict a bulk metallicity of 10--20%, which is $\sim100\times$ the atmospheric metallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.

          Resonances of compressible stars in precessing orbits around a spinning black hole

 - **Abstract**
 In our previous paper, we reported the presence of a new resonance of an incompressible star orbiting a spinning black hole and showed that it can set in before the tidal disruption limit if the star has an inclined spherical orbit around the black hole. Using the affine model developed by Carter and Luminet, we extend our result to the stars with polytropic equations of state. We give further credence to the result previously given. We also derive the formula for the growth rate of the resonant motion, which is useful for checking the results of hydrodynamics simulations.

          Properties of Turbulent Convection and Large-Scale Flows in a Rotating F-type Star Revealed by 3D Realistic Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The nonlinear coupling between stellar convection and rotation is of great interest because it relates to understanding both stellar evolution and activity. We investigated the influence of rotation and the Coriolis force on the dynamics and thermodynamic structure of an F-type main-sequence star with a shallow outer convection zone. We performed a series of 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of a 1.47Msun star for different rotation rates (periods of rotation 1 and 14 days) and with computational domains placed at latitudes of 0degrees (equator), 30degrees, and 60degrees. Because the star has a relatively shallow convection zone (28.5 Mm thick or about 2.81% R*), we model its dynamics from the upper layers of the radiative zone, the whole convection zone, and the low atmosphere. The simulation results show a weak shift of the ionization zones to the photosphere and a decrease of the stellar radius by about 29 km at the equator and about 58 km at higher latitudes in the presence of rotation with a period of 1 day. The models presented reveal the formation of radial differential rotation, meridional flows, latitude-dependent roll-like structures of convection, a tachocline, the presence of a gravity-darkening effect, and others. In this paper, we primarily discuss the properties of the outer convection zone for different rotation rates. Detailed analysis of the properties of the tachocline, the overshoot layer, and small-scale turbulence will be discussed in follow-on papers.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-2015 is a known exoplanetary system around an M4 dwarf star, consisting of a transiting sub-Neptune planet in a 3.35-day orbital period, TOI-2015b, accompanied by a non-transiting companion, TOI-2015c. High-precision RV measurements were taken with the MAROON-X spectrograph, and high-precision photometric data were collected several networks. We re-characterize the target star by combining optical spectr, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis. The TOI-2015 host star is a K=10.3mag M4-type dwarf with a sub-solar metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.31+/-0.16, and a Teff=3200K. Our photodynamical analysis of the system strongly favors the 5:3 mean motion resonance and in this scenario the planet b has an orbital period of 3.34days, a mass of Mp=9.02+/-0.34Me, a radius of Rp=3.309+/-0.012Re, resulting in a density of rhop= 1.40+/-0.06g/cm3, indicative of a Neptune like composition. Its transits exhibit large (>1hr) timing variations indicative of an outer perturber in the system. We performed a global analysis of the high-resolution RV measurements, the photometric data, and the TTVs, and inferred that TOI-2015 hosts a second planet, TOI-2015c, in a non-transiting configuration. TOI-2015c has an orbital period of Pc=5.583days and a mass of Mp=8.91+0.38-0.40Me. The dynamical configuration of TOI-2015b and TOI-2015c can be used to constrain the system's planetary formation and migration history. Based on the mass-radius composition models, TOI-2015b is a water-rich or rocky planet with a hydrogen-helium envelope. Moreover, TOI-2015b has a high transmission spectroscopic metric (TSM=149), making it a favorable target for future transmission spectroscopic observations with JWST to constrain the atmospheric composition of the planet. Such observations would also help to break the degeneracies in theoretical models of the planet's interior structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the most important contributors of enriched materials to the interstellar medium due to their strong stellar winds. To fully characterize mass loss on the AGB, it is necessary to determine the distributions of dust and gas around the stars, where the dust begins to condense from the gas, and how this extended atmospheric structure evolves over the pulsational period of the star. We present an analysis of L-band (2.8-4.2 $\mu$m) interferometric observations of the carbon-rich AGB star V Oph made with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI at the maximum and minimum of the star's visual light curve. Using the radiative transfer software RADMC-3D, we model the circumstellar dust shell, and find stellar radii of 395 and 495 $R_{\odot}$ at the two phases, and dust radii of 790 and 742.5 $R_{\odot}$ at the two epochs, respectively. By adding C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN gas to the RADMC-3D models, we are able to fit the visibility spectra well, with some deviations at the 3.11 $\mu$m feature. Reasons for this deviation and interpretation of the best fitting models are discussed in the text, and we discuss motivations for follow-up imaging observations of V Oph.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the origin of the preference of DESI Year-1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements and external data from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa) that dark energy behavior departs from that expected in the standard cosmological model with vacuum energy ($\Lambda$CDM). In our analysis, we allow a flexible scaling of the expansion rate with redshift that nevertheless allows reasonably tight constraints on the quantities of interest, and adopt and validate a simple yet accurate compression of the CMB data that allows us to constrain our phenomenological model of the expansion history. We find that data consistently show a preference for a $\sim$3-5% increase in the expansion rate at $z\simeq 0.5$ relative to that predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, in excellent agreement with results from the less flexible $(w_0, w_a)$ parameterization which was used in previous analyses. Even though our model allows a departure from the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model at zero redshift, we find no evidence for such a signal. We also find no evidence (at greater than 1$\sigma$ significance) for a departure of the expansion rate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at higher redshifts for any of the data combinations that we consider. Overall, our results strengthen the robustness of the findings using the combination of DESI, CMB, and SNIa data to dark-energy modeling assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present here a new hybrid scheme that combines a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with finite volume (FV) and finite difference (FD) methods. The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information exchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for ghostzones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations. Furthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that require information exchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on non-cuboid meshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element and its six nearest neighbors. Through this reduction in communication, we aim to retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star surfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element should be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and test the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star. These cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general relativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods. We also describe additional numerical methods, such as the limiters and the atmosphere treatment we need for our simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The inspiral range is the most common metric for characterizing the performance of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers. However, there is no clear formalism for working with frequency-dependent inspiral range quantities. We introduce a metric for the cumulative normalized range of a gravitational-wave interferometer, as well as methods to compare two separate noise curves. We show how this metric is a valuable tool for guiding the commissioning of these interferometers and provides increased clarity compared to other commonly used approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun, and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data. Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention (CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk H$\alpha$ images. Feature information from each network layer is fully extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer, significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design. Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as open-source resources.

          Estimate the Mass Escaping Rates of Radius-valley-spanning Planets in TOI-431 System via XUV Evaporation

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-431 system has 3 close-in exoplanets, which gives an ideal lab to study gas escape. In this study, we measure the XUV luminosity for TOI-431 with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn and OM data, then calculate the fluxes for the planets in the system. We find that, TOI-431 b's $\rm F_{XUV,b}=$$70286^{+12060}_{-2611}$$\rm \ erg\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ is 75 times of TOI-431 d $\rm F_{XUV,d}=$$935^{+160}_{-35}$$\rm \ erg\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. Adopting the energy limit method and hydrodynamic code $ATES$ with a set of He/H ratios, we obtain the mass-loss rates of $10^{10.51^{+0.07}_{-0.02}}$ g s$^{-1}$ for TOI-431 b, $10^{9.14^{+0.07}_{-0.02}}$ and $10^{9.84\sim 9.94}$ g s$^{-1}$ for TOI-431 d. We predict the $2.93\sim 7.91 \%$ H I Ly$\alpha$ and $0.19\sim 10.65\%$ He I triplet absorption depths for TOI-431 d, thus its gas escaping is detectable in principle. For both TOI-431 b and d, we select similar planets from the New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS) data. Then show that considering the mass-loss rates, TOI-431 b should be a naked solid planet, and TOI-431 d will likely maintain its gas envelope until the host star dies. According to the formation and evolution tracks, we find that TOI-431 b's potential birthplace (0.1-2 AU) should be inner than TOI-431 d (2-12 AU). Our results are consistent with the interpretation of the radius valley being caused by atmospheric escape. The intrinsic reason may be their birthplace, which will determine how close they can migrate to the host star, then lose mass and result in the Fulton gap.

          On the long-term evolution of razor-thin galactic discs: Balescu-Lenard prediction and perspectives

 - **Abstract**
 In the last five decades, numerical simulations have provided invaluable insights into the evolution of galactic discs over cosmic times. As a complementary approach, developments in kinetic theory now also offer a theoretical framework to understand statistically their long-term evolution. The current state-of-the-art kinetic theory of isolated stellar systems is the inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard equation. It can describe the long-term evolution of a self-gravitating razor-thin disc under the effect of resonant interactions between collectively amplified noise-driven fluctuations. In this work, confronting theoretical predictions to numerical simulations, we quantitatively show that kinetic theory indeed captures the average long-term evolution of cold stellar discs. Leveraging the versatility of kinetic methods, we then offer some new perspectives on this problem, namely (i) the crucial impact of collective effects in accelerating the relaxation; (ii) the role of (weakly) damped modes in shaping the disc's orbital heating; (iii) the bias introduced by gravitational softening on long timescales; (iv) the resurgence of strong stochasticity near marginal stability. These elements call for an appropriate choice of softening kernel when simulating the long-term evolution of razor thin discs and for an extension of kinetic theory beyond the average evolution. Notwithstanding, kinetic theory captures quantitatively the ensemble-averaged long-term response of such discs.

 - **Abstract**
 The CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) is an international observatory currently under construction. With more than sixty telescopes, it will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. CTAO studies the high-energy universe by observing gamma rays emitted by violent phenomena (supernovae, black hole environments, etc.). These gamma rays produce an atmospheric shower when entering the atmosphere, which emits faint blue light, observed by CTAO's highly sensitive cameras. The event reconstruction consists of analyzing the images produced by the telescopes to retrieve the physical properties of the incident particle (mainly direction, energy, and type). A standard method for performing this reconstruction consists of combining traditional image parameter calculations with machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, to estimate the particle's energy and class probability for each telescope. A second step, called stereoscopy, combines these monoscopic reconstructions into a global one using weighted averages. In this work, we explore the possibility of using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a suitable solution for combining information from each telescope. The "graph" approach aims to link observations from different telescopes, allowing analysis of the shower from multiple angles and producing a stereoscopic reconstruction of the events. We apply GNNs to CTAO-simulated data from the Northern Hemisphere and show that they are a very promising approach to improving event reconstruction, providing a more performant stereoscopic reconstruction. In particular, we observe better energy and angular resolutions(before event selection) and better separation between gamma photons and protons compared to the Random Forest method.

 We propose a novel mechanism for photon-dark photon mass state oscillations mediated by gravitational separation during propagation through the interstellar medium. This phenomenon establishes a new avenue for the detection of dark matter. By analyzing gravitational lensing data from quasars, we investigate the sensitivity of this approach to dark photons. Our analysis demonstrates constraints of$\epsilon<10^-2$ in the dark photon mass range of $10^{-14}eV$. Furthermore, we propose potential applications of this mechanism to astrophysical systems with strong gravitational fields, such as neutron stars and black hole accretion disks.

          Scaling relations for the uncertainty in neutron star radius inferred from pulse profile modelling: the effect of spin rate

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse profile modelling using X-ray data from NICER permits the inference of mass and radius for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. This in turn constrains the equation of state of cold dense matter. Previous studies indicate that the uncertainty in the inferred radius should reduce as neutron star spin rate increases. Here we test this using one of the pipelines currently being used for pulse profile modelling with NICER data. We synthesize a set of pulse profiles, assuming different neutron star spin frequencies, spanning the range (25-700) Hz. All of the simulated data sets are generated with the same (single) hot spot configuration, assuming a neutron star mass and radius of $1.6\,M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ and $10$ km. For this restricted set of synthetic data, we find no improvement in the radius credible interval once spin frequency exceeds a certain value (in this specific case $\sim 200$ Hz). If this result were to apply more generally, it would have important implications for the observing strategy for current and future pulse profile modelling missions: targets can be prioritized based on properties other than their spin frequencies, as long as we are in the millisecond range.

The observations cover 4 epochs over a 10-year period between March 2010 and March 2020. We confirm the emergence of a number of new regions of 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission in the molecular gas surrounding NGC6334-MM1, which lies north of the previously known class II methanol maser sites which are associated with NGC6334-MM3 and -MM2. The new maser emission is located close to the strongest (sub)millimetre source in the NGC6334I cluster MM1B which experienced a sudden increase in intensity in 2015, produced by an episodic accretion event. We are able to compare the location and intensity of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission before, during, and after the flare, providing new insights into the relationship between maser flares and periodic accretion events in high-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius > 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.

 - **Abstract**
 Near the center of our Milky Way is a bar-like structure and the so-called Expanding 3-kpc arms. We currently have limited knowledge of this important region, since we are about 8.2 kpc from the center and cannot directly observe it at optical wavelengths, owing to strong extinction from interstellar dust. Here we present extremely precise VLBI measurements of water maser sources from the BeSSeL Survey, where extinction is not a problem, which accurately determine the 3-dimensional locations and motions of three massive young stars. Combined with previous measurements, these stars delineate a trail of orbits outlining the Milky Way's Galactic Bar. We present the first measurements capturing the dynamics of quasi-elliptical (X1) orbits around the Galactic Bar. Our findings provide evidence substantiating the existence of such orbits populated by massive young stars. Our measurements of the position and velocity of a number of massive young stars, previously identified with the Expanding 3-kpc arms, show that they are more likely located in the X1 orbits about the Galactic Bar. Also, some stars previously assigned to the Norma spiral arm appear to be in these orbits, which suggests that this spiral arm does not extend past the end of the bar.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of NOEMA interferometric observations of the high-mass star-forming region W75N(B) with a focus on molecular composition and distribution of prebiotic molecules in the source's multiple cores. Over twenty molecules are identified across the region, with many being fit for column density, rotational temperature, spectral line full width half maximum, and v$_{lsr}$. This work includes the first known detection and initial analysis of complex organic molecules in the MM2 and MM3 regions. Furthermore, parameter maps were created from the six molecules that were well fit across multiple regions. The molecular emission was imaged and correlated across different molecules and the continuum to reveal structural features. From the spatial and spectral analysis of the MM1 region, these results concur with those from other studies showing that there is a difference in chemical composition between the MM1a and MM1b regions, with sulfur-bearing molecules tracing MM1a and organic molecules tracing MM1b. The molecular emission imaged toward the MM3 region reveals two peaks, possibly indicating the presence of multiple young stellar objects. These results provide detailed quantitative information about the physical parameters and distributions of molecules in this source. Additionally, these results are part of a follow-up of a single-dish survey of multiple star-forming regions and are discussed in this context.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next generation of ground-based observatories employing the imaging air Cherenkov technique for the study of very high energy gamma rays. The software Gammalearn proposes to apply Deep Learning as a part of the CTAO data analysis to reconstruct event parameters directly from images captured by the telescopes with minimal pre-processing to maximize the information conserved. In CTAO, the data analysis will include a data volume reduction that will definitely remove pixels. This step is necessary for data transfer and storage but could also involve information loss that could be used by sensitive algorithms such as neural networks (NN). In this work, we evaluate the performance of the gamma-PhysNet when applying different cleaning masks on images from Monte-Carlo simulations from the first Large-Sized Telescope. This study is critical to assess the impact of pixel removal in the data processing, mainly motivated by data compression.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic birefringence is an effect where the plane of polarisation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is rotated by an angle $\beta$ through coupling to a hypothetical parity-violating field. We analyse the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4 or NPIPE) data using a map-space analysis method and find $\beta=0.46^\circ\pm 0.04^\circ(\mathrm{stat.})\pm0.28^\circ(\mathrm{syst.})$ for SEVEM CMB maps and $\beta=0.48^\circ\pm 0.04^\circ(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.28^\circ(\mathrm{syst.})$ for Commander CMB maps. These values are slightly higher than previously published results, which may be explained by the fact that we have not attempted to remove any potential bias from miscalibration of the Planck polarimeters. The uncertainty in this miscalibration dominates the systematic uncertainty, which also means that our results are consistent with no parity violation. An advantage of the map-space analysis is that it is easy to investigate any variations on the sky, for example caused by foreground contamination. Our results for isotropic birefringence are fairly robust against different spatial data cuts, but there may be hints of a foreground systematic (north versus south hemispheres) or uncontrolled miscalibration effect (T peaks versus E peaks) that should be followed up in future studies. We additionally find no evidence of a cosmic birefringence dipole (anisotropic birefringence).

 - **Abstract**
 We re-analyze VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS K and H-band sparse aperture masking interferometry data of the transition disk HD 100546 observed in 2018 and 2021, respectively. We fit geometrical models to the closure phases extracted from both datasets. We compare three model classes: a forward scattering disk, a forward scattering disk plus an arbitrary asymmetric disk feature and a forward scattering disk plus an unresolved point source in the disk-gap. We find that the forward scattering disk plus point source model is the best representation of the data. We find that this point source candidate moved from a position of sep. = $39.9^{+2.8}_{-3.3}$ mas, P.A. = $124.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ degrees to a sep. = $50.0^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ mas, P.A. = $106.4^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ degrees between 2018 and 2021. Both of these positions are well within the $\sim$13 au ($\sim$120 mas) disk-gap, favouring the point source interpretation. We explore the orbital parameter space that is consistent with the measured relative astrometry. We find orbits either with a similar orientation to the outer disk, with a high eccentricity $e \gtrapprox 0.65$, or orbits with a large relative inclination ($\sim$60 degrees) to the outer disk, and any eccentricity. Despite the significance of the observed point-source signal, follow-up observations will be necessary to conclusively determine its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of the previously classified delta Scuti variable star MW Camelopardalis using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Telescope sparked a deeper inquiry due to the unexpected patterns within the target's observed-calculated graph. From the shape of the O-C diagram we have designed these objects as Staircase delta Scuti. The pattern was found to be replicated in the O-C graphs of seven additional targets. The objects are TIC 17931346, TIC 44845403, TIC 123580083, TIC 173503902, TIC 302394816, TIC 194944219, and TIC 396465600. The Q value for the targets, their position in the delta Scuti Leavitt Law, and location in the instability strip would show these objects to be low mass, fundamental pulsators, near the red edge of the instability strip. We also discuss the impact this phenomenon could have on the analysis of all pulsating variable stars.

          Statistical Reevaluation of the USP Classification Boundary: Smaller Planets Within 1 Day, Larger Period Ratios Below 2 Days

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial worlds with $P < 1$ day, known as ultra-short period planets (USPs), comprise a physically distinct population whose origins may be attributed to various possible formation channels within multi-planet systems. However, the conventional 1 day boundary adopted for USPs is an arbitrary prescription, and it has yet to be evaluated whether this specific cutoff, or any alternatives, may emerge from the data with minimal assumptions. We accordingly present a statistical evaluation of the USP classification boundary for 376 multi-planet systems across Kepler, K2, and TESS. We find that USPs are smaller in size ($p = 0.004$) and exhibit larger period ratios with their immediate neighbors ($\mathcal{P} = P_{2}/P_{1}$; $p < 10^{-4}$) when compared to non-USP short-period ($1 < P/\text{days} < 5$) worlds, and that these discrepancies rapidly transition towards statistical insignificance ($p > 0.05$) at respective orbital periods of $P_{R} = 0.97^{+0.25}_{-0.19}$ days and $P_{\mathcal{P}} = 2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$ days (see Figure 3). We verify that these results are not driven by imprecise planetary parameters, giant companions, low-mass host stars, or detection biases. Our findings provide qualitative support for pathways in which proto-USPs are detached from companions and delivered to $P \lesssim 2$ days via eccentric migration, while a subset of these objects near $P \sim 1$ day experience subsequent orbital decay and refractory mass loss to become USPs. These results lend evidence towards an astrophysical basis for the 1 day USP cutoff and encourage consideration of an additional 2 day boundary within future investigations of USP architectures and evolutionary dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.
