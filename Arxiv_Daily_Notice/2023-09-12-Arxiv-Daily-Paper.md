 - **Abstract**
 As the classic viscous paradigm for protoplanetary disk accretion is challenged by the observational evidence of low turbulence, the alternative scenario of MHD disk winds is being explored as potentially able to reproduce the same observed features traditionally explained with viscosity. Although the two models lead to different disk properties, none of them has been ruled out by observations - mainly due to instrumental limitations. In this work, we present a viable method to distinguish between the viscous and MHD framework based on the different evolution of the distribution in the disk mass ($M_{\mathrm{d}}$) - accretion rate ($\dot M$) plane of a disk population. With a synergy of analytical calculations and 1D numerical simulations, performed with the population synthesis code \texttt{Diskpop}, we find that both mechanisms predict the spread of the observed ratio $M_{\mathrm{d}}/\dot M$ in a disk population to decrease over time; however, this effect is much less pronounced in MHD-dominated populations as compared to purely viscous populations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this difference is detectable with the current observational facilities: we show that convolving the intrinsic spread with the observational uncertainties does not affect our result, as the observed spread in the MHD case remains significantly larger than in the viscous scenario. While the most recent data available show a better agreement with the wind model, ongoing and future efforts to obtain direct gas mass measurements with ALMA and ngVLA will cause a reassessment of this comparison in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark energy is frequently modelled as an additional dynamical scalar field component in the Universe, referred to as "quintessence", which drives the late-time acceleration. Furthermore, the quintessence field may be coupled to dark matter and/or baryons, leading to a fifth force. In this paper we explore the consequences for non-linear cosmological structure formation arising from a momentum coupling between the quintessence field and dark matter only. The coupling leads to a modified Euler equation, which we implement in an N-body cosmological simulation. We then analyse the effects of the coupling on the non-linear power spectrum and the properties of the dark matter halos. We find that, for certain quintessence potentials, a positive coupling can lead to significantly reduced structure on small scales and somewhat enhanced structure on large scales, as well as reduced halo density profiles and increased velocity dispersions.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a model for the large-scale, global 3D structure of molecular clouds. Motivated by the morphological appearance of clouds in surface density maps, we model clouds as cylinders, with the aim of backing out information about the volume density distribution of gas and its relationship to star formation. We test our model by applying it to surface density maps for a sample of nearby clouds and find solutions that fit each of the observed radial surface density profiles remarkably well. Our most salient findings are that clouds with higher central volume densities are more compact and also have lower total mass. These same lower-mass clouds tend to have shorter gas depletion times, regardless of whether we consider their total mass or dense mass. Our analyses lead us to conclude that cylindrical clouds can be characterized by a universal structure that sets the timescale on which they form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces novel constraints on the free-streaming of thermal relic warm dark matter (WDM) from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectra. Our analysis utilises a high-resolution, high-redshift sample of quasar spectra observed using the HIRES and UVES spectrographs ($z=4.2-5.0$). We employ a Bayesian inference framework and a simulation-based likelihood that encompasses various parameters including the free-streaming of dark matter, cosmological parameters, the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, and inhomogeneous reionization, to establish lower limits on the mass of a thermal relic WDM particle of $5.7\;\mathrm{keV}$ (at 95\% C.L.). This result surpasses previous limits from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest through reduction of the measured uncertainties due to a larger statistical sample and by measuring clustering to smaller scales ($k_{\rm max}=0.2\;\mathrm{km^{-1}\,s}$). The approximately two-fold improvement due to the expanded statistical sample suggests that the effectiveness of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest constraints on WDM models at high redshifts are limited by the availability of high-quality quasar spectra. Restricting the analysis to comparable scales and thermal history priors as in prior studies ($k_{\rm max}<0.1\;\mathrm{km^{-1}\,s}$) lowers the bound on the WDM mass to $4.1\;\mathrm{keV}$. As the precision of the measurements increases, it becomes crucial to examine the instrumental and modelling systematics. On the modelling front, we argue that the impact of the thermal history uncertainty on the WDM particle mass constraint has diminished due to improved independent observations. At the smallest scales, the primary source of modeling systematic arises from the structure in the peculiar velocity of the intergalactic medium and inhomogeneous reionization.
#### Gravitational imaging through a triple source plane lens: revisiting the  $Λ$CDM-defying dark subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM paradigm successfully explains the large-scale structure of the Universe, but is less well constrained on sub-galactic scales. Gravitational lens modelling has been used to measure the imprints of dark substructures on lensed arcs, testing the small-scale predictions of $\Lambda$CDM. However, the methods required for these tests are subject to degeneracies among the lens mass model and the source light profile. We present a case study of the unique compound gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006, wherein a dark, massive substructure has been detected, whose reported high concentration would be unlikely in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. For the first time, we model the first two background sources in both I- and U-band HST imaging, as well as VLT-MUSE emission line data for the most distant source. We recover a lensing perturber at a $5.9\sigma$ confidence level with mass $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{sub}/M_{\odot})=9.2^{+0.4}_{-0.1}$ and concentration $\log_{10}c=2.4^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$. The concentration is more consistent with CDM subhalos than previously reported, and the mass is compatible with that of a dwarf satellite galaxy whose flux is undetectable in the data at the location of the perturber. A wandering black hole with mass $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{BH}/M_{\odot})=8.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ is a viable alternative model. We systematically investigate alternative assumptions about the complexity of the mass distribution and source reconstruction; in all cases the subhalo is detected at around the $\geq5\sigma$ level. However, the detection significance can be altered substantially (up to $11.3\sigma$) by alternative choices for the source regularisation scheme.
#### Simulating the efficacy of the implicit-electric-field-conjugation  algorithm for the Roman Coronagraph with noise

 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Coronagraph is expected to perform its high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) with a ground-in-the-loop scheme due to the computational complexity of the Electric-Field-Conjugation (EFC) algorithm. This scheme provides the flexibility to alter the HOWFSC algorithm for given science objectives. A new alternative implicit-EFC algorithm is of particular interest as it requires no optical model to create a dark-hole, making the final contrast independent of the model accuracy. The intended HOWFSC scheme involves running EFC while observing a bright star such as $\zeta$ Puppis to create the initial dark-hole, then slew to the science target while maintaining the contrast with low-order WFSC over the given observation. Given a similar scheme, the efficacy of iEFC is simulated for two coronagraph modes, namely the Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and the wide-field-of-view Shaped-Pupil-Coronagraph (SPC-WFOV). End-to-end physical optics models for each mode serve as the tool for the simulations. Initial monochromatic simulations are presented and compared with monochromatic EFC results obtained with the FALCO software. Various sets of calibration modes are tested to understand the optimal modes to use when generating an iEFC response matrix. Further iEFC simulations are performed using broadband images with the assumption that $\zeta$ Puppis is the stellar object being observed. Shot noise, read noise, and dark current are included in the broadband simulations to determine if iEFC could be a suitable alternative to EFC for the Roman Coronagraph.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to reach contrast ratios of $10^{-8}$ and beyond, coronagraph testbeds need source optics that reliably emulate nearly-point-like starlight, with microfabricated pinholes being a compelling solution. To verify, a physical optics model of the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) source optics, including a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) pinhole simulation, was created. The results of the FDTD simulation show waveguide-like behavior of pinholes. We designed and fabricated microfabricated pinholes for SCoOB made from an aluminum overcoated silicon nitride film overhanging a silicon wafer substrate, and report characterization of the completed pinholes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a generalized Non-negative factorization (NMF)-based data reduction pipeline for circumstellar disk and exoplanet detection. By using an adaptable pre-processing routine that applies algorithmic masks and corrections to improper data, we are able to easily offload the computationally-intensive NMF algorithm to a graphics processing unit (GPU), significantly increasing computational efficiency. NMF has been shown to better preserve disk structural features compared to other post-processing approaches and has demonstrated improvements in the analysis of archival data. The adaptive pre-processing routine of this pipeline, which automatically aligns and applies image corrections to the raw data, is shown to significantly improve chromatic halo suppression. Utilizing HST-STIS and JWST-MIRI coronagraphic datasets, we demonstrate a factor of five increase in real-time computational efficiency by using GPUs to perform NMF compared to using CPUs. Additionally, we demonstrate the usefulness of higher numbers of NMF components with SNR and contrast improvements, which necessitates the use of a more computationally efficient approach for data reduction.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuous wavefront sensing on future space telescopes allows relaxation of stability requirements while still allowing on-orbit diffraction-limited optical performance. We consider the suitability of phase retrieval to continuously reconstruct the phase of a wavefront from on-orbit irradiance measurements or point spread function (PSF) images. As phase retrieval algorithms do not require reference optics or complicated calibrations, it is a preferable technique for space observatories, such as the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope. To increase the robustness and dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm, multiple PSF images with known amount of defocus can be utilized. In this study, we describe a recently constructed testbed including a 97 actuator deformable mirror, changeable entrance pupil stops, and a light source. The aligned system wavefront error is below ~30nm. We applied various methods to generate a known wavefront error, such as defocus and/or other aberrations, and found the accuracy and precision of the root mean squared error of the reconstructed wavefronts to be less than ~10nm and ~2nm, respectively. Further, we discuss the signal-to-noise ratios required for continuous dynamic wavefront sensing. We also simulate the case of spacecraft drifting and verify the performance of the phase retrieval algorithm for continuous wavefront sensing in the presence of realistic disturbances.
#### Dissecting the emission from LHAASO J0341+5258: implications for future  multi-wavelength observations

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has detected multiple ultra-high energy (UHE; E$_\gamma \ge$ 100 TeV) gamma-ray sources in the Milky Way Galaxy, which are associated with Galactic ``PeVatrons'' that accelerate particles up to PeV (= 10$^{15}$ eV) energies. Although supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), as source classes, are considered the leading candidates, further theoretical and observational efforts are needed to find conclusive proof to confirm the nature of these PeVatrons. This work aims to provide a phenomenological model to account for the emission observed from the direction of LHAASO J0341+5258, an unidentified UHE gamma-ray source observed by LHAASO. 15 years of Fermi-LAT data was analyzed to find the high energy (HE; 100 MeV $\le$ E$_\gamma$ $\le$ 100 GeV) GeV gamma-ray counterpart of LHAASO J0341+5258, in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog. We have explained the spectrum of the closest 4FGL source, 4FGL J0340.4+5302, by a synchro-curvature emission formalism typically used in the case of GeV pulsars. Escape-limited hadronic interaction between protons accelerated in an old, now invisible SNR and cold protons inside associated molecular clouds (MCs) and leptonic emission from a putative TeV halo was explored to explain the multi-wavelength (MWL) spectral energy distribution (SED) observed from the LHAASO source region. We have further discussed possible observational avenues that can be explored in the near future and predicted the outcome of those observational efforts from the model explored in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Large wind kinetic power of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars make them ideal targets in low radio frequencies to search for non-thermal emission due to relativistic particle acceleration. In this paper, we present observations of two WR stars, WR 114 and WR 142, in Band 4 (550-950 MHz) and Band 5 (1050-1450 MHz) using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Neither star is detected in the observed frequency bands, nor extended emission associated with them. The upper limit to the free-free radio emission from the stellar wind enables us to constrain the mass-loss rate of WR 114 to $\lesssim \rm 10^{-5}\,M_{ \odot}\,yr^{-1}$; this is a factor three smaller than previously estimated using spectroscopic modelling. If we further assume that the WR stars are binaries, the non-detection of synchrotron emission from the putative wind collision region implies that the stars are either in very wide binary systems away from periastron, or that the stars are in close binary systems with an orbital separation $<70$ AU for WR 114 and $<20$ AU for WR 142. The non-detection of low-frequency radio emission from these two systems thus provides evidence that narrows their nature, though it does not rule them out as bonafide particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries.
#### Secondary cosmic-ray nuclei in the model of Galactic halo with nonlinear  Landau damping

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04772
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04772
 - **Abstract**
 We employ our recent model of the cosmic-ray (CR) halo by Chernyshov et al. (2022) to compute the Galactic spectra of stable and unstable secondary nuclei. In this model, confinement of the Galactic CRs is entirely determined by the self-generated Alfvenic turbulence whose spectrum is controlled by nonlinear Landau damping. We analyze the physical parameters affecting propagation characteristics of CRs, and estimate the best set of free parameters providing accurate description of available observational data. We also show that agreement with observations at lower energies may be further improved by taking into account the effect of ion-neutral damping which operates near the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 TeV-range cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CREs) have been directly measured in the search for new physics or unknown astrophysical sources. CREs can inverse-Compton scatter solar photons and boost their energies into gamma-ray bands. Any potential CRE excess would enhance the resultant inverse Compton emission spectrum in the relevant energy range, offering a new window to verify the measured CRE spectrum. In this paper, we show that an excess in the TeV range of the CRE spectrum, such as the one indicated by the DAMPE experiment, can induce a characteristic solar gamma-ray signal. Accounting for contamination from extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds (EGB), we forecast the DAMPE feature is testable ($\gtrsim 4 \sigma$) with a $\sim 10^{5}\,\mathrm{m}^2\,{\rm yr}$ exposure in the off-disk direction. This can be achieved by long-exposure observations of water Cherenkov telescopes, such as LHAASO (7.2 years) and HAWC (25.9 years).
#### Stability maps for the 5/3 mean motion resonance between Ariel and  Umbriel with inclination

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the five largest satellites of Uranus during the crossing of the 5/3 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel is strongly affected by chaotic motion. Studies with numerical integrations of the equations of motion and analysis of Poincar\'e surface sections provided helpful insights to the role of chaos on the system. However, they lack of a quantification of this chaos in the phase-space. Here, we construct stability maps using the frequency analysis method. We determine that for low energies (small eccentricity and/or inclinations), the phase-space is mainly stable. As the energy increases, the chaotic regions replace the stable motion, until only small, localized libration regions remain stable.

 - **Abstract**
 G\,29$-$38 (TIC~422526868) is one of the brightest ($V=13.1$) and closest ($d = 17.51$\,pc) pulsating white dwarfs with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere (DAV/ZZ Ceti class). It was observed by the {\sl TESS} spacecraft in sectors 42 and 56. The atmosphere of G~29$-$38 is polluted by heavy elements that are expected to sink out of visible layers on short timescales. The photometric {\sl TESS} data set spans $\sim 51$ days in total, and from this, we identified 56 significant pulsation frequencies, that include rotational frequency multiplets. In addition, we identified 30 combination frequencies in each sector. The oscillation frequencies that we found are associated with $g$-mode pulsations, with periods spanning from $\sim$ 260 s to $\sim$ 1400 s. We identified %three distinct rotational frequency triplets with a mean separation $\delta \nu_{\ell=1}$ of 4.67 $\mu$Hz and a quintuplet with a mean separation $\delta \nu_{\ell=2}$ of 6.67 $\mu$Hz, from which we estimated a rotation period of about $1.35 \pm 0.1$ days. We determined a constant period spacing of 41.20~s for $\ell= 1$ modes and 22.58\,s for $\ell= 2$ modes. We performed period-to-period fit analyses and found an asteroseismological model with $M_{\star}/M_{\odot}=0.632 \pm 0.03$, $T_{\rm eff}=11\, 635\pm 178$ K, and $\log{g}=8.048\pm0.005$ (with a hydrogen envelope mass of $M_{\rm H}\sim 5.6\times 10^{-5}M_{\star}$), in good agreement with the values derived from spectroscopy. We obtained an asteroseismic distance of 17.54 pc, which is in excellent agreement with that provided by {\sl Gaia} (17.51 pc).
#### Are NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ ice present on Miranda?

 - **Abstract**
 Published near-infrared spectra of the four largest classical Uranian satellites display the presence of discrete deposits of CO$_2$ ice, along with subtle absorption features around 2.2 $\mu$m. The two innermost satellites, Miranda and Ariel, also possess surfaces heavily modified by past endogenic activity. Previous observations of the smallest satellite, Miranda, have not detected the presence of CO$_2$ ice, and a report of an absorption feature at 2.2 $\mu$m has not been confirmed. An absorption feature at 2.2 $\mu$m could result from exposed or emplaced NH$_3$- or NH$_4$-bearing species, which have a limited lifetime on Miranda's surface, and therefore may imply that Miranda's internal activity was relatively recent. In this work, we analyzed near-infrared spectra of Miranda to determine whether CO$_2$ ice and the 2.2-$\mu$m feature are present. We measured the band area and depth of the CO$_2$ ice triplet (1.966, 2.012, and 2.070 $\mu$m), a weak 2.13-$\mu$m band attributed to CO$_2$ ice mixed with H$_2$O ice, and the 2.2-$\mu$m band. We confirmed a prior detection of a 2.2-$\mu$m band on Miranda, but we found no evidence for CO$_2$ ice, either as discrete deposits or mixed with H$_2$O ice. We compared a high signal-to-noise spectrum of Miranda to synthetic and laboratory spectra of various candidate compounds to shed light on what species may be responsible for the 2.2-$\mu$m band. We conclude that the 2.2-$\mu$m absorption is best matched by a combination of NH$_3$ ice with NH$_3$-hydrates or NH$_3$-H$_2$O mixtures. NH$_4$-bearing salts like NH$_4$Cl are also promising candidates that warrant further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 Mountains or non-axisymmetric deformations of rotating neutron stars (NS) efficiently radiate gravitational waves (GW). We consider analogies between NS mountains and surface features of solar system bodies. Both NS and moons such as Europa or Enceladus have thin crusts over deep oceans while Mercury has a thin crust over a large metallic core. Thin sheets may wrinkle in universal ways. Europa has linear features, Enceladus has ``Tiger" stripes, and Mercury has lobate scarps. NS may have analogous features. The innermost inner core of the Earth is anisotropic with a shear modulus that depends on direction. If NS crust material is also anisotropic this will produce an ellipticity, when the crust is stressed, that grows with spin frequency. This yields a breaking index (log derivative of spin down rate) very different from $n=5$ and could explain the maximum spin observed for neutron stars and a possible minimum ellipticity of millisecond pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronagraphic instruments provide a great chance of enabling high contrast spectroscopy for the pursuit of finding a habitable world. Future space telescope coronagraph instruments require high performing focal plane masks in combination with precise wavefront sensing and control techniques to achieve dark holes for planet detection. Several wavefront control algorithms have been developed in recent years that might vary in performance depending on the coronagraph they are paired with. This study compares 3 model-free and model-based algorithms when coupled with either a Vector (VVC) or a Scalar (SVC) Vortex Coronagraph mask in the same laboratory conditions: Pairwise Probing with Electric Field Conjugation, the Self-Coherent Camera with Electric Field Conjugation, and Implicit Electric Field Conjugation. We present experimental results from the In-Air Coronagraph Testbed (IACT) at JPL in narrowband and broadband light, comparing the pros and cons of each of these wavefront sensing and control algorithms with respect to their potential for future space telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The utilization of a 6.5m monolithic primary mirror in a compact three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) telescope design offers unprecedented capabilities to accommodate various next generation science instruments. This design enables the rapid and efficient development of a large aperture telescope without segmented mirrors while maintaining a compact overall form factor. With its exceptional photon collection area and diffraction-limited resolving power, the TMA design is ideally suited for both the ground and space active/adaptive optics concepts, which require the capture of natural guide stars within the field of view for wavefront measurement to correct for misalignments and shape deformation caused by thermal gradients. The wide field of view requirement is based on a statistical analysis of bright natural guide stars available during observation. The primary mirror clear aperture, compactness requirement, and detector pixel sizes led to the choice of TMA over simpler two-mirror solutions like Ritchey-Chretien (RC) telescopes, and the TMA design offers superior diffraction-limited performance across the entire field of view. The standard conic surfaces applied to all three mirrors (M1, M2, and M3) simplify the optical fabrication, testing, and alignment process. Additionally, the TMA design is more tolerant than RC telescopes. Stray light control is critical for UV science instrumentation, and the field stop and Lyot stop are conveniently located in the TMA design for this purpose.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars is a primary science motivation for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. However, the current best technology is not yet advanced enough to reach the 10^-10 contrasts at close angular separations and at the same time remain insensitive to low-order aberrations, as would be required to achieve high-contrast imaging of exo-Earths. Photonic technologies could fill this gap, potentially doubling exo-Earth yield. We review current work on photonic coronagraphs and investigate the potential of hybridized designs which combine both classical coronagraph designs and photonic technologies into a single optical system. We present two possible systems. First, a hybrid solution which splits the field of view spatially such that the photonics handle light within the inner working angle and a conventional coronagraph that suppresses starlight outside it. Second, a hybrid solution where the conventional coronagraph and photonics operate in series, complementing each other and thereby loosening requirements on each subsystem. As photonic technologies continue to advance, a hybrid or fully photonic coronagraph holds great potential for future exoplanet imaging from space.

 - **Abstract**
 New development approaches, including launch vehicles and advances in sensors, computing, and software, have lowered the cost of entry into space, and have enabled a revolution in low-cost, high-risk Small Satellite (SmallSat) missions. To bring about a similar transformation in larger space telescopes, it is necessary to reconsider the full paradigm of space observatories. Here we will review the history of space telescope development and cost drivers, and describe an example conceptual design for a low cost 6.5 m optical telescope to enable new science when operated in space at room temperature. It uses a monolithic primary mirror of borosilicate glass, drawing on lessons and tools from decades of experience with ground-based observatories and instruments, as well as flagship space missions. It takes advantage, as do large launch vehicles, of increased computing power and space-worthy commercial electronics in low-cost active predictive control systems to maintain stability. We will describe an approach that incorporates science and trade study results that address driving requirements such as integration and testing costs, reliability, spacecraft jitter, and wavefront stability in this new risk-tolerant "LargeSat" context.

#### Measuring Black Hole Spins through X-ray Reflection Spectroscopy and the  Relativistic Precession Model: the case of XTE J1859+226

 - **Abstract**
 The development of techniques to measure accurately black hole spins is crucial to study the physics and astrophysics of these objects. X-ray reflection spectroscopy is currently the most popular method to estimate the spins of accreting black holes; so far it has provided a spin measurement of about 40 stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries and 40 supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. The relativistic precession model is another method to measure the spins of stellar-mass black holes: it requires the measurement of the frequencies of three simultaneous quasi-periodic oscillations and can potentially provide very precise estimates of the black hole mass and spin. However, the two methods do not seem to provide consistent results when applied to the same sources, which questions the actual reliability and accuracy of these measurements. Recently, the relativistic precession model has been applied to infer the spin of the black hole in XTE J1859+226 (Motta et al. 2022). The authors found $a_* = 0.149 \pm 0.005$ (68% CL) and there are no other spin measurements of this source. We looked for archived RXTE observations of XTE J1859+226 with blurred reflection features and found 23 spectra suitable for measuring the black hole spin. We employed two different models with relxill and relxillD and obtained a higher spin value from all these fits. From the further simultaneous fitting performed on two different subsets of the total set of 23 spectra, we infer the black hole spin parameter $a_* = 0.986^{+0.001}_{-0.004}$ and $a_* =0.987 \pm 0.003$ (90% CL, statistical) with relxill and relxillD for the first set and, $a_*$ = $0.981_{-0.007}^{+0.006}$ and $0.982_{-0.007}^{+0.006}$ (90% CL, statistical) for the second set, respectively. This clearly confirms the discrepancy between the black hole spin measurements inferred from the two techniques.
#### Measurement of D/H and 13C/12C Ratios in Methane Ice on Eris and  Makemake: Evidence for Internal Activity

 - **Abstract**
 James Webb Space Telescope's NIRSpec infrared imaging spectrometer observed the outer solar system dwarf planets Eris and Makemake in reflected sunlight at wavelengths spanning 1 through 5 microns. Both objects have high albedo surfaces that are rich in methane ice, with a texture that permits long optical path lengths through the ice for solar photons. There is evidence for N2 ice absorption around 4.2 um on Eris, though not on Makemake. No CO ice absorption is seen at 4.67 um on either body. For the first time, absorption bands of two heavy isotopologues of methane are observed at 2.615 um (13CH4), 4.33 um (12CH3D), and 4.57 um (12CH3D). These bands enable us to measure D/H ratios of (2.5 +/- 0.5) x 10-4 and (2.9 +/- 0.6) x 10-4, along with 13C/12C ratios of 0.012 +/- 0.002 and 0.010 +/- 0.003 in the surface methane ices of Eris and Makemake, respectively. The measured D/H ratios are much lower than that of presumably primordial methane in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, but they are similar to D/H ratios in water in many comets and larger outer solar system objects. This similarity suggests that the hydrogen atoms in methane on Eris and Makemake originated from water, indicative of geochemical processes in past or even ongoing hot environments in their deep interiors. The 13C/12C ratios are consistent with commonly observed solar system values, suggesting no substantial enrichment in 13C as could happen if the methane currently on their surfaces was the residue of a much larger inventory that had mostly been lost to space. Possible explanations include geologically recent outgassing from the interiors as well as processes that cycle the surface methane inventory to keep the uppermost surfaces refreshed.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamic fibrils (DFs) are commonly observed chromospheric features in solar active regions. Recent observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard the Solar Orbiter have revealed unambiguous signatures of DFs at the coronal base, in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission. However, it remains unclear if the DFs detected in the EUV are linked to their chromospheric counterparts. Simultaneous detection of DFs from chromospheric to coronal temperatures could provide important information on their thermal structuring and evolution through the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we address this question by using coordinated EUV observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and EUI to establish a one-to-one correspondence between chromospheric and transition region DFs (observed by IRIS) with their coronal counterparts (observed by EUI and AIA). Our analysis confirms a close correspondence between DFs observed at different atmospheric layers, and reveals that DFs can reach temperatures of about 1.5 million Kelvin, typical of the coronal base in active regions. Furthermore, intensity evolution of these DFs, as measured by tracking them over time, reveals a shock-driven scenario in which plasma piles up near the tips of these DFs and, subsequently, these tips appear as bright blobs in coronal images. These findings provide information on the thermal structuring of DFs and their evolution and impact through the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory mission will require coronagraphs capable of achieving contrasts of 1e-10 to detect exo-Earths. The choice of coronagraph depends on finding a solution that is achromatic within a 20\% bandwidth, insensitive to low order aberrations and polarization independent. We present two scalar vortex phase mask designs which employ a Roddier phase dimple and a dual zone phase dimple to improve the achromatic performance by addressing the chromatic stellar leakage not handled by the vortex. We show that using these dimples, it is possible to substantially improve the broadband contrast performance of existing scalar vortex phase masks.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We study the relation between the known binary fraction and spectral absorption feature index to judge whether (and potentially which) spectral absorption feature indices are suitable for determining the binary fraction. Aims. The determination of the binary fraction is important in studies of binary star formation, evolutionary population synthesis models, and other works. The number of binary stars is difficult to determine for nearly all stellar systems because the individual stars are need to be resolved photometrically or spectroscopically. By comparison, their integrated spectra or spectral absorption feature indices are relatively easy to obtain. Results. We find that the low-resolution (15\,\AA) spectrum is not suitable for this study and the binary fraction type would affect the results: $f$($q$>0.5) and $f$(tot)$^{\rm mc}$ exhibit better correlations with the spectral absorption feature index than $f$(tot)$^{\rm mf}$ and the difference in metallicity would significantly affect the above relationship. % Finally, to eliminate the effects of metallicity, age, and dynamical evolution, we only used those GCs with multiple spectra observed among different regions. % We find that OIII-1, OIII-2, H$_{\rm \gamma F}$, H$_{\rm \delta F}$, H$_{\rm \gamma A}$, H$_{\rm \delta A}$, H$_{\rm \beta}$, Ca4455, C$_2$4668, and TiO$_1$ indices have strong correlations with binary fraction. % The two OIII indices are the most sensitive to the binary fraction, followed by four Balmer indices -- the two narrower central bandpass Balmer indices ($\sim$20\AA, F-definition) are more sensitive than the wider two ($\sim$40\AA, A-definition) and, lastly, the Ca4455, C$_2$4668, and TiO$_1$ indices.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of fitting Insight-HXMT data to the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-430, which was discovered on January 26th, 2019, with the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on-board MAXI. Several observations at the beginning of the first burst were selected, with a total of 10 spectra. From the residuals of fits using disk plus power law models, X-ray reflection signatures were clearly visible in some of these observations. We use the state-of the-art relxill series reflection model to fit six spectra with distinct reflection signatures and a joint fit to these spectra. In particular, we focus on the results for the black hole spin values. Assuming Rin = RISCO, the spin parameter is constrained to be 0.82+0.04-0.03 with 90% confidence level (statistical only).
#### Discovery of millihertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in the Low Mass  X-Ray Binary XTE 1701$-$462 from a Search of the RXTE Legacy data set

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations ($\mathrm{mHz}$ QPOs) from the low-mass X-ray binary XTE 1701$-$462. The discovery came from a search of the legacy data set of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, in order to detect the periodic signals in all observations of sources exhibiting thermonuclear bursts. We found that $47$ out of $860$ observations of XTE 1701$-$462; covering the 2006--7 outburst exhibits signals with a significance above the detection threshold, which was determined separately for each observation via a Monte Carlo approach. We chose the four strongest candidates, each with maximum power exceeding $4\sigma$ of the simulated wavelet noise power distribution, to demonstrate the properties of the QPOs. The frequencies of the signals in the four observations are $\sim 3.5\;\text{to}\;5.6\; \mathrm{mHz}$, and the fractional R.M.S. amplitudes vary between $0.74 \pm 0.05\,\%$ and $3.54 \pm 0.04\,\%$. Although previously reported signals in other sources typically disappear immediately before a burst, we do not observe this behaviour in XTE 1701$-$462. Instead, we found that the QPOs and bursts occurred in separate accretion regimes. When the persistent luminosity dropped near the end of the outburst, the source showed bursts and no QPOs were detected, which is the behaviour predicted by theory for the transition from stable to unstable burning. On the basis of this new detection, we reassess the cases for identifying these $\mathrm{mHz}$ QPOs in this and other sources as arising from marginally stable burning.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Several bright emission line regions have been observed in the central 100 parsecs of the active galaxy NGC 1068. Aims. We aim to determine the properties and ionization mechanism of three regions of NGC 1068: the nucleus (B) and two clouds located at 0.3" and 0.7" north of it (C and D). Methods. We combined SPHERE (0.95 - 1.65 um) and SINFONI (1.5 - 2.45 um) spectra for the three regions B, C, and D. We compared these spectra to several CLOUDY photoionization models and to the MAPPINGS III Library of Fast Radiative Shock Models. Results. The emission line spectra of the three regions are almost identical to each other and contribute to most of the emission line flux in the nuclear region. The emitting media contain multiple phases, the most luminous of which have temperatures ranging from 104.8 K to 106 K. Central photoionization models can reproduce some features of the spectra, but the fast radiative shock model provides the best fit to the data. Conclusions. The similarity between the three regions indicates that they belong to the same class of objects. Based on our comparisons, we conclude that they are shock regions located where the jet of the active galactic nucleus impacts massive molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial metallicity distribution of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has recently been found to correlate as a V-shaped function with the semi-major axis of an elliptical framework proposed to assume a projected galaxy flattening. We report results on the impact that the use of such a framework can produce on our understanding of the SMC formation and its chemical enrichment. We show that clusters with similar semi-major axes are placed at a very different distances from the SMC centre. The recently claimed bimodal metallicity distribution of clusters projected on the innermost SMC regions and the V-shaped metallicity gradient fade away when actual distances are used. Although a large dispersion prevails, clusters older than $\sim$ 1 Gyr exhibit a shallow metallicity gradient, caused by slightly different spatial distributions of clusters younger and older than $\sim$ 4 Gyr; the former being more centrally concentrated and having a mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) $\sim$ 0.15 dex more metal-rich than that of older clusters. This metallicity gradient does not show any dependence with the position angle, except for clusters placed beyond 11 kpc, which are located in the eastern side of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Even if their detection is for now challenging, observation of small terrestrial planets will be easier in a near future thanks to continuous improvements of detection and characterisation instruments. In this quest, climate modeling is a key step to understand their characteristics, atmospheric composition and possible history. If a surface water reservoir is present on such a terrestrial planet, an increase in insolation may lead to a dramatic positive feedback induced by water evaporation: the runaway greenhouse. The resulting rise of global surface temperature leads to the evaporation of the entire water reservoir, separating two very different population of planets: 1) temperate planets with a surface water ocean and 2) hot planets with a puffed atmosphere dominated by water vapor. In this work we use a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), the Generic-PCM, to study the runaway greenhouse transition, linking temperate and post-runaway states. Our simulations are made of two steps. First, assuming initially a liquid surface ocean, an evaporation phase which enriches the atmosphere in water vapor. Second, when the ocean is considered entirely evaporated, a dry transition phase for which the surface temperature increases dramatically. Finally, it converges on a hot and stable post-runaway state. By describing in detail the evolution of the climate during these two steps, we show a rapid transition of the cloud coverage and of the wind circulation from the troposphere to the stratosphere. By comparing our result to previous studies using 1D models, we discuss the effect of intrinsically 3D processes such as the global dynamics and the clouds, keys to understand the runaway greenhouse. We also explore the potential reversibility of the runaway greenhouse, limited by its radiative unbalance.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-infrared bandpasses on spaceborne observatories diverge from their ground-based counterparts as they are free of atmospheric telluric absorption. Available transformations between respective filter systems in the literature rely on theoretical stellar atmospheres, which are known to have difficulties reproducing observed spectral energy distributions of cool giants. We present new transformations between the 2MASS $JHK_S$ and HST WFC3/IR F110W, F125W, & F160W photometric systems based on synthetic photometry of empirical stellar spectra from four spectral libraries. This sample comprises over 1000 individual stars, which together span nearly the full HR diagram and sample stellar populations from the solar neighborhood out to the Magellanic Clouds, covering a broad range of ages, metallicities, and other relevant stellar properties. In addition to global color-dependent transformations, we examine band-to-band differences for cool, luminous giant stars in particular, including multiple types of primary distance indicators.
#### Implications for the Explosion Mechanism of Type Ia Supernovae from  their Late-time Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Late-time spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important in clarifying the physics of their explosions, as they provide key clues to the inner structure of the exploding white dwarfs. We examined late-time optical spectra of 36 SNe Ia, including five from our own project (SNe 2019np, 2019ein, 2021hpr, 2021wuf, and 2022hrs), with phase coverage of $\sim 200$ to $\sim 400$ days after maximum light. At this late phase, the outer ejecta have become transparent and the features of inner iron-group elements emerge in the spectra. Based on multicomponent Gaussian fits and reasonable choices for the pseudocontinuum around Ni and Fe emission features, we get reliable estimates of the Ni to Fe ratio, which is sensitive to the explosion models of SNe Ia. Our results show that the majority (about 67%) of our SNe Ia are more consistent with the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass (i.e., double-detonation) model, although they could be affected by evolutionary or ionisation effects. Moreover, we find that the Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity measured around the time of maximum light tends to increase with the Ni to Fe ratio for the subsample with either redshifted or blueshifted nebular velocities, suggesting that progenitor metallicity might play an important role in accounting for the observed velocity diversity of SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision exoplanet eclipse light curves, like those possible with JWST, enable flux and temperature mapping of exoplanet atmospheres. These eclipse maps will have unprecedented precision, providing an opportunity to constrain current theoretical predictions of exoplanet atmospheres. However, eclipse mapping has unavoidable mathematical limitations because many map patterns are unobservable. This ``null space'' has implications for making comparisons between predictions from general circulation models (GCMs) and the observed planet maps, and, thus, affects our understanding of the physical processes driving the observed maps. We describe the eclipse-mapping null space and show how GCM forward models can be transformed to their observable modes for more appropriate comparison with retrieved eclipse maps, demonstrated with applications to synthetic data of an ultra-hot Jupiter and a cloudy warm Jupiter under JWST-best-case- and extreme-precision observing scenarios. We show that the effects of the null space can be mitigated and manipulated through observational design, and JWST exposure times are short enough to not increase the size of the null space. Furthermore, we show the mathematical connection between the null space and the ``eigenmapping'' method, demonstrating how eigenmaps can be used to understand the null space in a model-independent way. We leverage this connection to incorporate null-space uncertainties in retrieved maps, which increases the uncertainties to now encompass the ground truth for synthetic data. The comparisons between observed maps and forward models that are enabled by this work, and the improved eclipse-mapping uncertainties, will be critical to our interpretation of multidimensional aspects of exoplanets in the JWST era.
#### Moderate D/H Ratios in Methane Ice on Eris and Makemake as Evidence of  Hydrothermal or Metamorphic Processes in Their Interiors: Geochemical  Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf planets Eris and Makemake have surfaces bearing methane ice of unknown origin. D/H ratios were recently determined from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of Eris and Makemake (Grundy et al., submitted), giving us new clues to decipher the origin of methane. Here, we develop geochemical models to test if the origin of methane could be primordial, derived from CO$_2$ or CO ("abiotic"), or sourced by organics ("thermogenic"). We find that primordial methane is inconsistent with the observational data, whereas both abiotic and thermogenic methane can have D/H ratios that overlap the observed ranges. This suggests that Eris and Makemake either never acquired a significant amount of methane during their formation, or their original inventories were removed and then replaced by a source of internally produced methane. Because producing abiotic or thermogenic methane likely requires temperatures in excess of ~150{\deg}C, we infer that Eris and Makemake have rocky cores that underwent substantial radiogenic heating. Their cores may still be warm/hot enough to produce methane. This heating could have driven hydrothermal circulation at the bottom of an ice-covered ocean to generate abiotic methane, and/or metamorphic reactions involving accreted organic matter could have occurred in response to heating in the deeper interior, generating thermogenic methane. Additional analyses of thermal evolution model results and predictions from modeling of D-H exchange in the solar nebula support our findings of elevated subsurface temperatures and a lack of primordial methane on Eris and Makemake. It remains an open question whether their D/H ratios may have evolved subsequent to methane outgassing. Recommendations are given for future activities to further test proposed scenarios of abiotic and thermogenic methane production on Eris and Makemake, and to explore these worlds up close.

 The search for habitable environments and biomarkers in exoplanetary atmospheres is the holy grail of exoplanet science. The detection of atmospheric signatures of habitable Earth-like exoplanets is challenging due to their small planet-star size contrast and thin atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Recently, a new class of habitable exoplanets, called Hycean worlds, has been proposed, defined as temperate ocean-covered worlds with H2-rich atmospheres. Their large sizes and extended atmospheres, compared to rocky planets of the same mass, make Hycean worlds significantly more accessible to atmospheric spectroscopy with the JWST. Here we report a transmission spectrum of the candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, observed with the JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments in the 0.9-5.2 $\mu$m range. The spectrum reveals strong detections of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at 5$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$ confidence, respectively, with high volume mixing ratios of ~1% each in a H2-rich atmosphere. The abundant CH4 and CO2 along with the non-detection of ammonia (NH3) are consistent with chemical predictions for an ocean under a temperate H2-rich atmosphere on K2-18 b. The spectrum also suggests potential signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which has been predicted to be an observable biomarker in Hycean worlds, motivating considerations of possible biological activity on the planet. The detection of CH4 resolves the long-standing missing methane problem for temperate exoplanets and the degeneracy in the atmospheric composition of K2-18 b from previous observations. We discuss possible implications of the findings, open questions, and future observations to explore this new regime in the search for life elsewhere.

 Recent analysis of the kilonova, AT2017gfo, has indicated that this event was highly spherical. This may challenge hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers, which usually predict a range of asymmetries, and radiative transfer simulations show a strong direction dependence. Here we investigate whether the synthetic spectra from a 3D kilonova simulation of asymmetric ejecta from a hydrodynamical merger simulation can be compatible with the observational constraints suggesting a high degree of sphericity in AT2017gfo. Specifically, we determine whether fitting a simple P-Cygni line profile model leads to a value for the photospheric velocity that is consistent with the value obtained from the expanding photosphere method. We would infer that our kilonova simulation is highly spherical at early times, when the spectra resemble a blackbody distribution. The two independently inferred photospheric velocities can be very similar, implying a high degree of sphericity, which can be as spherical as inferred for AT2017gfo, demonstrating that the photosphere can appear spherical even for asymmetrical ejecta. The last-interaction velocities of radiation escaping the simulation show a high degree of sphericity, supporting the inferred symmetry of the photosphere. We find that when the synthetic spectra resemble a blackbody the expanding photosphere method can be used to obtain an accurate luminosity distance (within 4-7 per cent).

 One of the most exciting and pressing issues in cosmology today is the discrepancy between some measurements of the local Hubble constant and other values of the expansion rate inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Resolving these differences holds the potential for the discovery of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology: Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), a successful model that has been in place for more than 20 years. Given both the fundamental significance of this outstanding discrepancy, and the many-decades-long effort to increase the accuracy of the extragalactic distance scale, it is critical to demonstrate that the local measurements are convincingly free from residual systematic errors. We review the progress over the past quarter century in measurements of the local value of the Hubble constant, and discuss remaining challenges. Particularly exciting are new data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), that is delivering high-resolution near-infrared imaging data to both test for and to address directly several of the systematic uncertainties that have historically limited the accuracy of extragalactic distance scale. We present an overview of our new JWST program to observe Cepheids, TRGB and JAGB stars. For the first galaxy in our program, NGC 7250, the high-resolution JWST images demonstrate that many of the Cepheids observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are significantly crowded by nearby neighbors. Avoiding the more significantly crowded variables, the scatter in the JWST near-infrared (NIR) Cepheid period-luminosity relation is decreased by a factor of two compared to those from HST, illustrating the power of JWST for improvements to local measurements of Ho. Ultimately, these data will either confirm the standard model, or provide robust evidence for the inclusion of additional new physics.

 The conditions required for massive star formation are debated, particularly whether massive stars must form in conjunction with massive clusters. Some authors have advanced the view that stars of any mass (below the total cluster mass) can form in clusters of any mass with some probability (random sampling). Others pointed out that the scatter in the determinations of the most massive star mass for a given cluster mass was consistent with the measurement error, such that the mass of the most massive star was determined by the total cluster mass (optimal sampling). Here we investigate the relation between cluster mass (M\textsubscript{ecl}) and the maximum stellar mass (M\textsubscript{max}) using a suite of SPH simulations. Varying cloud mass and turbulence random seed results in a range of cluster masses which we compare with their respective maximum star masses. We find that more massive clusters will have, on average, higher mass stars with this trend being steeper at lower cluster masses ($M\textsubscript{max} \propto M\textsubscript{ecl}^{0.31}$ for $M\textsubscript{ecl}<500M\,_{\odot}$) and flattening at higher cluster masses ($M\textsubscript{max} \propto M\textsubscript{ecl}^{0.11}$ for $M\textsubscript{ecl}>500M\,_{\odot}$). This rules out purely stochastic star formation in our simulations. Significant scatter in the maximum masses with identical initial conditions also rules out the possibility that the relation is purely deterministic (that is that a given cluster mass will result in a specific maximum stellar mass). In conclusion our simulations disagree with both random and optimal sampling of the initial mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 The auto-correlation function of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest flux from high-z quasars can statistically probe all scales of the intergalactic medium (IGM) just after the epoch of reionization. The thermal state of the IGM, which is determined by the physics of reionization, sets the amount of small-scale power seen in the \lya forest. To study the sensitivity of the auto-correlation function to the thermal state of the IGM, we compute the auto-correlation function from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with semi-numerical models of the thermal state of the IGM. We create mock data sets of 20 quasars to forecast constraints on $T_0$ and $\gamma$, which characterize a tight temperature-density relation in the IGM, at $5.4 \leq z \leq 6$. At $z = 5.4$ we find that an ideal data set constrains $T_0$ to 29\% and $\gamma$ to 9\%. In addition, we investigate four realistic reionization scenarios that combine temperature and ultra-violet background (UVB) fluctuations at $z = 5.8$. We find that, when using mock data generated from a model that includes temperature and UVB fluctuations, we can rule out a model with no temperature or UVB fluctuations at $>1\sigma$ level 50.5\% of the time.

 - **Abstract**
 Future constraints of cosmological parameters from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) will depend on the use of photometric samples, those samples without spectroscopic measurements of the SNe Ia. There is a growing number of analyses that show that photometric samples can be utilised for precision cosmological studies with minimal systematic uncertainties. To investigate this claim, we perform the first analysis that combines two separate photometric samples, SDSS and Pan-STARRS, without including a low-redshift anchor. We evaluate the consistency of the cosmological parameters from these two samples and find they are consistent with each other to under $1\sigma$. From the combined sample, named Amalgame, we measure $\Omega_M = 0.328 \pm 0.024$ with SN alone in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_M = 0.330 \pm 0.018$ and $w = -1.016^{+0.055}_{-0.058}$ when combining with a Planck data prior and a flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with constraints from the Pantheon+ analysis of only spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, and show that there are no significant impediments to analyses of purely photometric samples of SNe Ia.
