#### Fundamentals of Stars: Critical Looks at Mass-Luminosity Relations and  Beyond
 - **Authors:** Z. Eker, F. Soydugan, S. Bilir

 - **Abstract**
 Developments on various relations among stellar variables such as the main sequence empirical mass-luminosity (MLR), mass-radius (MRR) and mass-effective temperature (MTR) relations were reviewed. Conceptual changes in their understanding and usages were discussed. After its discovery, MLR was treated as one of the fundamental secrets of the cosmos. Differences between fundamental laws and statistical relations were used to understand long-term developments of MLR, MRR and MTR. Developments show a break point, initiated by Andersen et al. (1991), in the line of progress. Before the break when reliable data were limited, MLR and MRR were calibrated using M, L, and R of binary components of all kinds visual, spectroscopic, and eclipsing for two purposes: i) obtaining mean mass, mean luminosity, and mean radius, ii) to estimate M and R of single stars. By the time of the break, the number of solutions from detached double-lined eclipsing binaries (DDEB) giving accurate M and R within a few percent levels are increased. Parameters from very close, semi-detached, and contact binaries were excluded for refinement, however, MLR and MRR diagrams were found insufficient to derive MLR and MRR functions because the dispersions are not only due to random observational errors but also due to chemical composition and age differences. Then, a new trend was adopted by replacing classical MLR and MRR with empirical M and R predicting relations. Thus, the purpose one was suppressed also because the new trend found a fruitful application in determining M and R of exoplanet hosting single stars. Corrections on misnames and devising new classical MLR, MRR, and MTR, giving mean values are encouraged since they are still useful and needed by astrophysical models requiring such mean values, not only beneficial to astrophysics, but also beneficial to Galactic, extragalactic search, even cosmological models.
#### Self-similarity of the third type in ultra relativistic blastwaves

 - **Abstract**
 A new type of self-similarity is found in the problem of a plane-parallel, ultra-relativistic blast wave, propagating in a powerlaw density profile of the form $\rho \propto z^{-k}$. Self-similar solutions of the first kind can be found for $k<7/4$ using dimensional considerations. For steeper density gradients with $k>2$, second type solutions are obtained by eliminating a singularity from the equations. However, for intermediate powerlaw indices $7/4<k<2$ the flow does not obey any of the known types of self-similarity. Instead, the solutions belong to a new class in which the self-similar dynamics are dictated by the non self-similar part of the flow. We obtain an exact solution to the ultra-relativistic fluid equations and find that the non self-similar flow is described by relativistic expansion into vacuum, composed of (1) an accelerating piston that contains most of the energy and (2) a leading edge of fast material that coincides with the interiors of the blastwave and terminates at the shock. The dynamics of the piston itself are self-similar and universal, and do not depend on the external medium. The exact solution of the non self-similar flow is used to solve for the shock in the new class of solutions.
#### Cracking the relation between mass and 1P-star fraction of globular  clusters: I. Present-day cluster masses as a first tool
 - **Authors:** Geneviève Parmentier

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07979
 - **Abstract**
 The phenomenon of multiple stellar populations is exacerbated in massive globular clusters, with the fraction of first-population (1P) stars a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass. We decipher this relation in far greater detail than has been done so far. We assume (i) a fixed stellar mass threshold for the formation of second-population (2P) stars, (ii) a power-law scaling $F_{1P} \propto m_{ecl}^{-1}$ between the mass $m_{ecl}$ of newly-formed clusters and their 1P-star fraction $F_{1P}$, and (iii) a constant $F_{1P}$ over time. The $F_{1P}(m_{ecl})$ relation is then evolved up to an age of 12Gyr for tidal field strengths representative of the entire Galactic halo. The 12Gyr-old model tracks cover extremely well the present-day distribution of Galactic globular clusters in (mass,$F_{1P}$) space. The distribution is curtailed on its top-right side by the scarcity of clusters at large Galactocentric distances, and on its bottom-left side by the initial scarcity of very high-mass clusters, and dynamical friction. Given their distinct dissolution rates, "inner" and "outer" model clusters are offset from each other, as observed. The locus of Magellanic Clouds clusters in (mass,$F_{1P}$) space is as expected for intermediate-age clusters evolving in a gentle tidal field. Given the assumed constancy of $F_{1P}$, we conclude that 2P-stars do not necessarily form centrally-concentrated. We infer a minimum mass of $4 \cdot 10^5~M_{\odot}$ for multiple-populations clusters at secular evolution onset. This high-mass threshold severely limits the amount of 2P-stars lost from evolving clusters, thereby fitting the low 2P-star fraction of the Galactic halo field.
#### Disentangling the Galaxy's Gordian knot: evidence from $APOGEE-Gaia$ for  a knotted and slower bar in the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The inner $\sim5$ kiloparsec (kpc) region of the Milky Way is complex. Unravelling the evolution of the Galaxy requires precise understanding of the formation of this region. We report a study focused on disentangling the inner Galaxy ($r < 5$ kpc) using the measured positions, velocities, and element abundance ratios of red giant stars from the $APOGEE-Gaia$ surveys. After removing the stellar halo, inner Galaxy populations can be grouped into three main components based on their angular momentum: bar, disc, and a previously unreported ``knot'' component. The knot has a spheroidal shape, is concentrated in the inner $\sim1.5$ kpc, is comprised of stars on nearly-radial orbits, and contains stars with super-solar [Fe/H] element abundances. The chemical compositions of the knot are qualitatively similar to the Galactic bar and inner disc, suggestive that these three populations share a common genesis; the chemical/dynamic properties of the knot suggest it could constitute a classical bulge formed via secular evolution. Moreover, our results show that the bar is more slowly rotating than previously thought, with a pattern speed of $\Omega_{\mathrm{bar}}=24\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. This new estimate suggests that the influence of the bar extends beyond the solar radius, with $R_{\mathrm{CR}}\sim9.4-9.8$ kpc, depending on the adopted Milky Way rotation curve; it also suggests a ratio of corotation to bar length of $\mathcal{R}\sim1.8-2$. Our findings help place constraints on the formation and evolution of inner Galaxy populations, and directly constrain dynamical studies of the Milky Way bar and stars in the solar neighbourhood.
#### Historical Fermi All-Sky Variability Analysis of Galactic Flares

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi All-sky Variability Analysis (FAVA) provides a photometric alternative for identifying week-long gamma-ray flares across the entire sky while being independent of any diffuse Galactic or isotropic emission model. Thorough analysis was conducted on 779 weeks of Fermi-LAT data analyzed by FAVA to estimate the rate and origin of Galactic gamma-ray flares, and to search for new variable Galactic gamma-ray transients. We report an estimated yearly rate of ~8.5 Galactic gamma-ray flares/year with ~1 being from an unknown source. Out of the known gamma-ray sources that are spatially coincident with these detected flares, six lack any previously reported gamma-ray flare. All six are classified as pulsars, or a special case (a supernova remnant or pulsar wind nebula). This potentially means these sites are tentative candidates to be the second known site of a variable gamma-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN), behind the famous Crab Nebula's PWN. Additionally, we identify 9 unassociated flares that are unlikely to have originated from nearby gamma-ray sources, 3 of which lack previous X-ray observations at their locations.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, dominated by low to intermediate-mass stars in the late stage of evolution, undergo periodic pulsations, with periods of several hundred days, earning them the name Long Period Variables (LPVs). These stars gradually shed their mass through stellar winds and mass ejections, enveloping themselves in dust. Infrared (IR) surveys can probe these dust-enshrouded phases and uncover populations of LPV stars in the Milky Way. In this paper, we present a catalog of 159,696 Long Period Variables using near-IR lightcurves from the Palomar Gattini - IR (PGIR) survey. PGIR has been surveying the entire accessible northern sky ($\delta > -28^{\circ}$) in the J-band at a cadence of 2-3 days since September 2018, and has produced J-band lightcurves for more than 60 million sources. We used a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier trained on a comprehensive feature set extracted from PGIR lightcurves to search for LPVs in this dataset. We developed a parallelized and optimized code to extract features at a rate of ~0.1 seconds per lightcurve. Our model can successfully distinguish LPVs from other stars with a true positive rate and weighted g-mean of 0.95. 73,346 (~46%) of the sources in our catalog are new, previously unknown LPVs.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar populations and their distribution differ widely across the Galaxy, which is likely to affect planet demographics. Our local neighbourhood is dominated by young, metal-rich stars in the galactic thin disc, while the stellar halo and galactic bulge host a large fraction of older, metal-poor stars. We study the impact of these variations on planet populations in different regions of the Galaxy by combining a high-resolution galaxy formation simulation with state-of-the-art planet population synthesis models. We construct a population model to estimate occurrence rates of different planet types, based on the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis by Emsenhuber et al., 2021. We apply this to a simulated Milky Way--Analogue in the HESTIA galaxy formation simulation. We study the planet occurrence rate in the metal-rich regions of the inner Galaxy, i.e. in the galactic bulge and thin disc, and contrast them to the frequencies in the more distant, metal-poor region like the thick disc and stellar halo. We find that the planet demographics in the metal-poor regions of the Milky Way-Analogue, differ strongly from the planet populations in the more distant, metal-poor regions. The occurrence rate of giant planets ($>300 M_\bigoplus$) is 10 to 20 times larger in the thin disc compared to the thick disc, driven by the low amounts of solid material available for planet formation around metal-poor stars. Similarly, low-mass Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars are most abundant in the thick disc, being 1.5 times more frequent than in the thin disc. Moreover, low-mass planets are expected to be abundant throughout the galaxy, from the central regions to the outer halo, due to their formation processes being less dependent on stellar metallicity. The planet populations differ more strongly around Sun-like stars compared to dwarfs with masses 0.3 - 0.5 $M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory Preliminary Input Catalog (HPIC) is a list of ~13,000 nearby bright stars that will be potential targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its search for Earth-sized planets around Sun-like stars. We construct this target list using the TESS and Gaia DR3 catalogs, and develop an automated pipeline to compile stellar measurements and derived astrophysical properties for all stars. We benchmark the stellar properties in the HPIC relative to those of the manually curated ExEP HWO Precursor Science Stars list and find that, for the 164 best targets for exo-Earth direct imaging, our stellar properties are consistent. We demonstrate the utility of the HPIC by using it as an input for yield calculations to predict the science output of various mission designs including those with larger telescope diameters and those focused on other planet types besides Earth analogs, such as Jupiter-mass planets. The breadth and completeness of the HPIC is essential for accurate HWO mission trade studies, and it will be useful for other exoplanet studies and general astrophysics studying the population of bright nearby stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct observations of solar wind are mostly limited to the vicinity of the ecliptic plane. Retrieving the latitudinal structure of solar wind indirectly based on observations of the backscatter glow of interstellar neutral hydrogen is complex and requires support from theoretical models. The GLOWS instrument, to operate on the planned IMAP mission, will scan the helioglow along circumsolar rings with an angular distance of ~75 degrees. Its objective is to retrieve the latitudinal structure of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and with this, the structure of the solar wind. In preparation for future analysis, we studied the sensitivity of the light curves to temporal and latitudinal variation of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and the solar Lyman-alpha illumination. Based on carefully planned numerical experiments, we analyze the time delay and relaxation time of the system for variations of the ionization rate and solar illumination in heliolatitude and with time. We found that variations in the solar illumination are reflected in the helioglow without delay, but relaxation takes longer than the variation rise time. By contrast, variations in the ionization rate are anti-correlated with the helioglow brightness with a delay of several months. We also found that the helioglow is not sensitive to variations in the ionization rate at the solar poles, so retrieving the ionization rate and solar wind at the poles requires an approximation of the ionization rate profiles with appropriate parametric functions.
#### Long-term orbital evolution of Dimorphos boulders and implications on  the origin of meteorites

 - **Abstract**
 By using recent observations of the Dydimos-Dimorphos system from the Hubble Space Telescope, 37 boulders with a size of 4 to 7 meters ejected from the system during the impact with the DART spacecraft were identified. In this work, we studied the orbital evolution of a swarm of boulders with a similar size to that of the detected ones. By using recent estimates for the ejection velocity of the boulders, we numerically propagated the dynamics of the swarm for 20 kyr in the future. We found that the ejection velocities and the non-gravitational effects are not strong enough to change the secular evolution significantly. The minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with the Earth will be reached in about 2.5 kyr, but it will not fall below 0.02 au. On the contrary, the Mars MOID will be very small in four instances, two near 6 kyr and the other two near 15 kyr. Therefore, there may be a chance for them to impact Mars in the future. Given the rarefaction of the Martian atmosphere, we expect the boulders to arrive intact on the ground and excavate a small impact crater. The results presented here provide a further indication that some meteorites found on Earth originated in collisions of $\sim$100 m near-Earth asteroids with projectiles of $\sim$1 m in size.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Acoustic waves in the Sun are affected by the atmospheric layers, but this region is often ignored in forward models due to the increase in computational cost. Aims. The purpose of this work is to take into account the solar atmosphere without increasing significantly the computational cost. Methods. We solve a scalar wave equation that describes the propagation of acoustic modes inside the Sun using a finite element method. The boundary conditions used to truncate the computational domain are learned from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, that is the relation between the solution and its normal derivative at the computational boundary. These boundary conditions may be applied at any height above which the background medium is assumed to be radially symmetric. Results. Taking into account the atmosphere is important even for wave frequencies below the acoustic cut-off. In particular, the mode frequencies computed for an isothermal atmosphere differ by up 10 {\mu}Hz from those computed for the VAL-C atmospheric model. We show that learned infinite elements lead to a numerical accuracy similar to that obtained for a traditional radiation boundary condition. Its main advantage is to reproduce the solution for any radially symmetric atmosphere to a very good accuracy at a low computational cost. Conclusions. This work emphasizes the importance of including atmospheric layers in helioseismology and proposes a computationally efficient method to do so.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will, over a period of 10 years, repeatedly survey the southern sky. To ensure that images generated by Rubin meet the quality requirements for precision science, the observatory will use an Active Optics System (AOS) to correct for alignment and mirror surface perturbations introduced by gravity and temperature gradients in the optical system. To accomplish this Rubin will use out-of-focus images from sensors located at the edge of the focal plane to learn and correct for perturbations to the wavefront. We have designed and integrated a deep learning model for wavefront estimation into the AOS pipeline. In this paper, we compare the performance of this deep learning approach to Rubin's baseline algorithm when applied to images from two different simulations of the Rubin optical system. We show the deep learning approach is faster and more accurate, achieving the atmospheric error floor both for high-quality images, and low-quality images with heavy blending and vignetting. Compared to the baseline algorithm, the deep learning model is 40x faster, the median error 2x better under ideal conditions, 5x better in the presence of vignetting by the Rubin camera, and 14x better in the presence of blending in crowded fields. In addition, the deep learning model surpasses the required optical quality in simulations of the AOS closed loop. This system promises to increase the survey area useful for precision science by up to 8%. We discuss how this system might be deployed when commissioning and operating Rubin.

 - **Abstract**
 Light curves of microlensing events occasionally deviate from the smooth and symmetric form of a single-lens single-source event. While most of these anomalous events can be accounted for by employing a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) or a single-lens binary-source (1L2S) framework, it is established that a small fraction of events remain unexplained by either of these interpretations. We carry out a project in which data collected by high-cadence microlensing surveys were reinvestigated with the aim of uncovering the nature of anomalous lensing events with no proposed 2L1S or 1L2S models. From the project, we find that the anomaly appearing in the lensing event OGLE-2023-BLG-0836 cannot be explained by the usual interpretations and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the event. From thorough modeling of the light curve under sophisticated lens-system configurations, we have arrived at the conclusion that a triple-mass lens system is imperative to account for the anomaly features observed in the lensing light curve. From the Bayesian analysis using the measured observables of the event time scale and angular Einstein radius, we determine that the least massive component of the lens has a planetary mass of $4.36^{+2.35}_{-2.18}~M_{\rm J}$. This planet orbits within a stellar binary system composed of two stars with masses $0.71^{+0.38}_{-0.36}~M_\odot$ and $0.56^{+0.30}_{-0.28}~M_\odot$. This lensing event signifies the sixth occurrence of a planetary microlensing system in which a planet belongs to a stellar binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and ultraviolet Research (CASTOR) is a proposed Canadian-led 1m-class space telescope that will carry out ultraviolet and blue-optical wide-field imaging, spectroscopy, and photometry. CASTOR will provide an essential bridge in the post-Hubble era, preventing a protracted UV-optical gap in space astronomy and enabling an enormous range of discovery opportunities from the solar system to the nature of the Cosmos, in conjunction with the other great wide-field observatories of the next decade (e.g., Euclid, Roman, Vera Rubin). FORECASTOR (Finding Optics Requirements and Exposure times for CASTOR) will supply a coordinated suite of mission-planning tools that will serve as the one-stop shop for proposal preparation, data reduction, and analysis for the CASTOR mission. We present the first of these tools: a pixel-based, user-friendly, extensible, multi-mission exposure time calculator (ETC) built in Python, including a modern browser-based graphical user interface that updates in real time. We then provide several illustrative examples of FORECASTOR's use that advance the design of planned legacy surveys for the CASTOR mission: a search for the most massive white dwarfs in the Magellanic Clouds; a study of the frequency of flaring activity in M stars, their distribution and impacts on habitability of exoplanets; mapping the proper motions of faint stars in the Milky Way; wide and deep galaxy surveys; and time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei.
#### Thermal processing of primordial pebbles in evolving protoplanetary  disks

 - **Abstract**
 During protoplanetary disk formation, dust grains located in the outer disk retain their pristine icy composition, while solids in the inner stellar-heated disk undergo volatile loss. This process may have left a fossil record in Solar System material showing different nucelosynthetic imprints that have been attributed to different degrees of thermal processing. However, it remains unclear how a large mass fraction of thermally-processed inner-disk pebbles is produced and how these grains are subsequently transported throughout the disk. In this work we numerically investigate the evolution in time of a two-component pebble disk, consisting of pristine pebbles and those that underwent ice sublimation. We find that stellar outbursts exceeding 1000 times the solar luminosity are efficient in thermally altering, through ice sublimation, a large mass fraction of pebbles (around 80%). After the establishment of this initial radial dust composition gradient throughout the disk, the subsequent mixing and inward drift of pristine outer-disk pebbles alter the inner disk bulk composition from processed to more unprocessed in time. Therefore, if processed pebbles without ice mantles have an isotopic composition similar to ureilite meteorites from the inner Solar System, inner-disk minor bodies forming from the early pebble flux (<1Myr) will be isotopically ureilite-like, while later-formed bodies will be increasingly admixed with the signature of the late incoming CI chondrite-like unprocessed pebbles. This appears to be largely consistent with the trend seen between the accretion age of different meteoric classes and their different stable isotope composition anomalies (in $\mu$54Cr, $\mu$48Ca, $\mu$30Si, $\mu$58Ni), but further work may be needed to explain the role of isotopically anomalous refractory inclusions and anomaly trends in other elements.

 - **Abstract**
 The predicted present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data has sometimes been found discrepant with more direct measurements of late-time structure. This has motivated many extensions to the standard cosmological model, including kinetic interactions between dark matter and dark energy that introduce a drag force slowing the growth of structure at late times. Exploring this scenario, we develop a model for quasi-linear scales in the matter power spectrum by calculating the critical overdensity in the presence of this interaction and a varying dark energy equation of state. We explicitly avoid modeling or interpretation of data on non-linear scales in this model (such as use of $\Lambda$CDM-calibrated priors), which would require numerical simulations. We find that the presence of the drag force hinders halo formation, thus increasing the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM in the mildly non-linear regime. We use CMB lensing observations from the sixth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope up to $L=1250$ (in combination with Planck, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and 6dFGS data) to derive the strongest constraints to date on the amplitude of the drag term, finding the dimensionless interaction strength $\Gamma_\mathrm{DMDE}/(H_0\rho_\mathrm{c})<0.831\; (2.81)$ at the 68\% (95\%) confidence level. The inclusion of non-linear corrections improves our constraints by about 35\% compared to linear theory. Our results do not exclude the best-fit values of $\Gamma_\mathrm{DMDE}$ found in previous studies using information from galaxy weak lensing, though we find no statistical preference for the dark matter-dark energy kinetic interactions over $\Lambda$CDM. We implement our model in a publicly available fork of the Boltzmann code CLASS at https://github.com/fmccarthy/Class_DMDE.
#### Coherent Imaging with Photonic Lanterns

 - **Abstract**
 Photonic Lanterns (PLs) are tapered waveguides that gradually transition from a multi-mode fiber geometry to a bundle of single-mode fibers (SMFs). They can efficiently couple multi-mode telescope light into a multi-mode fiber entrance at the focal plane and convert it into multiple single-mode beams. Thus, each SMF samples its unique mode (lantern principal mode) of the telescope light in the pupil, analogous to subapertures in aperture masking interferometry (AMI). Coherent imaging with PLs can be enabled by interfering SMF outputs and applying phase modulation, which can be achieved using a photonic chip beam combiner at the backend (e.g., the ABCD beam combiner). In this study, we investigate the potential of coherent imaging by interfering SMF outputs of a PL with a single telescope. We demonstrate that the visibilities that can be measured from a PL are mutual intensities incident on the pupil weighted by the cross-correlation of a pair of lantern modes. From numerically simulated lantern principal modes of a 6-port PL, we find that interferometric observables using a PL behave similarly to separated-aperture visibilities for simple models on small angular scales ($<\lambda/D$) but with greater sensitivity to symmetries and capability to break phase angle degeneracies. Furthermore, we present simulated observations with wavefront errors and compare them to AMI. Despite the redundancy caused by extended lantern principal modes, spatial filtering offers stability to wavefront errors. Our simulated observations suggest that PLs may offer significant benefits in the photon noise-limited regime and in resolving small angular scales at low contrast regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed near-daily observations on the binary pulsars PSR J0218+4232, PSR J1518+4904 and PSR J2023+2853 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). For the first time, we detected the Shapiro time delay in all three pulsar-binary systems, using only 2--4 years of CHIME/Pulsar timing data. We measured the pulsar masses to be $1.49^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ M$_\odot$, $1.470^{+0.030}_{-0.034}$ M$_\odot$ and $1.50^{+0.49}_{-0.38}$ M$_\odot$ respectively. The companion mass to PSR J0218+4232 was found to be $0.179^{+0.018}_{-0.016}$ M$_\odot$. We constrained the mass of the neutron-star companion of PSR J1518+4904 to be $1.248^{+0.035}_{-0.029}$ M$_\odot$, using the observed apsidal motion as a constraint on mass estimation. The binary companion to PSR J2023+2853 was found to have a mass of $0.93^{+0.17}_{-0.14}$ M$_\odot$; in the context of the near-circular orbit, this mass estimate suggests that the companion to PSR J2023+2853 is likely a high-mass white dwarf. By comparing the timing model obtained for PSR J0218+4232 with previous observations, we found a significant change in the observed orbital period of the system of $\dot{P_{\rm b}} = 0.14(2) \times 10^{-12}$; we determined that this variation arises from ``Shklovskii acceleration" due to relative motion of the binary system, and used this measurement to estimate a distance of $d=(6.7 \pm 1.0)$ kpc to PSR J0218+4232. This work demonstrates the capability of high-cadence observations, enabled by the CHIME/Pulsar system, to detect and refine general-relativistic effects of binary pulsars over short observing timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the radioactively powered kilonova AT2017gfo, associated with the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A and the gravitational wave source GW170817, has provided the first direct evidence supporting binary neutron star mergers as crucial astrophysical sites for the synthesis of heavy elements beyond iron through $r$-process nucleosysthesis in the universe. However, recent identifications of kilonovae following long-duration gamma-ray bursts, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, has sparked discussions about the potential of neutron star-white dwarf mergers to also produce neutron-rich ejecta and contribute to the production of heavy $r$-process elements. In this work, we estimate the contribution of binary neutron star mergers to the total mass of $r$-process elements in the Milky Way and investigate the possibility of neutron star-white dwarf mergers as alternative astrophysical sites for $r$-process nucleosynthesis through an analysis of the total mass of the $r$-process elements in the Milky Way. Our results reveal that binary neutron star mergers can sufficiently account for the Galactic heavy $r$-process elements, suggesting that these events are the dominant contributor to the production of heavy $r$-process elements in the Milky Way. Considering the total mass of $r$-process elements in the Milky Way and the higher occurrence rate of neutron star-white dwarf mergers, it is unlikely that such mergers can produce a significant amount of neutron-rich ejecta, with the generated mass of $r$-process elements being lower than $0.005M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength spectral analysis of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst, utilizing AstroSat far UV, soft and hard X-ray data, along with (quasi-)simultaneous optical and X-ray data from Las Cumbres Observatory and NICER, respectively. In the soft state, we detect soft X-ray and UV/optical excess components over and above the intrinsic accretion disk emission ($kT_{\rm in}\sim 0.58$ keV) and a steep X-ray power-law component. The soft X-ray excess is consistent with a high-temperature blackbody ($kT\sim 0.79$ keV), while the UV/optical excess is described by UV emission lines and two low-temperature blackbody components ($kT\sim 3.87$ eV and $\sim 0.75$ eV). Employing continuum spectral fitting, we determine the black hole spin parameter ($a=0.77\pm0.21$), using the jet inclination angle of $64^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}$ and a mass spanning $5-10M_{\odot}$. In the hard state, we observe a significantly enhanced optical/UV excess component, indicating a stronger reprocessed emission in the outer disk. Broad-band X-ray spectroscopy in the hard state reveals a two-component corona, each associated with its reflection component, in addition to the disk emission ($kT_{\rm in}\sim 0.19$ keV). The softer coronal component dominates the bolometric X-ray luminosity and produces broader relativistic reflection features, while the harder component gets reflected far from the inner disk, yielding narrow reflection features. Furthermore, our analysis in the hard state suggests a substantial truncation of the inner disk ($\gtrsim 51$ gravitational radii) and a high disk density ($\sim 10^{20}\ \rm cm^{-3}$).
#### A multiwavelength light curve model of the classical nova V339 Del: A  mechanism for the coexistence of dust dip and supersoft X-rays

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08287
 - **Abstract**
 The classical nova V339 Del 2013 is characterized by a 1.5 mag dip of the $V$ light curve owing to a dust shell formation, during which soft X-ray emissions coexist. We present Str\"omgren $y$ band light curve, which represents continuum emission, not influenced by strong [O III] emission lines. The $y$ light curve monotonically decreases in marked contrast to the $V$ light curve that shows a 1.5 mag dip. We propose a multiwavelength light curve model that reproduces the $y$ and $V$ light curves as well as the gamma-ray and X-ray light curves. In our model, a strong shock arises far outside the photosphere after optical maximum, because later ejected matter collides with earlier ejected gas. Our shocked shell model explains optical emission lines, H$\alpha$, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray fluxes. A dust shell forms behind the shock that suppresses [O III]. This low flux of [O III] shapes a 1.5 mag drop in the $V$ light curve. Then, the $V$ flux recovers by increasing contribution from [O III] lines, while the $y$ flux does not. However, the optical depth of the dust shell is too small to absorb the photospheric (X-ray) emission of the white dwarf. This is the reason that a dust shell and a soft X-ray radiation coexist. We determined the white dwarf mass to be $M_{\rm WD}=1.25\pm 0.05~M_\odot$ and the distance modulus in the $V$ band to be $(m-M)_V=12.2 \pm 0.2$; the distance is $d= 2.1\pm 0.2$ kpc for the reddening of $E(B-V)=0.18$.

 - **Abstract**
 The two prevailing planet formation scenarios, core-accretion and disk instability, predict distinct planetary mass-metallicity relations. Yet, the detection of this trend remains challenging due to inadequate data on planet atmosphere abundance and inhomogeneities in both planet and host stellar abundance measurements. Here we analyze high-resolution spectra for the host stars of 19 transiting exoplanets to derive the C, O, Na, S, and K abundances, including planetary types from cool mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters ($T_{\rm eq}\ \sim$ 300 - 2700 K; planet radius $\sim$ 0.1 - 2 $R_{\rm J}$). Our Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the current dataset, updated based on Welbanks et al. 2019, is unable to distinguish between a linear relation and an independent distribution model for the abundance-mass correlation for water, Na, or K. To detect a trend with strong evidence (Bayes factor > 10) at the 2$\sigma$ confidence interval, we recommend a minimum sample of 58 planets with HST measurements of water abundances coupled with [O/H] of the host stars, or 45 planets at the JWST precision. Coupled with future JWST or ground-based high resolution data, this well-characterized sample of planets with precise host star abundances constitute an important ensemble of planets to further probe the abundance-mass correlation.
#### Azimuthal metallicity variations, spiral structure, and the failure of  radial actions based on assuming axisymmetry

 - **Abstract**
 We study azimuthal variations in the mean stellar metallicity, <[Fe/H]>, in a self-consistent, isolated simulation in which all stars form out of gas. We find <[Fe/H]> variations comparable to those observed in the Milky Way and which are coincident with the spiral density waves. The azimuthal variations are present in young and old stars and therefore are not a result of recently formed stars. Similar variations are present in the mean age and alpha-abundance. We measure the pattern speeds of the <[Fe/H]>-variations and find that they match those of the spirals, indicating that they are at the origin of the metallicity patterns. Because younger stellar populations are not just more [Fe/H]-rich and alpha-poor but also dynamically cooler, we expect them to more strongly support spirals, which is indeed the case in the simulation. However, if we measure the radial action, J_R, using the Stackel axisymmetric approximation, we find that the spiral ridges are traced by regions of high J_R, contrary to expectations. Assuming that the passage of stars through the spirals leads to unphysical variations in the measured J_R, we obtain an improved estimate of J_R by averaging over a 1 Gyr time interval. This time-averaged J_R is a much better tracer of the spiral structure, with minima at the spiral ridges. We conclude that the errors incurred by the axisymmetric approximation introduce correlated deviations large enough to render the instantaneous radial action inadequate for tracing spirals.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino detector is currently under construction at 3500 m depth offshore Capo Passero, Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea. The main science objectives are the detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the discovery of their sources. Simulations were conducted for the full KM3NeT/ARCA detector, instrumenting a volume of 1 km$^3$, to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential to point-like neutrino sources and an all-sky diffuse neutrino flux. This paper covers the reconstruction of track- and shower-like signatures, as well as the criteria employed for neutrino event selection. By leveraging both the track and shower observation channels, the KM3NeT/ARCA detector demonstrates the capability to detect the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux within half a year of operation, achieving a 5$\sigma$ statistical significance. With an angular resolution below 0.1$^\circ$ for tracks and under 2$^\circ$ for showers, the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources surpasses existing observed limits across the entire sky.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the two-dimensional structure of a rigidly rotating self-gravitating body is accessible with relatively good precision by assuming a purely spheroidal stratification. With this hypothesis, the two-dimensional problem becomes one-dimensional, and consists in solving two coupled fixed-point equations in terms of equatorial mass density and eccentricity of isopycnics. We propose a simple algorithm of resolution based on the self-consistent field method. Compared to the full unconstrained-surface two-dimensional problem, the precision in the normalized enthalpy field is better than $10^{-3}$ in absolute, and the computing time is drastically reduced. In addition, this one-dimensional approach is fully appropriate to fast rotators, works for any density profile (including any barotropic equation of state), and can account for mass density jumps in the system, including the existence of an ambient pressure. Several tests are given.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the cluster mass function traces the growth of the linear density perturbations and can be utilized for constraining the parameters of cosmological and alternative gravity models. In this context, we present new constraints on potential deviations from general relativity by investigating the Hu-Sawicki parametrization of the f(R) gravity with the first SRG-eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) cluster catalog in the Western Galactic Hemisphere in combination with the overlapping Dark Energy Survey Year 3, KiloDegree Survey and Hyper Supreme Camera data for weak lensing mass calibration. For the first time, we present constraints obtained from cluster abundances only. When we consider massless neutrinos, we find a strict upper limit of log |fR0| < -4.31 at 95% confidence level. Massive neutrinos suppress structure growth at small scales, and thus have the opposite effect of f(R) gravity. We consequently investigate the joint fit of the mass of the neutrinos with the modified gravity parameter. We obtain log |fR0| < -4.12 jointly with \sum m_\nu < 0.44 e.V. at 95% confidence level, tighter than the limits in the literature utilizing cluster counts only. At log |fR0|= - 6, the number of clusters is not significantly changed by the theory. Consequently, we do not find any statistical deviation from general relativity from the study of eRASS1 cluster abundance. Deeper surveys with eROSITA, increasing the number of detected clusters, will further improve constraints on log |fR0| and investigate alternative gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio, sub-millimiter and millimeter ground-based telescopes are powerful instruments for studying the gas and dust-rich regions of the Universe that are invisible at optical wavelengths, but the pointing accuracy is crucial for obtaining high-quality data. Pointing errors are small deviations of the telescope's orientation from its desired direction. The telescopes use linear regression pointing models to correct for these errors, taking into account various factors such as weather conditions, telescope mechanical structure, and the target's position in the sky. However, residual pointing errors can still occur due to factors that are hard to model accurately, such as thermal and gravitational deformation and environmental conditions like humidity and wind. Here we present a proof-of-concept for reducing pointing error for the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope in the high-altitude Atacama Desert in Chile based on machine learning. Using historic pointing data from 2022, we trained eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models that reduced the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) for azimuth and elevation (horizontal and vertical angle) pointing corrections by 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, on hold-out test data. Our results will inform operations of current and future facilities such as the next-generation Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST).

 - **Abstract**
 As the number of known Galactic structures mounts thanks to the Gaia Space Telescope, it is now pertinent to study methods for disentangling structures occupying the same regions of the Milky Way. Indeed, understanding the precise form of each individual structure and the interactions between structures may aid in understanding their origins and chronology. Moreover, accounting for known structures allows one to probe still finer Galactic structure. In order to demonstrate, we have developed an odd low-pass filter (OLPF) which removes smaller, odd-parity structures like the vertical waves, and use the filtered data to examine the location of the Galaxy's mid-plane. We find that the radial wave identified by Xu et al. (2015) continues inward to at least the Sun's location, with an amplitude that decreases towards the inner, denser parts of the disk, consistent with a simple, qualitative simulation. Additionally, we employ the OLPF results to determine the solar offset, $z_{\odot}$, with smaller structures filtered out. We find that $z_{\odot} = 34.2 \pm 0.3$ pc.
#### Clustering of primordial black holes from quantum diffusion during  inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We study how large fluctuations are spatially correlated in the presence of quantum diffusion during inflation. This is done by computing real-space correlation functions in the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. We first derive an exact description of physical distances as measured by a local observer at the end of inflation, improving on previous works. Our approach is based on recursive algorithmic methods that consistently include volume-weighting effects. We then propose a "large-volume'' approximation under which calculations can be done using first-passage time analysis only, and from which a new formula for the power spectrum in stochastic inflation is derived. We then study the full two-point statistics of the curvature perturbation. Due to the presence of exponential tails, we find that the joint distribution of large fluctuations is of the form $P(\zeta_{R_1}, \zeta_{R_2}) = F(R_1,R_2,r) P(\zeta_{R_1})P( \zeta_{R_2})$, where $\zeta_{R_1}$ and $\zeta_{R_2}$ denote the curvature perturbation coarse-grained at radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, around two spatial points distant by $r$. This implies that, on the tail, the reduced correlation function, defined as $P(\zeta_{R_1}>\zeta_{\rm{c}}, \zeta_{R_2}>\zeta_{\rm{c}})/[P(\zeta_{R_1}>\zeta_{\rm{c}}) P(\zeta_{R_2}>\zeta_{\rm{c}})]-1$, is independent of the threshold value $\zeta_{\rm{c}}$. This contrasts with Gaussian statistics where the same quantity strongly decays with $\zeta_{\rm{c}}$, and shows the existence of a universal clustering profile for all structures forming in the exponential tails. Structures forming in the intermediate (i.e. not yet exponential) tails may feature different, model-dependent behaviours.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio interferometers targeting the 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations at high redshift are subject to systematic effects that operate over a range of different timescales. These can be isolated by designing appropriate Fourier filters that operate in fringe-rate (FR) space, the Fourier pair of local sidereal time (LST). Applications of FR filtering include separating effects that are correlated with the rotating sky vs. those relative to the ground, down-weighting emission in the primary beam sidelobes, and suppressing noise. FR filtering causes the noise contributions to the visibility data to become correlated in time however, making interpretation of subsequent averaging and error estimation steps more subtle. In this paper, we describe fringe rate filters that are implemented using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, and designed for two different purposes -- beam sidelobe/horizon suppression (the `mainlobe' filter), and ground-locked systematics removal (the `notch' filter). We apply these to simulated data, and study how their properties affect visibilities and power spectra generated from the simulations. Included is an introduction to fringe-rate filtering and a demonstration of fringe-rate filters applied to simple situations to aid understanding.
