#### Anisotropies of Diffusive Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays in $f(R)$  Gravity Theory

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the anisotropy of ultra high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is crucial for unraveling the origins and propagation mechanisms of these enigmatic particles. In this work, we studied the dipolar anisotropy of UHECRs in the diffusive regime by considering three cosmological models: the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, $f(R)$ gravity power-law model and the Starobinsky model. This work aims to see the role of the $f(R)$ gravity theory in understanding the anisotropy of UHECRs without condoning the standard cosmology. We found that the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy is sensitive to these cosmological models, with the $f(R)$ power-law model predicting the largest amplitude, while the $\Lambda$CDM model predicting the smallest amplitude at most of the energies in the range considered. The predicted amplitude of the Starobinsky model lies within the range of the $\Lambda$CDM one. This work not only provides a way for exploration of UHECRs anisotropy within different cosmological contexts but also may pave the way for new avenues of research at the intersection of high-energy astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric data were used to perform the first light curve analysis of the V0610 Vir binary system. We extracted the minima from our observations and compiled the literature, which was few in number. Therefore, we performed computations using the reference ephemeris and presented a new ephemeris and O-C diagram with a linear fit. Light curve analysis was performed using the PHOEBE Python code and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The assumption of a cold spot was required due to the asymmetry in the light curve's maxima. The analysis shows that V0610 Vir is a contact binary system with a fillout factor of 0.085, a mass ratio of 0.998, and an inclination of 70.65deg. The absolute parameters of the system were estimated based on the Gaia DR3 parallax method. The results show that the system is a Low-Mass Contact Binary (LMCB) with a total mass lower than 0.8(M_Sun). The location of the stars was shown in the M-L and M-R diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 This article examines India's first science lander mission on 22 July 2019, attempting a historic landing on the Lunar South Pole Region. Communication was lost at 2.1 km above the lunar surface during the rough braking phase. The cause of the Chandrayaan 2 lander "Vikram" failure remains undisclosed. Possible factors such as vibrations, thruster issues, and power depletion are considered. Recommendations include backup power sources and direct communication systems for interplanetary missions. Despite the setback, ISRO proposed "Chandrayaan 3" to explore the lunar polar region. Chandrayaan 2's legacy influences future missions, shaping India's aspirations for pioneering space endeavors. Gratitude is expressed to ISRO for insights gained during live coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 500 AU and 700 AU resolution 1 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations, respectively, of protostellar cores in protoclusters Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) North (N) and Main (M), parts of the most actively star-forming cloud in our Galaxy. Previous lower resolution (5000 AU) 3 mm observations of this region detected $\sim$150 sources inferred to be young stellar objects (YSOs) with $M>8\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$. With a tenfold increase in resolution, we detect 371 sources at 3 mm and 218 sources in the smaller field of view at 1 mm. The sources seen at low resolution are observed to fragment into an average of two objects. About a third of the observed sources fragment. Most of the sources we report are marginally resolved and are at least partially optically thick. We determine that the observed sources are most consistent with Stage 0/I YSOs, i.e., rotationally supported disks with an active protostar and an envelope, that are warmer than those observed in the solar neighborhood. We report source-counting-based inferred stellar mass and the star formation rate of the cloud: 2800$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$, 0.0038$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for Sgr B2 N and 6900$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$, 0.0093$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for Sgr B2 M respectively.
#### A novel eccentricity parameterization for transit-only models

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel eccentricity parameterization for transit-only fits that allows us to efficiently sample the eccentricity and argument of periastron, while being able to generate a self-consistent model of a planet in a Keplerian orbit around its host star. With simulated fits of 330 randomly generated systems, we demonstrate that typical parameterizations often lead to inaccurate and overly precise determinations of the planetary eccentricity. However, our proposed parameterization allows us to accurately -- and often precisely -- recover the eccentricity for the simulated planetary systems with only transit data available.
#### GA-NIFS: co-evolution within a highly star-forming galaxy group at z=3.7  witnessed by JWST/NIRSpec IFS

 - **Abstract**
 We present NIRSpec IFS observations of a galaxy group around the massive GS_4891 galaxy at z=3.7 in GOODS-South that includes two other two systems, GS_4891_n to the north and GS_28356 to the east. These observations, obtained as part of the GTO GA-NIFS program, allow for the first time to study the spatially resolved properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy at this redshift. Leveraging the wide wavelength range spanned with the high-dispersion grating (with resolving power R=2700) observations, covering from [OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,29 to [SII]$\lambda$$\lambda$6716,31, we explore the spatial distribution of star-formation rate, nebular attenuation and gas metallicity, together with the mechanisms responsible for the excitation of the ionized gas. GS_4891 presents a clear gradient of gas metallicity (as traced by 12 + log(O/H)) by more than 0.2dex from the south-east (where a star-forming clump is identified) to the north-west. The gas metallicity in the less-massive northern system, GS_4891_n, is also higher by 0.2 dex than at the center of GS_4891, suggesting that inflows of lower-metallicity gas might be favoured in higher-mass systems. The kinematic analysis shows that GS_4891 presents velocity gradients in the ionized gas consistent with rotation. The region between GS_4891 and GS_4891_n does not present high gas turbulence which, together with the difference in gas metallicities, suggests that these two systems might be in a pre-merger stage. Finally, GS_4891 hosts an ionized outflow that extends out to r_out=1.2 kpc from the nucleus and reaches maximum velocities v_out of approximately 400 km/s. Despite entraining an outflowing mass rate of M_out$\sim$2Msun/yr, the low associated mass-loading factor, $\eta$=0.05, implies that the outflow does not have a significant impact on the star-formation activity of the galaxy.
#### A disc wind model for blueshifts in quasar broad emission lines

 - **Abstract**
 Blueshifts - or, more accurately, blue asymmetries - in broad emission lines such as CIV $\lambda$1550 are common in luminous quasars and correlate with fundamental properties such as Eddington ratio and broad absorption line (BAL) characteristics. However, the formation of these blueshifts is still not understood, and neither is their physical connection to the BAL phenomenon or accretion disc. In this work, we present Monte Carlo radiative transfer and photoionization simulations using parametrized biconical disc-wind models. We take advantage of the azimuthal symmetry of a quasar and show that we can reproduce CIV blueshifts provided that (i) the disc-midplane is optically thick out to radii beyond the line formation region, so that the receding wind bicone is obscured; and (ii) the system is viewed from relatively low (that is, more face-on) inclinations ($\lesssim40^\circ$). We show that CIV emission line blueshifts and BALs can form in the same wind structure. The velocity profile of the wind has a significant impact on the location of the line formation region and the resulting line profile, suggesting that the shape of the emission lines can be used as a probe of wind-driving physics. While we are successful at producing blueshifts/blue asymmetries in outflows, we struggle to match the detailed shape or skew of the observed emission line profiles. In addition, our models produce redshifted emission-line asymmetries for certain viewing angles. We discuss our work in the context of the CIV $\lambda$1550 emission blueshift versus equivalent-width space and explore the implications for quasar disc wind physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Wavelength-shifting (WLS) materials contain molecules that absorb light and reemit at longer wavelengths. They can be used for light detection because they provide a large effective area for low cost and they are able to efficiently trap and guide light because of total internal reflection processes. We are currently developing such a WLS detector, considering two main designs: A single-shift design with one wavelength shift (tile) and a double-shift design with two wavelength shifts (tile and fiber). As photodetectors we use small Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) with a high photon detection efficiency (PDE) and single-photon sensitivity. The double-shift layout goes at the expense of detection efficiency. In this design however, light is channeled to the two ends of a fiber, thus requiring a reduced photosensitive area compared to the single-shift layout. We will present the results of our measurements and show that light traps and SiPMs together represent a promising alternative to PMTs in case of a non-focused light beam. For the special case of SWGO, the application of light traps is also motivated by a possible improvement of the gamma/hadron separation, using a one-chamber tank with an array of wavelength-shifting light traps instead of a (two-chamber) tank with PMTs. Besides SWGO, new WLS detectors could also constitute useful and cheap technology for other experiments and use cases. The contribution summarizes our motivation and efforts to build a light trap detection module and to characterize its properties in terms of costs, temporal performance and detection efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay of the chemistry and physics that exists within astrochemically relevant sources can only be fully appreciated if we can gain a holistic understanding of their chemical inventories. Previous work by Lee et al. (2021) demonstrated the capabilities of simple regression models to reproduce the abundances of the chemical inventory of the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1), as well as provide abundance predictions for new candidate molecules. It remains to be seen, however, to what degree TMC-1 is a ``unicorn'' in astrochemistry, where the simplicity of its chemistry and physics readily facilitates characterization with simple machine learning models. Here we present an extension in chemical complexity to a heavily studied high-mass star forming region: the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula. Unlike TMC-1, Orion KL is composed of several structurally distinct environments that differ chemically and kinematically, wherein the column densities of molecules between these components can have non-linear correlations that cause the unexpected appearance or even lack of likely species in various environments. This proof-of-concept study used similar regression models sampled by Lee et al. (2021) to accurately reproduce the column densities from the XCLASS fitting program presented in Crockett et al. (2014).

 The MMT Adaptive Optics exoPlanet Characterization System (MAPS) is a comprehensive update to the first generation MMT adaptive optics system (MMTAO), designed to produce a facility class suite of instruments whose purpose is to image nearby exoplanets. The system's adaptive secondary mirror (ASM), although comprised in part of legacy components from the MMTAO ASM, represents a major leap forward in engineering, structure and function. The subject of this paper is the design, operation, achievements and technical issues of the MAPS adaptive secondary mirror. We discuss laboratory preparation for on-sky engineering runs, the results of those runs and the issues we discovered, what we learned about those issues in a follow-up period of laboratory work, and the steps we are taking to mitigate them.
#### Polarization Measurements of Arecibo-Sky Pulsars: Faraday Rotations and  Emission-Beam Analyses

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14537
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14537
 - **Abstract**
 We present Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) values derived at L- and P-band as well as some 60 Stokes-parameter profiles, both determined from our longstanding Arecibo dual-frequency pulsar polarimetry programs. Many of the RM measurements were carried out toward the inner Galaxy and the Anticenter on pulsars with no previous determination, while others are re-measurements intended to confirm or improve the accuracy of existing values. Stokes-parameter profiles are displayed for the 58 pulsars for which no meaningful Stokes profile at lower frequency is available and four without a high frequency pair. This is a population that includes many distant pulsars in the inner Galaxy. A number of these polarized pulse profiles exhibit clear interstellar-scattering tails; nonetheless, we have attempted to interpret the associated emission-beam structures and to provide morphological classifications and geometrical models where possible.
#### POEMMA (Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics) Roadmap Update

 - **Abstract**
 The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) was designed as a NASA Astrophysics probe-class mission to identify the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and observe cosmic neutrinos from extremely energetic transient sources. POEMMA consists of two identical spacecraft flying in a loose formation at 525 km altitude oriented to view a common atmospheric volume and to provide full-sky coverage for both types of messengers. Each spacecraft hosts a wide field of view Schmidt telescope with a hybrid focal plane optimized to observe both the UV fluorescence signal from extensive air showers (EASs) and the optical Cherenkov signals from EASs. When in stereo close to nadir mode, POEMMA can measure the spectrum, composition, and full-sky distribution of the UHECRs above 20 EeV and be sensitive to UHE neutrinos. When pointing just below the Earth's limb, POEMMA will be sensitive to cosmic tau neutrinos above 20 PeV by observing the Cherenkov radiation of EASs produced by upward-moving tau decays, induced from tau neutrino interactions in the Earth. POEMMA is designed to quickly re-orient to follow a Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) neutrino transient from astrophysical sources with exceptional sensitivity to neutrinos from both short-duration transients, such as short-gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), and long-duration sources, such as binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Here we review the POEMMA mission and discuss the recent progress towards its technical readiness provided by the Mini-EUSO and EUSO-SPB2 missions and the forthcoming Terzina and POEMMA-Balloon-Radio missions

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we report the results of Fe, Mg, Al, and Si abundances analysis for a sample of 439 stars in Omega Centauri, using high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT/FLAMES multi-object spectrograph. Our analysis reveals the presence of four distinct Fe populations, with the main peak occurring at low metallicity, consistent with previous literature findings. We observe a discrete and pronounced Mg-Al anti-correlation, which exhibits variations in shape and extension as a function of metallicity. Specifically, this anti-correlation is present in stars with metallicities lower than approximately -1.3 dex, while it becomes less evident or absent for higher [Fe/H] values. Additionally, we detect (anti-) correlations between Mg and Si, and between Al and Si, whose extensions also vary with metallicity, similar to the Mg-Al anti-correlation. These results suggest that the MgAl cycle plays a crucial role in the formation of multiple populations in Omega Centauri, with the presence of all (anti-) correlations at metallicities lower than -1.3 dex providing evidence for the burning of Mg at very high temperatures (> 10^8 K), at least in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, we observe a clear trend of stars with [Al/Fe] > +0.5 dex as a function of metallicity, confirming for the first time the existence of the two channels of Al production and destruction. This evidence can help to provide further constraints on the potential nature of the polluters responsible for the observed chemical anomalies in this stellar system. Finally, we find that the two most metal-poor populations identified in our sample are compatible with null or very small metallicity dispersion and we discuss how this result fit into a scenario where Omega Centauri is the remnant of a disrupted nucleated dwarf galaxy.
#### Cannonball or Bowling Ball: A Proper Motion and Parallax for PSR  J0002+6216

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of careful astrometric measurements of the Cannonball pulsar J0002+6216 carried out over three years using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). We significantly refine the proper motion to $\mu=35.3\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and place new constraints on the distance, with the overall effect of lowering the velocity and increasing the inferred age to $47.60\pm0.80$ kyr. Although the pulsar is brought more in line with the standard natal kick distribution, this new velocity has implications for the morphology of the pulsar wind nebula that surrounds it, the density of the interstellar medium through which it travels, and the age of the supernova remnant (CTB 1) from which it originates.
#### The ALMA Survey of Star Formation and Evolution in Massive Protoclusters  with Blue Profiles (ASSEMBLE): Core Growth, Cluster Contraction, and  Primordial Mass Segregation

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA Survey of Star Formation and Evolution in Massive Protoclusters with Blue Profiles (ASSEMBLE) aims to investigate the process of mass assembly and its connection to high-mass star formation theories in protoclusters in a dynamic view. We observed 11 massive (Mclump>1000 Msun), luminous (Lbol>10,000 Lsun), and blue-profile (infall signature) clumps by ALMA with resolution of 2200-5500 au at 350 GHz (870 um) in continuum and line emission. 248 dense cores were identified, including 106 cores showing protostellar signatures and 142 prestellar core candidates. Compared to early-stage infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) by ASHES, the core mass and surface density within the ASSEMBLE clumps exhibited significant increment, suggesting concurrent core accretion during the evolution of the clumps. The maximum mass of prestellar cores was found to be 2 times larger than that in IRDCs, indicating evolved protoclusters have the potential to harbor massive prestellar cores. The mass relation between clumps and their most massive core (MMCs) is observed in ASSEMBLE but not in IRDCs, which is suggested to be regulated by multiscale mass accretion. The mass correlation between the core clusters and their MMCs has a steeper slope compared to that observed in stellar clusters, which can be due to fragmentation of the MMC and stellar multiplicity. We observe a decrease in core separation and an increase in central concentration as protoclusters evolve. We confirm primordial mass segregation in the ASSEMBLE protoclusters, possibly resulting from gravitational concentration and/or gas accretion.
#### Clump-scale Gas Infall in High-mass Star Formation: a Multi-transition  View with JCMT HCN (4--3) Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Gas infall motions play a crucial role in high-mass star formation and are characterized by observable signatures in the form of blue-shifted asymmetric spectral line profiles ("blue profiles"). However, the connection between blue profiles and infall motions is unclear due to complex gas motions at parsec scales. In this study, we present the results of an HCN (4-3) mapping survey conducted with the JCMT, towards 38 massive clumps exhibiting blue profiles in HCO+ (3-2). We extract 34 HCN cores from the 38 observed fields. The core-averaged spectra show various line profiles, indicating that blue-profile HCO+ (3-2) does not guarantee the same in HCN (4-3). Through non-LTE radiation transfer calculations, we attribute the low detection rate of high-$J$ blue profiles to a combination of insufficient HCN (4-3) opacity and intricate gas motion across different density layers. The comparison between the MALT90 and BGPS line surveys highlights the importance of appropriate tracers, high spectral resolution, and column density thresholds when searching for blue profiles. We select 11 reliable infall candidates and adopt the Hill5 model to fit the infall velocity of 0.2-1.9 km/s, corresponding to 5% to 74% of free-fall velocity. Assuming a spherically collapsing model, we estimate the median and mean mass infall rates to be 4.5E-3 and 7.6E-3 Msun/year, respectively. The consistency of the mass infall rates among different transitions suggests a steady accretion process from the clump gas envelope to the inner region.
#### Reconciling results of 2019 and 2020 stellar occultations on Pluto's  atmosphere. New constraints from both the 5 September 2019 event and  consistency analysis

 - **Abstract**
 A stellar occultation by Pluto on 5 September 2019 yielded positive detections at two separate stations. Using an approach consistent with comparable studies, we derived a surface pressure of $11.478 \pm 0.55~\mathrm{\mu bar}$ for Pluto's atmosphere from the observations of this event. In addition, to avoid potential method inconsistancies highlighted by Sicardy et al. when comparing with historical pressure measurements, we reanalyzed the data by 15 August 2018 and 17 July 2019 events, respectively. All the new measurements provide a bridge between the two different perspectives on the pressure variation since 2015: a rapid pressure drop from previous studies of the 15 August 2018 and 17 July 2019 events and a plateau phase from that of the 6 June 2020 event. The pressure measurement from the 5 September 2019 event aligns with those from 2016, 2018, and 2020, supporting the latter perspective. While the measurements from the 4 June 2011 and 17 July 2019 events suggest probable V-shaped pressure variations unaccounted for by the volatile transport model (VTM) from Meza et al., the VTM remains applicable on average. And, the validity of the V-shaped variations is debatable due to the stellar faintness of the 4 June 2011 event and the grazing single-chord geometry of the 17 July 2019 event. To reveal and understand all significant pressure variations of Pluto's atmosphere, it is essential to provide constraints on both short-term and long-term evolutions of the interacting atmosphere and surface by continuous pressure monitoring through occultation observations, whenever possible, complemented by frequent spectroscopy and photometry of the surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Astro-COLIBRI is an innovative tool designed for professional astronomers to facilitate the study of transient astronomical events. Transient events - such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and stellar mergers - are fleeting cataclysmic phenomena that can offer profound insights into the most violent processes in the universe. Revealing their secrets requires rapid and precise observations: Astro-COLIBRI alerts its users of new transient discoveries from observatories all over the world in real-time. The platform also provides observers the details they need to make follow-up observations. Some of the transient phenomena available through Astro-COLIBRI are accessible by amateur astronomers and citizen scientists. A subset of the features dedicated to this growing group of users are highlighted here. They include the possibility of receiving only alerts on very bright events, the possibility of defining custom observer locations, as well as the calculation of optimized observation plans for searches for optical counterparts to gravitational wave events.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama desert stands as the most arid, non-polar, region on Earth and has accommodated a considerable portion of the world's ground-based astronomical observatories for an extended period. The comprehension of factors important for observational conditions in this region, and the potential alterations induced by the escalating impact of climate change, are, therefore, of the utmost significance. In this study, we conduct an analysis of the surface-level air temperature, water vapour density, and astronomical seeing at the European Southern Observatory (commonly known by its acronym, ESO) telescope sites in northern Chile. Our findings reveal a discernible rise in temperature across all sites during the last decade. Moreover, we establish a correlation between the air temperature and water vapour density with the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases, wherein, the warm anomaly known as El Ni\~no (EN) corresponds to drier observing conditions, coupled with higher maximum daily temperatures favouring more challenging near-infrared observations. The outcomes of this investigation have potential implications for the enhancement of the long-term scheduling of observations at telescope sites in northern Chile, thereby aiding in better planning and allocation of resources for the astronomy community.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumstellar disk images have highlighted a wide variety of morphological features. Recovering disk images from high-contrast angular differential imaging (ADI) sequences are however generally affected by geometrical biases, leading to unreliable inference of the morphology of extended disk features. Recently, two types of approaches have been proposed to recover more robust disk images from ADI sequences: iterative principal component analysis, and inverse problem approaches. We introduce MUSTARD, a new IP-based algorithm designed to address the problem of the flux invariant to the rotation in ADI sequences; a limitation inherent to the ADI observing strategy, and discuss the advantages of IP approaches with respect to PCA-based algorithms. The MUSTARD model relies on the addition of morphological priors on the disk and speckle field to a standard IP approach to tackle rotation-invariant signal in circumstellar disk images. We compare the performance of MUSTARD, I-PCA, and standard PCA on a sample of high-contrast imaging data sets acquired in different observing conditions, after injecting a variety of synthetic disk models at different contrast levels. MUSTARD significantly improves the recovery of rotation-invariant signal in disk images, especially for data sets obtained in good observing conditions. However, the MUSTARD model is shown to inadequately handle unstable ADI data sets, and to provide shallower detection limits than PCA-based approaches. MUSTARD has the potential to deliver more robust disk images by introducing a prior to address the inherent ambiguity of ADI observations. However, the effectiveness of the prior is partly hindered by our limited knowledge of the morphological and temporal properties of the stellar speckle halo. In light of this limitation, we suggest that the algorithm could be improved by enforcing a prior based on a library of reference stars

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, such as the VERITAS array, are subject to the Night Sky Background (NSB) and electronic noise, which contribute to the total signal of pixels in the telescope camera. The contribution of noise photons in event images is reduced with the application of image cleaning methods. Conventionally, high thresholds must be employed to ensure the removal of pixels containing noise signal. On that account, low-energy gamma-ray showers might be suppressed during the cleaning. We present here the application of an optimised next neighbour image cleaning for the VERITAS array. With this technique, differential noise rates are estimated for each individual observation and thus changes in the NSB and afterpulsing are consistently being accounted for. We show that this method increases the overall rate of reconstructed gamma-rays, lowers the energy threshold of the array and allows the reconstruction of low energy (E > 70 GeV) source events which were suppressed by the conventional cleaning method.

 - **Abstract**
 RX J0440.9+4431, a Be/X-ray binary, had its brightest outburst in 2022 since its discovery, with a peak X-ray flux of 2.25 Crab (as recorded by Swift/BAT, 15-50 keV). We analyze the timing properties of this giant outburst using data from Insight-HXMT and NICER, focusing on the evolution of the pulse profile and pulse fraction. We observe that when the luminosity reached around ~ 3*10^{37} er s^{-1}, a transition from double-peaked to single-peaked pulse profiles occurred across the energy range, with the peak of the low-energy profile aligning gradually with the peak of the high-energy profile. This change indicates a transition from subcritical to supercritical accretion. Additionally, we found a concave in the pulse fraction as a function of energy around 20-30 keV throughout the entire outburst period. Compared to the low luminosity, the concave becomes weaker in high luminosities, and overall, the pulse fraction is higher. We propose that this concave could be caused by the scattering of high-energy photons by the atmosphere of a neutron star, leading to a dilution of the pulse fraction. As the accretion reaches the supercritical state, the accretion column height increases, resulting in a larger direct component of strongly beamed X-ray flux, and an elevated pulse fraction.
#### Automated analysis of oscillations in coronal bright points

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal bright points (BPs) are numerous, bright, small-scale dynamical features found in the solar corona. Bright points have been observed to exhibit intensity oscillations across a wide range of periodicities and are likely an important signature of plasma heating and/or transport mechanisms. We present a novel and efficient wavelet-based method that automatically detects and tracks the intensity evolution of BPs using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in the 193\r{A} bandpass. Through the study of a large, statistically significant set of BPs, we attempt to place constraints on the underlying physical mechanisms. We used a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) in 2D to detect the BPs within images. One-dimensional CWTs were used to analyse the individual BP time series to detect significant periodicities. We find significant periodicity at 4, 8-10, 17, 28, and 65 minutes. Bright point lifetimes are shown to follow a power law with exponent $-1.13\pm0.07$. The relationship between the BP lifetime and maximum diameter similarly follows a power law with exponent $0.129\pm0.011$. Our wavelet-based method successfully detects and extracts BPs and analyses their intensity oscillations. Future work will expand upon these methods, using larger datasets and simultaneous multi-instrument observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solar coronal jets seen in EUV are ubiquitous on the Sun, have been found in and at the edges of active regions, at the boundaries of coronal holes, and in the quiet Sun. Jets have various shapes, sizes, brightness, velocities and duration in time, which complicates their detection by automated algorithms. So far, solar jets reported in the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK) have been mostly reported by humans looking for them in the data, with different levels of precision regarding their timing and positions. Aims. We create a catalogue of solar jets observed in EUV at 304 {\AA} containing precise and consistent information on the jet timing, position and extent. Methods. We designed a citizen science project, "Solar Jet Hunter", on the Zooniverse platform, to analyze EUV observations at 304 {\AA} from the Solar Dynamic Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). We created movie strips for regions of the Sun in which jets have been reported in HEK and ask the volunteers to 1) confirm the presence of at least one jet in the data and 2) report the timing, position and extent of the jet. Results. We report here the design of the project and the results obtained after the analysis of data from 2011 to 2016. 365 "coronal jet" events from HEK served as input for the citizen science project, equivalent to more than 120,000 images distributed into 9,689 "movie strips". Classification by the citizen scientists resulted with only 21% of the data containing a jet, and 883 individual jets being identified. Conclusions. We demonstrate how citizen science can enhance the analysis of solar data with the example of Solar Jet Hunter. The catalogue of jets thus created is publicly available and will enable statistical studies of jets and related phenomena. This catalogue will also be used as a training set for machines to learn to recognize jets in further data sets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we delve into the temperature-dependent Equation of State (EoS) of baryonic matter within the framework of the FSU2H$^*$ hadronic model, which comprehensively incorporates hyperons and is suitable for relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and supernovae. To assess the impact of the uncertainties in the hyperonic sector on astrophysical observables, we introduce two additional models, namely FSU2H$^*$L and FSU2H$^*$U. These models cover the entire spectrum of variability of hyperonic potentials, as derived from experimental data. Our investigations reveal that these uncertainties extend their influence not only to the relative abundances of various particle species but also to the EoS itself and, consequently, have an impact on the global properties of both cold and hot neutron stars. Notably, their effects become more pronounced at large temperatures, owing to the increased presence of hyperons. These findings have direct implications for the outcomes of relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and supernovae, emphasizing the need of accounting for hyperonic uncertainties to ensure the accuracy and reliability of such simulations in astrophysical contexts.
#### Polymer amide as a source of the cosmic 6.2 micron emission and  absorption

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic infrared emission and absorption spectra often carry a well-defined and invariant 6.2 micron band that has been proposed to emanate from very small dust grains that may carry polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Hemoglycin, a well-defined polymer of glycine that also contains iron, has been found in meteorites of the primordial CV3 class and therefore originated in the solar protoplanetary disc. In approximate calculations, the principal amide I infrared absorption band of hemoglycin is at 6.04 microns. Hemoglycin, an antiparallel beta sheet structure with two 11-mer glycine chains, has an exact structural analog in antiparallel poly-L-lysine beta sheets which in the laboratory have an absorption peak at 6.21 microns. This wavelength coincidence, the demonstrated propensity of hemoglycin 4.9nm rods to form accreting lattice structures, and its proven existence in the solar protoplanetary disc strongly suggest that the cosmic 6.2 micron emission and absorption could be from small grains that are hemoglycin lattices or shell-like vesicles carrying internal organic molecules of various types. Calculated hemoglycin ultraviolet absorptions associated with iron in the molecule match the observed ultraviolet extinction feature at nominal 2175 Angstroms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectroscopic confirmation and precise mass measurement of the warm giant planet TOI-199 b. This planet was first identified in TESS photometry and confirmed using ground-based photometry from ASTEP in Antarctica including a full 6.5$\,$h long transit, PEST, Hazelwood, and LCO; space photometry from NEOSSat; and radial velocities (RVs) from FEROS, HARPS, CORALIE, and CHIRON. Orbiting a late G-type star, TOI-199\,b has a $\mathrm{104.854_{-0.002}^{+0.001} \, d}$ period, a mass of $\mathrm{0.17\pm0.02 \, M_J}$, and a radius of $\mathrm{0.810\pm0.005 \, R_J}$. It is the first warm exo-Saturn with a precisely determined mass and radius. The TESS and ASTEP transits show strong transit timing variations, pointing to the existence of a second planet in the system. The joint analysis of the RVs and TTVs provides a unique solution for the non-transiting companion TOI-199 c, which has a period of $\mathrm{273.69_{-0.22}^{+0.26} \, d}$ and an estimated mass of $\mathrm{0.28_{-0.01}^{+0.02} \, M_J}$. This period places it within the conservative Habitable Zone.

 - **Abstract**
 In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, the multi-messenger GW observation for binary neutron star (BNS) merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. In this work, we comprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations by considering the 3G GW detectors and the future short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint observations. Based on the 10-year observation of different detection strategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 277-685 with the redshifts $z<4$ and the inclination angles $\iota<17^{\circ}$. For the cosmological analysis, we consider five typical dark energy models, i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM models, and interacting dark energy (IDE) models (I$\Lambda$CDM and I$w$CDM). We find that GW can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with precisions of $0.09\%$-$0.37\%$, but perform not well in constraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). When combining the mock GW data with the CBS data, CBS+GW can tightly constrain the equation of state parameter of dark energy $w$ with a precision of $1.36\%$, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on cosmological parameters by $35.3\%$-$92.0\%$. In conclusion, GW standard siren observations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Detector requirements for far infrared astronomy generally result in devices which exhibit a few-moded response to incident radiation. The sensitivity and spatial form of the individual modes to which such a detector is sensitive can be determined with knowledge of the complex valued cross-spectral density of the system, which we label the detector response function (DRF). A matrix representing the discretized cross-spectral density can be measured from the complex amplitudes of interference fringes generated by two identical sources as they are independently scanned through the field of view. We provide experimental verification of this technique using monochromatic THz beams generated by photomixers in which the relative phase is varied with fiber stretchers. We use this system to characterize the modal response of a single pixel from an array of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs).

 - **Abstract**
 We consider black hole formation due to the gravitational collapse produced by large density fluctuations during an epoch of reheating with a stiff equation of state and calculate the induced gravitational wave spectrum. By considering the existing bounds on the total energy density of gravitational waves today, we find constraints on the parameter space of this scenario. We also calculate the lepton asymmetry generated by metric perturbations via the chiral gravitational anomaly present in the Standard Model and find that, once the electroweak sphaleron processes have taken place, the large spectrum of scalar perturbations responsible for black hole formation induces a peak in the baryon asymmetry fluctuations on small scales.
#### On the Distances to the X-ray Binaries Cygnus X-3 and GRS 1915+105

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we significantly improve estimates of distance to the X-ray binary systems Cyg X-3 and GRS 1915+105. We report a highly accurate trigonometric parallax measurement for Cyg X-3 using the VLBA at 43 GHz, placing the source at a distance of 9.67+0.53-0.48 kpc. We also use Galactic proper motions and line-of-sight radial velocity measurements to determine 3-dimensional (3D) kinematic distances to both systems, under the assumption that they have low peculiar velocities. This yields distances of 8.95+-0.96 kpc for Cyg X-3 and 9.4+-0.6 (statistical)+-0.8 (systematic) for GRS 1915+105. The good agreement between parallax and 3D kinematic distances validates the assumption of low peculiar velocities, and hence small natal kicks, for both of the systems. For a source with a low peculiar velocity, given its parallax distance, Cyg X-3 should have a Vlsr near -64+-5 km/s. Our measurements imply a slightly higher inclination angle, and hence lower black hole mass for GRS 1915+105 than found from previous work by Reid et al (2014) and strengthen arguments from X-ray polarization that Cyg X-3 would be an ultraluminous X-ray source if viewed face-on.

 - **Abstract**
 Several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments such as NANOGrav and PPTA reported evidence of a gravitational wave background at the nano-Hz frequency band recently. This signal can originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) generated by the enhanced curvature perturbation. Here we perform a joint likelihood inference on PTA datasets, and our results show that if the PTA signals were indeed of SIGW origin, the curvature perturbations amplitude required will produce primordial black holes (PBHs) in $[2 \times 10^{-5}, 2 \times 10^{-2}]\ m_\odot$ mass range. Mergers of these PBHs can leave a strong gravitational wave signature in the $[10^{-3}, 10^8]$ Hz frequency range, to be detectable at upcoming interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope, DECIGO and BBO, etc. This offers a multi-frequency opportunity to further scrutinize the source of the observed PTA signal.

 - **Abstract**
 I analyze a new X-ray image of the youngest supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy, which is the type Ia SNR G1.9+0.3, and reveal a very clear point-symmetrical structure. Since explosion models of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) do not form such morphologies, the point-symmetrical morphology must come from the circumstellar material (CSM) into which the ejecta expands. The large-scale point-symmetry that I identify and the known substantial deceleration of the ejecta of SNR G1.9+0.3 suggest a relatively massive CSM of >1Mo. I argue that the most likely explanation is the explosion of this SN Ia into a planetary nebula (PN). The scenario that predicts a large fraction of SN Ia inside PNe (SNIPs) is the core degenerate scenario. Other SN Ia scenarios might lead to only a very small fraction of SNIPs or not at all.
#### A Single Ejection Model of the DART/Dimorphos Debris Trail

 - **Abstract**
 The collision of the NASA DART spacecraft with asteroid Dimorphos resulted in the formation of a distinctive and long-lived debris trail, formed by the action of solar radiation pressure on ejected particles. This trail briefly displayed a double appearance, which has been interpreted as the result of a double ejection. We present a model which can produce a transient double trail without the need to assume a double ejection. Our model explains the appearance of the double trail as a projection of the cone walls when viewed from a large angle to the cone axis and avoids the problem of producing dust in two epochs from a single, instantaneous impact. The particles follow a broken power-law size distribution, with differential indices q = 2.7+/-0.2 (1 um <= a <= 2 mm), 3.9+/-0.1 (2 mm < a <= 1 cm), and 4.2+/-0.2 (1 cm < a <= 20 cm). We find that the total trail mass in particles from 1 um to 20 cm in size (for an assumed density 3500 kg/m3) is ~1.7e7 kg, rising to 2.2e7 kg, when extended to boulders up to 3.5 m in radius. This corresponds to 0.4-0.6% of the mass of Dimorphos.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the prospects of upcoming 21-cm surveys of cosmic dawn ($12\lesssim \!z\lesssim\!30$) to provide cosmological information on top of upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure surveys, such as CMB-S4, Simons Observatory (SO) and DESI. We focus on the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$ which is a promising observable for probing beyond the Standard Model theories. We show including upcoming 21-cm surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) can allow probing a wide range of models for light particles at $2\sigma$ level achieving $2\sigma(N_{\rm eff})=0.034$ with CMB-S4, for example. Taking into account the degeneracy between $N_{\rm eff}$ and primordial helium fraction $Y_p$, one can achieve improvements in sensitivities to cosmological parameters, in particular, by more than a factor of 2 for $N_{\rm eff}$ and dark matter fractional energy density $\omega_c$.
