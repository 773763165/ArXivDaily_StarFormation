 - **Authors:** Chris Byrohl, Dylan Nelson
 - **Subjects:** Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17818
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17818
 - **Abstract**
 scida is a Python package for reading and analyzing large scientific data sets with support for various cosmological and galaxy formation simulations out-of-the-box. Data access is provided through a hierarchical dictionary-like data structure after a simple load() function. Using the dask library for scalable, parallel and out-of-core computation, all computation requests from a user session are first collected in a task graph. Arbitrary custom analysis, as well as all available dask (array) operations, can be performed. The subsequent computation is executed only upon request, on a target resource (e.g. a HPC cluster).

 - **Abstract**
 The energy injection through Hawking evaporation has been used to put strong constraints on primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate at masses below $10^{17}\,\rm{g}$. However, Hawking's semiclassical approximation breaks down at latest after half-decay. Beyond this point, the evaporation could be significantly suppressed as was shown in recent work. In this study, we review existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds on primordial black holes taking this effect into account. We show that the constraints disappear completely for a reasonable range of parameters, which opens a new window below $10^{10}\,\rm{g}$ for light primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly radio-loud quasars (HRLQs; $\log R>2.5$) at $z\gtrsim 4$ show apparent enhanced X-ray emission compared to matched HRLQs at lower redshifts, perhaps due to a redshift-dependent fractional contribution to the X-ray luminosity from inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB). Using new {\it Chandra} observations and archival X-ray data, we investigate this phenomenon with an optically flux-limited sample of 41 HRLQs at $z = 4$--5.5 all with sensitive X-ray coverage, the largest sample utilized to date by a wide margin. X-ray enhancements are assessed using X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and spectral energy distributions. We confirm the presence of X-ray enhancements at a 4.9--5.3$\sigma$ significance level, finding that the median factor of enhancement is $\approx 1.8$ at our sample median redshift of $z\approx 4.4$. Under a fractional IC/CMB model, the expected enhancement at lower redshifts is modest; e.g., $\approx 4$% at $z\approx 1.5$. We also investigate a sample of seven radio-loud quasars (RLQs; $\log R>1$) at even higher redshifts of $z=5.6$--6.8, using new and archival X-ray data. These RLQs also show evidence for X-ray enhancements by a median factor of $\approx 2.7$ at a 3.7--4.9$\sigma$ significance level. The X-ray spectral and other properties of these $z=5.6$--6.8 RLQs, however, pose challenges for a straightforward fractional IC/CMB interpretation of their enhancements.
#### A possible relation between global CO excitation and massive molecular  outflows in local ULIRGs

 - **Abstract**
 Local ULIRGs host ubiquitous molecular outflows, including the most massive and powerful ever detected. These sources have also exceptionally excited global, galaxy-integrated CO ladders. A connection between outflows and molecular gas excitation has however never been established, since previous multi-J CO surveys were limited in spectral resolution and sensitivity and so could only probe the global molecular gas conditions. We address this question using new, ground-based, sensitive heterodyne spectroscopy of multiple CO rotational lines (up to CO(7-6)) in a sample of 17 local ULIRGs. We used the APEX telescope to survey the CO($J_{up}\geq4$) lines at a high signal-to-noise ratio, and complemented these data with CO($J_{up}\leq3$) observations presented in Montoya Arroyave et al. (2023). We detected 74 (out of 75) CO lines, with up to six transitions per source. Some CO SLEDs peak at $J_{up}\sim3,4$, which we classify as 'lower excitation', while others plateau or keep increasing up to the highest-J CO transition probed, and we classify these as 'higher excitation'. Our analysis includes the results of CO SLED fits performed with a single large velocity gradient component, but our main focus is the investigation of possible links between global CO excitation and the presence of broad and/or high-velocity CO spectral components that can contain outflowing gas. We discovered an increasing trend of line width as a function of $J_{up}$ of the CO transition, which is significant at the $4\sigma$ level and appears to be driven by the eight sources classified as 'higher excitation'. For such ULIRGs we found that the CO ladders are more excited for spectral components characterised by higher velocities and/or velocity dispersion. We favour an interpretation whereby the highly excited CO-emitting gas in ULIRGs resides in galactic-scale massive molecular outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The surface array of IceCube, IceTop, operates primarily as a cosmic-ray detector, as well as a veto for astrophysical neutrino searches for the IceCube in-ice instrumentation. However, the snow accumulation on top of the IceTop detectors increases the detection threshold and attenuates the measured IceTop signals. Enhancing IceTop by a hybrid array of scintillation detectors and radio antennas will lower the energy threshold for air-shower measurements, provide more efficient veto capabilities, enable more accurate cosmic-ray measurements, and improve the detector calibration by compensating for snow accumulation. After the initial commissioning period, a prototype station at the South Pole has been recording air-shower data and has successfully observed coincident events of both the scintillation detectors and the radio antennas with the IceTop array. The production and calibration of the detectors for the full planned array has been ongoing. Additionally, one station each has been installed at the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array for further R\&D of these detectors in different environmental conditions. This contribution will present the status and future plans of the hybrid detector stations for the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement.
#### New Insight Concerning Primordial Lithium Production

 - **Abstract**
 To constrain the universe before recombination (380000 years after the Big Bang), we mostly rely on the measurements of the primordial abundances that indicate the first insight into the thermal history of the universe. The first production of elements is obtained by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The production of the elements (Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4) during the BBN matches well the observations; however, the production of lithium (Lithium-7) based on the Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (SBBN) is found to be higher by about a factor of three than the observed abundance from metal-poor halo stars. This so-called "Cosmological Lithium Problem" is still elusive and needs to be resolved. One important attempt to get more insight into this problem is to invoke a non-standard description of the SBBN to decrease the lithium abundance. In our previous work, we encountered a problem that the decrease in the Lithium-7 abundance requires an increase in the deuterium abundance to maximum values that are not accepted by observations. In the present work, a decrease in the lithium abundance could be achieved without maximizing the deuterium abundance by modifying the time-temperature relation in the range (0.43-0.91) GK during the nucleosynthesis process. This range is crucial to reduce the strong correlation between lithium and deuterium production. The main conclusion of the present work is that Lithium-7 abundance in the atmospheres of metal-poor stars cannot be analyzed without considering possible modification of the primordial nucleosynthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of extrasolar planets discovered is increasing, so that more than five thousand exoplanets have been confirmed to date. Now we have an opportunity to test the validity of the laws governing planetary systems and take steps to discover the relationships between the physical parameters of planets and stars. Firstly, we present the results of a search for additional exoplanets in 229 multi-planetary systems that house at least three or more confirmed planets, employing a logarithmic spacing between planets in our Solar System known as the Titius-Bode (TB) relation. We find that the planets in $\sim53\%$ of these systems adhere to a logarithmic spacing relation remarkably better than the Solar System planets. We predict the presence of 426 additional exoplanets, 47 of which are located within the habitable zone (HZ), and five of the 47 planets have a maximum mass limit of 0.1-2$M_{\oplus}$ and a maximum radius lower than 1.25$R_{\oplus}$. Secondly, we employ efficient machine learning approaches to analyze a dataset comprising 762 confirmed exoplanets and eight Solar System planets, aiming to characterize their fundamental quantities. We classify the data into two main classes: 'small' and 'giant' planets, with cut-off values at $R_{p}=8.13R_{\oplus}$ and $M_{p}=52.48M_{\oplus}$. Giant planets have lower densities, suggesting higher H-He mass fractions, while small planets are denser, composed mainly of heavier elements. We highlight that planetary mass, orbital period, and stellar mass play crucial roles in predicting exoplanet radius. Notably, our study reveals a noteworthy result: for giant planets, we observe a strong correlation between planetary radius and the mass of their host stars, which might provide intriguing insights into the relationship between giant planet formation and stellar characteristics.
#### Missing Titanium in the Asymmetric Supernova Remnant W49B

 - **Abstract**
 The progenitor of the W49B supernova remnant is still under debate. One of the candidates is a jet-driven core-collapse supernova. In such a highly asymmetric explosion, a strong $\alpha$-rich freezeout is expected in local high entropy regions, which should enrich elements synthesized by the capture of $\alpha$-particles such as $^{44}$Ti and $^{48}$Cr (decaying to $^{44}$Ca and $^{48}$Ti, respectively). In the present work, in order to infer the progenitor of the W49B remnant, we constrain the amount of stable Ti ($^{48}$Ti) synthesized, using the {\it Suzaku} observation. We found no firm evidence for the Ti line and set the upper limit of $M_{\rm Ti}/M_{\rm Fe} < 8.2 \times$ 10$^{-4}$ (99\% limit using Xspec) and $M_{\rm Ti}/M_{\rm Fe} < 1.9 \times$ 10$^{-3}$ (99\% limit using SPEX), and thus excluded almost all hypernova/jet-driven supernova models. Our results, as complemented by some previous studies, suggest that a Type Ia supernova from a near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ (Chandrasekhar mass) white dwarf is the most favorable candidate for the origin of W49B. Future observations with X-ray calorimeter missions, such as XRISM, will give us a stronger constraint on the progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio astronomy file formats are now required to store wide frequency bandwidths and multiple simultaneous receiver beams and must be able to account for versatile observing modes and numerous calibration strategies. The need to capture and archive high-time and high frequency-resolution data, along with the comprehensive metadata that fully describe the data, implies that a new data format and new processing software are required. This requirement is suited to a well-defined, hierarchically-structured and flexible file format. In this paper we present the Spectral-Domain Hierarchical Data Format (`SDHDF') -- a new file format for radio astronomy data, in particular for single dish or beam-formed data streams. Since 2018, SDHDF has been the primary format for data products from the spectral-line and continuum observing modes at Murriyang, the CSIRO Parkes 64-m radio telescope, and we demonstrate that this data format can also be used to store observations of pulsars and fast radio bursts.
#### Impact of Systematic Redshift Errors on the Cross-correlation of the  Lyman-$α$ Forest with Quasars at Small Scales Using DESI Early Data

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will measure millions of quasar spectra by the end of its 5 year survey. Quasar redshift errors impact the shape of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest correlation functions, which can affect cosmological analyses and therefore cosmological interpretations. Using data from the DESI Early Data Release and the first two months of the main survey, we measure the systematic redshift error from an offset in the cross-correlation of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest with quasars. We find evidence for a redshift dependent bias causing redshifts to be underestimated with increasing redshift, stemming from improper modeling of the Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depth in the templates used for redshift estimation. New templates were derived for the DESI Year 1 quasar sample at $z > 1.6$ and we found the redshift dependent bias, $\Delta r_\parallel$, increased from $-1.94 \pm 0.15$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc to $-0.08 \pm 0.04$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc ($-205 \pm 15~\text{km s}^{-1}$ to $-9.0 \pm 4.0~\text{km s}^{-1}$). These new templates will be used to provide redshifts for the DESI Year 1 quasar sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a novel method for co-adding multiple under-sampled images that combines the iteratively reweighted least squares and divide-and-conquer algorithms. Our approach not only allows for the anti-aliasing of the images but also enables PSF deconvolution, resulting in enhanced restoration of extended sources, the highest PSNR, and reduced ringing artefacts. To test our method, we conducted numerical simulations that replicated observation runs of the CSST/VST telescope and compared our results to those obtained using previous algorithms. The simulation showed that our method outperforms previous approaches in several ways, such as restoring the profile of extended sources and minimizing ringing artefacts. Additionally, because our method relies on the inherent advantages of least squares fitting, it is more versatile and does not depend on the local uniformity hypothesis for the PSF. However, the new method consumes much more computation than the other approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 A measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino spectrum is presented using IceCube data collected from 2011-2022 (10.3 years). We developed novel detection techniques to search for events with a contained vertex and exiting track induced by muon neutrinos undergoing a charged-current interaction. Searching for these starting track events allows us to not only more effectively reject atmospheric muons but also atmospheric neutrino backgrounds in the southern sky, opening a new window to the sub-100 TeV astrophysical neutrino sky. The event selection is constructed using a dynamic starting track veto and machine learning algorithms. We use this data to measure the astrophysical diffuse flux as a single power law flux (SPL) with a best-fit spectral index of $\gamma = 2.58 ^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ and per-flavor normalization of $\phi^{\mathrm{Astro}}_{\mathrm{per-flavor}} = 1.68 ^{+0.19}_{-0.22} \times 10^{-18} \times \mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ (at 100 TeV). The sensitive energy range for this dataset is 3 - 550 TeV under the SPL assumption. This data was also used to measure the flux under a broken power law, however we did not find any evidence of a low energy cutoff.
#### A study of 10 Rotating Radio Transients using Parkes radio telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are a relatively new subclass of pulsars that emit detectable radio bursts sporadically. We conducted an analysis of 10 RRATs observed using the Parkes telescope, with 8 of these observed via the Ultra-Wideband Receiver. We measured the burst rate and produced integrated profiles spanning multiple frequency bands for 3 RRATs. We also conducted a spectral analysis on both integrated pulses and individual pulses of 3 RRATs. All of their integrated pulses follow a simple power law, consistent with the known range of pulsar spectral indices. Their average spectral indices of single pulses are -0.9, -1.2, and -1.0 respectively, which are within the known range of pulsar spectral indices. Additionally, we find that the spreads of single-pulse spectral indices for these RRATs (ranging from -3.5 to +0.5) are narrower compared to what has been observed in other RRATs (Shapiro-Albert et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2022). It is notable that the average spectral index and scatter of single pulses are both relatively small. For the remaining 5 RRATs observed at the UWL receiver, we also provided the upper limits on fluence and flux density. In addition, we obtained the timing solution of PSR J1709-43. Our analysis shows that PSRs J1919+1745, J1709-43 and J1649-4653 are potentially nulling pulsars or weak pulsars with sparse strong pulses.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, with a set of high-resolution He I 10830 \AA\ filtergrams, we select an area in a plage, very likely an EUV moss area, as an interface layer to follow the clues of coronal heating channels down to the photosphere. The filtergrams are obtained from the 1-meter aperture New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). We make a distinction between the darker and the brighter regions in the selected area and name the two regions enhanced absorption patches (EAPs) and low absorption patches (LAPs). With well-aligned, nearly simultaneous data from multiple channels of the AIA and the continuum of the HMI on board SDO, we compare the EUV/UV emissions, emission measure, mean temperature, and continuum intensity in the two kinds of regions. The following progress is made: 1) The mean EUV emissions over EAPs are mostly stronger than the corresponding emissions over LAPs except for the emission at 335 \AA. The UV emissions at 1600 and 1700 \AA\ fail to capture the difference between the two regions. 2) In the logarithmic temperature range of 5.6-6.2, EAPs have higher EUV emission measure than LAPs, but they have lower mean coronal temperature. 3) The mean continuum intensity over EAPs is lower. Based on the above progress, we suggest that the energy for coronal heating in the moss region can be traced down to some areas in intergranular lanes with enhanced density of both cool and hot material. The lower temperature over the EAPs is due to the greater fraction of cool material over there.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based reconstruction analysis of the Supernova Ia (SNIa) distance moduli ($\mu(z)$), and hence dark energy, using LSST simulated three-year SNIa data. Our ANN reconstruction architecture can model both the distance moduli and their corresponding error estimates. For this we employ astroANN and incorporate Monte Carlo dropout techniques to quantify uncertainties in our predictions. We tune our hyperparameters through advanced genetic algorithms, including elitism, utilizing the DEAP library. We compared the performance of the ANN based reconstruction with two theoretical descriptions of dark energy models, $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CPL). We perform a Bayesian analysis for these two theoretical models using the LSST simulations and also compare with observations from Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNIa real data. We show that our model-independent reconstruction using ANN is consistent with both of them. We assessed the performance using mean squared error (MSE) and showed that the ANN can produce distance estimates in better agreement with the LSST dataset than either $\Lambda$CDM or CPL, albeit very small. We included an additional residual analysis and a null test with $F$-scores to show that the reconstructed distances from the ANN model, are in excellent agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM or CPL model.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent numerical simulations have shown that the unstable disk within the central regime of the primordial gas cloud fragments to form multiple protostars on several scales. Their evolution depends on the mass accretion phenomenon, interaction with the surrounding medium and radiative feedback respectively. In this work, we use a fast semi-analytical framework in order to model multiple protostars within a rotating cloud, where the mass accretion is estimated via a Bondi-Hoyle flow and the feedback process is approximated through radiation pressure. We observe that while some of the evolving protostars possibly grow massive ($\approx 1-24 M_{\odot}$) via accretion and mergers, a fraction of them ($\approx 20\%$) are likely to be ejected from the parent cloud with a mass corresponding to $M_{*} \lesssim 0.8 M_{\odot}$. These low-mass protostars may be considered as the potential candidates to enter the zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) phase and possibly survive till the present epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify axion miniclusters collapsing in the radiation-dominated era and follow them to redshift $z=99$ with N-body simulations. We find that the majority of the densest miniclusters end up in the center of larger minicluster halos at late times. Soon after their formation, the miniclusters exhibit NFW profiles but they subsequently develop a steeper inner slope approaching $\rho\sim r^{-2}$ on small scales. Using the so far most highly resolved axion structure formation simulation with $2048^3$ particles we examine the structure of previously studied minicluster halos. While the density profiles of their subhalos are NFW-like we confirm that a modified NFW profile with a steeper inner slope provides a better description for minicluster halos with masses above $\sim 10^{-12}\,M_\odot$. We show that miniclusters with a higher central density might be in contrast to pure NFW halos dense enough to induce gravitational microlensing. Likewise, more compact minicluster halos will have immediate implications for direct and indirect axion detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) describes how CMB photons pick up a net blue or redshift when traversing the time-varying gravitational potentials between the last scattering surface and us. Deviations from its standard amplitude could hint new physics. We show that reconstructing the amplitude of the ISW effect as a function of the redshift may provide a unique tool to probe the gravity sector during the era of dark ages, inaccessible via other cosmological observables. Exploiting Planck CMB temperature, polarization and lensing observations, we find a $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard ISW amplitude at redshift $z=500$. Barrying a systematic origin, our findings could point to either possibly new physics or a departure from the standard picture of structure formation under the General Relativity framework. Assuming the simplest two-redshift-bin scenario, we ensure $38\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ evidences of the early and late ISW effects, respectively, despite a priori possible degeneracy with the CMB lensing amplitude. Using a multiple tomographic method, we present the first complete characterization of the ISW effect over space and time. Future tomographic ISW analyses are therefore crucial to probe the dark ages at redshifts otherwise unreachable via other probes.
#### Origin of broad He II 4686Å emission in early spectra of type IIP  supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a model for the origin of the broad He II 4686A emission in the early spectrum of type II SN~2020jfo. The 4686A line is emitted presumably by dense fragments embedded into a hot gas of the forward shock wave. The fragments are produced as a result of a heavy braking of the dense low-mass shell at the ejecta boundary and a simultaneous Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The temperature of line-emitting fragments is $\approx$5$\times10^4$K. Calculations of ionization and excitation of helium and hydrogen account for the He II 4686A luminosity, the large flux ratio of He II 4686A/H$\alpha$, and a significant optical depth of the 4686A line. We demonstrate that fragments heating by hot electrons behind the forward shock compensates cooling via the HeII 304A emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we extended an energy-integrated neutrino transport method to facilitate efficient, yet precise, modeling of compact astrophysical objects. We focus particularly on core-collapse supernovae. We implemented the framework of Foucart et al. (2016) into FLASH and performed a detailed evaluation of its accuracy in core-collapse supernova simulations. Based on comparisons with results from simulations using energy-dependent neutrino transport, we incorporated several improvements to the original scheme. Our analysis shows that our grey neutrino transport method successfully reproduces key aspects from more complex energy-dependent transport across a variety of progenitors and equations of state. We find both qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with multi-group M1 transport simulations. However, the grey scheme tends to slightly favor shock revival. In terms of gravitational wave and neutrino signals, there is a good alignment with the energy-dependent transport, although we find 15-30 percent discrepancies in the average energy and luminosity of heavy-lepton neutrinos. Simulations using the grey transport are around four times faster than those using energy-dependent transport.

 - **Abstract**
 We used an unbiased CMB lensing mass estimator on 468 SPT-SZ clusters from the SPT-SZ and the Planck public data, the first such estimation using combined ground- and space-based data. We measured the average ratio between CMB lensing and SZ mass to be $M_{\rm CMBlens}/M_{\rm SZ} = 0.98 \pm 0.19$ (stat.) $\pm 0.03$ (syst.). The average CMB lensing mass from the combination of the two data sets is measured at 4.8$\sigma$, which is a significant gain with respect to the measurement performed on the SPT-SZ only (3.9$\sigma$) or the Planck only (3.7$\sigma$) data set. We showed that the combination not only takes advantage of the two different ranges of spatial scales (i.e. Fourier modes) observed but also exploits the lensing induced correlation between scales observed by one experiment and the other. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring a large range of spatial scales for CMB lensing mass estimation, from arcmin to degrees. This large range of scales will most probably be provided by the combination of various data sets, such as from the large and small aperture telescopes of the upcoming Simons Observatory and future CMB-S4 experiment, and Planck. In this context, the Planck data will remain a key element for CMB lensing cluster studies in the years to come.

 We present the results of a preliminary study of a correction method applied to the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope images affected by clouds. The studied data are Monte Carlo simulations made with CORSIKA, imitating the very high energy events registered by the Large-Sized Telescopes, a type of telescope within the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. We implement the cloud correction method in the ctapipe/lstchain analysis framework. The correction is based on a simple geometrical model of the emission. We show the effect of the correction method on the image parameters and the stereo-reconstructed shower parameters.
#### Fast and spurious: a robust determination of our peculiar velocity with  future galaxy surveys

 - **Abstract**
 To date, the most precise measurement of the observer's peculiar velocity comes from the dipole in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This velocity also generates a dipole in the source number counts, whose amplitude is governed not only by the observer velocity, but also by specific properties of the sources, that are difficult to determine precisely. Quantitative studies of the source number counts currently give dipoles which are reasonably well aligned with the CMB dipole, but with a significantly larger amplitude than that of the CMB dipole. In this work, we explore an alternative way of measuring the observer velocity from the source number counts, using correlations between neighboring spherical harmonic coefficients, induced by the velocity. We show that these correlations contain both a term sensitive to the source properties and another one directly given by the observer velocity. We explore the potential of a Euclid-like survey to directly measure this second contribution, independently of the characteristics of the population of sources. We find that the method can reach a precision of 4%, corresponding to a detection significance of 24 sigma, on the observer velocity. This will settle with precision the present "dipole tension".

 Spectral line observations encode a wealth of information. A key challenge, therefore, lies in the interpretation of these observations in terms of models to derive the physical and chemical properties of the astronomical environments from which they arise. In this paper, we present pomme: an open-source Python package that allows users to retrieve 1D or 3D models of physical properties, such as chemical abundance, velocity, and temperature distributions of (optically thin) astrophysical media, based on spectral line observations. We discuss how prior knowledge, for instance, in the form of a steady-state hydrodynamics model, can be used to guide the retrieval process, and demonstrate our methods both on synthetic and real observations of cool stellar winds.
#### High angular momentum hot differentially rotating equilibrium star  evolutions in conformally flat spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 The conformal flatness approximation to the Einstein equations has been successfully used in many astrophysical applications such as initial data constructions and dynamical simulations. Although it has been shown that full general relativistic strongly differentially rotating equilibrium models deviate by at most a few percents from their conformally flat counterparts, whether those solutions share the same dynamical stabilities has not been fully addressed. To further understand the limitations of the conformal flatness approximation, in this work, we construct spatially-conformally-flat hot hypermassive neutron stars with postmerger-like rotation laws, and perform conformally flat evolutions and analysis over dynamical timescales. We found that the stellar profiles of quasi-toroidal models with high angular momentum for $J \gtrsim 9 \;G M_{\odot}^2 / c$ can change significantly over dynamical timescales. In contrast, all the quasi-spherical models considered in this work remain stable even with high angular momentum $J=9\;G M_{\odot}^2 / c$. Our investigation suggest that the quasi-spherical models are suitable initial data for long-lived hypermassive neutron star modelings in conformally flat spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we extend the dust-independent Hatzidimitriou (1991) relation between cluster age and $d_{B-R}$ color difference between red giant branch (RGB) and red clump (RC) to younger cluster ages. We perform membership analysis on twenty-two open clusters using $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 astrometry, then compute the difference in color of red giant branch and red clump $d_{B-R}$ using $\textit{Gaia}$ photometry. We find that the trend derived from older clusters does not extrapolate to younger ages and becomes double-valued. We confirm that $d_{B-R}$ is independent of metallicity. Current stellar evolutionary isochrones do not quantitatively reproduce the trend and furthermore predict an increased color gap with a decrease in metallicity that is not echoed in the data. Integrated light models based on current isochrones exaggerate the color change over the $-0.5 <$ [Fe/H] $< 0$ interval at the few-percent level.
#### Dark Scattering: accelerated constraints from KiDS-1000 with  $\tt{ReACT}$ and $\tt{CosmoPower}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the Dark Scattering model through cosmic shear measurements from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), using an accelerated pipeline with novel emulators produced with $\tt{CosmoPower}$. Our main emulator, for the Dark Scattering non-linear matter power spectrum, is trained on predictions from the halo model reaction framework, previously validated against simulations. Additionally, we include the effects of baryonic feedback from $\tt{HMcode2016}$, whose contribution is also emulated. We analyse the complete set of statistics of KiDS-1000, namely Band Powers, COSEBIs and Correlation Functions, for Dark Scattering in two distinct cases. In the first case, taking into account only KiDS cosmic shear data, we constrain the amplitude of the dark energy - dark matter interaction to be $\vert A_{\rm ds} \vert \lesssim 20$ $\rm b/GeV$ at 68\% C.L. Furthermore, we add information from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from Planck, along with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from 6dFGS, SDSS and BOSS, approximating a combined weak lensing + CMB + BAO analysis. From this combination, we constrain $A_{\rm ds} = 10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ $\rm b/GeV$ at 68\% C.L. We confirm that with this estimated value of $A_{\rm ds}$ the interacting model considered in this work offers a promising alternative to solve the $S_8$ tension.
#### Measuring Tracers of Planet Formation in the Atmosphere of WASP-77A b:  Sub-stellar O/H and C/H ratios, with a stellar C/O ratio and a potentially  Super-stellar Ti/H ratio

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive atmospheric retrieval study of the hot Jupiter WASP-77A\,b using eclipse observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST. Using atmospheric retrievals, the spectral features of H$_2$O, CO, and TiO are identified, with volume mixing ratios estimated at log$_{\rm 10}$(VMR) = -4.40$^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$, -4.44$^{+0.34}_{-0.28}$, and -6.40$^{+0.22}_{-0.23}$, respectively. We derive the atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio -- a key planetary formation tracer -- to be C/O = 0.54$\pm$0.12, which is consistent with both the stellar host value and previous studies of the planet's atmosphere, suggesting a relatively close-in formation. Computing other elemental ratios (i.e., C/H, O/H, and Ti/H), we conclude that the general enrichment of the atmosphere (i.e., metallicity) is sub-stellar, is depleted in C and O, but that Ti appears slightly super-stellar. A low C and O content could be obtained, in combination with a stellar C/O ratio, if the planet formed outside of the CO$_2$ snow line before migrating inwards. Meanwhile, a super-stellar Ti/H could be obtained by late contamination from refractory rich planetesimals. While broadly in agreement with previous works, we do find some differences and discuss these while also highlighting the need for homogeneous analyses when comparative exoplanetology is conducted.
