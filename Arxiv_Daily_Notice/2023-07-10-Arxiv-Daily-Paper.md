#### TuRMoiL of Survival: A Unified Survival Criterion for Cloud-Wind  Interactions
 - **Authors:** Matthew W. Abruzzo, Drummond B. Fielding, Greg L. Bryan

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud-wind interactions play an important role in long-lived multiphase flows in many astrophysical contexts. When this interaction is primarily mediated by hydrodynamics and radiative cooling, the survival of clouds can be phrased in terms of the comparison between a timescale that dictates the evolution of the cloud-wind interaction, (the dynamical time-scale $\tau_{\rm dyn}$) and the relevant cooling timescale $\tau_{\rm cool}$. Previously proposed survival criteria, which can disagree by large factors about the size of the smallest surviving clouds, differ in both their choice of $\tau_{\rm cool}$ and (to a lesser extent) $\tau_{\rm dyn}$. Here we present a new criterion which agrees with a previously proposed empirical formulae but is based on simple physical principles. The key insight is that clouds can grow if they are able to mix and cool gas from the hot wind faster than it advects by the cloud. Whereas prior criteria associate $\tau_{\rm dyn}$ with the cloud crushing timescale, our new criterion links it to the characteristic cloud-crossing timescale of a hot-phase fluid element, making it more physically consistent with shear-layer studies. We develop this insight into a predictive expression and validate it with hydrodynamic ENZO-E simulations of ${\sim}10^4\, {\rm K}$, pressure-confined clouds in hot supersonic winds, exploring, in particular, high wind/cloud density contrasts, where disagreements are most pronounced. Finally, we illustrate how discrepancies among previous criteria primarily emerged due to different choices of simulation conditions and cooling properties, and discuss how they can be reconciled.
#### Evolution and Final Fates of a Rotating 25 M$_{\odot}$ Pop III star

 - **Abstract**
 In this proceeding, we present the 1-dimensional stellar evolution of two rotating population III (Pop III) star models, each having a mass of 25 M$_{\odot}$ at the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS). The slowly rotating model has an initial angular rotational velocity of 10 per cent of the critical angular rotational velocity. In contrast, the rapidly rotating model has an initial angular rotational velocity of 70 per cent of the critical angular rotational velocity. As an effect of rotationally enhanced mixing, we find that the rapidly rotating model suffers an enormous mass loss due to the deposition of a significant amount of CNO elements toward the surface after the main-sequence phase. We also display the simulated light curves as these models explode into core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe).

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) play an important role in our understanding of supernovae and their feedback on the interstellar environment. SNR G352.7$-$0.1 is special for its thermal composite morphology and double-ring structure. We have performed spectroscopic mapping in $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=2$-1 lines toward G352.7$-$0.1 with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope. Broad $^{12}$CO lines are found in the northeastern ring at a local-standard-of-rest velocity range of $\sim-50$-$-30$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that the remnant is interacting with molecular clouds (MCs) at $\sim-51$ km s$^{-1}$. Thus, we adopt a distance of $\sim10.5$ kpc for this SNR. The momentum and kinetic energy of the shocked gas along the line of sight are estimated to be $\sim10^2{\rm M_{sun}}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim10^{46}$ erg, respectively. We also find an expanding structure around the remnant, which is possibly related to the wind-blown bubble of the progenitor star. From the Fermi-LAT data in an energy range of 0.1-500 GeV, we find no gamma-ray counterparts of G352.7$-$0.1.
#### Asteroseismic Modeling of 1,153 Kepler Red Giant Branch Stars: Improved  Stellar Parameters with Gravity-Mode Period Spacings and Luminosity  Constraints
 - **Authors:** Yingxiang Wang, Tanda Li, Shaolan Bi, Timothy R. Bedding, Yaguang Li

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03397
 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports estimated stellar parameters of 1,153 Kepler red giant branch stars determined with asteroseismic modeling. We use radial-mode oscillation frequencies, gravity-mode period spacings, Gaia luminosities, and spectroscopic data to characterize these stars. Compared with previous studies, we find that the two additional observed constraints, i.e., the gravity-mode period spacing and luminosity, significantly improve the precision of fundamental stellar parameters. The typical uncertainties are 2.9% for the mass, 11% for the age, 1.0% for the radius, 0.0039 dex for the surface gravity, and 0.5\% for the helium core mass, making this the best-characterized large sample of red-giant stars available to date. With better characterizations for these red giants, we recalibrate the seismic scaling relations and study the surface term on the red-giant branch. We confirm that the surface term depends on the surface gravity and effective temperature, but there is no significant correlation with metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the host of a rich system of globular clusters (GCs) that span a wide age range. The chemical composition of the SMC clusters is still poorly understood, despite their significance to chemical evolution studies. Here, we provide the first detailed chemical study of evolved giants in three distinct clusters, NGC 121 (10.5 Gyr), NGC 339 (6 Gyr), and NGC 419 (1.4 Gyr). Results are based on high-resolution spectra obtained with FLAMES at the Very Large Telescope. The chemical fingerprints of these clusters closely resemble those of SMC field stars, supporting the SMC's specific history of chemical enrichment relative to the Milky Way. The approximately solar-scaled [alpha/Fe] observed in all three clusters, independent of their [Fe/H], demonstrate the SMC's low star formation efficiency. Compared to their Milky Way counterparts, elements primarily produced by massive stars are severely underrepresented. Particularly, the young cluster NGC 419's extremely low [Zn/Fe] shows that hypernovae have contributed relatively little during the past two Gyr. The three GCs have high [Eu/Fe] values regardless of their age. This suggests that the production of the r-process elements in the SMC was extremely efficient up to 1.5 Gyr ago, with an enrichment timescale comparable to that from Type Ia supernovae. When the properties of the oldest SMC object NGC 121 are compared to those of in-situ Milky Way clusters and accreted clusters linked to the Gaia-Enceladus merger event, it is shown that the SMC had already attained the same metallicity as Gaia-Enceladus but with lower [Fe/H] ratios at the age of NGC 121. This suggests that the chemical enrichment histories of the early SMC and Gaia-Enceladus differed, and that the SMC probably had a lower mass in its early ages than Gaia-Enceladus.
#### Formation Channels for Population III Stars at Cosmic Dawn

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the co-evolution of a population of primordial star-forming minihalos at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we highlight the influence of individual Population III stars on the ability of nearby minihalos to form sufficient molecular hydrogen to undergo star formation of their own. In the absence of radiation, we find the minimum halo mass required to bring about collapse and star formation to be 10^5 Msun, which then increases to 10^6 Msun after two stars have formed. We find an inverse relationship between the mass of a halo and the time required for it to recover its molecular gas after being disrupted by radiation from a nearby star. We also take advantage of the extremely high resolution to investigate the effects of major and minor mergers on the gas content of star-forming minihalos. Contrary to previous claims of fallback of supernova ejecta, we find that minihalos evacuated after hosting Pop III stars primarily recover gas through mergers with undisturbed halos. We identify an intriguing type of major merger between recently evacuated halos and gas-rich ones, finding that these "dry" mergers accelerate star formation instead of suppressing it like their low redshift counterparts. We attribute this to the gas-poor nature of one of the merging halos resulting in no significant rise in temperature or turbulence and instead inducing a rapid increase in central density and hydrostatic pressure. This constitutes a novel formation pathway for Pop III stars and establishes major mergers as potentially the primary source of gas, thus redefining the role of major mergers at this epoch.
#### Exploring the chemodynamics of metal-poor stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-poor stars are key for studying the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Evidence of the early mergers that built up the Galaxy remains in the distributions of abundances, kinematics, and orbital parameters of its stars. Several substructures resulting from these mergers have been tentatively identified in the literature. We conduct a global analysis of the chemodynamic properties of metal-poor stars. Our aim is to identify signs of accreted and in situ stars in different regions of the parameter space and to investigate their differences and similarities. We selected a sample of about 6600 metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.8 from DR3 of the GALAH survey. We used unsupervised machine learning to separate stars in a parameter space made of two normalised orbital actions, plus [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], without additional a priori cuts on stellar properties. We divided the halo stars in four main groups. All groups exhibit a significant fraction of in situ contamination (ISC). Accreted stars of these groups have very similar chemical properties, except for those of the group of stars with very retrograde orbits. This points to at most two main sources of accreted stars in the current sample, the major one related to Gaia-Enceladus (GE) and the other possibly related to Thamnos and/or Sequoia. Stars of GE are r-process enriched at low metallicities, but a contribution of the s-process appears with increasing metallicity. A flat trend of [Eu/Mg] as a function of [Fe/H] suggests that only core collapse supernovae contributed to r-process elements in GE. To better characterise accreted stars in the low metallicity regime, high precision abundances and guidance from chemical evolution models are needed. It is possible that ISC in samples of accreted stars has been underestimated. This can have important consequences for attempts to estimate the properties of the original systems.
#### Looking for evidence of high-mass star formation at core scale in a  massive molecular clump

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive physical and chemical study of the fragmentation and star formation activity towards the massive clump AGAL G338.9188+0.5494 harbouring the extended green object EGO 338.92+0.55(b). The presence of an EGO embedded in a massive clump, suggests, at clump scale, that high-mass star formation is occurring. The main goal of this work is to find evidence of such high-mass star formation, but at core scale. Using mm observations of continuum and lines obtained from the ALMA database at Bands 6 and 7, we study the substructure of the massive clump. The angular resolution of the data is about 0.5'', which allow us to resolve structures of about 0.01pc ($\sim$ 2000 au) at the distance of 4.4 kpc. The continuum emission at 340 GHz reveals that the molecular clump is fragmented in five cores, labeled from C1 to C5. The $^{12}$CO J=3--2 emission shows the presence of molecular outflows related to three of them. The analysis of the CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$CCH emissions suggests temperatures of about 340 and 72~K, respectively, for C1, showing that the methyl cyanide would trace a gas layer closer to the protostar than the methyl acetylene. The obtained mass of core C1 ranges from 3 to 10 M$_{\odot}$. We found that the discovered molecular outflow arising from core C1 should be the main responsible for the 4.5 $\mu$m extended emission. The average mass and energy of such a molecular outflow is about 0.5 M$_{\odot}$~and $10^{46}$~erg, respectively, which suggest that 10 M$_{\odot}$ is the most likely mass value for core C1. Additionally we found that the region is chemically very rich with several complex molecular species. Particularly, from the analysis of the CN emission we found strong evidence that such a radical is indirectly tracing the molecular outflows, more precisely the border of the cavity walls carved out by such outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 {The variability study of 6.7\,GHz methanol masers has become a useful way to improve our understanding of the physical conditions in high-mass star-forming regions.} {Based on the single-dish monitoring using the Irbene telescopes, we selected three sources with close sky positions.} {We imaged them using the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer Network and searched available data on VLBI archives to follow detailed changes in their structures and single maser spot variability.} {All three targets show a few groups of maser cloudlets of a typical size of 3.5\,mas and the majority of them show linear or arched structures with velocity gradients of order 0.22\kms\,mas$^{-1}$. The cloudlets and overall source morphologies are remarkably stable on time scales of 7-15\,yr supporting a scenario of variability due to changes in the maser pumping rate.}
#### A Local Model for the Spherical Collapse/Expansion Problem

 - **Abstract**
 Spherical flows are a classic problem in astrophysics which are typically studied from a global perspective. However, much like with accretion discs, there are likely many instabilities and small scale phenomena which would be easier to study from a local perspective. For this purpose, we develop a local model for a spherically contracting/expanding gas cloud, in the spirit of the shearing box, $\beta$-plane and expanding box models which have had extensive use in studies of accretion discs, planets and stellar winds respectively. The local model consists of a, spatially homogeneous, periodic box with a time varying aspect ratio, along with a scale factor (analogous to that in FRW/Newtonian cosmology) relating the box coordinates to the physical coordinates of the global problem. We derive a number of symmetries and conservation laws exhibited by the local model. Some of these reflect symmetries of the periodic box, modified by the time dependant geometry, while others are local analogues for symmetries of the global problem. The energy, density and vorticity in the box also generically increase(/decrease) as a consequence of the collapse(/expansion). We derive a number of nonlinear solutions, including a local analogue of uniform density zonal flows, which grow as a consequence of angular momentum conservation. Our model is closely related to the accelerated expanding box model of Tenerani \& Velli and is an extension of the isotropic model considered by Robertson \& Goldreich.
