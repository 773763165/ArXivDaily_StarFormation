 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected ubiquitously in protostellar systems. However, at shorter wavelengths (~0.8mm) it is more difficult to detect larger molecules than at longer wavelengths (~3mm) because of the increase of millimeter dust opacity, line confusion, and unfavorable partition function. We aim to search for large molecules (>8 atoms) in the ALMA Band 3 spectrum of IRAS 16293-2422 B. We search for more than 70 molecules and identify as many lines as possible in the spectrum. The spectral settings were set to specifically target three-carbon species such as propanol and glycerol. We identify lines of 31 molecules including many oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH3OH and c-C2H4O and a few nitrogen- and sulfur-bearing ones such as HOCH2CN and CH3SH. The largest detected molecules are gGg-(CH2OH)2 and CH3COCH3. We do not detect glycerol or propanol but provide upper limits for them which are in line with previous laboratory and observational studies. The line density in Band 3 is only ~2.5 times lower in frequency space than in Band 7. From the detected lines in Band 3 at a $\gtrsim 6\sigma$ level, ~25-30% of them could not be identified indicating the need for more laboratory data of rotational spectra. We find similar column densities and column density ratios of COMs (within a factor ~2) between Band 3 and Band 7. The effect of dust optical depth for IRAS 16293-2422 B at an off-source location on column densities and column density ratios is minimal. Moreover, for warm protostars, long wavelength spectra are not only crowded, but also take longer integration times to reach the same sensitivity limit. The 3mm search has not yet resulted in detection of larger and more complex molecules in warm sources. A full deep ALMA Band 2-3 (i.e., 3-4 mm) survey is needed to assess whether low frequency data have the potential to reveal more complex molecules in warm sources.
#### Revisiting the Helium and Hydrogen Accretion Indicators at TWA 27B: Weak  Mass Flow at Near-Freefall Velocity

 - **Abstract**
 TWA 27B (2M1207b) is the first directly-imaged planetary-mass (MP ~ 5 MJ) companion (Chauvin et al. 2004) and was observed at 0.9--5.3 micron with JWST/NIRSpec (Luhman et al. 2023). To understand the accretion properties of TWA 27B, we search for continuum-subtracted near-infrared helium and hydrogen emission lines and measure their widths and luminosities. We detect the He I triplet at 4.3 sigma and all Paschen-series lines covered by NIRSpec (Pa alpha, Pa beta, Pa gamma, Pa delta) at 4--5 sigma. The three brightest Brackett-series lines (Br alpha, Br beta, Br gamma) as well as Pf gamma and Pf delta are tentative detections at 2--3 sigma. We provide upper limits on the other hydrogen lines, including on H alpha through Hubble Space Telescope archival data. Three lines can be reliably deconvolved to reveal an intrinsic width Delta v = 67+-9 km/s, which is 60% of the surface freefall velocity. The line luminosities seem significantly too high to be due to chromospheric activity. Converting line luminosities to an accretion rate yields Mdot ~ 5e-9 MJ/yr when using scalings relationships for planetary masses, and Mdot ~ 0.1e-9 MJ/yr with extrapolated stellar scalings. Several of these lines represent first detections at an accretor of such low mass. The weak accretion rate implies that formation is likely over. This analysis shows that JWST can be used to measure low line-emitting mass accretion rates onto planetary-mass objects, motivates deeper searches for the mass reservoir feeding TWA 27B, and hints that other young directly-imaged objects might -- hitherto unbeknownst -- also be accreting.

 - **Abstract**
 Young terrestrial worlds are critical test beds to constrain prevailing theories of planetary formation and evolution. We present the discovery of HD 63433d - a nearby (22pc), Earth-sized planet transiting a young sunlike star (TOI-1726, HD 63433). HD 63433d is the third planet detected in this multiplanet system. The kinematic, rotational, and abundance properties of the host star indicate that it belongs to the young (414 $\pm$ 23 Myr) Ursa Major moving group, whose membership we update using new data from Gaia DR3 and TESS. Our transit analysis of the TESS light curves indicates that HD 63433 d has a radius of 1.1 $R_\oplus$ and closely orbits its host star with a period of 4.2 days. To date, HD 63433 d is the smallest confirmed exoplanet with an age less than 500 Myr, and the nearest young Earth-sized planet. Furthermore, the apparent brightness of the stellar host (V $\approx$ 6.9 mag) makes this transiting multiplanet system favorable to further investigations, including spectroscopic follow-up to probe atmospheric loss in a young Earth-sized world.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a data reduction pipeline written in Python for data obtained with the near-infrared cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph, WINERED, which yields a 0.91$-$1.35 $\mu$m spectrum with the resolving power of $R_{\text{max}} \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda = 28,000$ or 70,000 depending on the observing mode. The pipeline was developed to efficiently extract the spectrum from the raw data with high quality. It comprises two modes: the calibration and the science mode. The calibration mode automatically produces the flat-fielding image, bad pixel map, echellogram distortion map and the dispersion solution from the set of the calibration data. Using calibration images and parameters, the science data of astronomical objects can be reduced automatically using the science mode. The science mode is also used for the real-time quick look at the data during observations. An example of the spectra reduced with WARP is presented. The effect of the highly inclined slit image on the spectral resolution is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The age and mass of red giants are essential for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Traditional isochrone methods for these estimations are inherently limited due to overlapping isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, while asteroseismology, though more precise, requires high-precision, long-term observations. In response to these challenges, we developed a novel framework, Spectral Transformer (SPT), to predict the age and mass of red giants aligned with asteroseismology from their spectra. A key component of SPT, the Multi-head Hadamard Self-Attention mechanism, designed specifically for spectra, can capture complex relationships across different wavelength. Further, we introduced a Mahalanobis distance-based loss function to address scale imbalance and interaction mode loss, and incorporated Monte Carlo dropout for quantitative analysis of prediction uncertainty.Trained and tested on 3,880 red giant spectra from LAMOST, the SPT achieved remarkable age and mass estimations with average percentage errors of 17.64% and 6.61%, respectively, and provided uncertainties for each corresponding prediction. The results significantly outperform those of traditional machine learning algorithms and demonstrate a high level of consistency with asteroseismology methods and isochrone fitting techniques. In the future, our work will leverage datasets from the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to enhance the precision of the model and broaden its applicability in the field of astronomy and astrophysics.
#### Classification and characterization using HCT/HFOSC spectra of carbon  stars selected from the HES survey

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the analysis of 88 carbon stars selected from Hamburg/ESO (HES) survey using low-resolution spectra (R$\sim$1330 \& 2190). The spectra were obtained with the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) attached to the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Using a well-defined spectral criteria based on the strength of carbon molecular bands, the stars are classified into different groups. In our sample, we have identified 53 CH stars, four C-R stars, and two C-N type stars. Twenty-nine stars could not be classified due to the absence of prominent C$_{2}$ molecular bands in their spectra. We could derive the atmospheric parameters for 36 stars. The surface temperature is determined using photometric calibrations and synthesis of the H-alpha line profile. The surface gravity log g estimates are obtained using parallax estimates from the Gaia DR3 database whenever possible. Microturbulent velocity ($\zeta$) is derived using calibration equation of log g \& ${\zeta}$. We could determine metallicity for 48 objects from near-infrared Ca II triplet features using calibration equations. The derived metallicity ranges from $-$0.43$\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$$-$3.49. Nineteen objects are found to be metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\leq$$-$1), 14 very metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq$$-$2), and five extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq$$-$3.0) stars. Eleven objects are found to have a metallicity in the range $-$0.43 $\leq$[Fe/H]$\leq$$-$0.97. We could derive the carbon abundance for 25 objects using the spectrum synthesis calculation of the C$_{2}$ band around 5165\AA. The most metal-poor objects found will make important targets for follow-up detailed chemical composition studies based on high-resolution spectroscopy, that are likely to provide insight into the Galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite galaxy Crater II of the Milky Way is extremely cold and exceptionally diffuse. These unusual properties are challenging to understand in the standard model of cold dark matter. We investigate the formation of Crater II in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), where dark matter particles can scatter and thermalize. We conduct a series of controlled N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of Crater II, varying the self-interacting cross section, orbit parameters, and initial stellar distribution. Dark matter self-interactions lead to halo core formation and the distribution of stars expands accordingly. A cored SIDM halo also boosts tidal mass loss, allowing for a high orbit. Our simulations show that SIDM halos with a $1~{\rm kpc}$ core can simultaneously explain the low stellar velocity dispersion and the large half-light radius of Crater II, remaining robust to the initial distribution of stars. For the orbit motivated by the measurements from Gaia Early Data Release 3, the favored self-interacting cross section is approximately $60~{\rm cm^2/g}$ on the mass scale of Crater II.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants interacting with molecular/atomic clouds are interesting X-ray sources to study broadband nonthermal emission. X-ray line emission in these systems can be produced by different processes, e.g. low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud and fast ejecta fragments moving in the cloud. The paper aims at studying the origin of the non-thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006 beyond the main shock, in order to distinguish if the emission is due to low energy cosmic rays diffusing in the cloud or to ejecta knots moving into the cloud. We analyzed the X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, where the remnant interacts with an atomic cloud, with three different X-ray telescopes ({NuSTAR, Chandra and XMM-Newton) and performed a combined spectro-imaging analysis of this region. The analysis of the non thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, interacting with an atomic cloud, has shown the detection of an extended X-ray source in the atomic cloud, approximately $2$ pc upstream of the shock front. The source is characterized by a hard continuum (described by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\sim1.4$) and by Ne, Si and Fe emission lines. The observed flux suggests that the origin of the X-ray emission is not associated with low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud. On the other hand, the spectral properties of the source, together with the detection of an IR counterpart visible with \textit{Spitzer}-MIPS at 24 $\mu$m are in good agreement with expectations for a fast ejecta fragment moving within the atomic cloud. We detected X-ray and IR emission from a possible ejecta fragment, with radius approximately 1$\times10^{17}$ cm, and mass approximately $10^{-3}M_\odot$ at about 2 pc out of the shell of SN 1006, in the interaction region between the southwestern limb of the remnant and the atomic cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution of Galactic stars with different chemical abundances encodes information on the processes that drove the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Survey selection functions are indispensable for analysing astronomical catalogues produced by large-scale surveys. The use of these selection functions in data modelling is more complex when data from different surveys are to be modelled simultaneously. We introduce a procedure for constructing the selection function of a sample of red clump stars that have parallaxes and elemental abundances from the Gaia mission. We separately constructed the selection function of the APOGEE DR17 red clump stars, which depends on very different observables and has a very different spatial coverage. We combined the two surveys and accounted for their joint selection function to provide strong constraints on the radial and vertical density distribution of mono-abundance populations, with Gaia offering a dense coverage of the solar neighbourhood, while APOGEE reaches larger distances near the Galactic plane. We confirm that the radial density profile steepens with increasing metallicity. The combined sample also indicates a metallicity-dependent flaring of the alpha-poor disc. We provide the code for constructing the Gaia selection function we used in this study through the GaiaUnlimited Python package.
#### Can the giant planets of the Solar System form via pebble accretion in a  smooth protoplanetary disc?

 - **Abstract**
 Prevailing $N$-body planet formation models typically start with lunar-mass embryos and show a general trend of rapid migration of massive planetary cores to the inner Solar System in the absence of a migration trap. This setup cannot capture the evolution from a planetesimal to embryo, which is crucial to the final architecture of the system. We aim to model planet formation with planet migration starting with planetesimals of $\sim10^{-6}$ -- $10^{-4}M_\oplus$ and reproduce the giant planets of the Solar System. We simulated a population of 1,000 -- 5,000 planetesimals in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which was evolved under the effects of their mutual gravity, pebble accretion, gas accretion, and planet migration, employing the parallelized $N$-body code SyMBAp. We find that the dynamical interactions among growing planetesimals are vigorous and can halt pebble accretion for excited bodies. While a set of results without planet migration produces one to two gas giants and one to two ice giants beyond 6 au, massive planetary cores readily move to the inner Solar System once planet migration is in effect. Dynamical heating is important in a planetesimal disc and the reduced pebble encounter time should be considered in similar models. Planet migration remains a challenge to form cold giant planets in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which suggests an alternative mechanism is required to stop them at wide orbits.
#### Formation of flattened planetesimals by gravitational collapse of  rotating pebble clouds

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05101
 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals are believed to form by the gravitational collapse of aerodynamically concentrated clumps of pebbles. Many properties of the objects in the cold classical Kuiper belt -- such as binarity, rotation, and size distribution -- are in agreement with this gravitational collapse model. Further support comes from the pebble-pile structure inferred for comet nuclei. For this study, we simulated the final assembly of a planetesimal from the gravitational collapse of a rotating clump of pebbles. We implemented a numerical method from granular dynamics to follow the collapse that includes the transition from a pebble swarm to solid cells at a high density. We compared the shapes of the simulated planetesimals with the shapes of the lobes of contact binaries and bilobed Solar System objects. We find that the gravitational collapse of slowly rotating pebble clouds naturally explains the formation of flattened ellipsoidal bodies. This result agrees well with the flattened structure of the bilobed planetesimal Arrokoth and the shapes of the components of bilobed comets.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study by Hon et al. reported that a close-in planet around the red clump star, 8 UMi, should have been engulfed during the expansion phase of the stellar evolution. They explained the survival of this exoplanet through a binary merger channel for 8 UMi. The key to testing this formation scenario is to derive the true age of this star: an old "imposter" resulting from a binary merger or a genuinely young red clump giant? To accomplish this, we derive kinematic and chemical properties for 8 UMi using astrometric data from $Gaia$ DR3 and the element-abundance pattern measured from a high-resolution ($R \sim 75,000$) spectrum taken by SOPHIE. Our analysis shows that 8 UMi is a normal thin-disk star with orbital rotation speed of $\it{V}_\mathrm{\phi}=\mathrm{244.96 km s^{-1}}$, and possesses a Solar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= -0.01 \pm 0.07$) and $\alpha$-element abundance ratio ([$\alpha$/Fe] $= 0.00 \pm 0.03$). By adopting well-established relationships between age and space velocities/elemental abundances, we estimate a kinematic age of $3.50^{+3.00}_{-2.00}$ Gyr, and a chemical age of $2.75^{+1.50}_{-1.00}$ Gyr from [C/N] and $3.47 \pm 1.96$ Gyr from [Y/Mg] for 8 UMi, respectively. These estimates are consistent with the isochrone-fitting age ($1.85^{+0.55}_{-0.30}$ Gyr) of 8 UMi, but are all much younger than 8.6 Gyr required in a binary merger scenario. This result challenges the binary merger model; the existence of such a closely orbiting exoplanet around a giant star remains a mystery yet to be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Similarity solutions to the nonlinear non-equilibrium Marshak wave problem with a time dependent radiation driving source are presented. The radiation transfer model used is the gray, non-equilibrium diffusion approximation in the supersonic regime. These solutions constitute an extension of existing non-equilibrium supersonic Marshak wave solutions which are linear, to the nonlinear regime, which prevails in realistic high energy density systems. The generalized solutions assume a material model with power law temperature dependent opacities and a material energy density which is proportional to the radiation energy density, as well as a surface radiation temperature drive which obeys a temporal power-law. The solutions are analyzed in detail and it is shown that they take various qualitatively different forms according to the values of the opacity exponents. The solutions are used to construct a set of standardized benchmarks for supersonic non-equilibrium radiative heat transfer, which are nontrivial but straightforward to implement. These solutions are compared in detail to implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations as well gray diffusion simulations, showing a good agreement, which demonstrates the usefulness of these solutions as a code verification test problem.

 - **Abstract**
 A search for pulsed radiation at a frequency of 111 MHz in the direction of 116 RRAT candidates was carried out. For the search, archival data obtained on a meridian 128-beam radio telescope, a Large Phased Array (LPA), was used. For each candidate, about six days of observations were accumulated over an interval of eight years. Eleven new RRATs have been discovered. It was possible to estimate periods for six of them, and to construct average profiles for four of them. Some of the candidates turned out to be known pulsars observed in the side lobes of the radio telescope and interference. For the part of the candidates could not find pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio of more than seven, and their nature remains unknown.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars condition the evolution of the interstellar medium by the amount of energy released during their lives and especially by their deaths as supernova explosions. The vast amounts of spectroscopic data for massive stars provided by previous and existing instruments on ground-based and space-based telescopes have already saturated our capability to process them by the use of human routines. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for machine-assisted tools to help handle incoming data. To this end, we present the development of a massive star spectroscopic multiwavelength interactive database designed for scientific research and a fully automatic stellar parameter determination tool. Here we show the preliminary results of the application of these tools to optical spectra of O-type stars.
#### JWST-TST High Contrast: Asymmetries, dust populations and hints of a  collision in the $β$ Pictoris disk with NIRCam and MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first JWST MIRI and NIRCam observations of the prominent debris disk around Beta Pictoris. Coronagraphic observations in 8 filters spanning from 1.8 to 23~$\mu$m provide an unprecedentedly clear view of the disk at these wavelengths. The objectives of the observing program were to investigate the dust composition and distribution, and to investigate the presence of planets in the system. In this paper, we focus on the disk components, providing surface brightness measurements for all images and a detailed investigation of the asymmetries observed. A companion paper by Kammerer et al. will focus on the planets in this system using the same data. We report for the first time the presence of an extended secondary disk in thermal emission, with a curved extension bent away from the plane of the disk. This feature, which we refer to as the ``cat's tail", seems to be connected with the previously reported CO clump, mid-infrared asymmetry detected in the southwest side, and the warp observed in scattered light. We present a model of this secondary disk sporadically producing dust that broadly reproduces the morphology, flux, and color of the cat's tail, as well as other features observed in the disk, and suggests the secondary disk is composed largely of porous, organic refractory dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 Radial profiles play a crucial role in the analysis and interpretation of astronomical data, facilitating the extraction of spatial information. However, highly customizable (for different scenarios) measurements over each elliptical annulus can be challenging. In response, we present 'astscript-radial-profile', which is part of Gnuastro from version 0.15 and has an extensive documentation. A convenient feature of this program is its capability to make the measurements with different operators (mean, median, sigma-clipping, and many more) over ellipses, very quickly and directly on the command-line with minimal dependencies. This research note is reproducible with Maneage, on the Git commit 104aad5.
