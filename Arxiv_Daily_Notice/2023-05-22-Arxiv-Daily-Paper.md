 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning techniques have been previously used to model and predict column densities in the TMC-1 dark molecular cloud. In interstellar sources further along the path of star formation, such as those where a protostar itself has been formed, the chemistry is known to be drastically different from that of largely quiescent dark clouds. To that end, we have tested the ability of various machine learning models to fit the column densities of the molecules detected in source B of the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422. By including a simple encoding of isotopic composition in our molecular feature vectors, we also examine for the first time how well these models can replicate the isotopic ratios. Finally, we report the predicted column densities of the chemically relevant molecules that may be excellent targets for radioastronomical detection in IRAS 16293-2422B.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in axial symmetry (2D) with feedback from fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC). Our schematic treatment of FFCs assumes instantaneous flavor equilibration under the constraint of lepton-number conservation. Systematically varying the spatial domain where FFCs are assumed to occur, we find that they facilitate SN explosions in low-mass (9-12 solar masses) progenitors that otherwise explode with longer time delays, whereas FFCs weaken the tendency to explode of higher-mass (around 20 solar masses) progenitors.
#### Fitting Probability Distribution Functions in Turbulent Star-Forming  Molecular Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and without stellar feedback and magnetic fields, to investigate the effectiveness of different fitting methods for volume and column density probability distribution functions (PDFs). The first method fits a piecewise lognormal and power-law (PL) function to recover PDF parameters such as the PL slope and transition density. The second method fits a polynomial spline function and examines the first and second derivatives of the spline to determine the PL slope and the functional transition density. We demonstrate that fitting a spline allows us to directly determine if the data has multiple PL slopes. The first PL (set by the transition between lognormal and PL function) can also be visualized in the derivatives directly. In general, the two methods produce fits that agree reasonably well for volume density but vary for column density, likely due to the increased statistical noise in column density maps as compared to volume density. We test a well-known conversion for estimating volume density PL slopes from column density slopes and find that the spline method produces a better match (\c{hi}2 of 2.38 vs \c{hi}2 of 5.92), albeit with a significant scatter. Ultimately, we recommend the use of both fitting methods on column density data to mitigate the effects of noise.
#### Planetesimal formation via the streaming instability with multiple grain  sizes

 - **Abstract**
 Kilometre-sized planetesimals form from pebbles of a range of sizes. We present the first simulations of the streaming instability that begin with a realistic, peaked size distribution, as expected from grain growth predictions. Our 3D numerical simulations directly form planetesimals via the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. Models with multiple grain sizes show spatially distinct dust populations. The smallest grains in the size distribution do not participate in the formation of filaments or the planetesimals that are formed by the remaining ~80% of the dust mass. This implies a size cutoff for pebbles incorporated into asteroids and comets. Observations cannot resolve this dust clumping. However, we show that clumping, combined with optical depth effects, can cause significant underestimates of the dust mass, with 20%-80% more dust being present even at moderate optical depths if the streaming instability is active.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of polarized dust emission at 850 $\mu$m from the L43 molecular cloud which sits in the Ophiuchus cloud complex. The data were taken using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as a part of the BISTRO large program. L43 is a dense ($N_{\rm H_2}\sim 10^{22}$-10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) complex molecular cloud with a submillimetre-bright starless core and two protostellar sources. There appears to be an evolutionary gradient along the isolated filament that L43 is embedded within, with the most evolved source closest to the Sco OB2 association. One of the protostars drives a CO outflow that has created a cavity to the southeast. We see a magnetic field that appears to be aligned with the cavity walls of the outflow, suggesting interaction with the outflow. We also find a magnetic field strength of up to $\sim$160$\pm$30 $\mu$G in the main starless core and up to $\sim$90$\pm$40 $\mu$G in the more diffuse, extended region. These field strengths give magnetically super- and sub-critical values respectively and both are found to be roughly trans-Alfv\'enic. We also present a new method of data reduction for these denser but fainter objects like starless cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Fits the infrared spectra from the nuclear regions of AGN can place constraints on the dust properties, distribution, and geometry by comparison with models. However, none of the currently available models fully describe the observations of AGN currently available. Among the aspects least explored, here we focus on the role of dust grain size. We offer the community a new spectral energy distribution (SED) library, hereinafter [GoMar23] model, which is based on the two-phase torus model developed before with the inclusion of the grain size as a model parameter, parameterized by the maximum grain size Psize or equivalently the mass-weighted average grain size < P >. We created 691,200 SEDs using the SKIRT code, where the maximum grain size can vary within the range Psize = 0.01 - 10.0um ( < P >= 0.007 - 3.41um). We fit this new and several existing libraries to a sample of 68 nearby and luminous AGNs with Spitzer/IRS spectra dominated by AGN-heated dust. We find that the [GoMar23] model can adequately reproduce up to 85-88% of the spectra. The dust grain size parameter significantly improves the final fit in up to 90% of these spectra. Statistical tests indicate that the grain size is the third most important parameter in the fitting procedure (after the size and half opening angle of the torus). The requirement of a foreground extinction by our model is lower compared to purely clumpy models. We find that 41% of our sample requires that the maximum dust grain size is as large as Psize =10um (< P >= 3.41um). Nonetheless, we also remark that disk+wind and clumpy torus models are still required to reproduce the spectra of a non-negligible fraction of objects, suggesting the need for several dust geometries to explain the infrared continuum of AGN. This work provides tentative evidence for dust grain growth in the proximity of the AGN.
#### Filling in the Gaps: Can Gravitationally Unstable Discs Form the Seeds  of Gas Giant Planets?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11336
 - **Abstract**
 Circumstellar discs likely have a short window when they are self-gravitating and prone to the effects of disc instability, but during this time the seeds of planet formation can be sown. It has long been argued that disc fragmentation can form large gas giant planets at wide orbital separations, but its place in the planet formation paradigm is hindered by a tendency to form especially large gas giants or brown dwarfs. We instead suggest that planet formation can occur early in massive discs, through the gravitational collapse of dust which can form the seeds of giant planets. This is different from the usual picture of self-gravitating discs, in which planet formation is considered through the gravitational collapse of the gas disc into a gas giant precursor. It is familiar in the sense that the core is formed first, and gas is accreted thereafter, as is the case in the core accretion scenario. However, by forming a $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ seed from the gravitational collapse of dust within a self-gravitating disc there exists the potential to overcome traditional growth barriers and form a planet within a few times $10^5$ years. The accretion of pebbles is most efficient with centimetre-sized dust, but the accretion of millimetre sizes can also result in formation within a Myr. Thus, if dust can grow to these sizes, planetary seeds formed within very young, massive discs could drastically reduce the timescale of planet formation and potentially explain the observed ring and gap structures in young discs.
#### The origin of low-redshift event rate excess as revealed by the  low-luminosity GRBs

 - **Abstract**
 The relation between the event rate of long Gamma-Ray Bursts at low redshift and the star formation rate is still controversial, especially in the low-redshift end. Dong et al. confirmed that the Gamma-Ray Burst rate always exceeds the star formation rate at low-redshift of z < 1 in despite of the sample completeness. However, the reason of low-redshift excess is still unclear. Considering low-luminosity bursts with smaller redshift generally, we choose three Swift long burst samples and classify them into low- and high-luminosity bursts in order to check whether the low-redshift excess is existent and if the excess is biased by the sample size and completeness. To degenerate the redshift evolution from luminosity, we adopt the non-parametric method to study the event rate of the two types of long bursts in each sample. It is found that the high-luminosity burst rates are consistent with the star formation rate within the whole redshift range while the event rates of low-luminosity bursts exceed the star formation rate at low redshift of z < 1. Consequently, we conclude that the low-redshift excess is contributed by the low-luminosity bursts with possibly new origins unconnected with the star formation, which is also independent of the sample size and the sample completeness.

 - **Abstract**
 Tsinghua university-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS) aims to discover rapidly evolving transients by monitoring the northern sky. The TMTS catalog is cross-matched with the white dwarf (WD) catalog of Gaia EDR3, and light curves of more than a thousand WD candidates are obtained so far. Among them, the WD TMTS J23450729+5813146 (hereafter J2345) is one interesting common source. Based on the light curves from the TMTS and follow-up photometric observations, periods of 967.113 s, 973.734 s, 881.525 s, 843.458 s, 806.916 s and 678.273 s are identified. In addition, the TESS observations suggest a 3.39 h period but this can be attributed to the rotation of a comoving M dwarf located within 3". The spectroscopic observation indicates that this WD is DA type with Teff = 11778+/-617K,log g = 8.38+/-0.31,mass=0.84+/-0.20Msun and age=0.704+/-0.377 Gyrs. Asteroseismological analysis reveals a global best-fit solution of Teff =12110+/-10K and mass=0.760+/-0.005Msun,consistent with the spectral fitting results, and Oxygen and Carbon abundances in the core center are 0.73 and 0.27, respectively. The distance derived from the intrinsic luminosity given by asteroseismology is 93 parsec, which is in agreement with the distance of 98 parsec from Gaia DR3. Additionally, kinematic study shows that this WD is likely a thick disk star. The mass of its zero-age main-sequence mass is estimated to be 3.08 Msun and has a main-sequence plus cooling age of roughly 900 Myrs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The study of high-mass stars found to be isolated in the field of the Milky Way may help to probe the feasibility of the core-accretion mechanism in the case of massive star formation. The existence of truly isolated stars may efficiently probe the possibility that individual massive stars can be born in isolation. Aims: We observed WR67a (hereafter Sapaki), an O3If* star that appears to be isolated close to the center of a well-developed giant cavity that is aptly traced by 8.0 $\mu$m hot dust emission. Methods: We acquired medium-resolution ($R=4100$) and moderate signal-to-noise ($S/N = 95$ at 4500 \r{A}) spectra for Sapaki in the range of 3800-10500 \r{A} with the Magellan Echellette (MagE) at Las Campanas Observatory. We computed the line-of-sight total extinctions. Additionally, we restricted its heliocentric distance by using a range of different estimators. Moreover, we measured its radial velocity from several lines in its spectrum. Finally, we analyzed its proper motions from Gaia to examine its possible runaway status. Results: The star has been classified as having the spectral type O3If* given its resemblance to standard examples of the class. In addition, we found that Sapaki is highly obscured, reaching a line-of-sight extinction value of $A_{V} = 7.87$. We estimated the heliocentric distance to be in the range of $d = 4-7$ kpc. We also estimated its radial velocity to be $V_{r} = -34.2 \pm 15.6$ km/s. We may also discard its runaway status solely based on its 2D kinematics. Furthermore, by analyzing proper motions and parallaxes provided by Gaia, we found only one other star with compatible measurements. Conclusions: Given its apparent non-runaway status and the absence of clustering, Sapaki appears to be a solid candidate for isolated high-mass star formation in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven analysis methods can help to infer physical properties of red giant stars where "gold-standard" asteroseismic data are not available. The study of optical and infrared spectra of red giant stars with data-driven analyses has revealed that differences in oscillation frequencies and their separations are imprinted in said spectra. This makes it possible to confidently differentiate core-helium burning red clump stars (RC) from those that are still on their first ascent of the red giant branch (RGB). We extend these studies to a tenfold larger wavelength range of 0.33 to 2.5 microns with the moderate-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectrograph. Our analysis of 49 stars with asteroseismic data from the K2 mission confirms that CN, CO and CH features are indeed the primary carriers of spectroscopic information on the evolutionary stages of red giant stars. We report 215 informative features for differentiating the RC from the RGB within the range of 0.33 to 2.5 microns. This makes it possible for existing and future spectroscopic surveys to optimize their wavelength regions to deliver both a large variety of elemental abundances and reliable age estimates of luminous red giant stars.
#### Rotation-tunneling spectrum and astrochemical modeling of dimethylamine,  CH$_3$NHCH$_3$, and searches for it in space

 - **Abstract**
 Methylamine has been the only simple alkylamine detected in the interstellar medium for a long time. With the recent secure and tentative detections of vinylamine and ethylamine, respectively, dimethylamine has become a promising target for searches in space. Its rotational spectrum, however, has been known only up to 45 GHz until now. Here we investigate the rotation-tunneling spectrum of dimethylamine in selected regions between 76 and 1091 GHz using three different spectrometers in order to facilitate its detection in space. The quantum number range is extended to $J = 61$ and $K_a = 21$, yielding an extensive set of accurate spectroscopic parameters. To search for dimethylamine, we refer to the spectral line survey ReMoCA carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array toward the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2(N) and a spectral line survey of the molecular cloud G+0.693$-$0.027 employing the IRAM 30 m and Yebes 40 m radio telescopes. We report nondetections of dimethylamine toward the hot molecular cores Sgr B2(N1S) and Sgr B2(N2b) as well as G+0.693$-$0.027 which imply that dimethylamine is at least 14, 4.5 and 39 times less abundant than methylamine toward these sources, respectively. The observational results are compared to computational results from a gas-grain astrochemical model. The modeled methylamine to dimethylamine ratios are compatible with the observational ratios. However, the model produces too much ethylamine compared with methylamine which could mean that the already fairly low levels of dimethylamine in the models may also be too high.
#### EUV fine structure and variability associated with coronal rain revealed  by Solar Orbiter/EUI HRIEUV and SPICE

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal rain is the most dramatic cooling phenomenon of the solar corona and an essential diagnostic tool for the coronal heating properties. A puzzling feature of the solar corona, besides the heating, is its EUV filamentary structure and variability. We aim to identify observable features of the TNE-TI scenario underlying coronal rain at small and large spatial scales, to understand the role it plays in the solar corona. We use EUV datasets at unprecedented spatial resolution of ~240 km from EUI/HRIEUV and SPICE of Solar Orbiter from the spring 2022 perihelion. EUV absorption features produced by coronal rain are detected at scales as small as 260 km. As the rain falls, heating and compression is produced immediately downstream, leading to a small EUV brightening accompanying the fall and producing a "fireball" phenomenon. Just prior to impact, a flash-like EUV brightening downstream of the rain, lasting a few minutes is observed for the fastest events. For the first time, we detect the atmospheric response to the rain's impact on the chromosphere and consists of upward propagating rebound shocks and flows partly reheating the loop. The observed widths of the rain clumps are 500 +- 200 km. They exhibit a broad velocity distribution of 10 - 150 km s^-1, peaking below 50 km s^-1. Coronal strands of similar widths are observed along the same loops co-spatial with cool filamentary structure, which we interpret as the CCTR. Matching with the expected cooling, prior to the rain appearance sequential loop brightenings are detected in gradually cooler lines from corona to chromospheric temperatures. Despite the large rain showers, most cannot be detected in AIA 171 in quadrature, indicating that LOS effects play a major role in coronal rain visibility. Still, AIA 304 and SPICE observations reveal that only a small fraction of the rain can be captured by HRIEUV.
#### Alpha-Meteoroids then and now: Unearthing an overlooked micrometeoroid  population

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11698
 - **Abstract**
 The term `$\alpha$-meteoroid' was introduced to describe a group of micrometeoroids with certain dynamical properties, which -- alongside the group of the $\beta$-meteoroids -- had been identified by the first generation of reliable in-situ dust detectors in interplanetary space. In recent years, use of the term $\alpha$-meteoroid has become more frequent again, under a subtly but crucially altered definition. This work shall bring attention to the discrepancy between the term's original and newly established meaning, and spotlight the now-overlooked group of particles that the term used to describe. We review past and present pertinent literature around the term $\alpha$-meteoroid, and assess the dynamics of the originally referred-to particles with respect to possible sources, showing that their formation is the expected consequence of collisional grinding of the zodiacal cloud at short heliocentric distances. The abundance of the original $\alpha$-meteoroids, which are essentially `bound $\beta$-meteoroids', makes them relevant to all in-situ dust experiments in the inner solar system. Due to the change of the term's meaning, however, they are not considered by contemporary studies. The characterization of this particle population could elucidate the processing of the innermost zodiacal cloud, and should thus be objective of upcoming in-situ dust experiments. The attained ambiguity of the term $\alpha$-meteoroid is not easily resolved, warranting great care and clarity going forward.
#### Constraints on star formation in Orion A from Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 We develop statistical methods within a Bayesian framework to infer the star formation history from photometric surveys of pre-main sequence populations. Our procedures include correcting for biases due to extinction in magnitude-limited surveys, and using distributions from subsets of stars with individual extinction measurements. We also make modest corrections for unresolved binaries. We apply our methods to samples of populations with Gaia photometry in the Orion A molecular cloud. Using two well-established sets of evolutionary tracks, we find that, although our sample is incomplete at youngest ages due to extinction, star formation has proceeded in Orion A at a relatively constant rate between ages of about 0.3 and 5 Myr, in contrast to other studies suggesting multiple epochs of star formation. Similar results are obtained for a set of tracks that attempt to take the effects of strong magnetic fields into account. We also find no evidence for a well-constrained "birthline" that would result from low-mass stars appearing first along the deuterium-burning main sequence, especially using the magnetic evolutionary tracks. While our methods have been developed to deal with Gaia data, they may be useful for analyzing other photometric surveys of star-forming regions.
