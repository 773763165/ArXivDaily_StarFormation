 - **Abstract**
 With the recent observational evidence in extra galactic astronomy, the interpretation of the nature of quasar redshift continues to be a research interest. Very high redshifts are being detected for extragalactic objects that are presumably very distant and young while also exhibiting properties that are characteristic of a more mature galaxy such as ours. According to Halton Arp and Geoffrey Burbidge, redshift disparities consist of an intrinsic component and are related to an evolutionary process. Karlsson observed redshift periodicity at integer multiples of 0.089 in log scale and Burbidge observed redshift periodicity at integer multiples of 0.061 in linear scale. Since Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based periodicity estimation is known to be superior for noisy data sets, especially when the data contains multiple harmonics and overtones, mainly irregular in nature, we have chosen it to be our primary tool for analysis of the quasar-galaxy pair redshift data. We have observed a fundamental periodicity of 0.051 with a confidence interval of 95% in linear scale with the site-available Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 (SDSS DR7) quasar-galaxy pair data set. We have independently generated quasar-galaxy pair data sets from both 2dF and SDSS and found fundamental periodicities of 0.077 and 0.089 in log scale with a confidence interval of 95%.

          Improving Radial Velocities by Marginalizing over Stars and Sky: Achieving 30 m/s RV Precision for APOGEE in the Plate Era

 - **Abstract**
 The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$. However, previous data reductions of APOGEE have not fully realized the potential radial velocity (RV) precision of the instrument. Here we present an RV catalog based on a new reduction of all 2.6 million visits of APOGEE DR17 and validate it against improved estimates for the theoretical RV performance. The core ideas of the new reduction are the simultaneous modeling of all components in the spectra, rather than a separate subtraction of point estimates for the sky, and a marginalization over stellar types, rather than a grid search for an optimum. We show that this catalog, when restricted to RVs measured with the same fiber, achieves noise-limited precision down to 30 m/s and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties. We also introduce a general method for calibrating fiber-to-fiber constant RV offsets and demonstrate its importance for high RV precision work in multi-fiber spectrographs. After calibration, we achieve 47 m/s RV precision on the combined catalog with RVs measured with different fibers. This degradation in precision relative to measurements with only a single fiber suggests that refining line spread function models should be a focus in SDSS-V to improve the fiber-unified RV catalog.

          Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas

 - **Abstract**
 Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma<v<\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v<\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.

          On the Progenitor of the Crab Pulsar

 - **Abstract**
 The Crab supernova is interesting because we know that it was not a binary at death, the outcome was a neutron star, and because of the supernova remnant's apparently low energy and mass. Using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry, we examine the stellar population local to the Crab in a cylinder with a projected radius of 100 pc and parallax range $0.427 < \varpi < 0.619$ mas set by the uncertainties in the Crab's parallax. We also individually model the most luminous stars local to the Crab. The two most luminous stars are blue, roughly main sequence stars with masses of $\sim11 M_{\odot}$. We estimate the stellar population's age distribution using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. The estimated age distribution of the 205 $M_{G} < 0$ stars modestly favor lower mass stars consistent with an AGB star or a lower mass binary merger as the progenitor, but we cannot rule out higher masses. This may be driven by contamination due to the $\sim700$ pc length of the cylinder in distance.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing with binary lensing is one of the channels for detecting exoplanets. Due to the degeneracy of the lens parameters for the binary microlensing, additional features such as parallax and finite-size effects need to identify the lens parameters. The frequency-shift effect as the relativistic analogy of the gravity assist for the photons, is an extra observation that provides additional constraint between the lens parameters . In this work, we extend the application of the frequency shift effect to binary microlensing and derive the frequency shift during the lensing and caustic crossing. The frequency shift for the binary lens is of the order of ${\Delta\nu}/{\nu}\sim 10^{-12}$. We also investigate the feasibility of detecting this effect by employing Cross-Correlation methods .

          Toward a Comprehensive Grid of Cepheid Models with MESA I. Uncertainties of the Evolutionary Tracks of Intermediate-Mass Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Helium-burning stars, in particular Cepheids, are especially difficult to model, as the choice of free parameters can greatly impact the shape of the blue loops - the part of the evolutionary track at which instability strip is crossed. Contemporary one-dimensional stellar evolution codes, like MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), come with a large number of free parameters that allow to model the physical processes in stellar interiors under many assumptions. The uncertainties that arise from this freedom are rarely discussed in the literature despite their impact on the evolution of the model. We calculate a grid of evolutionary models with MESA, varying several controls, like solar mixture of heavy elements, mixing length theory prescription, nuclear reaction rates, scheme to determine convective boundaries, atmosphere model, temporal and spatial resolution, and quantify their impact on age and location of the evolutionary track on the HR diagram from the main sequence till the end of core-helium burning. Our investigation was conducted for a full range of masses and metallicities expected for classical Cepheids. The uncertainties are significant, especially during core-helium burning, reaching or exceeding the observational uncertainties of log Teff and log L for detached eclipsing binary systems. For models below 9 solar masses, thin convective shells develop and evolve erratically, not allowing the models to converge. A careful inspection of Kippenhahn diagrams and convergence study is advised for a given mass and metallicity, to assess how severe this problem is and to what extent it may affect the evolution.

          Evolving Dark Energy or Supernovae Systematics?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have been interpreted as evidence for evolving dark energy. However, this interpretation is strongly dependent on which Type Ia supernova (SN) sample is combined with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The strength of the evidence for evolving dark energy ranges from ~3.9 sigma for the Dark Energy 5 year (DES5Y) SN sample to ~ 2.5 sigma for the Pantheon+ sample. Here I compare SN common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations finding evidence for an offset of ~0.04 mag. between low and high redshifts. Correcting for this offset brings the DES5Y sample into very good agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology. Given that most of the parameter range favoured by the uncorrected DES5Y sample is discrepant with many other cosmological datasets, I conclude that the evidence for evolving dark energy is most likely a result of systematics in the DES5Y sample.

          Jets from the Upper Scorpious Variable Young Star System 2MASS J16075796-2040087 Via KECK/HIRES Spectro-astrometry

 - **Abstract**
 2MASS J16075796-2040087 is a ~ 5 Myr young star in Upper Sco with evidence for accretion bursts on a timescale of about 15 days and, uncommonly for its age, outflows traced by multi-component forbidden emission lines (FELs). The accretion bursts may be triggered by a companion at ~ 4.6 au. We analyze HIRES spectra optimised for spectro-astrometry to better understand the origin of the several FEL velocity components and determine whether a MHD disk wind is present. The FEL high velocity component (HVC) traces an asymmetric, bipolar jet ~ 700 au long. The jet's position angle (PA) ~ 277 degrees is not perpendicular to the disk. The lower-velocity emission, classified previously as a disk wind low-velocity component (LVC), is found to have more in common with the HVC and overall it is not possible to identify a MHD disk wind component. The spectro-astrometric signal of the low velocity emission resembles those of jets and its density and ionisation fraction fall into the range of HVCs. We suggest a scenario where the accretion bursts due to the close companion power the jets past the age where such activity ends around most stars. The low-velocity emission here could come from a slow jet launched near the close companion and this emission would be blended with emission from the MHD wind.

          The possible origin of three Apollo asteroids 3200 Phaethon, 2005UD, and 1999YC

 - **Abstract**
 $\textit{Aims.}$ We study the possible dynamical background of three Apollo asteroids: 3200 Phaethon, 2005 UD, and 1999 YC. The source regions under consideration are the asteroid families (2) Pallas, in the outer belt, and two inner-belt families (329) Svea and (142) Polana. We also aim to explain some of the contradictions in the literature in regards to the origin of Phaethon. $\textit{Methods.}$ Our methodology relies on the precise dynamical mapping of several mean motion resonances (MMRs), which are considered the main transport channels. This approach allows the clear detection of chaotic structures in an MMR and efficient selection of test asteroids for diffusion. We tracked the orbital evolution of the selected particles over 5 million years and registered all their eventual entries into the orbital neighborhood of the asteroids 3200 Phaethon, 2005 UD and 1999 YC. We performed massive calculations for different orbital and integration parameters using Orbit9 and Rebound software packages. $\textit{Results.}$ We observed possible connections between three targeted Apollo asteroids and asteroid families we considered as their sources. The (2) Pallas family has the highest chance of being the origin of targeted asteroids, and (142) Polana has the lowest. The amount of transported material largely depends on the integrator, the integration step, and even the choice of the initial epoch, though to a lesser extent. There is a systematic discrepancy between the results obtained with Orbit9 and Rebound regarding the efficiency of the transport, but they show good agreement over delivery times and dynamical maps. A non-negligible number of objects approached all three target asteroids, which could indicate that the breakup of the precursor body occurred during its dynamical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we present 18 to 24 GHz and high angular resolution radio wavelength Australia Telescope Compact Array follow up observations towards a sample of 39 HC HII region candidates. These objects, taken from a sample hosting 6.7 GHz methanol masers, were chosen due to the compact and optically thick nature of their continuum emission. We have detected 27 compact radio sources and constructed their spectral energy distributions over the 5 to 24 GHz range to determine the young HII regions physical properties, i.e., diameter, electron density ne, emission measure, Lyman continuum flux NLy and turnover frequency. The flux measurements are fitted for 20 objects assuming an ionisation bounded HII region with uniform density model. For the remaining 7 objects that lack constraints spanning both their optically thick and thin regimes, we utilise relations from the literature to determine their physical properties. Comparing these determined parameters with those of known hypercompact and ultracompact HII regions, we have identified 13 HC HII regions, 6 intermediate objects that fall between HC HII and UC HII regions, 6 UC HII regions and one radio jet candidate which increases the known population of HC HII regions by 50 per cent. All the young and compact HII regions are embedded in dusty and dense clumps and 80 percent of the HC HII regions identified in this work are associated with various maser species. Four of our radio sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz, we consider these to be amongst the youngest HC HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The authors of the article set out to investigate the motion of Globular Star Clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way relative to the plane and center of the Galaxy. For this study, we used data from 164 Galactic Globular Clusters derived from Gaia, HST, and literature studies. The study calculated the average GC motion velocities relative to the Galactic plane in the northern and southern regions depending on the galactic latitude b and distance from the Galactic plane. The work consisted of using the GC parameters to find the proper motion of clusters along the Galactic latitude b and the velocities V of cluster motion in the perpendicular direction relative to the Galactic plane for the northern and southern regions, respectively, and determine the average values of these velocities. The velocities V of GC motion were also found depending on the distance to the Galaxy plane and their average values were determined. The work also determined the average velocity VR of motion of the GC relative to the center of the galaxy. The study yielded

          The physical mechanism of the streaming instability

 - **Abstract**
 The main hurdle of planet formation theory is the metre-scale barrier. One of the most promising ways to overcome it is via the streaming instability (SI). Unfortunately, the mechanism responsible for the onset of this instability remains mysterious. It has recently been shown that the SI is a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI) involving inertial waves. We build on this insight and clarify the physical picture of how the SI develops, while bolstering this picture with transparent mathematics. Like all RDIs, the SI is built on a feedback loop: in the `forward action', an inertial wave concentrates dust into clumps; in the `backward reaction', those drifting dust clumps excite an inertial wave. Each process breaks into two mechanisms, a fast one and a slow one. At resonance, each forward mechanism can couple with a backward mechanism to close a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the fast-fast loop is stable, so the SI uses the fast-slow and slow-fast loops. Despite this last layer of complexity, we hope that our explanation will help understand how the SI works, in which conditions it can grow, how it manifests itself, and how it saturates.

          Superflare of a Sun-like star observed with XMM-Newton and SRG/eROSITA

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we studied X-ray source SRGe J021932.4$-$040154 (SRGe J02193), which we associated with a single X-ray active star of spectral class G2V$-$G4V and the rotational period $\rm P_{rot} < 9.3$ days. Additional analysis of TESS light-curves allowed for the rotational period estimation of $3.2 \pm 0.5$ days. SRGe J02193 was observed with the SRG/eROSITA during eUDS survey in 2019 in a much dimmer state compared to the XMM-Newton catalogue 4XMM-DR12. Detailed analysis revealed that the archival XMM-Newton observations captured the source during a flaring event in 2017. The XMM-Newton light curve demonstrates a strong flare described with the Gaussian rise and exponential decay, typical for stellar flares, characterized by timescales of ${\sim}400$ s and ${\sim}1300$ s, respectively. The spectral analysis of the quiescent state reveals ${\sim}10$ MK plasma at luminosity of $(1.4\pm0.4) \times 10^{29} \rm~erg~s^{-1}$ (0.3$-$4.5 keV). The spectrum of the flare is characterized by temperature of ${\sim}40$ MK and luminosity $(5.5\pm0.6)\times 10^{30} \rm~erg~s^{-1}$. The total energy emitted during the flare ${\sim}1.7 \times 10^{34}$ erg exceeds the canonical threshold of $10^{33}$ erg, allowing us to classify the observed event as a superflare on a Sun-like star. Additionally, we present the upper limit on the surface starspot area based on the brightness variations and consider the hypothesis of the object being a binary system with G-type and M-type stars, suggested by two independent estimations of radial velocity variations from APOGEE-2 and Gaia.

          $\texttt{AXP4}$, a Numerical Simulator of Pulse Profiles for Binary Accreting X-ray Pulsars $-$ I: Beam Geometries
 - **Authors:** Parisee S. Shirke
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The paper presents model pulse profiles from binary accreting X-ray pulsars using high-resolution numerical simulations for pencil and fan emission beam geometries, each with two different optical depths obtained using a new numerical code $\texttt{AXP4}$ developed in this work. Sharp, pointed-peak improvements are obtained in the known flat-top pulse profiles by extrapolating the model emission functions available in the literature over the full range of emission angles for a realistic description. The effect of general relativistic bending of light due to the strong gravity near the neutron star is taken into account, updating previous attempts with new analytic approximations for photon trajectories in curved space-time reported in the literature (including additional flux contribution from the dark unseen face of the pulsar). Incorporating the other general relativistic effect of gravitational red-shift is seen to redden the pulsar beam to increasingly lower energies along the X-ray observing band. Integrating this emission over a circular slab geometry for two antipodal hotspots lying flush at the neutron star polar caps presents smoothened, composite gravitationally bent pulse profiles to the observer. A comparison between the corresponding non-normalized flux profiles is included. For theoretical completeness and reference base, this treatment is applied to isotropic emitters with uniform injection and limb-darkened beams, as well. The possibility of the production of Einstein rings around a pulsar for a limiting value of the compactness parameter is a distinctive feature.

          Rotational velocities of Blue Straggler Stars in the Globular Cluster M55

 - **Abstract**
 By using high-resolution spectra acquired with FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT, we measured radial and rotational velocities of 115 stars in the Galactic globular cluster M55. After field decontamination based on the radial velocity values, the final sample of member stars is composed of 32 blue straggler stars (BSSs) and 76 reference stars populating the red giant and horizontal branches of the cluster. In agreement with previous findings, the totality of red giant branch stars has negligible rotation ($<$ 10 km s$^{-1}$), and horizontal branch stars have rotational velocities of 40 km s$^{-1}$ at most. In contrast, the BSS rotational velocity distribution shows a long tail extending up to $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, with 15 BSSs (out of 32) spinning faster than 40 km s$^{-1}$. By defining the threshold for fast rotating BSSs at 40 km s$^{-1}$, this sets the percentage of these stars at 47 $\pm$ 14 %. Such a large value has never been found before in any globular clusters. It is roughly comparable to that measured in other loose systems ($\omega$ Centauri, M4, and NGC 3201) and significantly larger than that observed in high-density clusters (as 47 Tucanae, NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and M30). This evidence supports a scenario where recent BSS formation is occurring in low-density environments. We also find that the BSS rotational velocity tends to decrease for decreasing luminosity, as found for another loose cluster of the sample (namely, NGC 3201).

          Insight into the occurrence of particle acceleration through the investigation of Wolf-Rayet stars using uGMRT observations

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars produce strong stellar winds that consist of continuous outflows of material at speeds of thousands of km/s. These winds convey large amounts of kinetic power, especially in the case of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. When these winds interact with nearby material, they will likely produce shocks. Among other processes, particle acceleration is expected to occur. This is particularly well established in the case of massive binary systems, where the stellar winds collide, allowing these systems to be identified thanks to the detection of synchrotron radio emission, produced by a population of relativistic particles accelerated in the shocks. Our goal is to investigate the occurrence of particle acceleration among massive stars in their pre-supernova evolution phases. To this end, we observed a subset of five WR stars in the radio domain using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), located in India. The observations were carried out in bands 4 (550-950 MHz) and 5 (1050-1450 MHz) for all the targets. We detected radio emission for only WR 110 in bands 4 and 5. Its thermal spectrum displays a consistent index of +0.74 down to uGMRT bands. The four other targets were not detected and we derived 3$\sigma$ upper limits. Our upper limits in Band 4 are the first provided for these targets below 1 GHz. None of the targets was identified as a synchrotron radio emitter in these radio bands. If some synchrotron emission is produced in these systems, the non-detection with uGMRT can be most likely attributed to strong free-free absorption (FFA). This is especially relevant for WR 98a, which is catalogued as a particle accelerator based on previous measurements at higher radio frequencies. We discuss how the prominence of FFA constitutes a severe obstacle to identifying particle accelerators in the radio domain.

          Field-level Emulation of Cosmic Structure Formation with Cosmology and Redshift Dependence
 - **Authors:** Drew Jamieson, Yin Li, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Shirley Ho, David N. Spergel

 - **Abstract**
 We present a field-level emulator for large-scale structure, capturing the cosmology dependence and the time evolution of cosmic structure formation. The emulator maps linear displacement fields to their corresponding nonlinear displacements from N-body simulations at specific redshifts. Designed as a neural network, the emulator incorporates style parameters that encode dependencies on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the linear growth factor $D(z)$ at redshift $z$. We train our model on the six-dimensional N-body phase space, predicting particle velocities as the time derivative of the model's displacement outputs. This innovation results in significant improvements in training efficiency and model accuracy. Tested on diverse cosmologies and redshifts not seen during training, the emulator achieves percent-level accuracy on scales of $k\sim~1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~h$ at $z=0$, with improved performance at higher redshifts. We compare predicted structure formation histories with N-body simulations via merger trees, finding consistent merger event sequences and statistical properties.

          Profile Likelihoods in Cosmology: When, Why and How illustrated with $\Lambda$CDM, Massive Neutrinos and Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Frequentist parameter inference using profile likelihoods has received increased attention in the cosmology literature recently since it can give important complementary information to Bayesian credible intervals. Here, we give a pedagogical review to frequentist parameter inference in cosmology with particular focus on when the graphical profile likelihood construction gives meaningful constraints, i.e.\ confidence intervals with correct coverage. This construction rests on the assumption of the asymptotic limit of a large data set such as in \textit{Wilks' theorem}. We assess the validity of this assumption in the context of three cosmological models with \textit{Planck} 2018 \texttt{Plik\_lite} data: While our tests for the $\Lambda$CDM model indicate that the profile likelihood method gives correct coverage, $\Lambda$CDM with the sum of neutrino masses as a free parameter appears consistent with a Gaussian near a boundary motivating the use of the boundary-corrected or Feldman-Cousins graphical method; for $w_0$CDM with the equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, as a free parameter, we find indication of a violation of the assumptions. Finally, we compare frequentist and Bayesian constraints of these models. Our results motivate care when using the graphical profile likelihood method in cosmology.
