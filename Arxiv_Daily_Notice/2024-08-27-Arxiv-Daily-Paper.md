          CMB limits on decaying dark matter beyond the ionization threshold

 - **Abstract**
 The temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been used to set constraints on decaying dark matter models down to keV masses. In this work, we extend these limits down to the sub-keV mass range. Using principal component analysis, we estimate the lower bound on the decay lifetime for a basis of different dark matter masses and Standard Model final states, from which the bound on an arbitrary model can be calculated. We validate our principal component analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and Planck 2018 data. We perform a separate analysis for models decaying into photons below the hydrogen ionization threshold. We demonstrate that for these models, the effect of energy deposition can be captured approximately by a single parameter, but the redshift dependence of the effect is very different from higher-energy injections; in particular, the perturbations to CMB anisotropies are more sensitive to energy deposited around the time of recombination.

          Can Baby Universe Absorption Explain Dark Energy?

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that the accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by the merging of our universe with baby universes, resulting in dark energy with a phantom-like equation of state. However, the evidence in favor of it did not include the full set of cosmological observables. Here we examine the implications of this model for both early and late universe cosmology using data from Planck collaboration, DESI 2024 and other experiments. We find that the pure baby universe model gives a poor fit to current data. Extending it to include a contribution from the cosmological constant, we find two allowed regions of parameter space: one close to $\Lambda$CDM, and another with $\Lambda <0$ plus the exotic dark energy component. The two regions can be significantly favored over $\Lambda$CDM, depending on the choice of supernova datasets, and they can ameliorate the Hubble tension to the level of $2\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. The model with $\Lambda<0$ features an equation of state $w(a)$ with a pole singularity at early times.

          Two Novel Hot Jupiter Formation Pathways: How White Dwarf Kicks Shape the Hot Jupiter Population

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Hot Jupiters (HJs) is disputed between a variety of in situ and ex situ formation scenarios. One of the early proposed ex situ scenarios was the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism combined with tidal circularization, which can produce HJs with the aid of a stellar or planetary companion. However, observations have revealed a lack of stellar companions to HJs, which challenges the importance of the binary star-driven EKL plus tides scenario. In this work, we explore so far unaccounted-for stellar evolution effects on HJ formation, in particular the effect of white dwarf (WD) formation. Gaia observations have revealed that WDs often undergo a kick during formation, which can alter a binary's orbital configuration or even unbind it. Based on this WD kick, in this letter we propose and explore two novel HJ formation pathways: 1) HJs that are presently orbiting single stars, but were initially formed in a binary that was later unbound by a WD kick; 2) Binaries that survive the WD kick can trigger enhanced EKL oscillations and lead to 2nd generation HJ formation. We demonstrate that the majority of seemingly single HJs could have formed in binary star systems. As such, HJ formation in binaries via the EKL mechanism could be one of the dominant HJ formation pathways, and our results highlight that unaccounted-for stellar evolution effects, like WD formation, can obscure the actual origin of observed exoplanet populations.

          A Comprehensive Analysis Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m Phase Curve of Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Although exoplanetary science was not initially projected to be a substantial part of the Spitzer mission, its exoplanet observations set the stage for current and future surveys with JWST and Ariel. We present a comprehensive reduction and analysis of Spitzer's 4.5 micron phase curves of 29 hot Jupiters on low-eccentricity orbits. The analysis, performed with the Spitzer Phase Curve Analysis (SPCA) pipeline, confirms that BLISS mapping is the best detrending scheme for most, but not all, observations. Visual inspection remains necessary to ensure consistency across detrending methods due to the diversity of phase curve data and systematics. Regardless of the model selection scheme - whether using the lowest-BIC or a uniform detrending approach - we observe the same trends, or lack thereof. We explore phase curve trends as a function of irradiation temperature, orbital period, planetary radius, mass, and stellar effective temperature. We discuss the trends that are robustly detected and provide potential explanations for those that are not observed. While it is almost tautological that planets receiving greater instellation are hotter, we are still far from confirming dynamical theories of heat transport in hot Jupiter atmospheres due to the sample's diversity. Even among planets with similar temperatures, other factors like rotation and metallicity vary significantly. Larger, curated sample sizes and higher-fidelity phase curve measurements from JWST and Ariel are needed to firmly establish the parameters governing day-night heat transport on synchronously rotating planets.

 - **Abstract**
 RV Tauri variable stars are pulsating evolved stars that are identified by a characterizing feature in their light curves: alternating deep and shallow minima. Many RV Tauri variable stars were originally classified decades ago using visual observations and photographic plates. However, recent studies suggest that there are imposters, or misclassified variables, amongst the sample of RV Tau stars. In this study, we examine 84 known and suspected RV Tau stars that appear in the variable star catalog of the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernova (ASAS-SN). For each ASAS-SN light curve, we performed a period analysis and compared our results with those of the General Catalog of Variables Stars (GCVS) and the automatic classification algorithm used by ASAS-SN. We found that the pattern of alternating minima present in RV Tau variable stars often confuses automatic classification. Our results include updated periods and classifications for our sample. Our study provides an important step towards obtaining a robust sample of RV Tau variable stars to better understand the pulsation mechanism and the evolutionary pathway of these variable stars.

          Finding the Fuse: Prospects for the Detection and Characterization of Hydrogen-Rich Core-Collapse Supernova Precursor Emission with the LSST

 - **Abstract**
 Enhanced emission in the months to years preceding explosion has been detected for several core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Though the physical mechanisms driving the emission remain hotly debated, the light curves of detected events show long-lived ($\geq$50 days), plateau-like behavior, suggesting hydrogen recombination may significantly contribute to the total energy budget. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a decade-long photometric baseline to search for this emission, both in binned pre-explosion observations after an SN is detected and in single-visit observations prior to the SN explosion. In anticipation of these searches, we simulate a range of eruptive precursor models to core-collapse SNe and forecast the discovery rates of these phenomena in LSST data. We find a detection rate of ~40-130 yr$^{-1}$ for SN IIP/IIL precursors and ~110 yr$^{-1}$ for SN IIn precursors in single-epoch photometry. Considering the first three years of observations with the effects of rolling and observing triplets included, this number grows to a total of 150-400 in binned photometry, with the highest number recovered when binning in 100-day bins for 2020tlf-like precursors and in 20-day bins for other recombination-driven models from the literature. We quantify the impact of using templates contaminated by residual light (from either long-lived or separate precursor emission) on these detection rates, and explore strategies for estimating baseline flux to mitigate these issues. Spectroscopic follow-up of the eruptions preceding core-collapse SNe and detected with LSST will offer important clues to the underlying drivers of terminal-stage mass loss in massive stars.

          Earths within Reach: Evaluation of Strategies for Mitigating Solar Variability using 3.5 years of NEID Sun-as-a-Star Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of Sun-as-a-star observations by the NEID Solar Telescope at WIYN Observatory, spanning January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024. We identify 117,060 observations which are unlikely to be significantly affected by weather, hardware or major calibration issues. We describe several high-level data products being made available to the community to aid in the interpretation and inter comparisons of NEID solar observations. Solar observations demonstrate excellent performance of NEID, including radial velocity (RV) accuracy and long-term stability of better than $\simeq 0.37$ m s$^{-1}$ over $\simeq 3.5$ years, even though NEID was not originally designed or optimized for daytime observations of the Sun. Currently, intrinsic stellar variability is the primary barrier to detecting Earth-analog planets for most nearby, Sun-like stars. We present a comparison of the effectiveness of several methods proposed to mitigate the effects of solar variability on the Sun's estimated RV. We find that the Scalpels algorithm performs particularly well and substantially reduces the RMS RV of solar spectra from over 2 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.277 m s$^{-1}$. Even when training on a subset of days with NEID solar observations and testing on a held-out sample, the RMS of cleaned RV is 0.34-0.42 m s$^{-1}$. This is significantly better than previous attempts at removing solar variability and suggests that the current generation of EPRV instruments are technically capable of detecting Earth-mass planets orbiting a solar twin if provided with sufficient observing time allocations ($\sim 10^3$ nights of observations).

          JWST Thermal Emission of the Terrestrial Exoplanet GJ 1132b

 - **Abstract**
 We present thermal emission measurements of GJ 1132b spanning 5--12 um obtained with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/LRS) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). GJ 1132b is an M-dwarf rocky planet with Teq=584 K and an orbital period of 1.6 days. We measure a white-light secondary eclipse depth of 140+/-17 ppm, which corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of Tp,dayside= 709+/-31 K using improved star and planet parameters. This measured temperature is only 1 sigma below the maximum possible dayside temperature of a bare rock (i.e., assuming a zero albedo planet with no heat redistribution, Tmax = 746+14/-11 K). The emission spectrum is consistent with a featureless blackbody, which agrees with a wide range of possible surface compositions. By comparing forward models to the dayside emission spectrum, we rule out Earth-thickness (P ~ 1 bar) atmospheres with at least 1% H2O, atmospheres of any modeled thickness (10^-4 -- 10^2 bar) that contain at least 1% CO2, and thick, Venus-like atmospheres (P>~100 bar) with at least 1 ppm CO2 or H2O. We therefore conclude that GJ 1132b likely does not have a significant atmosphere. This finding supports the concept of a universal 'Cosmic Shoreline' given the high level of bolometric and XUV irradiation received by the planet.

          Counter-Rotation and Slow Precession in Aligned Eccentric Nuclear Disks due to Gravitational Wave Recoil Kicks

 - **Abstract**
 The M31 nucleus contains a supermassive black hole embedded in a massive stellar disk of apsidally-aligned eccentric orbits. It has recently been shown that this disk is slowly precessing at a rate consistent with zero. Here we demonstrate using N-body methods that apsidally-aligned eccentric disks can form with a significant (~0.5) fraction of orbits counter-rotating as the result of a gravitational wave recoil kick of merging supermassive black holes. Higher amplitude kicks map to a larger retrograde fraction in the surrounding stellar population which in turns results in slow precession. We furthermore show that disks with significant counter-rotation are more stable (that is, apsidal-alignment is most pronounced and long lasting), more eccentric, and have the highest rates of stars entering the black hole's tidal disruption radius

 - **Abstract**
 The values of the Hubble constant obtained from the data of the early and of the late Universe differ by 10%. Data obtained by DESI Collaboration can help solve this problem, establishing with high precision the value of the product of the Hubble constant h and comoving of sound horizon at the end of drag epoch to be equal to 101.8 Mpc. This value agrees very well with the earlier refinement of the standard recombination theory and the value of the Hubble constant H0=73.5 km/s/Mpc obtained from measurements in the late Universe.

          High-redshift cosmography with a possible cosmic distance duality relation violation

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) defines a fundamental link in modern cosmology between geometric distance measurements and redshift. Any observed deviations from the CDDR could suggest the need for new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this study, we model geometric distances (both luminosity and angular) using a cosmographic expansion with the Pade method, which stabilizes the behavior of the cosmographic series at high redshifts. This approach allows us to determine geometric distances independently of any specific model. By incorporating updated data from supernovae (SN), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic chronometers (CC), we obtain observational constraints for parametric models that quantify the CDDR, alongside all baseline cosmographic parameters. We find that potential CDDR violations introduce new statistical correlations in the cosmographic parameters ($H_0$, $q_0$, and $j_0$). However, within this framework, we do not observe significant deviations from the CDDR, and our results remain consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work offers a novel and straightforward method for testing the CDDR by fixing background evolution through cosmographic techniques, thereby paving the way for new geometric observational tests of possible deviations from standard cosmology.

          Buto Facula, Ganymede: Palimpsest Exemplar

 - **Abstract**
 Nowhere in the solar system are impact morphologies observed in greater variety than on the icy Galilean satellites. This is likely a consequence of the structural and thermal state of the crust at the time of impact, and perhaps impact velocity. Palimpsest-type impact features show smooth enclosed central plains surrounded by undulating plains, within which are distributed concentric arcuate ridges, and no recognizable rim. Buto Facula on Ganymede is the best resolved of any palimpsest, having mostly been imaged at 190 m/pixel and optimum lighting, allowing insight into the circumstances that form this type of impact feature. Part of an impact crater on the eastern edge of Buto Facula has been buried by undulating plains material, suggesting that at the time of their emplacement the undulating plains behaved as a low-viscosity flow advancing across the landscape around the impact zone, encroaching on landforms that it encountered. We evaluated hypotheses for the formation of undulating plains using impact and ejecta modeling. We do not attribute the source of Buto's undulating plains to "dry" impact ejecta due to the existence of impact features larger than Buto that are not surrounded by undulating plains deposits. We performed iSALE impact simulations incorporating a subsurface liquid layer (or low strength layer) at various depths. An impact into a surface with a pre-existing, 5 km-deep, 5 km-thick fluid layer results in excavation of fluid material from that layer, producing a nearly flat final surface profile that is consistent with Buto's flat profile and the distribution of its undulating plains material. A liquid layer at a depth of 20-40 km results in impact feature profiles that resemble classic impact craters. We offer tests of this shallow subsurface liquid layer hypothesis for palimpsest formation that could potentially be performed by JUICE and Europa Clipper.

          Detection of gamma-ray burst Amati relation based on Hubble data set and Pantheon+ samples

 - **Abstract**
 Using gamma-ray bursts as standard candles for cosmological parameter constraints rely on their empirical luminosity relations and low-redshift calibration. In this paper, we examine the Amati relation and its potential corrections based on the A118 sample of higher-quality gamma-ray bursts, using both Hubble data set and Pantheon+ samples as calibration samples in the redshift range of z < 1.965. In calibrating gamma-ray bursts using these two datasets, we employ Gaussian processes to obtain corresponding Hubble diagrams to avoid the dependence on cosmological models in the calibration process. We first divided the low-redshift sample of GRBs into two bins and examined the Amati relation and its potential modifications. We found that under both calibrations, the Amati relation did not show evidence of redshift evolution (68% confidence level). For the other two Amati relations that include redshift evolution terms, the central values of the redshift evolution coefficients deviated from 0, but due to the limitations of the sample size and the increase in the number of parameters, most of the redshift evolution coefficients were not able to be excluded from 0 at the 1 sigma level. Therefore, to assess their situation across the entire redshift range, we employed MCMC to globally fit three types of Amati relations. By computing AIC and BIC, we found that for the GRB A118 sample, the standard Amati relation remains the most fitting empirical luminosity formula, and no potential redshift evolution trend was observed for two different low-redshift calibrating sources.

          Exploring the nature of an ultraluminous X-ray source in NGC 628

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the X-ray spectral and temporal properties of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 628 by using multi-epoch archival X-ray data. The physical parameters were estimated in each epoch in order to constrain the nature of the compact object in the system. Also, the optical counterpart candidates of the ULX were examined using the archival {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) data. {\it XMM-Newton}, {\it Chandra}, and {\it Swift} data were used to create the long-term light curve (which covers a period of 22 years) and perform the spectral analysis. Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the source were constructed to examine the short-term variability in each epoch. In order to search for an optical counterpart in the HST/WFC3 images, a relative astrometric correction was initially applied to the {\it Chandra} and HST/WFC3 images. The X-ray flux of the source changes by a factor of $\sim 200$ throughout the observations. The previously detected quasi-periodic signal (in the range of 0.1$-$0.4 mHz) was confirmed by using the Lomb-Scargle method. After astrometric correction, two optical counterpart candidates were detected for the source. The obtained spectral energy distributions in the optical band for both candidates indicate that the optical emission is dominated by the irradiation of the accretion disc. Considering the best-fit model parameters of the multi-colour disc black-body model, we derived the mass of the black hole in the system as being in the range of (3$-$16) $M_{\odot}$. Nonetheless, the long-term variability and the spectral transitions in the hardness-luminosity diagram make it difficult to rule out the neutron star scenario.

          Four HD 209458 b transits through CRIRES+: Detection of H$_2$O and non-detections of C$_2$H$_2$, CH$_4$, and HCN

 - **Abstract**
 HD 209458 b is one of the most studied exoplanets to date. Despite this, atmospheric characterisation studies yielded inconsistent species detections and abundances. Values reported for the C/O ratio range from 0.1 to 1.0. Of particular interest is the simultaneous detection of H2O and HCN reported by some studies using high-resolution ground-based observations, which would require the atmospheric C/O ratio to be fine-tuned to a narrow interval around 1. HCN has however not been detected from recent space-based observations. We aim to provide an independent study of HD 209458 b's atmosphere with high-resolution observations, in order to infer the presence of several species, including H2O and HCN. We observed four primary transits of HD 209458 b at a high resolution (R=92000) with CRIRES+ in the near infrared (band H, 1.4--1.8 um). After reducing the data with pycrires, we prepared the data using the SysRem algorithm and performed a cross-correlation (CCF) analysis of the transmission spectra. We also compared the results with those obtained from simulated datasets constructed by combining the Exo-REM self-consistent model with the petitRADTRANS package. Combining the four transits, we detect H2O with a signal-to-noise CCF metric of 8.7. This corresponds to a signal emitted at $K_p=151.3^{+31.1}_{-23.4}$ km/s and blueshifted by $-6^{+1}_{-2}$ km/s, consistent with what is expected for HD 209458 b. We do not detect any other species among C2H2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2S, HCN, and NH3. Comparing this with our simulated datasets, this result is consistent with a C/O ratio of 0.1 and an opaque cloud top pressure of 50 Pa, at a 3 times solar metallicity. This would also be consistent with recent JWST observations. However, none of the simulated results obtained with a bulk C/O ratio of 0.8, a value suggested by previous studies using GIANO-B and CRIRES, are consistent with our observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rapid and accurate identification of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is crucial for unraveling their origins. However, current burst search algorithms frequently miss low-threshold signals or lack universality for observations. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing transfer learning experiment based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to establish a universal GRB identification method, which validated successfully using GECAM-B data. By employing data augmentation techniques, we enhance the diversity and quantity of the GRB sample. We develop a 1D CNN model with a multi-scale feature cross fusion module (MSCFM) to extract features from samples and perform classification. The comparative results demonstrated significant performance improvements following pre-training and transferring on a large-scale dataset. Our optimal model achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.41% on the source dataset of GECAM-B, and identified three previously undiscovered GRBs by contrast with manual analysis of GECAM-B observations. These innovative transfer learning and data augmentation methods presented in this work hold promise for applications in multi-satellite exploration scenarios characterized by limited data sets and a scarcity of labeled samples in high-energy astronomy.

          Efficient estimation of rotation-induced bias to reconstructed CMB lensing power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum is a powerful probe of the late-time universe, encoding valuable information about cosmological parameters such as the sum of neutrino masses and dark energy equation of state. However, the presence of anisotropic cosmic birefringence can bias the reconstructed CMB lensing power spectrum using CMB polarization maps, particularly at small scales, and affect the constraints on these parameters. Upcoming experiments, which will be dominated by the polarization lensing signal, are especially susceptible to this bias. We identify the dominant contribution to this bias as an $N_L^{(1)}$-like noise, caused by anisotropic rotation instead of lensing. We show that, for an CMB-S4-like experiment, a scale-invariant anisotropic rotation field with a standard deviation of 0.05 degrees can suppress the small-scale lensing power spectrum ($L\gtrsim 2000$) at a comparable level to the effect of massive neutrino with $\sum_i m_{\nu_{i}}=50~\rm{meV}$, making rotation field an important source of degeneracy in neutrino mass measurement for future CMB experiments. We provide an analytic expression and a simulation-based estimator for this $N_L^{(1)}$-like noise, which allows for efficient forecasting and mitigation of the bias in future experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of a non-scale-invariant rotation power spectrum on the reconstructed lensing power spectrum and find that an excess of power in the small-scale rotation power spectrum leads to a larger bias. Our work provides an effective numeric framework to accurately model and account for the bias caused by anisotropic rotation in future CMB lensing measurements.

          Influence of selection criteria on the interpretation of rotational behaviour of wide-binary star systems

 - **Abstract**
 Binary star systems are expected to follow Newtonian dynamics similarly to planetary systems. However, reports have been made of wide binary systems with separations around 0.01 pc and larger, showing potential deviations from standard Newtonian motion. This phenomenon, suggestive of the flattening of galactic rotation curves, calls for closer inspection. This study presents an analysis of wide binary stars using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), a space-based astrometry mission funded by the European Space Agency. The study compares different choices of selection criteria to examine the nature of these apparent anomalous kinematics within the solar neighbourhood. The Gaia data set furnishes detailed parameters, including radial velocity, mass, age, and binary probability in addition to standard parameters. A custom Python tool named BYNARY facilitated both data processing and analysis. This report reveals that the signs of any anomalous signals systematically diminish as the initial selection criteria are relaxed for degrouping while subsequent filtering remains stringent, leading to the complete elimination of any apparent non-Newtonian motion for binary separations within 0.5 pc. The study shows that an y observ ed anomalous behaviour in solar neighbourhood wide binaries within 130 pc must be produced either by faint companion stars orbiting primary or secondary stars, or by flyby stars. The findings emphasize the importance of the choice of selection criteria in disentangling genuine binary dynamics from external influences. The conclusions align with the predictions of Newtonian mechanics and general relativity, though they do not exclude other phenomena at larger scales.

 - **Abstract**
 As an inflated Hot Jupiter orbiting an early-type primary star in the evolved binary HD 202772 system, HD 202772 A b's presence invites a study of how such a planet forms and evolves. As a prelude to potential atmospheric characterization with the latest generation of observatories, we present a reduction and analysis of eclipse light curve observations of HD 202772 A b acquired with the Spitzer Space Telescope using the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m channels. We find eclipse depths of $680\pm68$ and $1081^{+54}_{-53}$ ppm, respectively, corresponding to day-side effective temperatures of $2130^{+102}_{-91}$ and $2611^{+46}_{-49}$ K. The corresponding Bond albedos are consistent with the distribution of albedos for Hot Jupiters observed with both Spitzer and TESS. The heat redistribution efficiencies consistent with the Bond albedo range predicted by 1-D atmospheric models in radiative-convective equilibrium are $0.71\pm0.10$ and $0.03^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, respectively, indicating a weak day-night contrast for the former and a strong contrast for the latter. Given this, and the unique environment in which this planet resides, we recommend follow-up observations with JWST to more precisely constrain its atmospheric composition and structure, as well as its host stellar environment, to elucidate if and how the atmospheres of these close-in giants evolve with host stars in binaries past the main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the MASTER OT J030227.28+191754.5 outburst in 2021-2022, reaching an amplitude of 10.2 mag and a duration of 60 d. The detections of (1) the double-peaked optical emission lines, and (2) the early and ordinary superhumps, established that MASTER OT J030227.28+191754.5 is an extremely energetic WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN). Based on the superhump observations, we obtained its orbital period and mass ratio as 0.05986(1) d and 0.063(1), respectively. These are within a typical range of low-mass-ratio DNe. According to the binary parameters derived based on the thermal-tidal instability model, our analyses showed that (1) the standard disk model requires an accretion rate $\simeq$ 10$^{20}$ g s$^{-1}$ to explain its peak optical luminosity and (2) large mass was stored in the disk at the outburst onset. These cannot be explained solely by the impact of its massive ($\gtrsim$ 1.15 M$_\odot$) primary white dwarf implied by Kimura et al. (2023). Instead, we propose that the probable origin of this enormously energetic DN outburst is the even lower quiescence viscosity than other WZ Sge-type DNe. This discussion is qualitatively valid for most possible binary parameter spaces unless the inclination is low ($\lesssim 40^\circ$) enough for the disk to be bright explaining the outburst amplitude. Such low inclinations, however, would not allow detectable amplitude of early superhumps in the current thermal-tidal instability model. The optical spectra at outburst maximum showed the strong emission lines of Balmer, He I, and He II series whose core is narrower than $\sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$. Considering its binary parameters, a Keplerian disk cannot explain this narrow component, but the presumable origin is disk winds.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer (RT) modelling is a necessary tool in the interpretation of observations of the thermal emission of interstellar dust. It is also often part of multi-physics modelling. In this context, the efficiency of radiative transfer calculations is important, even for one-dimensional models. We investigate the use of the so-called immediate re-emission (IRE) method for fast calculation of one-dimensional spherical cloud models. We wish to determine whether weighting methods similar to those used in traditional Monte Carlo simulations can speed up the estimation of dust temperature. We present the program DIES, a parallel implementation of the IRE method, which makes it possible to do the calculations also on graphics processing units (GPUs). We tested the program with externally and internally heated cloud models, and examined the potential improvements from the use of different weighted sampling schemes. The execution times of the program compare favourably with previous programs, especially when run on GPUs. On the other hand, weighting schemes produce only limited improvements. In the case of an internal radiation source, the basic IRE method samples the re-emission well, while traditional Monte Carlo requires the use of spatial importance sampling. Some noise reduction could be achieved for externally heated models by weighting the initial photon directions. Only in optically very thin models does weighting - such as the proposed method of forced first interaction - result in noise reduction by a factor of several. The IRE method performs well for both internally and externally heated models, typically without the need for any additional weighting schemes. With run times of the order of one second for our test models, the DIES program is suitable even for larger parameter studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of Dark matter (DM) within a neutron star (NS) can substantially influence the macroscopic properties. It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM. Our analysis indicates that binary pulsar systems could potentially constrain the extent of admixed anisotropic NS or, more optimistically, provide evidence for the existence of DM-admixed anisotropic NS.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves induced by primordial perturbations serve as crucial probes for studying the early universe, providing a significant window into potential new physics during cosmic evolution. Due to the potentially large amplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of high-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a vertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can directly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational waves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order cosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams correspond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced gravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible diagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar induced gravitational waves unaffected.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of the jet in Cen A is likely better revealed in X-rays than in the radio band, which is usually used to investigate jet proper motions. In this paper, we analyze Chandra ACIS observations of Cen A from 2000 to 2022 and develop an algorithm for systematically fitting the proper motions of its X-ray jet knots. Most of the knots had an apparent proper motion below the detection limit. However, one knot at a transverse distance of $520~\mathrm{pc}$ had an apparent superluminal proper motion of $2.7\pm0.4~\mathrm{c}$. This constrains the inclination of the jet to be $i<41\pm6^{\circ}$, and the velocity of this knot to be $\beta>0.94\pm0.02$. This agrees well with the inclination measured in the inner jet by the EHT, but contradicts previous estimates based on jet and counterjet brightness. It also disagrees with the proper motion of the corresponding radio knot, of $0.8\pm0.1~\mathrm{c}$, which further indicates that the X-ray and radio bands trace distinct structures in the jet. There are four prominent X-ray jet knots closer to the nucleus, but only one of these is inconsistent with being stationary. A few jet knots also have a significant proper motion component in the non-radial direction. This component is typically larger closer to the center of the jet. We also detect brightness and morphology variations at a transverse distance of $100~\mathrm{pc}$ from the nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface porosity has been found to be an important property for small bodies. Some asteroids and comets can exhibit an extremely high surface porosity in the first millimeter layer. This layer may be produced by various processes and maintained by the lack of an atmosphere. However, the influence of porosity on the spectro-photometric properties of small body surfaces is not yet fully understood. In this study, we looked into the effect of porosity on the spectro-photometric properties of Phobos regolith spectroscopic simulants; created by mixing the simulants with ultra-pure water, producing ice-dust particles, and then sublimating the water. The reflectance spectroscopic properties in the visible and near-infrared (0.5-4.2 $\mu$m) show no strong variations between the porous and compact samples. However, one simulant exhibits a bluing of the slope after increasing porosity, providing possible insights into the differences between the blue and red units observed on Phobos. In the mid-infrared range, a contrast increase of the 10-$\mu$m emissivity plateau due to silicates is observed. Photometry reveals a modification in the phase reddening behavior between the compact powder and the sublimation residue for both simulants. However, the observed behavior is different between the simulants, suggesting that the phase reddening may be dependent on the composition of the simulants. The phase curve also appears to be modified by the addition of porosity, with a higher contribution of forward scattering observed for the sublimation residue. The derivation of the Hapke parameters indicates an increase in roughness for the porous sample, but no significant modification of the opposition effect. This study aims to provide new insights into the understanding of porosity by using two Phobos simulants in the context of the upcoming JAXA/Martian Moons eXploration mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical novae are known to demonstrate a supersoft X-ray source (SSS) state following outbursts, which is associated with residual thermonuclear burning on the white dwarf (WD) surface. During its all-sky survey (eRASS1), the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory discovered a bright new SSS, whose position is consistent with the known classical nova AT 2018bej in the Large Magellanic Cloud. There were two eROSITA spectra obtained during eRASS1 and eRASS2 monitoring epochs and one XMM-Newton grating spectrum close to the eRASS1 epoch. We aim to describe the eROSITA and XMM-Newton spectra of AT 2018bej with our local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmosphere models. We focused on the evolution of the hot WD properties between the eRASS1 and eRASS2 epochs, especially on the change of the carbon abundance. A grid of LTE model atmosphere spectra were calculated for different values of the effective temperature (from $T_{\rm eff}= 525$ to $700\,\rm kK$), surface gravity (six values) and chemical composition with five different values of carbon and nitrogen abundances. Both eRASS1 and XMM $0.3-0.6$ keV spectral analyses yield a temperature of the WD of $T_{\rm eff}{\sim}\,600\, \rm kK$ and a WD radius of $8000-8700\,\rm km$. Simultaneous fitting of the eROSITA spectra for two epochs (eRASS1 and eRASS2) with a common WD mass parameter demonstrates a decrease in $T_{\rm eff}$ accompanied by an increase in the WD radius and a decrease in the carbon abundance. However, these changes are marginal and coincide within errors. The derived WD mass is estimated to be $1.05-1.15\, M_\odot$. We traced a minor evolution of the source on a half-year timescale accompanied by a decrease in carbon abundance and concluded that LTE model atmospheres can be used to analyse the available X-ray spectra of classical novae during their SSS stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are typically characterised by energetically significant X-ray emissions from flare-accelerated electrons and hot thermal plasmas. Occulted events, where the main flare is blocked by the solar limb, provide an opportunity to observe and analyse the X-ray emissions specifically associated with CMEs. This study investigates the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions associated with a large filament eruption and CME that occurred on February 15, 2022. This event was highly occulted from the three vantage points of Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Earth. We utilised X-ray observations from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and EUV observations from the Full Sun Imager (FSI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on-board Solar Orbiter, supplemented by multi-viewpoint observations from STEREO-A/EUVI. This enabled a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray emissions in relation to the filament structure observed in EUV. We used STIX's imaging and spectroscopy capabilities to characterise the X-ray source associated with the eruption. Our analysis reveals that the X-ray emissions associated with the occulted eruption originated from an altitude exceeding 0.3Rsun above the main flare site. The X-ray time-profile showed a sharp increase and exponential decay, and consisted of both a hot thermal component at 17 MK and non-thermal emissions (>11.4 keV) characterised by an electron spectral index of 3.9. Imaging analysis showed an extended X-ray source that coincided with the EUV emission as observed from EUI, and was imaged until the source grew to a size larger than the imaging limit of STIX (180 arcsec). The findings demonstrate that STIX combined with EUI provides a unique and powerful tool for examining the energetic properties of the CME component of solar energetic eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the statistics and properties of microlensing events that can be detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS) based on Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate potential microlensing events from a sample of the TESS Candidate Target List(CTL) stars by assuming different observational time spans(or different numbers of sectors for each star) and a wide range of lens masses, i.e., $M_{\rm l}\in [0.1M_{\oplus},~2 M_{\odot}]$. On average, the microlensing optical depth and the event rate for CTL stars are $\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq0.6\times10^{-9}$ per star per day, respectively. The microlensing optical depth decreases by increasing the CTL priority, whereas the efficiency for detecting their microlensing signals enhances with the priority. Additionally, we simulate the microlensing events from the TESS Full-Frame Images(FFIs) stars extracted from the \texttt{TESS}-\texttt{SPOC} pipeline. The optical depth and event rate for these stars are on average $\simeq 1$-$3\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq 1$-$4\times 10^{-9}$ per star per day, and their highest values occur for sector $12$. The total number of microlensing events for the CTL stars is $N_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\sim0.03$, whereas for the FFIs' stars number of events per star during $27.4$-day observing windows is $\hat{N}_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\simeq1.4 \times 10^{-6}$. Based on four criteria we extract the detectable microlensing events and evaluate the detection efficiencies. The highest efficiency for detecting microlensing events from the TESS data occurs for the lens mass $\log_{10}[M_{\rm l}(M_{\odot})] \in [-4.5$,~$-2.5]$, i.e., super-Earth to Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets(FFPs). The detectable microlensing events from the TESS stars are significantly affected by both finite-source and parallax effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pan-STARRS 3$\pi$ survey has detected hundreds of thousands of variable stars thanks to its coverage and 4-year time span, even though the sampling of the light curves is relatively sparse. These light curves contain only 10-15 detections in each of the five filters (g,r,i,z,y). During the K2 mission, the Kepler space telescope observed with a high sampling frequency, although only for about 80 days in each of its campaigns. Crossmatching and investigating the RR Lyrae stars observed by both K2 and Pan-STARRS can serve as a valuable tool to validate the classification and period determination of the survey. We used the Sesar catalogue of RR Lyrae stars detected by Pan-STARRS. After determining the overlap, we also considered the Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae catalogue data for these stars wherever it was available. The frequencies of the light variations were calculated by applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method on the K2 light curves that were prepared with autoEAP photometry. The calculated frequencies of the stars then were compared with those given in the Sesar catalogue and the Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae catalogue. We found that for the majority of the stars, the classification (95.6%) and the frequency determination (90.1%) of the PanSTARRS RR Lyrae stars were consistent within 0.03 d-1 with those that we derived from the K2 autoEAP light curves. For a significant subset of the sample, 7.4%, however, an offset of 1 or 2 d-1 was found in the frequencies. These are the result of the sampling of the detections, because Pan-STARRS observations are affected by diurnal cycles, whereas Kepler carried out measurements quasicontinuously. We found that RRc subtypes are significantly more affected (25.3%) than RRab subtypes (3.7%), which is most likely caused by RRc stars having less sharp light curve features. Validation via space-based data will be important for future ground-based surveys, as well.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Super-RDI, a unique framework for the application of reference star differential imaging (RDI) to Keck/NIRC2 high-contrast imaging observations with the vortex coronagraph. Super-RDI combines frame selection and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optimization techniques with a large multi-year reference point spread function (PSF) library to achieve optimal PSF subtraction at small angular separations. We compile a $\sim$7000 frame reference PSF library based on a set of 288 new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ sequences of 237 unique targets acquired between 2015 and 2019 as part of two planet-search programs, one focusing on nearby young M dwarfs and the other targeting members of the Taurus star-forming region. For our dataset, synthetic companion injection-recovery tests reveal that frame selection with the mean-squared error (MSE) metric combined with KLIP-based PSF subtraction using 1000-3000 frames and $<$500 principal components yields the highest average S/N for injected synthetic companions. We uniformly reduce targets in the young M-star survey with both Super-RDI and angular differential imaging (ADI). For the typical parallactic angle rotation of our dataset ($\sim$10$^\circ$), Super-RDI performs better than a widely used implementation of ADI at separations $\lesssim$0.4" ($\approx$5 $\lambda$/$D$) gaining an average of 0.25 mag in contrast at 0.25" and 0.4 mag in contrast at 0.15". This represents a performance improvement in separation space over RDI with single-night reference star observations ($\sim$100 frame PSF libraries) applied to a similar Keck/NIRC2 dataset in previous work. We recover two known brown dwarf companions and provide detection limits for 155 targets in the young M-star survey. Our results demonstrate that increasing the PSF library size with careful selection of reference frames can improve the performance of RDI with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in $L'$.

This emission likely originates from shocks at the interface of the outer spirals, observed in CO and scattered light emission, and the molecular and dust ring. SO is also detected inside the cavity, at a radius $\sim 20-30$ au and with a rotation velocity compatible with the proto-planet P1.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging of exoplanets relies on complex wavefront sensing and control architectures. In addition to fast adaptive optics systems, most of the future high-contrast imaging instruments will soon be equipped with focal plane wavefront sensing algorithms. These techniques use the science detector to estimate the static and quasi-static aberrations induced by optical manufacturing defects and system thermal variations. Pair-wise probing (PWP) has been the most widely used, especially for space-based application and will be tested at contrast levels of ~1e-9 on-sky along with the future coronagraph instrument onboarding the Roman Space Telescope. This algorithm leans on phase diversities applied on the deformable mirror that are recorded in pairs. A minimum of two pairs of probes are required per bandwidth. An additional unprobed image is also recorded to verify the convergence rate of the correction. Before PWP, Borde & Traub proposed a similar algorithm that takes advantage of the unprobed image in the estimation process to get rid of the pair diversity requirement. In this work, we theoretically show that this latter technique should be more efficient than PWP when the convergence time is not limited by photon noise. We then present its performance and practical limitations on coronagraphic testbeds at JPL and exhibit a first on-sky control of non-common path aberrations with such method on VLT/SPHERE.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an initial analysis of the XRISM first-light observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Resolve microcalorimeter has obtained the first high-resolution spectrum in the 1.6-10 keV band, which contains K-shell emission lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. We find that the Si and S lines are relatively narrow, with a broadening represented by a Gaussian-like velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v \sim 450$ km s$^{-1}$. The Fe He$\alpha$ lines are, on the other hand, substantially broadened with $\sigma_v \sim 1670$ km s$^{-1}$. This broadening can be explained by a combination of the thermal Doppler effect due to the high ion temperature and the kinematic Doppler effect due to the SNR expansion. Assuming that the Fe He$\alpha$ emission originates predominantly from the supernova ejecta, we estimate the reverse shock velocity at the time when the bulk of the Fe ejecta were shock heated to be $-1000 \lesssim V_{\rm rs}~[{\rm km s}^{-1}] \lesssim 3300$ (in the observer frame). We also find that Fe Ly$\alpha$ emission is redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\sim 890$ km s$^{-1}$, substantially larger than the radial velocity of the local interstellar medium surrounding N132D. These results demonstrate that high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is capable of providing constraints on the evolutionary stage, geometry, and velocity distribution of SNRs.

          On the origin of the $10^7$ K hot emitting gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of the $\approx 10^6$ K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at `super-virial' temperatures of $\approx 10^7$ K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the `virial' and the `super-virial' temperature gas as observed in \emph{emission} occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the Milky Way. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the $\approx 10^7$ K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both super-virial and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.

          Can supernova from runaway stars mimic the signs of absorbing `super-virial' gas?

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\sim 20\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.7 \%$ and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.

 - **Abstract**
 Current observational evidence reveals that fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit bandwidths ranging from a few dozen MHz to several GHz. Traditional FRB searches primarily employ matched filter methods on time series collapsed across the entire observational bandwidth. However, with modern ultra-wideband receivers featuring GHz-scale observational bandwidths, this approach may overlook a significant number of events. We investigate the efficacy of sub-banded searches for FRBs, a technique seeking bursts within limited portions of the bandwidth. These searches aim to enhance the significance of FRB detections by mitigating the impact of noise outside the targeted frequency range, thereby improving signal-to-noise ratios. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations, for the $400$-MHz bandwidth Parkes 21-cm multi-beam (PMB) receiver system and the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver, simulating bursts down to frequency widths of about $100$\,MHz. Additionally, we performed a complete reprocessing of the high-latitude segment of the High Time Resolution Universe South survey (HTRU-S) of the Parkes-Murriyang telescope using sub-banded search techniques. Simulations reveal that a sub-banded search can enhance the burst search efficiency by $67_{-42}^{+133}$ % for the PMB system and $1433_{-126}^{+143}$ % for the UWL receiver. Furthermore, the reprocessing of HTRU led to the confident detection of eighteen new bursts, nearly tripling the count of FRBs found in this survey. These results underscore the importance of employing sub-banded search methodologies to effectively address the often modest spectral occupancy of these signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic demographics -- the statistical study of populations of astrophysical objects -- has long relied on *multivariate statistics*, providing methods for analyzing data comprising fixed-length vectors of properties of objects, as might be compiled in a tabular astronomical catalog (say, with sky coordinates, and brightness measurements in a fixed number of spectral passbands). But beginning with the emergence of automated digital sky surveys, ca. ~2000, astronomers began producing large collections of data with more complex structure: light curves (brightness time series) and spectra (brightness vs. wavelength). These comprise what statisticians call *functional data* -- measurements of populations of functions. Upcoming automated sky surveys will soon provide astronomers with a flood of functional data. New methods are needed to accurately and optimally analyze large ensembles of light curves and spectra, accumulating information both along and across measured functions. Functional data analysis (FDA) provides tools for statistical modeling of functional data. Astronomical data presents several challenges for FDA methodology, e.g., sparse, irregular, and asynchronous sampling, and heteroscedastic measurement error. Bayesian FDA uses hierarchical Bayesian models for function populations, and is well suited to addressing these challenges. We provide an overview of astronomical functional data, and of some key Bayesian FDA modeling approaches, including functional mixed effects models, and stochastic process models. We briefly describe a Bayesian FDA framework combining FDA and machine learning methods to build low-dimensional parametric models for galaxy spectra.
