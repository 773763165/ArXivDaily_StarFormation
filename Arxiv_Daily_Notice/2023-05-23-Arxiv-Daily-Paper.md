 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift quasars ($z\gtrsim6$), powered by black holes (BHs) with large inferred masses, imply rapid BH growth in the early Universe. The most extreme examples have inferred masses of $\sim \! 10^9\,$M$_\odot$ at $z = 7.5$ and $\sim \! 10^{10}\,$M$_\odot$ at $z = 6.3$. Such dramatic growth via gas accretion likely leads to significant energy input into the quasar host galaxy and its surroundings, however few theoretical predictions of the impact of such objects currently exist. We present zoom-in simulations of a massive high-redshift protocluster, with our fiducial FABLE model incapable of reproducing the brightest quasars. With modifications to this model to promote early BH growth, such as earlier seeding and mildly super-Eddington accretion, such `gargantuan' BHs can be formed. With this new model, simulated host dust masses and star formation rates are in good agreement with existing JWST and ALMA data from ultraluminous quasars. We find the quasar is often obscured as it grows, and that strong, ejective feedback is required to have a high probability of detecting the quasar in the rest-frame UV. Fast and energetic quasar-driven winds expel metal-enriched gas, leading to significant metal pollution of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) out to twice the virial radius. As central gas densities and pressures are reduced, we find weaker signals from the CGM in mock X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich maps, whose detection - with proposed instruments such as Lynx, and even potentially presently with ALMA - can constrain quasar feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 The detections of four apparently young radio pulsars in the Milky Way globular clusters are difficult to reconcile with standard neutron star formation scenarios associated with massive star evolution. Here we discuss formation of these young pulsars through white dwarf mergers in dynamically-old clusters that have undergone core collapse. Based on observed properties of magnetic white dwarfs, we argue neutron stars formed via white dwarf merger are born with spin periods of roughly $10-100\,$ms and magnetic fields of roughly $10^{11}-10^{13}\,$G. As these neutron stars spin down via magnetic dipole radiation, they naturally reproduce the four observed young pulsars in the Milky Way clusters. Rates inferred from $N$-body cluster simulations as well as the binarity, host cluster properties, and cluster offsets observed for these young pulsars hint further at a white dwarf merger origin. These young pulsars may be descendants of neutron stars capable of powering fast radio bursts analogous to the bursts observed recently in a globular cluster in M81.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic science encompasses a wide range of subjects in the study of the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, from Young Stellar Objects to X-ray Binaries. Mapping these populations, and exploring transient phenomena within them, are among the primary science goals of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). While early versions of the survey strategy dedicated relatively few visits to the Galactic Plane region, more recent strategies under consideration envision higher cadence within selected regions of high scientific interest. The range of galactic science presents a challenge in evaluating which strategies deliver the highest scientific returns. Here we present metrics designed to evaluate Rubin survey strategy simulations based on the cadence of observations they deliver within regions of interest to different topics in galactic science, using variability categories defined by timescale. We also compare the fractions of exposures obtained in each filter with those recommended for the different science goals. We find that the baseline_v2.x simulations deliver observations of the high-priority regions at sufficiently high cadence to reliably detect variability on timescales >10 d or more. Follow-up observations may be necessary to properly characterize variability, especially transients, on shorter timescales. Combining the regions of interest for all the science cases considered, we identify those areas of the Galactic Plane and Magellanic Clouds of highest priority. We recommend that these refined survey footprints be used in future simulations to explore rolling cadence scenarios, and to optimize the sequence of observations in different bandpasses.
#### Estimating Ejecta Masses of Stripped Envelope Supernovae Using Late-Time  Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) are a subclass of core-collapse supernovae that are deficient in hydrogen (SN~IIb, SN~Ib) and possibly helium (SN~Ic) in their spectra. Their progenitors are likely stripped of this material through a combination of stellar winds and interactions with a close binary companion, but the exact ejecta mass ranges covered by each subtype and how it relates to the zero-age main-sequence progenitor mass is still unclear. Using a combination of semi-analytic modeling and numerical simulations, we discuss how the properties of SESN progenitors can be constrained through different phases of the bolometric light curve. We find that the light curve rise time is strongly impacted by the strength of radioactive nickel mixing and treatment of helium recombination. These can vary between events and are often not accounted for in simpler modeling approaches, leading to large uncertainties in ejecta masses inferred from the rise. Motivated by this, we focus on the late time slope, which is determined by gamma-ray leakage. We calibrate the relationship between ejecta mass, explosion energy, and gamma-ray escape time $T_0$ using a suite of numerical models. Application of the fitting function we provide to bolometric light curves of SESNe should result in ejecta masses with approximately 20\% uncertainty. With large samples of SESNe coming from current and upcoming surveys, our methods can be utilized to better understand the diversity and origin of the progenitor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion of black holes at near-Eddington or super-Eddington rates is the most powerful episode that drives black hole growth, and it may work in several types of objects. However, the physics of accretion and jet-disc coupling in such a state remains unclear, mainly because the associated jets are not easily detectable due to the extremely weak emission or possibly episodic nature of the jets. Only a few near/super-Eddington systems have demonstrated radio activity, and it remains unclear whether there is a jet and what are their properties, in super-Eddington active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (and ultraluminous X-ray sources). The deficit is mainly due to the complex radio mixing between the origins of jets and others, such as star formation activity, photo-ionized gas, accretion disk wind, and coronal activity. In this work, we conducted high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to explore the jets in the highly accreting narrow-line Seyfert I system IZw1. Our observations successfully revealed small-scale jets (with a linear size of $\sim45$ parsec) at both 1.5 and 5 GHz, based on the high radio brightness temperature, radio morphology, and spectral index distribution. Interestingly, the lack of a flat-spectrum radio core and knotty jet structures imply episodic ejections in IZw1, which resemble the ejection process in Galactic X-ray binaries that are in the canonical very high state. The high accretion rates and jet properties in the AGN IZw1 may support the AGN/XRB analogy in the extreme state.
#### The core starbursts of the galaxy NGC 3628: Radio very long baseline  interferometry and X-ray studies

 - **Abstract**
 We present radio very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and X-ray studies of the starburst galaxy NGC 3628. The VLBI observation at 1.5 GHz reveals seven compact (0.7$-$7 parsec) radio sources in the central $\sim$250 parsec region of NGC 3628. Based on their morphology, high radio brightness temperatures ($10^5-10^7$ K), and steep radio spectra, none of these seven sources can be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGNs); instead, they can be identified as supernova remnants (SNRs), with three of them appearing consistent with partial shells. Notably, one of them (W2) is likely a nascent radio supernova and appears to be consistent with the star formation rate of NGC 3628 when assuming a canonical initial mass function. The VLBI observation provides the first precise measurement of the diameter of the radio sources in NGC 3628, which allow us to fit a well-constrained radio surface brightness - diameter ($\Sigma-D$) correlation by including the detected SNRs. Furthermore, future VLBI observations can be conducted to measure the expansion velocity of the detected SNRs. In addition to our radio VLBI study, we analyze Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra of NGC 3628. The spectral fitting indicates that the SNR activities could well account for the observed X-ray emissions. Along with the Chandra X-ray image, it further reveals that the X-ray emission is likely maintained by the galactic-scale outflow triggered by SN activities. These results provide strong evidence that SN-triggered activities play a critical role in generating both radio and X-ray emissions in NGC 3628 and further suggest that the galaxy NGC 3628 is in an early stage of starbursts.
#### High-resolution APEX/LAsMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3-2) observation of  the G333 giant molecular cloud complex : I. Evidence for gravitational  acceleration in hub-filament systems

 - **Abstract**
 Hub-filament systems are suggested to be the birth cradles of high-mass stars and clusters. We apply the FILFINDER algorithm to the integrated intensity maps of the 13CO (3-2) line to identify filaments in the G333 complex, and extract the velocity and intensity along the filament skeleton from moment maps. Clear velocity and density fluctuations are seen along the filaments, allowing us to fit velocity gradients around the intensity peaks. The velocity gradients fitted to the LAsMA data and ALMA data agree with each other over the scales covered by ALMA observations in the ATOMS survey. Changes of velocity gradient with scale indicate a ''funnel'' structure of the velocity field in PPV space, indicative of a smooth, continuously increasing velocity gradient from large to small scales, and thus consistent with gravitational acceleration. The typical velocity gradient corresponding to a 1 pc scale is ~1.6km/s/pc. Assuming free-fall, we estimate a kinematic mass within 1 pc of ~1190 M$_\odot$, which is consistent with typical masses of clumps in the ATLASGAL survey. We find direct evidence for gravitational acceleration from comparison of the observed accelerations to those predicted by free-fall onto dense hubs. On large scales, we find that the inflow may be driven by the larger scale structure, consistent with hierarchical structure in the molecular cloud and gas inflow from large to small scales. The hub-filament structures at different scales may be organized into a hierarchical system extending up to the largest scales probed, through the coupling of gravitational centers at different scales. We argue that the ''funnel'' structure in PPV space can be an effective probe for the gravitational collapse motions in molecular clouds. The large scale gas inflow is driven by gravity, implying that the molecular clouds in G333 complex may be in the state of global gravitational collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The photoionization model of narrow-line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been investigated for decades. Many published models are restricted to simple linear scaling abundance relations, dust-free assumption, uniform AGN radiation field, and using one specific photoionization code, which restricts them from providing a satisfactory prediction on a broad range of AGN observations. Through a comprehensive investigation, here we present how the choice of abundance scaling relations, dust inclusion, AGN radiation fields, and different photoionization codes CLOUDY and MAPPINGS affect the predictions on the strength of strong UV, optical, and infrared emission lines. We find the dust-depleted radiation pressure-dominated AGN model built with the latest non-linear abundance sets and photoionization code MAPPINGS V are consistent with AGN observations across a broad range of wavelengths. We also assess new potential HII-AGN separation diagrams in the optical and UV wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of nearby globular clusters have discovered excess dark mass in their cores, apparently in an extended distribution, and simulations indicate that this mass is composed mostly of white dwarfs (respectively stellar-mass black holes) in clusters that are core-collapsed (respectively with a flatter core). We perform mass-anisotropy modelling of the closest globular cluster, M4, with intermediate slope for the inner stellar density. We use proper-motion data from Gaia EDR3 and from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. We extract the mass profile employing Bayesian Jeans modelling, and check our fits with realistic mock data. Our analyses return isotropic motions in the cluster core and tangential motions ($\beta\approx -0.4$$\pm$$0.1$) in the outskirts. We also robustly measure a dark central mass of roughly $800\pm300 \,$M$_{\odot}$, but it is not possible to distinguish between a point-like source, such as an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), or a dark population of stellar remnants of extent $\approx 0.016\,\rm pc \simeq 3300\,AU$. However, when removing a high-velocity star from the cluster centre, the same mass excess is found, but more extended ($\sim 0.034\, \rm{pc} \approx 7000\,\rm AU$). We use Monte Carlo $N$-body models of M4 to interpret the second outcome, and find that our excess mass is not sufficiently extended to be confidently associated with a dark population of remnants. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of these two scenarios (i.e., IMBH vs. remnants), and propose new observations that could help to better grasp the complex dynamics in M4's core.
#### Halo formation and evolution in SFDM and CDM: new insights from the  fluid approach

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We present simulations of halo formation and evolution in scalar field dark matter (SFDM) cosmologies in the Thomas-Fermi regime, aka ``SFDM-TF", where a strong repulsive 2-particle self-interaction (SI) is included, being a valuable alternative to CDM, with the potential to resolve its ``cusp-core" problem. In general, SFDM behaves like a quantum fluid. Previous literature has presented two fluid approximations for SFDM-TF, as well as simulations of halo formation. These results confirmed earlier expectations and are generally in mutual agreement, but discrepancies were also reported. Therefore, we perform dedicated 3D cosmological simulations for the SFDM-TF model, applying both fluid approximations, as well as for CDM. Our results are very well in accordance with previous works and extend upon them, in that we can explain the reported discrepancies as a result of different simulation setups. We find some interesting details: The evolution of both SFDM-TF and CDM halos follows a 2-stage process. In the early stage, the density profile in the center becomes close to a $(n=1.5)$-polytropic core, dominated by an "effective" velocity-dispersion pressure $P_{\sigma}$ which is common to both dark matter models. Consecutively, for CDM halos, the core transitions into a central cusp. In SFDM-TF halos, the additional pressure $P_\text{SI}$ due to SI determines the second stage of the evolution, where the central region follows closely a $(n=1)$-polytropic core, embedded in a nearly isothermal envelope, i.e. the outskirts are similar to CDM. We also encounter a new effect, namely a late-time expansion of both polytropic core plus envelope, because the size of the almost isothermal halo envelope is affected by the expansion of the background universe. So, an initial primordial core of $\sim 100$ pc can evolve into a larger core of $\gtrsim 1$ kpc, even without feedback from baryons.
#### High Sensitivity Observations of the Water Megamasers of NGC 1068:  Precise Astrometry and Detailed Kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 We present High Sensitivity Array observation of the water megamasers of NGC 1068. We obtain absolute astrometry with 0.3 mas precision that confirms the association of the disk masers with the nuclear radio continuum source S1. The new observations reveal two new blueshifted groups of disk masers. We also detect the 22 GHz continuum on short interferometric baselines. The position-velocity diagram of the disk masers shows a curve consistent with a nonaxisymmetric distribution of maser spots. The curve is probably the result of spiral arms with a constant pitch angle of roughly 5 degrees. The disk kinematics are consistent with Keplerian rotation and low turbulent speeds. The inferred central mass is 17 million solar masses. On the basis of disk stability arguments, the mass of the molecular disk is roughly 110 thousand solar masses. The disk masers further resolve into filamentary structures suggesting an ordered magnetic field threading the maser disk. The magnetic field strengths must be greater than 1.6 mG to withstand turbulent motions in the partially ionized molecular gas. We note apparent asymmetries in the molecular disk that might be explained by anisotropic heating by a misaligned inner accretion disk. The new observations also detect the fainter jet masers north of the disk masers. The distribution and kinematics of the jet masers are consistent with an expanding ring of molecular gas.
#### Density biases and temperature relations for DESIRED HII regions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first study based on the analysis of the DEep Spectra of Ionized REgions Database (DESIRED). This is a compilation of 190 high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra of HII regions and other photoionized nebulae, mostly observed with 8-10m telescopes and containing $\sim$29380 emission lines. We find that the electron density --$n_{\rm e}$-- of the objects is underestimated when [SII] $\lambda6731/\lambda6716$ and/or [OII] $\lambda3726/\lambda3729$ are the only density indicators available. This is produced by the non-linear density dependence of the indicators in the presence of density inhomogeneities. The average underestimate is $\sim 300$ cm$^{-3}$ in extragalactic HII regions, introducing systematic overestimates of $T_{\rm e}$([OII]) and $T_{\rm e}$([SII]) compared to $T_{\rm e}$([NII]). The high-sensitivity of [OII] $\lambda\lambda7319+20+30+31/\lambda\lambda3726+29$ and [SII] $\lambda\lambda4069+76/\lambda\lambda6716+31$ to density makes them more suitable for the diagnosis of the presence of high-density clumps. If $T_{\rm e}$([NII]) is adopted, the density underestimate has a small impact in the ionic abundances derived from optical spectra, being limited to up to $\sim$0.1 dex when auroral [SII] and/or [OII] lines are used. However, these density effects are critical for the analysis of infrared fine structure lines, such as those observed by the JWST in local star forming regions, implying strong underestimates of the ionic abundances. We present temperature relations between $T_{\rm e}$([OIII]), $T_{\rm e}$([ArIII]), $T_{\rm e}$([SIII]) and $T_{\rm e}$([NII]) for the extragalactic HII regions. We confirm a non-linear dependence between $T_{\rm e}$([OIII])-$T_{\rm e}$([NII]) due to a more rapid increase of $T_{\rm e}$([OIII]) at lower metallicities.
#### A panoptic view of the Taurus molecular cloud I. The cloud dynamics  revealed by gas emission and 3D dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of interstellar dust derived from stellar extinction observations toward the Taurus molecular cloud (MC) and its relation with the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission at 21 cm wavelength and the carbon monoxide $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission in the $J=1\rightarrow0$ transition. We used the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) method to match the morphology in a 3D reconstruction of the dust density (3D dust) and the distribution of the gas tracers' emission. The result of the HOG analysis is a map of the relationship between the distances and radial velocities. The HOG comparison between the 3D dust and the HI emission indicates a morphological match at the distance of Taurus but an anti-correlation between the dust density and the HI emission, which uncovers a significant amount of cold HI within the Taurus MC. The HOG between the 3D dust and $^{12}$CO reveals a pattern in radial velocities and distances that is consistent with converging motions of the gas in the Taurus MC, with the near side of the cloud moving at higher velocities and the far side moving at lower velocities. This convergence of flows is likely triggered by the large-scale gas compression caused by the interaction of the Local Bubble and the Per-Tau shell, with Taurus lying at the intersection of the two bubble surfaces.
#### Winking filaments due to cyclic evaporation-condensation

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have shown that some filaments appear and disappear in the H$\alpha$ line wing images periodically. There have been no attempts to model these "winking filaments" thus far. The evaporation--condensation mechanism is widely used to explain the formation of solar filaments. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, how multi-dimensional evaporation--condensation in an arcade setup invariably causes a stretching of the magnetic topology. We aim to check whether this magnetic stretching during cyclic evaporation--condensation could reproduce a winking filament. We used our open-source code MPI-AMRVAC to carry out 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations based on a quadrupolar configuration. A periodic localized heating, which modulates the evaporation--condensation process, was imposed before, during, and after the formation of the filament. Synthetic H$\alpha$ and 304 \r{A}, images were produced to compare the results with observations. For the first time, we noticed the winking filament phenomenon in a simulation of the formation of on-disk solar filaments, which was in good agreement with observations. Typically, the period of the winking is different from the period of the impulsive heating. A forced oscillator model explains this difference and fits the results well. A parameter survey is also done to look into details of the magnetic stretching phenomenon. We found that the stronger the heating or the higher the layer where the heating occurs, the more significant the winking effect appears.
#### Using Giant Pulses to Measure the Impulse Response of the Interstellar  Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Giant pulses emitted by PSR B1937+21 are bright, intrinsically impulsive bursts. Thus, the observed signal from a giant pulse is a noisy but direct measurement of the impulse response from the ionized interstellar medium. We use this fact to detect 13,025 giant pulses directly in the baseband data of two observations of PSR B1937+21. Using the giant pulse signals, we model the time-varying impulse response with a sparse approximation method, in which the time dependence at each delay is decomposed in Fourier components, thus constructing a wavefield as a function of delay and differential Doppler shift. We find that the resulting wavefield has the expected parabolic shape, with several diffuse structures within it, suggesting the presence of multiple scattering locations along the line of sight. We also detect an echo at a delay of about 2.4 ms, over 1.5 times the rotation period of the pulsar, which between the two observations moves along the trajectory expected from geometry. The structures in the wavefield are insufficiently sparse to produce a complete model of the system, and hence the model is not predictive across gaps larger than about the scintillation time. Nevertheless, within its range, it reproduces about 75% of the power of the impulse response, a fraction limited mostly by the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations. Furthermore, we show that by deconvolution, using the model impulse response, we can successfully recover the intrinsic pulsar emission from the observed signal.
