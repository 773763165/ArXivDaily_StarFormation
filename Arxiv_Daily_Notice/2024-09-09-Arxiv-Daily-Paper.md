 - **Abstract**
 Integrated optics are used to achieve astronomical interferometry inside robust and compact materials, improving the instruments stability and sensitivity. In order to perform differential phase measurements at the H$\alpha$ line (656.3 nm) with the 600-800 nm spectro-interferometer FIRST, a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) is being developed. This PIC performs the visible combination of the beams coming from the telescope pupil sub-apertures. In this work, TEEM Photonics waveguides fabricated by $K_+:Na_+$ ion exchange in glass are characterized in terms of single-mode range and mode field diameter. The waveguide diffused index profile is modeled on Beamprop software. FIRST beam combiner building blocks are simulated, especially achromatic directional couplers and passive $\pi/2$ phase shifters for a potential ABCD interferometric combination.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main endeavors of the field of exoplanetary sciences is the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres on a population level. The current method of choice to accomplish this task is transmission spectroscopy, where the apparent radius of a transiting exoplanet is measured at multiple wavelengths in search of atomic and molecular absorption features produced by the upper atmosphere constituents. To extract the planetary radius from a transit light curve, it is necessary to account for the decrease in luminosity away from the center of the projected stellar disk, known as the limb darkening. Physically-motivated parametrizations of the limb darkening, in particular of the quadratic form, are commonly used in exoplanet transit light-curve fitting. Here, we show that such parametrizations can introduce significant wavelength-dependent biases in the transmission spectra currently obtained with all instrument modes of the JWST, and thus have the potential to affect atmospheric inferences. To avoid such biases, we recommend the use of standard limb-darkening parametrizations with wide uninformative priors that allow for non-physical stellar intensity profiles in the transit fits, and thus for a complete and symmetrical exploration of the parameter space. We further find that fitting the light curves at the native resolution results in errors on the measured transit depths that are significantly smaller compared to light curves that are binned in wavelength before fitting, thus potentially maximizing the amount of information that can be extracted from the data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has enabled the discovery of numerous tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), which are pulsating stars in close binaries where the presence of a tidal bulge has the effect of tilting the primary star's pulsation axes into the orbital plane. Recently, the modeling framework developed to analyze TTPs has been applied to the emerging class of tri-axial pulsators, which exhibit nonradial pulsations about three perpendicular axes. In this work, we report on the identification of the second-ever discovered tri-axial pulsator, with sixteen robustly-detected pulsation multiplets, of which fourteen are dipole doublets separated by 2$\nu_{\rm orb}$. We jointly fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) and TESS light curve of the star, and find that the primary is slightly evolved off the zero-age main sequence, while the less massive secondary still lies on the zero-age main sequence. Of the fourteen doublets, we associate eight with $Y_{10x}$ modes and six with novel $Y_{10y}$ modes. We exclude the existence of $Y_{11x}$ modes in this star and show that the observed pulsation modes must be $Y_{10y}$. We also present a toy model for the tri-axial pulsation framework in the context of this star. The techniques presented here can be utilized to rapidly analyze and confirm future tri-axial pulsator candidates.

          TriPoD: Tri-Population size distributions for Dust evolution. Coagulation in vertically integrated hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Dust coagulation and fragmentation impact the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks and set the initial conditions for planet formation. Dust grains dominate the opacities, they determine the cooling times of the gas, they influence the ionization state of the gas, and the grain surface area is an important parameter for the chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, dust evolution should not be ignored in numerical studies of protoplanetary disks. Available dust coagulation models are, however, too computationally expensive to be implemented in large-scale hydrodynamic simulations. This limits detailed numerical studies of protoplanetary disks, including these effects, mostly to one-dimensional models. Aims. We aim to develop a simple - yet accurate - dust coagulation model that can be implemented in hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks. Our model shall not significantly increase the computational cost of simulations and provide information about the local grain size distribution. Methods. The local dust size distributions are assumed to be truncated power laws. Such distributions can be characterized by two dust fluids (large and small grains) and a maximum particle size, truncating the power law. We compare our model to state-of-the-art dust coagulation simulations and calibrate it to achieve a good fit with these sophisticated numerical methods. Results. Running various parameter studies, we achieved a good fit between our simplified three-parameter model and DustPy, a state-of-the-art dust coagulation software. Conclusions. We present TriPoD, a sub-grid dust coagulation model for the PLUTO code. With TriPoD, we can perform two-dimensional, vertically integrated dust coagulation simulations on top of a hydrodynamic simulation. Studying the dust distributions in two-dimensional vortices and planet-disk systems is thus made possible.

          Map-level baryonification: Efficient modelling of higher-order correlations in the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich fields

 - **Abstract**
 Semi-analytic methods can generate baryon-corrected fields from N-body simulations (``baryonification'') and are rapidly becoming a ubiquitous tool in modeling structure formation on non-linear scales. We extend this formalism to consistently model the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) fields directly on the full-sky, with an emphasis on higher-order correlations. We use the auto- and cross- $N$th-order moments, with $N \in \{2, 3, 4\}$, as a summary statistic of the lensing and tSZ fields, and show that our model can jointly fit these statistics measured in IllustrisTNG to within measurement uncertainties, for scales above $\gtrsim 1 {\rm Mpc}$ and across multiple redshifts. The model predictions change only minimally when including additional information from secondary halo properties, such as halo concentration and ellipticity. Each individual moment is dependent on halos of different mass ranges and has different sensitivities to the model parameters. A simulation-based forecast on the ULAGAM simulation suite shows that the combination of all moments, measured from current and upcoming lensing and tSZ surveys, can jointly constrain cosmology and baryons to high precision. The lensing and tSZ field are sensitive to different combinations of the baryonification parameters, with degeneracy directions that are often orthogonal, and the combination of the two fields leads to significantly better constraints on both cosmology and astrophysics. Our pipeline for map-level baryonification is publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The mid-infrared water vapor emission spectrum provides a novel way to characterize the delivery of icy pebbles towards the innermost ($<5$ au) regions of planet-forming disks. Recently, JWST MIRI-MRS showed that compact disks exhibit an excess of low-energy water vapor emission relative to extended multi-gapped disks, suggesting that icy pebble drift is more efficient in the former. We carry out detailed emission line modeling to retrieve the excitation conditions of rotational water vapor emission in a sample of four compact and three extended disks within the JDISC Survey. We present two-temperature H$_2$O slab model retrievals and, for the first time, constrain the spatial distribution of water vapor by fitting parametric radial temperature and column density profiles. Such models statistically outperform the two-temperature slab fits. We find a correlation between the observable hot water vapor mass and stellar mass accretion rate, as well as an anti-correlation between cold water vapor mass and sub-mm dust disk radius, confirming previously reported water line flux trends. We find that the mid-IR spectrum traces H$_2$O with temperatures down to 180-300 K, but the coldest 150-170 K gas remains undetected. Furthermore the H$_2$O temperature profiles are generally steeper and cooler than the expected `super-heated' dust temperature in passive irradiated disks. The column density profiles are used to estimate icy pebble mass fluxes, which suggest that compact and extended disks may produce markedly distinct inner-disk exoplanet populations if local feeding mechanisms dominate their assembly.

          McFine: python-based Monte-Carlo multi-component hyperfine structure fitting

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling complex line emission in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a degenerate, high-dimensional problem. Here, we present McFine, a tool for automated multi-component fitting of emission lines with complex hyperfine structure, in a fully automated way. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to efficiently explore the complex parameter space, allowing for characterising model denegeracies. This tool allows for both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and radiative-transfer (RT) models. McFine can fit individual spectra and data cubes, and for cubes encourage spatial coherence between neighbouring pixels. It is also built to fit the minimum number of distinct components, to avoid overfitting. We have carried out tests on synthetic spectra, where in around 90~per~cent of cases it fits the correct number of components, otherwise slightly fewer components. Typically, $T_{\rm ex}$ is overestimated and $\tau$ underestimated, but accurate within the estimated uncertainties. The velocity and line widths are recovered with extremely high accuracy, however. We verify McFine by applying to a large Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) N$_2$H$^+$ mosaic of an high-mass star forming region, G316.75-00.00. We find a similar quality of fit to our synthetic tests, aside from in the active regions forming O-stars, where the assumptions of Gaussian line profiles or LTE may break down. To show the general applicability of this code, we fit CO(J = 2-1) observations of NGC 3627, a nearby star-forming galaxy, again obtaining excellent fit quality. McFine provides a fully automated way to analyse rich datasets from interferometric observations, is open source, and pip-installable.

          STAR NRE: Solving supernova selection effects with set-based truncated auto-regressive neural ratio estimation

 - **Abstract**
 Accounting for selection effects in supernova type Ia (SN Ia) cosmology is crucial for unbiased cosmological parameter inference -- even more so for the next generation of large, mostly photometric-only surveys. The conventional "bias correction" procedure has a built-in systematic bias towards the fiducial model used to derive it and fails to account for the additional Eddington bias that arises in the presence of significant redshift uncertainty. On the other hand, Bayesian hierarchical models scale poorly with the data set size and require explicit assumptions for the selection function that may be inaccurate or contrived. To address these limitations, we introduce STAR NRE, a simulation-based approach that makes use of a conditioned deep set neural network and combines efficient high-dimensional global inference with subsampling-based truncation in order to scale to very large survey sizes while training on sets with varying cardinality. Applying it to a simplified SN Ia model consisting of standardised brightnesses and redshifts with Gaussian uncertainties and a selection procedure based on the expected LSST sensitivity, we demonstrate precise and unbiased inference of cosmological parameters and the redshift evolution of the volumetric SN Ia rate from ~100 000 mock SNae Ia. Our inference procedure can incorporate arbitrarily complex selection criteria, including transient classification, in the forward simulator and be applied to complex data like light curves. We outline these and other steps aimed at integrating STAR NRE into an end-to-end simulation-based pipeline for the analysis of future photometric-only SN Ia data.

          Searching for Additional Planets in TESS Multi-Planet Systems: Testing Empirical Models Based on Kepler Data

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-planet system architectures are frequently used to constrain possible formation and evolutionary pathways of observed exoplanets. Therefore, understanding the predictive and descriptive power of empirical models of these systems is critical to understanding their formation histories. Additionally, if empirical models can reproduce architectures over a range of scales, transit and radial velocity observations can be more easily and effectively used to inform future microlensing, astrometric, and direct imaging surveys. We analyze 52 TESS multi-planet systems previously studied using Dynamite (Dietrich & Apai 2020), who used TESS data alongside empirical models based on Kepler planets to predict additional planets in each system. We analyze additional TESS data to search for these predicted planets. We thereby evaluate the degree to which these models can be used to predict planets in TESS multi-planet systems. Specifically, we study whether a period ratio method or clustered period model is more predictive. We find that the period ratio model predictions are most consistent with the planets discovered since 2020, accounting for detection sensitivity. However, neither model is highly predictive, highlighting the need for additional data and nuanced models to describe the full population. Improved eccentricity and dynamical stability prescriptions incorporated into Dynamite provide a modest improvement in the prediction accuracy. We also find that the current sample of 183 TESS multi-planet systems are are highly dynamically packed, and appear truncated relative to detection biases. These attributes are consistent with the Kepler sample, and suggest a highly efficient formation process.

          Progress towards an array-wide diffuse UHE neutrino search with the Askaryan Radio Array

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino experiment at the South Pole. ARA aims to detect the radio emissions from neutrino-induced particle showers using in-ice clusters of antennas buried ${\sim}200$ m deep on a roughly cubical lattice with side length of ${\sim}10$ m. ARA has five such independent stations which have collectively accumulated ${\sim}30$ station-years of livetime through 2023. The fifth station of ARA has an additional sub-detector, known as the phased array, which pioneered an interferometric trigger constructed by beamforming the signals of $7$ tightly packed, vertically-polarized antennas. This scheme has been demonstrated to significantly improve the trigger efficiency for low SNR signals. In this talk, we will present the current state of the first array-wide diffuse neutrino search using $24$ station-years of data (through 2021). We anticipate that this analysis will result in the first UHE neutrino observation or world-leading limits from a radio neutrino detector below $100$ EeV. Additionally, this analysis will demonstrate the feasibility for multi-station in-ice radio arrays to successfully conduct an array-wide neutrino search -- paving the way for future, large detector arrays such as RNO-G and IceCube-Gen2 Radio.

          H I Kinematics and the E(B-V)/N(H I) ratio

 - **Abstract**
 The $\lambda 21$cm H I emission that is used to trace the gas to dust ratio at high Galactic latitudes has contributions from material beyond the Milky Way disk, with uncertain and likely sub-Solar metallicity and dust content. These contributions can be isolated kinematically and their presence is clear for sightlines with small mean reddening $<$E(B-V)$>$ $\la$ 0.03 mag, which have mean ratios $<$N(H I)$>$/$<$E(B-V)$>$ that are 20-50\% above the high latitude Galactic average $<$N(H I)$>/<$E(B-V)$>=8.3\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$. By mapping N(H I) and E(B-V) across H I High Velocity Cloud complexes and the Magellanic Clouds we show that the reddening of this kinematically-isolated gas is on average five times smaller per H I than the high latitude average. However, the aggregate contribution of this gas is small and $<$N(H I)$>/<$E(B-V)$>=8.3\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$ is the appropriate value for Galactic gas seen at high latitude using the H I and reddening measures employed here and in our previous work.

          Measuring the $\mathrm{^{34}S}$ and $\mathrm{^{33}S}$ isotopic ratios of volatile sulfur during planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 Stable isotopic ratios constitute powerful tools for unraveling the thermal and irradiation history of volatiles. In particular, we can use our knowledge of the isotopic fractionation processes active during the various stages of star, disk and planet formation to infer the origins of different volatiles with measured isotopic patterns in our own solar system. Observations of planet-forming disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) now readily detect the heavier isotopologues of C, O and N, while the isotopologue abundances and isotopic fractionation mechanisms of sulfur species are less well understood. Using ALMA observations of the SO and SO2 isotopologues in the nearby, molecule-rich disk around the young star Oph-IRS 48 we present the first constraints on the combined 32S/34S and 32S/33S isotope ratios in a planet-forming disk. Given that these isotopologues likely originate in relatively warm gas (>50 K), like most other Oph-IRS 48 volatiles, SO is depleted in heavy sulfur while SO2 is enriched compared to solar system values. However, we cannot completely rule out a cooler gas reservoir, which would put the SO sulfur ratios more in line with comets and other solar system bodies. We also constrain the S18O/SO ratio and find the limit to be consistent with solar system values given a temperature of 60 K. Together these observations show that we should not assume solar isotopic values for disk sulfur reservoirs, but additional observations are needed to determine the chemical origin of the abundant SO in this disk, inform on what isotopic fractionation mechanism(s) are at play, and aid in unravelling the history of the sulfur budget during the different stages of planet formation.

          On the virialization threshold for halo mass functions

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent study by Euclid collaboration, the halo mass function (HMF) has been fitted with accuracy better than $1\%$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several parameters were introduced and fitted against N-body simulations, assuming the usual linearly extrapolated matter density contrast at the collapse time, $\delta_c$, as a basic threshold for halo formation. As a result, a new function that multiplies $\delta_c$ was introduced, producing an effective threshold that varies both with redshift and mass scale. We show that the redshift evolution of this effective threshold is similar to the one of the linear extrapolated matter density contrast at the virialization time, $\delta_{\rm v}$. Assuming the Euclid HMF as a fiducial model, we refit the Sheth-Tormen (ST) HMF using $\delta_{\rm v}$ as a threshold. This new fit improves the agreement between ST-HMF and the Euclid one with respect to Despali et al. (2016) fit, specially at high masses. Interestingly, the parameters $a$ and $p$ in this refit have values closer to the Press-Schechter limit of the ST-HMF, showing that the use of $\delta_{\rm v}$ can provide semi-analytical HMF less dependent on extra parameters. Moreover, we analyze the consistency of the ST-HMF fitted with $\delta_{\rm v}$ in smooth dark energy models with time-varying equation of state, finding an overall good agreement with the evolution of halo abundances expected from the linear evolution of perturbations and the Euclid HMF extrapolated to these scenarios. These findings suggest that the use $\delta_{\rm v}$ as a basic function to describe the threshold for halo formation can be a good guide when considering extrapolations for models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, which are typically harder to study in simulations.

          An analysis of spectroscopic, seismological, astrometric, and photometric masses of pulsating white dwarf stars

 - **Abstract**
 A central challenge in the field of stellar astrophysics lies in accurately determining the mass of isolated stars. However, for pulsating white dwarf (WD) stars, the task becomes more tractable due to the availability of multiple approaches such as spectroscopy, asteroseismology, astrometry, and photometry. The objective of this work is to compare the asteroseismological and spectroscopic mass values of WDs in detail and, in turn, to compare them with the masses derived using astrometric parallaxes/distances and photometry. Our analysis encompasses a selection of pulsating WDs with different surface chemical abundances that define the main classes of variable WDs. We calculated their spectroscopic masses, compiled seismological masses, and determined astrometric masses. We also derived photometric masses, when possible. Subsequently, we compared all the sets of stellar masses obtained through these different methods. To ensure consistency and robustness in our comparisons, we used identical WD models and evolutionary tracks across all four methods. The analysis suggests a general consensus among the these methods regarding the masses of pulsating WD with H-rich atmospheres, known as DAV or ZZ Ceti stars, especially for objects with masses below approximately $0.75 M_{\sun}$, although notable disparities emerge for certain massive stars. For pulsating WD stars with He-rich atmospheres, called DBV or V777 Her stars, we find that astrometric masses generally exceed seismological, spectroscopic, and photometric masses. Finally, while there is agreement among the sets of stellar masses for pulsating WDs with C-, O-, and He-rich atmospheres (designated as GW Vir stars), outliers exist where mass determinations by various methods show significant discrepancies.

          Feasibility of keeping Mars warm with nanoparticles

 - **Abstract**
 One-third of Mars' surface has shallow-buried H$_2$O, but it is currently too cold for use by life. Proposals to warm Mars using greenhouse gases require a large mass of ingredients that are rare on Mars' surface. However, we show here that artificial aerosols made from materials that are readily available at Mars-for example, conductive nanorods that are ~9 $\mu$m long-could warm Mars >5 $\times$ 10$^3$ times more effectively than the best gases. Such nanoparticles forward-scatter sunlight and efficiently block upwelling thermal infrared. Similar to the natural dust of Mars, they are swept high into Mars' atmosphere, allowing delivery from the near-surface. For a particle lifetime of 10 years, two climate models indicate that sustained release at 30 liters/sec would globally warm Mars by $\gtrsim$30 K and start to melt the ice. Therefore, if nanoparticles can be made at scale on (or delivered to) Mars, then the barrier to warming of Mars appears to not be as high as previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 The best molecular line lists for astrophysical applications today require both high accuracy of line positions for strong lines as well as high overall completeness. The former is required to enable, for example, molecular detection in high-resolution cross-correlation observations of exoplanets, while completeness is required for accurate spectroscopic and radiative properties over broad temperature and spectral ranges. The use of empirical energies generated with the Marvel procedure is a standard way to improve accuracy; here we explore methods of extending the use of these levels using predicted shifts and isotopologue extrapolation, as well augmenting the levels from other sources such as effective Hamiltonian studies. These methods are used to update ExoMol line lists for the main 24Mg16O and 48Ti16O isotopologues, as well as for 24Mg17O, 24Mg18O, 25Mg16O, 26Mg16O, 46Ti16O, 47Ti16O, 49Ti16O and 50Ti16O; new Marvel results for 51V16O are also presented

 - **Abstract**
 We put forward a primordial scenario to alleviate cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension. Based on flat $\Lambda$CDM, the Bounce-Inflation (BI) scenario gives the results that $ H_0 = 68.60^{+0.40}_{-0.45} \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.806 \pm 0.011 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 68.96 \pm 0.38 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.797\pm 0.010 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets. These reduce the cosmological tensions slightly. We also take an extended $\Lambda$CDM model into account, $\Lambda$CDM (BI)+$A_L$, where $ A_L $ is the gravitational lensing amplitude. The results are $ H_0 = 69.38 \pm 0.49 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.014 $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 69.49 \pm 0.45 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.771^{+0.013}_{-0.012} $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets, which reduce the Hubble tension to $\sim 3\sigma $ level and show no $S_8 $ tension. The $A_L \approx 1.1$ is smaller than the result of the inflation scenario with a constraint of \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets. Besides, the spectral index of the bounce-inflation scenario $ n_s $ is about $ 0.98 $, with a trend to the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 In the single-field model, the preheating process occurs through self-resonance of inflaton field. We study the nonlinear structures generated during preheating in the $\alpha$-attractor models and monodromy models. The potentials have a power law form $\propto\left|\phi\right|^{2n}$ near the origin and a flat region away from bottom, which are consistent with current cosmological observations. The Floquet analysis shows that potential parameters in monodromy model have a significant influence on the region of resonance bands. The analytical oscillons solution for the $\alpha$-attractor T model with parameter $n=1$ is derived using the small amplitude analysis method. Besides we investigate the formation of nonlinear structures, the equation of state and the energy transfer through the (3+1) dimensional lattice simulation. We find that the symmetric T potential and the asymmetric E potential in the $\alpha$-attractor models have similar nonlinear dynamics. And the potential parameter $n$ in monodromy model significantly influences the lifetime of transients, whereas the parameter $q$ exerts minimal impact on the nonlinear dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The threat posed to humanity by global warming has led scientists to question the nature of their activities and the need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from research. Until now, most studies have aimed at quantifying the carbon footprints and relatively less works have addressed the ways GHG emissions can be significantly reduced. A factor two reduction by 2030 implies to think beyond increases in the efficacy of current processes, which will have a limited effect, and beyond wishful thinking about large new sources of energy. Hence, choices among research questions or allocated means within a given field will be needed. They can be made in light of the perceived societal utility of research activities. Here, we addressed the question of how scientists perceive the impact of GHG reduction on their discipline and a possible trade-off between the societal utility of their discipline and an acceptable level of GHG emissions. We conducted 28 semi-directive interviews of French astrophysicists from different laboratories. Our most important findings are that, for most researchers, astronomy is considered to have a positive societal impact mainly regarding education but also because of the fascination it exerts on at least a fraction of the general public. Technological applications are also mentioned but with relatively less emphasis. The reduction of GHG emissions is believed to be necessary and most often reductions within the private-sphere have been achieved. However, the question of community-wide reductions in astrophysics research, and in particular the possible reductions of large facilities reveals much more contrasted opinions.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube remains largely unknown. Several individual neutrino source candidates were observed. Among them is the gamma-ray flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. A similar coincidence of a high-energy neutrino and a gamma-ray flare was found in blazar PKS 0735+178. By modeling the spectral energy distributions of PKS 0735+178, we expect to investigate the physical conditions for neutrino production during different stages of the source activity. We analyze the multi-wavelength data during the selected periods of time. Using numerical simulations of radiation processes in the source, we study the parameter space of one-zone leptonic and leptohadronic models and find the best-fit solutions that explain the observed photon fluxes. We show the impact of model parameter degeneracy on the prediction of the neutrino spectra. We show that the available mutli-wavelength data are not sufficient to predict the neutrino spectrum unambiguously. Still, under the condition of maximal neutrino flux, we propose a scenario in which 0.2 neutrino events are produced during the 50 days flare.

 - **Abstract**
 The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted By Orbiting Planets) survey is a search for circumbinary planets using the radial velocity spectrographs HARPS and SOPHIE, currently focusing on single-lined binaries with a mass ratio $<0.3$. Circumbinary systems are an important testing ground for planet formation theories as the dynamically complex influence of the binary makes planet formation and survival more difficult. Here we present the results of the survey so far including: confirmed planets such as BEBOP-1c the first circumbinary planet detected in radial velocity; the status of our observations; and preliminary occurrence rates. We compare the early results of the radial velocity survey to the population of circumbinary planets discovered in transit, and suggest that there may be a population of inflated planets close to the inner binary which are detectable in transit but more difficult in radial velocity. Using time-lag tidal theory, we show that this inflation is unlikely caused by tides.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and evolution of organic molecules represent a pivotal issue in the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, potentially shedding light on the origins of life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution, is well suitable to observe molecules such as methane ($\rm CH_4$). Our analysis focused on the distribution of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0 micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract the $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results reveal that the spatial distribution of $\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the "Classical" dark-cloud chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes. These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbiting space objects have become in the last decade a major nuisance impacting ground astronomy and orbiting space assets, from observatories to satellites and space stations. In particular with the rise of the satellite population in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), space objects are becoming an even bigger threat and a strong problem to astronomical observations. To tackle these threats several coordinated surveillance networks composed of dedicated sensors (telescopes, radars and laser ranging facilities) track and survey space objects, from debris to active satellites. As part of the European Space Surveillance \& Tracking (EU-SST) network, Portugal is developing the PAmpilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO), with both radio and optical telescopes dedicated to the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain, deployed at a Dark Sky destination. To optimize telescope survey time, we developed {\tt{CLOWN}} (CLOud Watcher at Night), an application interface that automatically monitors clouds in real time. This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.

 - **Abstract**
 In the near-infrared wavelength regime, atmospheric turbulence fluctuates at a scale of a few milliseconds, and its precise control requires the use of extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems equipped with fast and sensitive detectors operating at kHz speeds. The C-RED One cameras developed by First Light Imaging (FLI), based on SAPHIRA detectors made of HgCdTe e-APD array sensitive to 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m light, featuring a 320x256 pixels with 24 $\mu$m pitch, offering sub-electron readout noise and the ability to read subarrays, at frame-rates of up to few 10-kHz, are state-of-the-art for XAO wavefront sensing. The Observatory of Geneva purchased two C-RED One cameras identified as necessary for RISTRETTO (a proposed high-contrast high-resolution spectrograph for the VLT) and SAXO+ (an upgrade of the VLT/SPHERE XAO system) projects. We present a comprehensive characterization and comparative analysis of both the cameras. We present test results examining key noise contributors, including readout noise, detector bias, etc. And we also study their temporal variability. Additionally, we assess the conversion gain and the avalanche gain calibration of the detector. We also study the evolution some of these parameters over time.

          RISTRETTO: a comparative performance analysis of the unmodulated Pyramid wavefront sensor and the Zernike wavefront sensor

 - **Abstract**
 The RISTRETTO instrument, a proposed visible high-contrast, high-resolution spectrograph for the VLT, has the primary science goal of detecting reflected light from nearby exoplanets and characterizing their atmospheres. Specifically, it aims to atmospherically characterize Proxima b, our closest temperate rocky exoplanet, located $37 mas$ from its host star, corresponding to $2\lambda/D$ at $\lambda=750 nm$. To achieve this goal, a raw contrast of less than $10^{-4}$ at $2\lambda/D$ and a Strehl ratio greater than 70% are required, necessitating an extreme adaptive optics system (XAO) for the spectrograph. To meet the performance requirements for RISTRETTO, high sensitivity to low-order wavefront aberrations and petal modes is essential. Therefore, unmodulated Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFS) and Zernike wavefront sensors (ZWFS) are under consideration. However, these sensors exhibit non-linearities and have a limited dynamic range, requiring different strategies to optimize their performance. The dynamic range of the sensors increases at longer wavelengths. Thus, in this study, we compare the performance of the 3-sided unmodulated PWFS, the 4-sided unmodulated PWFS, and the Zerniike WFS at different wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regime.

 The Sun's global inertial modes are very sensitive to the solar differential rotation and to properties of the deep solar convection zone which are currently poorly constrained. These properties include the superadiabatic temperature gradient, the latitudinal entropy gradient, and the turbulent viscosity. The inertial modes also play a key role in controlling the Sun's large-scale structure and dynamics, in particular the solar differential rotation. This paper summarizes recent observations and advances in the (linear and nonlinear) modeling of the solar inertial modes.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of RR Lep and BF Vel, two short-period semi-detached oscillating Algols (oEA stars), which are shown to be triple systems. Spectral types of their primaries were determined and radial velocities calculated from spectra observed with the Australian National University's 2.3 m telescope and Wide Field Spectrograph. Spectra of the Na I D doublet confirmed the presence of tertiary components which were apparent in the broadening function analyses and, with H_a spectra during primary eclipses, indicated chromospherical activity in their secondaries. Ground-based telescopes were used for observations in several pass bands for photometric analyses. These data were complemented by data from the TESS mission to enable the modelling of the light curves, followed by a detailed analysis of pulsations. Eclipse-timing variation (ETV) analyses of both systems were used to determine the most likely mechanisms modulating the orbital period. We found mass values M1 = 2.9 M_sun and M2 = 0.75 M_sun for the components of RR Lep, and M1 = 1.93 M_sun and M2 = 0.97 M_sun for those of BF Vel. By integrating information from photometry, spectroscopy and ETV analysis, we found that tertiary components revolve around both systems. The primary star of RR Lep pulsates in 36 frequencies, of which five were identified as independent modes, with the dominant one being 32.28 d^-1. The pulsating component of BF Vel oscillates in 37 frequencies, with the frequency 46.73 d^-1 revealed as the only independent mode. For both systems, many frequencies were found to be related to the orbital frequency. Their physical properties were compared with other oEA stars in Mass-Radius and H-R diagrams, and the pulsational properties of their delta Sct components were compared with currently known systems of this type within the orbital-pulsation period and logg-pulsation period diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of different types of atmospheres and surfaces on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing the detection of atmospheres. One technique is to measure day-side emission to search for lower thermal emission than expected for a black-body planet due to atmospheric absorption features. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for night-side emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. In this work we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets using these techniques. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters, for a range of surfaces and atmospheres on thirty exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. Our results show that secondary eclipse observations are highly degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres, given the wide range of potential surface albedos. We also show that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a black-body planet in these filters. These two results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric day-side emission, except in a subset of CO$_{2}$-dominated atmospheres. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets, allowing the unambiguous detection of atmospheres by night-side emission.

 We present a procedure for calculating the heating of, and the infrared emission from, dust in a homogeneous spherical shell surrounded by a spherically symmetric source of radiation. The results are applicable to newly formed dust either in supernova ejecta or in the circumstellar medium that has been swept up by the expanding shock wave. They can also be applied to the heating and IR emission from dust in clumps or clouds embedded in a homogeneous radiation field.

 As wavefront quality demands tighten on space systems for applications such as astronomy and laser communication, mounting small optics such that the wavefront is undisturbed, positioning is adjustable and the design is producible, while surviving harsh space environments, is a continuing challenge. We designed multiple candidate flexure mounts to support small optics (up to 50 mm diameter, and over 100 grams) to survive the qualification and acceptance tests of small spacecraft and units as defined in ISO 19683 and a mounting structure which is adjustable in decenter [+/-0.5mm], tip/tilt +/-0.5deg, and piston [+/-0.25mm]. We will present design details along with measurements showing less than approximately lambda/10 wavefront contribution from the optic bonding process, along with thermal and multi-axis vibration test data showing the mounted optics survived the acceptance testing loads and are suitable for operation in a wide range of harsh environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor instabilities appear to be omnipresent in dense astrophysical environments, thus presenting a challenge to large-scale simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers (NSMs). Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on "fast" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors.

          Buoyant crystals halt the cooling of white dwarf stars

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable to the age of the universe, signaling the presence of a powerful yet unknown energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid-liquid distillation mechanism, due to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, \citet{Niraula2022} pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this Letter, we introduce an end-to-end solution from ab initio calculations to pressure broadening, and use the perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ presents a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily driven by the observation of gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m and yet severely lack opacity data. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$ ~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements. Our proof-of-concept introduces a computationally affordable way to compute full-dimensional interaction potentials and scattering quantum dynamics with a precision sufficient to reduce the model-limited biases originating from the pressure broadening and thus support instrument-limited science with JWST and future missions.
