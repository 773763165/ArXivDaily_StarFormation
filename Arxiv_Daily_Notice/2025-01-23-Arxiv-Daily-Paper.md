          Ripples spreading across the Galactic disc: Interplay of direct and indirect effects of the Sagittarius dwarf impact

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia data have revealed vertically asymmetric phase-space structures in the Milky Way (MW) disc, such as phase spirals, indicating vertical oscillations. These oscillations exhibit two distinct modes: the bending mode and the breathing mode, associated with one-arm and two-arm phase spirals, respectively. This study aims to explore the excitation mechanisms of the bending and breathing modes and their subsequent evolution in the MW disc, focusing on the interplay between direct perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and indirect contributions from tidally induced spiral arms. We perform high-resolution $N$-body simulations to model the interaction between an MW-like disc galaxy and a Sagittarius dwarf-like satellite. These simulations resolve fine phase-space structures, enabling analysis of the bending and breathing modes at both macroscopic (global bending and breathing waves) and microscopic (local phase spirals) scales. Our simulations demonstrate that the satellite's perturbation directly excites the bending mode and induces spiral arms in the galactic disc. These spiral arms excite the breathing mode, making it an indirect consequence of the satellite interaction. Initially, the bending mode dominates, but it rapidly decays due to horizontal mixing. In contrast, the breathing mode persists for a longer duration, sustained by the spiral arms, leading to a transition from a bending-dominated to a breathing-dominated state. This transition progresses faster in the inner galaxy than in the outer regions. The simulations reproduce the one-arm phase spiral observed in the solar neighbourhood and reveal two-arm phase spirals, particularly in the inner galaxy, associated with spiral arm-induced breathing modes. Our findings highlight the combined effects of direct satellite perturbations and indirect spiral arm dynamics in shaping the vertical structure of the MW disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The observations of eclipsing binary systems are of great importance in astrophysics, as they allow direct measurements of fundamental stellar parameters. By analysing high-quality space-based observations with ground-based photometric data, it becomes possible to detect these fundamental parameters with greater precision using multicolour photometry. Here, we report the first photometric analysis results of the V517 Cam eclipsing binary system by combining the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve and new CCD observations in BVRI filters, obtained with a 60 cm robotic telescope (T60) at the TÜBİTAK National Observatory. By means of photometric analyses, the masses and radii of the primary and secondary stars were carefully determined to be $M_{1}= 1.47\pm 0.06\,M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 0.79\pm0.05\,M_\odot$, and $R_{1}=1.43\pm 0.03\,R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 0.75\pm 0.04\,R_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, the distance to V517 Cam was calculated to be $284\pm20$ pc. The overall age of the system is estimated to be around $63\pm15$ Myr. At this age, the primary component stands near the onset of its main-sequence evolution, near the ZAMS, whereas the secondary component remains in the pre-main-sequence evolutionary phase. To better understand the evolutionary status and nature of V517 Cam, the mass ratio and temperature values, obtained with relatively low sensitivity by photometric measurements, need to be confirmed by spectral analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematic parameters identified from high-velocity stars situated within 100 kpc are examined and analyzed. We included three high velocity programs comprising 591, 87, and 519 stars as a function of distances ranging from 0.10 to nearly 109 kpc. In this analysis, we will determine the spatial velocities (U, V, W) in galactic coordinates along with their velocity dispersion (sigma_1, sigma_2, sigma_3), the convergent point (Ao, Do), and therefore, the solar motion (S_sun).

 - **Abstract**
 The circumstellar envelope of the carbon star CW Leo exhibited various unexpected changes in recent optical imaging observations. We have performed a follow-up observation using the Near-infrared Integral-Field Spectrograph (NIFS) equipped on the Gemini-North telescope. We report the near-infrared counterparts of a local brightness peak in the optical at the stellar position of CW Leo. On the other hand, a second peak detected at short wavelengths in the J band coincides with the brightest, bluest position in the optical images. The absorption features in the K band are minimized at a radius of 0.2 arcsec from the predicted stellar position. The reduction of the absorption depths likely indicates dilution of the absorption features by thermal emission of dust grains newly formed at such a radius and heated by radiation from the central star. The broad absorption feature at 1.53 um is significantly deeper than in template carbon stars, consistent with the presence of a substantial amount of circumstellar material around CW Leo. Its northeastern quadrant lacks circumstellar absorption features and scattered light in the near-infrared regime, which are possibly manifestations of its conical cavity in both gas and dust. In addition, a cross correlation of CO overtone bands indicates that the average expansion velocity of dust grains is smaller to the northern direction, likewise the velocity of transverse wind components derived using the differential proper motion of a circumstellar whirled pattern. The gradual brightening of CW Leo and the changes in its innermost circumstellar envelope need further continuous monitoring observations to properly understand its transitional phase toward the post-asymptotic-giant-branch stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong lensing of gravitational wave (GW) sources allows the observer to see the GW source from different lines-of-sight (LOS) through the corresponding images, which provides a way for constraining the relative proper motion of the GW source. This is possible as the GW signals received from each image will have slightly different projected velocity components, from which one can `Doppler-Triangulate' for the GW source velocity vector. The difference in projected velocity between the different images can be observationally inferred through pairwise GW phase measurements that accumulate over the time-of-observation. In this paper we study lensed eccentric GW sources and explore how the observable GW phase shift between images evolve as a function of time, eccentricity, lens- and binary parameters. Next generation GW observatories, including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will see $\sim $hundreds/year of lensed GW sources, where a significant fraction of these are expected to be eccentric. We discuss the expected unique observables for such eccentric lensed GW sources, and the relation to their observable relative linear motion, which otherwise is exceedingly difficult to constrain in general.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a novel ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that considers the multiband and non-uniform cadence without having to compute complex features. Our proposed model consists of an ensemble of RNNs, which do not require the entire light curve to perform inference, making the inference process simpler. The ensemble is able to adapt to varying numbers of bands, tested on three real light curve datasets, namely Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, and ZTF, to demonstrate its potential for generalization. We also show the capabilities of deep learning to perform not only classification, but also regression of physical parameters such as effective temperature and radius. Our ensemble model demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with fewer observations, thus providing potential for early classification of sources from facilities such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST. The results underline the model's effectiveness and flexibility, making it a promising tool for future astronomical surveys. Our research has shown that a multitask learning approach can enrich the embeddings obtained by the models, making them instrumental to solve additional tasks, such as determining the orbital parameters of binary systems or estimating parameters for object types beyond periodic ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (<\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 TeV-emitting BL Lac type blazars represent the extreme end of the blazar population. They are characterized by relatively weak jets and radiatively inefficient accretion disks. Particles accelerated in these jets experience fewer radiative losses, allowing them to reach energies beyond the TeV scale and produce TeV gamma-ray emission. The study of TeV blazars is constrained by the limited number of known sources in this category. Currently, only 56 high synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs have been detected at energies above 0.1\,TeV. Searches for TeV emission from BL~Lacs typically target sources with bright X-ray emission and a synchrotron peak at or above 1\,keV. The recently released eRASS1 catalog by the eROSITA collaboration, which covers half of the sky, represents the deepest X-ray survey in the soft X-ray band to date. Utilizing the eROSITA survey, combined with infrared data from WISE and archival radio observations, we have identified 135 TeV-emitting blazar candidates. Our search introduces selection criteria based on the radio to infrared that remove quasar-like objects that have similar infrared spectra and X-ray fluxes as TeV-emitting BL~Lacs. In our search, we find 26 objects that had not been detected in the ROSAT X-ray survey and 20 that have not been previously associated with blazars. The candidates resulting from our search are suitable for follow-up observations with currently operating imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, as well as future facilities like the CTAO Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multi-telescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 8.25 events for type Ia, 3.06 for type Ic, 1.04 for type IIb, 0.66 for type IIL, 0.89 for type IIn, 5.26 for type IIP, and 1.44 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-Field Survey (WFS) program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 3.30 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.4\%$ precision in estimating the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we report for the first time two repeated quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curve of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) S5 1044+71. This source was observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in multiple sectors. We used the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram method and weighted wavelet Z-transform method to search for significant periodic signals. The main results are as follows: We found QPOs of $\sim$ 7.0 days (persisted for 4 cycles, with a significance of $\sim3.5\sigma$) and $\sim$ 7.3 days (persisted for 5 cycles, with a significance of $\sim3.8\sigma$) in the light curves of Sector 47 and EP1, respectively. Considering range of error, we consider them to be the same. We discussed two likely models of these rapid quasi-periodic variations: One comes from the jet and the other from the accretion disk. For the first one, we consider kink instability of the jet as a plausible explanation. Second, the QPO is probable to come from the main hot spots in the accretion disk, which is located approximately within the innermost stable circular orbit allowed by general relativity. Based on this model, we estimate the mass of the black hole in S5 1044+71 to be $3.49 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the presence and kinematics of NV absorption proximate to high redshift quasars selected upon the presence of strong $H_{2}$ and HI absorption at the quasar redshift. Our spectroscopic observations with X-shooter at the VLT reveal a 70% detection rate of NV (9 of 13 quasars with 2.5 < z < 3.3), remarkably higher than the 10% detection rate in intervening DLA systems and the 30% rate observed within a few thousand km/s of the source in the general quasar population. While many NV components lie within the velocity range of the neutral gas, the kinematic profiles of high-ionization species appear decoupled from those of low-ionization species, with the former extending over much larger velocity ranges, particularly towards bluer velocities. We also observe significant variations in the NV/SiIV, which we attribute to varying ionization conditions, with a velocity-dependent trend: blueshifted NV components systematically exhibit higher ionization parameters compared to those near the quasar's systemic redshift. Furthermore, the most redshifted systems relative to the quasar show no evidence of NV absorption. The results suggest that proximate $H_{2}$ absorption systems select critical stages of quasar evolution, during which the quasar remains embedded in a rich molecular environment. Redshifted systems trace infalling gas, potentially associated with mergers, preceding the onset of outflows. Such outflows may reach or even carry out neutral and molecular this http URL latter stage would correspond to proximate $H_{2}$ systems located around or blueshifted relative to the quasar's systemic z. Finally, the only case in our sample featuring highly blueshifted neutral gas shows no evidence of an association with the this http URL findings highlight the need to account for the ionization state when defining a velocity threshold to distinguish quasar-associated systems from intervening.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e. capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. We study this region using very-high-energy gamma-ray data. Aims. We explore the region of IC 443 using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC observatory. We study the emission of this supernova remnant and search for signatures that would show acceleration of (hadronic) cosmic rays at the PeV range. Methods. We use the maximum likelihood estimation and a likelihood ratio test to perform a multi-source fitting search. We find the best-fit morphology and spectrum of the IC 443 region above $\sim$300 GeV that best describes the HAWC data. Results. We observe a point source located at ($\alpha$=94.42$^{\circ}$, $\delta$=22.35$^{\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of -3.14$\pm$0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. We also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of -2.49$\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213. Conclusions. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we find a new extended source in the region. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.

 - **Abstract**
 The amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at a given measurement position are the key parameters for retrieving information from radio signals generated by extensive air showers. Accurate reconstruction of the electric field from the signals recorded by the antennas is therefore essential for the radio detection technique. Conventional reconstruction methods primarily focus on electric field reconstruction for antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical least-squares ($\chi^2$) reconstruction method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field directly at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves an accuracy better than 4\% in determining the Hilbert peak amplitude of an electric field and better than 6\% accuracy, with minimal bias, when estimating energy fluence. Additionally, this method is reliable for almost all arrival directions, and the direction dependence has been investigated. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method enhances our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.

 Reconstructing the dark matter density, velocity, and tidal (MTV) fields from galaxy surveys is essential for advancing our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework using a UNet convolutional neural network to reconstruct the MTV fields from mock samples of the DESI bright galaxy survey within the redshift range $0.1 < z < 0.4$. Our approach accounts for realistic observational effects, including geometric selection, flux-limited data, and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, thereby improving the fidelity of the reconstructed fields. Testing on mock galaxy catalogs generated from the Jiutian N-body simulation, our method achieves significant accuracy level. The reconstructed density field exhibits strong consistency with the true field, effectively eliminating most RSD effects and achieving a cross-correlation power spectrum coefficient greater than 0.985 on scales with $k < 0.1 \, h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The velocity field reconstruction accurately captures large-scale coherent flows and small-scale turbulent features, exhibiting slopes of the grid-to-grid relationship close to unity and a scatter below $\sim$100 $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, the tidal field is reconstructed without bias, successfully recovering the features of the large-scale cosmic web, including clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids. Our results confirm that the proposed framework effectively captures the large-scale distribution and dynamics of dark matter while addressing key systematic challenges. These advancements provide a reliable and robust tool for analyzing current and future galaxy surveys, paving the way for new insights into cosmic structure formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent--daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.

          Resonance Capture and Stability Analysis for Planet Pairs under Type I Disk Migration

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical model to investigate a two-planet pair that undergoes convergent type I migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disk and traps into the first-order mean motion resonance. Our study identifies the conditions for resonant capture and explores the subsequent dynamical stability of the system. We derive the analytical criteria for planets with an arbitrary mass ratio and validate through numerical N-body simulations. Slow migration and weak eccentricity damping are required for resonant capture, the latter of which has not received enough attention in the literature. Once capture into resonance, their following stability can be classified into three regimes: stable trap, overstable trap and escape. Notably, resonant capture remains stable when the inner planet significantly outweighs the outer one. However, the subsequent evolution can be diverse when the mass of the inner planet is lower or comparable to that of the outer planet. Stability weakens as the relative strength between migration and eccentricity damping increases. The key results can be comprehensively demonstrated in a $\tau_{a}$-$\tau_{a}/\tau_{\rm e}$ plot, where $\tau_{a}$ and $\tau_{\rm e}$ are orbital decay and eccentricity damping timescales, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We have been developing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel detectors with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure, named "XRPIX", for X-ray astronomy. In our previous study, we successfully optimized the design of the PDD structure, achieving both the suppression of large leakage current and satisfactory X-ray spectroscopic performance. Here, we report a detailed study on the X-ray spectroscopic performance of the XRPIX with the optimized PDD structure. The data were obtained at $-60^\circ\mathrm{C}$ with the "event-driven readout mode", in which only a triggering pixel and its surroundings are read out. The energy resolutions in full width at half maximum at 6.4 keV are $178\pm1$ eV and $291\pm1$ eV for single-pixel and all-pixel event spectra, respectively. The all-pixel events include charge-sharing pixel events as well as the single-pixel events. These values are the best achieved in the history of our development. We argue that the gain non-linearity in the low energy side due to excessive charge injection to the charge-sensitive amplifier is a major factor to limit the current spectroscopic performance. Optimization of the amount of the charge injection is expected to lead to further improvement in the spectroscopic performance of XRPIX, especially for the all-pixel event spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an analysis of the predicted optical-to-X-ray spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm ox}$) within the context of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) associated with stellar mass black holes and neutron stars. We use the population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate the evolution of binary systems and investigate the relationship between UV and X-ray emission during the ULX phase, namely the $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ relation. The study investigates the impact of metallicity on $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values. Notably, it predicts a significant anti-correlation between $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ and UV luminosity ($L_{\rm UV}$), consistent with observations, with the slope of this relationship varying with metallicity for BH-ULXs. The NS-ULX population shows a relatively consistent slope around $-0.33$ across metallicities, with minor variations. The number of ULXs decreases with increasing metallicity, consistent with observational data, and the X-ray luminosity function shows a slight variation in its slope with metallicity, exhibiting a relative excess of high-luminosity ULXs at lower metallicities. Inclusion of beaming effect in the analysis shows a significant impact on the XLF and $\alpha_{\rm ox}$, particularly at high accretion rates, where the emission is focused into narrower cones. Furthermore, the study finds that UV emission in ULXs is predominantly disk-dominated, which is the likely origin of the $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ relation, with the percentage of disk-dominated ULXs increasing as metallicity rises.

 During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy \&amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fourth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French astrophysics research community. This year had a special context: both the CNRS-INSU and the CNES were preparing their scientific perspectives for the period 2025-2030 in the field of Astronomy-Astrophysics (AA). In this proceeding, we first describe the main actions undertaken by the Commission Transition Environnementale. Then, we summarize the discussions held during the half-day workshop, which brought together about 100 participants, and point to forthcoming proceeding, reports and other related resources. A key message is that the French A\&amp;A community is now fully aware that astronomical activities simply cannot thrive indefinitely in the current situation, and seems now eager to seize the opportunity of developing our profession towards a better social and environmental impact.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations. Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network. Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach. Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports. Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 The subsurface convective zones (CZs) of massive stars significantly influences many of their key characteristics. Previous studies have paid little attention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so we aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive stars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to simulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We establish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\odot}$ to 120 $M_{\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0, $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the subsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of this zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower metallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find that rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation significantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars. By comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we propose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as important CR sources, with the potential of explaining the high-energy end of the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum, that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) seem unable to account for. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies and the energetics is enough to account for a large fraction of the Galactic CRs, if the system is efficient enough. A handful of star clusters have been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in this environment. However, contamination by other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from SCs only. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters. The young age (< 3 Myr) of the clusters guarantees that no SN has exploded in the region, allowing us to determine the power contributed by the stellar component alone, and to quantify the contribution of this type of sources to the bulk of CRs. Moreover, we will present a recent statistical investigation that quantifies the degree of correlation between gamma-ray sources and these astrophysical objects and briefly discuss the observational prospect for ASTRI and CTAO.

 The Cryogenic AntiCoincidence Detector (CryoAC) is a key element of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) on board the future ATHENA X-ray observatory. It is a TES-based detector designed to reduce the particle background of the instrument, thereby increasing its sensitivity. The detector design is driven by an end-to-end simulator which includes the electro-thermal modelling of the detector and the dynamics of its readout chain. Here, we present the measurements carried out on the last CryoAC single pixel prototype, namely DM127, in order to evaluate the critical thermal parameters of the detector and consequently to tune and validate the CryoAC end-to-end simulator.

 - **Abstract**
 ExoSim 2 is the next generation of the Exoplanet Observation Simulator (ExoSim) tailored for spectro-photometric observations of transiting exoplanets from space, ground, and sub-orbital platforms. This software is a complete rewrite implemented in Python 3, embracing object-oriented design principles, which allow users to replace each component with their functions when required. ExoSim 2 is publicly available on GitHub, serving as a valuable resource for the scientific community. ExoSim 2 employs a modular architecture using Task classes, encapsulating simulation algorithms and functions. This flexible design facilitates the extensibility and adaptability of ExoSim 2 to diverse instrument configurations to address the evolving needs of the scientific community. Data management within ExoSim 2 is handled by the Signal class, which represents a structured data cube incorporating time, space, and spectral dimensions. The code execution in ExoSim 2 follows a three-step workflow: the creation of focal planes, the production of Sub-Exposure blocks, and the generation of non-destructive reads (NDRs). Each step can be executed independently, optimizing time and computational resources. ExoSim 2 has been extensively validated against other tools like ArielRad and has demonstrated consistency in estimating photon conversion efficiency, saturation time, and signal generation. The simulator has also been validated independently for instantaneous read-out and jitter simulation, and for astronomical signal representation. In conclusion, ExoSim 2 offers a robust and flexible tool for exoplanet observation simulation, capable of adapting to diverse instrument configurations and evolving scientific needs. Its design principles and validation results underscore its potential as a valuable resource in the field of exoplanet research.

 - **Abstract**
 Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.

          The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation

 - **Abstract**
 We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.

 For minor planet observations to be archived and used by the scientific community, observations of individual objects must be linked together into groups called tracklets. This linking is nontrivial, as linking software must find real tracklets in noisy data within a reasonable amount of time. We describe FindPOTATOs, a linking software written in Python that can assemble minor planet tracklets. With the appropriate parameters, FindPOTATOs assembles tracklets for a variety of objects, including close-approaching near-Earth objects and trans-Neptunian objects. FindPOTATOs is ideal for processing data sets taken at small observatories, processing archival data, or finding tracklets of minor planets on unusual orbits. This paper describes the code structure, usage, and validation.

 - **Abstract**
 The G-ring arc of Saturn, confined by the 7:6 corotation eccentric resonance with Mimas, is primarily composed of micrometric particles. These particles, significantly influenced by the solar radiation pressure, are subject to rapid depletion. This study investigates a mechanism for dust replenishment in the arc, specifically analyzing collisions between macroscopic bodies and the satellite Aegaeon. Utilizing N-body and Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we assess the dust generation from these impacts, with a focus on the most likely collision parameters derived from the N-body simulations. Our findings indicate that, while collisions among macroscopic bodies are inefficient for dust production, impacts involving Aegaeon are substantially more effective, providing conservative lower limits for dust generation. This mechanism, in conjunction with the natural decay processes and continuous dust generation from impacts, potentially keeps the arc population over thousands of years with a possible variation in brightness.

 - **Abstract**
 First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.

 BayesEoR is a GPU-accelerated, MPI-compatible Python package for estimating the power spectrum of redshifted 21-cm emission from interferometric observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Utilizing a Bayesian framework, BayesEoR jointly fits for the 21-cm EoR power spectrum and a "foreground" model, referring to bright, contaminating emission between us and the cosmological signal, and forward models the instrument with which these signals are observed. To perform the sampling, we use MultiNest [arXiv:1402.0004], which calculates the Bayesian evidence as part of the analysis. Thus, BayesEoR can also be used as a tool for model selection [see e.g. arXiv:1701.03384].

 AGILE (Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero) has been a unique and hugely successful mission of Italian Space Agency (ASI), built and operated with the programmatic and technical support of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), several universities and Italian industries. During almost 17 years of observations in orbit (from April 23, 2007, to January 18, 2024), AGILE contributed to high-energy astrophysics and terrestrial physics with many discoveries and detections. Two co-aligned X- and gamma-ray detectors, a silicon-strip-based tracker, a wide field of view gamma-ray imager and the fast-reaction ground segment were the AGILE innovative solutions with respect to the previous generation of gamma-ray satellites. With the AGILE's re-entry, the in-orbit operational phase ends, but a new phase of scientific work on the satellite legacy data archive opens: AGILE may still hold future surprises.

 The Harvard College Observatory was the preeminent astronomical data center of the early 20th century: it gathered and archived an enormous collection of glass photographic plates that became, and remains, the largest in the world. For nearly twenty years DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) actively digitized this library using a one-of-a kind plate scanner. In early 2024, after 470,000 scans, the DASCH project finished. Now, this unique analog dataset can be integrated into 21st-century, digital analyses. The key DASCH data products include ~200 TB of plate images, ~16 TB of calibrated light curves, and a variety of supporting metadata and calibration outputs. Virtually every part of the sky is covered by thousands of DASCH images with a time baseline spanning more than 100 years; most stars brighter than B ~ 15 have hundreds or thousands of detections. DASCH Data Release 7, issued in late 2024, represents the culmination of the DASCH scanning project.

 This paper presents the development and characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone designed for deep-sea applications, with a focus on detecting neutrino interactions via their acoustic signatures. The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 New observations obtained with JWST of the proto-stellar HH~270 jet and the "deflected" HH 110 system, show that HH 110 has a morphology of a series of distorted working surfaces. These working surfaces appear to be "deflected versions" of the heads of the incident, HH 270 jet. We compute a series of 3D numerical simulations, in which we explore the possible parameters of a shearing environment that could give origin to the deflection of HH 270 into the HH 110 flow. We find that we need a quite high sideways velocity for the streaming environment (of ~30km/s) in order to produce the complex structure observed in HH 110. This high velocity would be possible in an environment which has been strongly perturbed by the passage of other outflows.

 Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations, reproducing and building on prior results. Our WGAN models successfully generate high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations. We also identify a limitation of the WGAN model in the form of smeared features in the generated high-resolution snapshots, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 With the evolution of radio astronomy, related education and training, the demand for scalable, efficient, and remote systems in data acquisition, storage, and analysis has significantly increased. Addressing this need, we have developed a web interface for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array integral to the SKA Test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory (77.428 E, 13.603 N). This interface, employing Python-based technologies such as Streamlit and PyVISA, along with SCPI commands, offers a seamless and user-friendly experience. Our solution introduces a unique data acquisition approach, employing SCPI through Python to communicate with the setup's Data Acquisition System (DAS). The web interface, accessible remotely via a secure WLAN network or VPN, facilitates user-initiated observations and comprehensive logging and offers advanced features like manual RFI masking, transit plotting, and fringe plot analysis. Additionally, it acts as a data hub, allowing for the remote downloading of observational data. These capabilities significantly enhance the user's ability to conduct detailed post-observation data analysis. The effectiveness of this interface is further demonstrated through a successful solar transit observation, validating its utility and accuracy in real-world astronomical applications. The applications of this web tool are expandable and can be tailored according to the Observatory's Goals and Instrumentation as well as for the growing radio astronomy instrumentation and observing facilities coming up at various educational institutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The current knowledge in cosmology deals with open problems whose solutions are still under investigation. The main issue is the so-called Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, namely, the $4-6 \sigma$ discrepancy between the local value of $H_0$ obtained with Cepheids+Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the cosmological one estimated from the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For the investigation of this problem, probes that span all over the redshift $z$ ranges are needed. Cepheids are local objects, SNe Ia reached up to $z=2.9$, and CMB is observed at $z=1100$. In this context, the use of probes at intermediate redshift $z>3$ is auspicious for casting more light on modern cosmology. The Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are particularly suitable for this task, given their observability up to $z=9.4$. The use of GRBs as standardizable candles requires the use of tight and reliable astrophysical correlations and the presence of gaps in the GRB time-domain data represents an obstacle in this sense. In this work, we propose to improve the precision of the lightcurve (LC) parameters through a reconstruction process performed with the functional forms of GRB LCs and the Gaussian Processes (GP). The filling of gaps in the GRB LCs through these processes shows an improvement up to $41.5\%$ on the precision of the LC parameters fitting, which lead to a reduced scatter in the astrophysical correlations and, thus, in the estimation of cosmological parameters.
