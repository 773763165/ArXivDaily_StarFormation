 - **Abstract**
 An axion-like spectator during inflation can trigger a tachyonic instability which amplifies the modes of one of the helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of parity-violating gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we investigate the impact of the coupling $RFF$ of the gauge field to gravity on the production of GWs. We find that such a coupling introduces a multiplicative factor to the tachyonic mass, which effectively enhances the amplitude of the gauge field modes. Produced GWs are expected to be observed by future space-based GW detectors. Additionally, we find that the strong backreaction due to particle production leads to multiple peaks in the energy spectrum of GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-planet occultations (PPOs) occur when one exoplanet occults another exoplanet in the same system as seen from the Earth's vantage point. PPOs may provide a unique opportunity to observe radio "spillover" from extraterrestrial intelligences' (ETIs) radio transmissions or radar being transmitted from the further exoplanet towards the nearer one for the purposes of communication or scientific exploration. Planetary systems with many tightly packed, low-inclination planets, such as TRAPPIST-1, are predicted to have frequent PPOs. Here, the narrowband technosignature search code turboSETI was used in combination with the newly developed NbeamAnalysis filtering pipeline to analyze 28 hours of beamformed data taken with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) during late October and early November 2022, from 0.9--9.3~GHz, targeting TRAPPIST-1. During this observing window, 7 possible PPO events were predicted using the NbodyGradient code. The filtering pipeline reduced the original list of 25 million candidate signals down to 6 million by rejecting signals that were not sky-localized and, from these, identified a final list of 11127 candidate signals above a power law cutoff designed to segregate signals by their attenuation and morphological similarity between beams. All signals were plotted for visual inspection, 2264 of which were found to occur during PPO windows. We report no detection of signals of non-human origin, with upper limits calculated for each PPO event exceeding EIRPs of 2.17--13.3 TW for minimally drifting signals and 40.8--421 TW in the maximally drifting case. This work constitutes the longest single-target radio SETI search of TRAPPIST-1 to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have made it possible for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to resolve the innermost accretion flows of the largest supermassive black holes on the sky. The sparse nature of the EHT's $(u, v)$-coverage presents a challenge when attempting to resolve highly time-variable sources. We demonstrate that the changing (u, v)-coverage of the EHT can contain regions of time over the course of a single observation that facilitate dynamical imaging. These optimal time regions typically have projected baseline distributions that are approximately angularly isotropic and radially homogeneous. We derive a metric of coverage quality based on baseline isotropy and density that is capable of ranking array configurations by their ability to produce accurate dynamical reconstructions. We compare this metric to existing metrics in the literature and investigate their utility by performing dynamical reconstructions on synthetic data from simulated EHT observations of sources with simple orbital variability. We then use these results to make recommendations for imaging the 2017 EHT Sgr A* data set.

          Gamma-ray burst spectral-luminosity correlations in the synchrotron scenario

 - **Abstract**
 For over two decades, gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission spectra were modelled with smoothly-broken power laws (Band function), and a positive and tight correlation between the spectral rest-frame peak energy $E_p$ and the total isotropic-equivalent luminosity $L_{iso}$ was found, constituting the so-called Yonetoku relation. However, more recent studies show that many prompt emission spectra are well described by the synchrotron radiation model, hence significantly deviating from the Band function. In this work, we test the impact of a more suited spectral model such as an idealized synchrotron spectrum from non-thermal electrons on the Yonetoku relation and its connection with physical parameters. We select GRBs with measured redshift observed by Fermi/GBM together with high energy observations (>30 MeV), and perform spectral analysis dividing them in two samples: the single-bin sample, using the light curve peak spectrum of each GRB, and the multiple-bins sample, where we explore the whole duration of 13 bright bursts with time-resolved spectral analysis. We observed that the $E_p$ of synchrotron spectra in fast-cooling regime ($\nu_m/\nu_c\gg1$) is generally larger than the one provided by the Band function. For this reason, we do not find any $E_p-L_{iso}$ correlation in our samples except for the GRBs in an intermediate-cooling regime ($1<\nu_m/\nu_c<3$), namely where peak and break energies are very close. We instead find in both our samples a new tight correlation between the rest-frame cooling frequency $\nu_{c,z}$ and $L_{iso}$: $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{iso}^{(0.53 \pm 0.06)}$. These results suggest that, assuming that prompt emission spectra are produced by synchrotron radiation, the physical relation is between $\nu_{c,z}$ and $L_{iso}$. The fit of the Band function to an intrinsic synchrotron spectrum returns peak energy values $E_{p,z}^{Band} \sim \nu_{c,z}$.

          Revisiting the Relationship Between Rocky Exoplanet and Stellar Compositions: Reduced Evidence for a Super-Mercury Population

 - **Abstract**
 Planets and the stars they orbit are born from the same cloud of gas and dust, and the primordial compositions of rocky exoplanets have been assumed to have iron and refractory abundance ratios consistent with their host star. To test this assumption, we modeled the interior iron-to-rock ratio of 20 super-Earth sized (1-1.8R$_{\oplus}$) exoplanets around stars with homogeneously measured stellar parameters. We computed the core mass fraction for each planet and an equivalent ``core mass fraction'' for each host star based on its Fe and Mg abundances. We then fit a linear correlation using two methods (Ordinary Least Squares and Orthogonal Distance Regression) between planetary and stellar core mass fraction, obtaining substantially different slopes between these two methods (m=1.3 $\pm$ 1.0 and m=5.6 $\pm$ 1.6, respectively). Additionally, we find that 75$\%$ of planets have a core mass fraction consistent with their host star to within 1$\sigma$, and do not identify a distinct population of high-density super-Mercuries. Overall, we conclude that current uncertainties in observational data and differences in modeling methods prevent definitive conclusions about the relationship between between planet and host star chemical compositions.

          3D Radiation-Hydrodynamical Simulations of Shadows on Transition Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan$^{-1}$($c_s$/$v_\phi$) (6$^{\circ}$ if $h/r$=0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$ in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity-pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10% of the sound speed, which can be probed by ALMA line observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic search for astrophysical transients using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data were taken from 2017 to 2022 in three frequency bands spanning 77 GHz to 277 GHz. In this paper we present a pipeline for transient detection using single observation maps where each pixel of a map contains one observation with an integration time of approximately four minutes. We find 34 transient events at 27 unique locations. All but two of the transients are associated with Galactic stars and exhibit a wide range of properties. We also detect an event coincident with the classical nova, YZ Ret and one event consistent with a flaring active galactic nucleus. We notably do not detect any reverse shock emission from gamma ray bursts, a non-detection which is in tension with current models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Wavefront Sensor units of the Gravity Plus Adaptive Optics (GPAO) system, which will equip all 8m class telescopes of the VLTI and is an instrumental part of the GRAVITY+ project. It includes two modules for each Wavefront Sensor unit: a Natural Guide Star sensor with high-order 40x40 Shack-Hartmann and a Laser Guide Star 30x30 sensor. The state-of-the-art AO correction will considerably improve the performance for interferometry, in particular high-contrast observations for NGS observations and all-sky coverage with LGS, which will be implemented for the first time on VLTI instruments. In the following, we give an overview of the Wavefront Sensor units system after completion of their integration and characterization.

          The Puzzling Superorbital Period Variation of the Low-mass X-ray Binary 4U 1820-30

 - **Abstract**
 Because of the previously observed stability of the 171-day period, the superorbital modulation of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 was considered a consequence of a third star orbiting around the binary. This study aims to further verify this triple model by testing the stability of superorbital period using the light curves collected by X-ray sky monitoring/scanning telescopes from 1987 to 2023. Both power spectral and phase analysis results indicate a significant change in the superorbital period from 171 days to 167 days over this 36-year span. The evolution of the superorbital phase suggests that the superorbital period may have experienced an abrupt change between late 2000 and early 2023 or changed gradually with a period derivative of $\dot P_{sup}=(-3.58 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{-4}$ day/day. We conclude that the superorbital period of 4U 1820-30 was not as stable as anticipated by the triple model, which strongly challenges this hypothesis. Instead, we propose an irradiation-induced mass transfer instability scenario to explain the superorbital modulation of 4U 1820-30.

          Robust Constraints on the Physics of the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A from Optical Depth Arguments

 - **Abstract**
 The brightest-of-all-time gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 221009A, is the first GRB observed to have emission line (up to 37 MeV) in its prompt emission spectra. It is naturally explained as \pair annihilation line that was Doppler boosted in the relativistic jet of the GRB. In this work, we repeatedly apply the simple optical depth argument to different physical processes necessary to produce an observable \pair annihilation line. This approach results in robust constraints on the physics of the line: We conclude that in GRB 221009A, the \pair pairs were produced at a radius greater than $4.3\times 10^{15}$\,cm from the central engine, and annihilated in a region between $1.4\times 10^{16}$\,cm and $4.3\times 10^{16}$\,cm. From these constraints, we established a self-consistent picture of \pair production, cooling, and annihilation. We also derived a criterion for pair production in the GRB prompt emission: $E_{\rm{iso}} \gtrsim3.3\times 10^{53} E_{\rm{peak},100} (1+z) R^2_{\rm{prod},16}~\text{erg}$. Using this criterion, we find tens of candidate GRBs that could have produced \pair in prompt emissions to annihilate. GRB 221009A is with the highest likelihood according to this criterion. We also predict the presence of a thermal radiation, with a time-evolving black body temperature, sweeping through soft X-ray during the prompt emission phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep and low mass-ratio contact binaries (DLMCBs) are believed to be in the final stage of their contact phase, potentially leading to the formation of fast-rotating single stars such as FK Com-type stars and blue stragglers, as well as luminous red novae. These systems serve as an excellent laboratory for studying stellar coalescence and merging processes. Our search for DLMCBs began in 2004 and has since identified a group of such systems. Together with that collected from the literature, more than 100 DLMCBs have been detected so far. Half of them have had their periods investigated based on O-C curves. Some have shown period increases, while others have exhibited period decreases. Among them, more than half DLMCBs have cyclic variations, suggesting the possibility of the existence of a third body orbiting around the DLMCBs. Furthermore, with more data obtained extending the span of the O-C curve, more cyclic variations could be detected. The high proportion of signs of the presence of third bodies makes them an essential factor to consider when studying the merger of contact binaries.

          A Modified Initial Mass Function of the First Stars with Explodability Theory under Different Enrichment Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 The most metal-poor stars record the earliest metal enrichment triggered by Population III stars. By comparing observed abundance patterns with theoretical yields of metal-free stars, physical properties of their first star progenitors can be inferred, including zero-age main-sequence mass and explosion energy. In this work, the initial mass distribution (IMF) of first stars is obtained from the largest analysis to date of 406 very metal-poor stars with the newest LAMOST/Subaru high-resolution spectroscopic observations. However, the mass distribution fails to be consistent with the Salpeter IMF, which is also reported by previous studies. Here we modify the standard power-law function with explodability theory. The mass distribution of Population III stars could be well explained by ensuring the initial metal enrichment to originate from successful supernova explosions. Based on the modified power-law function, we suggest an extremely top-heavy or nearly flat initial mass function with a large explosion energy exponent. This indicates that supernova explodability should be considered in the earliest metal enrichment process in the Universe.

          Is there a genetic relationship between chondrules and matrix?

 - **Abstract**
 Chondritic components such as chondrules and matrix are the key time capsules that can help us understand the evolution and dynamics of the protoplanetary disk from which the Solar System originated. Knowledge of where and how these components formed and to what extent they were transported in the gaseous disk provides major constraints to astrophysical models that investigate planet formation. Here, we explore whether chondrules and matrix are genetically related to each other and formed from single reservoirs per chondrite group or if every chondrite represents a unique proportion of components transported from a small number of formation reservoirs in the disk. These static versus dynamic disk interpretations of cosmochemical data have profound implications for the accretion history of the planets in the Solar System. To fully understand the relationship between chondrules and matrix and their potential complementarity, we dive into the petrological nature and origin of matrix, the chemical and isotopic compositions of chondrules and matrix and evaluate these data considering the effect of secondary alteration observed in chondrites and the potential complexity of chondrule formation. Even though we, the authors, have used different datasets and arrived at differing interpretations of chondrule-matrix relationships in the past, this review provides clarity on the existing data and has given us new directions towards future research that can resolve the complementarity debate.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of quasars show that the polarization position angle of the emission coming from them varies greatly over time, including periods called rotations during which the angle changes in an orderly manner. The study proposes a method for identifying such events and assessing their statistical significance. The operation of the method is demonstrated using the example of long-term polarimetric observations of the blazars CTA 102, 3C 454.3, and OT 081. During the analysis of light curves, 51 rotations of the polarization position angle were found and it was shown that for CTA 102 and 3C 454.3 the rotations are predominantly oriented in one direction.

 - **Abstract**
 Here, we present the angular diameter distance measurement obtained from the measurement of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature using the completed Dark Energy Survey (DES) data, summarizing the main results of [Phys. Rev. D 110, 063514] and [Phys. Rev. D 110, 063515]. We use a galaxy sample optimized for BAO science in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.2, with an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}$ = 0.85. Our consensus measurement constrains the ratio of the angular distance to the sound horizon scale to $D_M(z_{\rm eff})/r_d$ = 19.51 $\pm$ 0.41. This measurement is found to be 2.13$\sigma$ below the angular BAO scale predicted by Planck. To date, it represents the most precise measurement from purely photometric data, and the most precise from any Stage-III experiment at such high redshift. The analysis was performed blinded to the BAO position and is shown to be robust against analysis choices, data removal, redshift calibrations and observational systematics.

 - **Abstract**
 Hard X-ray photons with energies in the range of hundreds of keV typically undergo Compton scattering when they are incident on a detector. In this process, an incident photon deposits a fraction of its energy at the point of incidence and continues onward with a change in direction that depends on the amount of energy deposited. By using a pair of detectors to detect the point of incidence and the direction of the scattered photon, we can calculate the scattering direction and angle. The position of a source in the sky can be reconstructed using many Compton photon pairs from a source. We demonstrate this principle in the laboratory by using a pair of Cadmium Zinc Telluride detectors sensitive in the energy range of 20-200 keV. The laboratory setup consists of the two detectors placed perpendicular to each other in a lead-lined box. The detectors are read out by a custom-programmed Xilinx PYNQ FPGA board, and data is then transferred to a PC. The detectors are first calibrated using lines from $^{241}\mathrm{Am}$, $^{155}\mathrm{Eu}$ and $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}$ sources. We irradiated the detectors with a collimated $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}$ source and identified Compton scattering events for the 356 keV line. We run a Compton reconstruction algorithm and correctly infer the location of the source in the detector frame. This comprises a successful technology demonstration for a Compton imaging camera in the Hard X-ray regime. We present the details of our setup, the data acquisition process, and software algorithms, and showcase our results.

          Evolution and the quasistationary state of collective fast neutrino flavor conversion in three dimensions without axisymmetry

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate in this work the evolution of the collective fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) in a three dimensional (3D) cubic box with periodic boundary condition for three different neutrino angular distributions that are axially asymmetric. We find that the system evolves toward a quasistationary state where the angular distribution of the spatially averaged neutrino electron-minus-muon lepton number (ELN) does not contain any crossings. In the quasistationary state, near flavor equilibration is achieved in one angular domain enclosed by the initial ELN angular crossing contour, similar to the conclusion derived based on simplified one dimensional (1D) system with axially symmetric neutrino angular distributions. We have also performed additional simulations in coordinates where the initial first ELN angular moment has only one nonvanishing spatial component by using the original axially asymmetric ELN angular distributions as well as the corresponding axisymmetric ELN distributions, and find interesting similarity between these two sets. Finally, we propose three different analytical prescriptions generalized from earlier 1D models to 3D models, and evaluate their performances in predicting the post-FFC moments. Our findings suggest that further development of effective classical transport model in multidimensions to capture the effect of FFC is promising.

          Minimum Safe Distances for DE-STAR Space Lasers

 - **Abstract**
 The prospect of phased laser arrays in space has received considerable attention in recent years, with applications to both planetary defence and space exploration. The most detailed investigation conducted into such a design is that of the DE-STAR phased array, standing for $\textbf{D}$irected $\textbf{E}$nergy $\textbf{S}$ystems for $\textbf{T}$argeting of $\textbf{A}$steroids and explo$\textbf{R}$ation. DE-STAR is a square modular design which exploits the energy created by banks of solar cells in space to generate and amplify the power of a laser beam. A specific DE-STAR design is expressed as DE-STAR n, where 'n' (typically in the range 0 - 4) equates to the log to base 10 of the side, in metres, of a square bank of lasers. With a DE-STAR 4 structure (10 km $\times$ 10 km square) capable of generating a laser beam on the order of tens of gigawatts, clearly there is the potential for such an asset to be deployed as a weapon by targeting locations on Earth. This naturally leads to the question of what effective ways can this possible misuse be removed or at least mitigated, to ensure these powerful space lasers can only be used for their intended purpose, and never malevolent reasons. One solution would be to locate the DE-STAR far enough away so that the laser flux at Earth would be too low. Results indicate that given they should lie 1 au from the Sun, there are feasible locations for DE-STAR 0-2 arrays where there is no danger to Earth. For DE-STAR 4-5, such is their power, safety measures other than those considered here would have to be adopted. Positions in the Solar System where the DE-STAR lasers have no direct line-of-sight with Earth tend to be unstable, and would require regular corrections using an on-board propulsion system, or preferably using push-back from the laser itself.

 - **Abstract**
 We present preliminary results of a detailed 3D study of supernova remnants in the nearby spiral M51 using data from the SIGNALS survey obtained with the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Data cubes covering the entire galaxy were gathered in three spectral ranges: SN3 (647-685 nm, R = 5000), SN2 (482-513 nm, R = 600) and SN1 (363-386 nm, R = 1000). The spectral resolution of the SN3 cube allows a precise, spatially resolved measurement of the velocity dispersion of each object. While most of the SNRs were known from previous surveys based on imagery and long-slit spectroscopy, we now provide 2D line flux and kinematic maps for all of them and found 20 new candidates. Most of the SNRs show velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) in the range 30-80 km/s, which is typical for middle-aged SNRs. Finally, we compare the properties of SNRs with those of thousands of HII regions included in the same dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain dark energy and modified gravity within the effective field theory of dark energy framework using the full-shape BOSS galaxy power spectrum, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and recent baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from DESI. Specifically, we focus on a varying braiding parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$, a running of the ``effective'' Planck mass $\alpha_{\rm M}$, and a constant dark energy equation of state $w$. The analysis is performed with two of these parameters at a time, including all the other standard cosmological parameters and marginalizing over bias and nuisance parameters. The full-shape galaxy power spectrum is modeled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We find that the CMB data is most sensitive to $\alpha_{\rm B}$, and that adding large-scale structure information only slightly changes the parameter constraints. However, the large-scale structure data significantly improve the bounds on $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and $w$ by a factor of two. This improvement is driven by background information contained in the BAO, which breaks the degeneracy with $H_0$ in the CMB. We confirm this by comparing the BOSS full-shape information with BOSS BAO, finding no significant differences. This is likely to change with future high-precision full-shape data from Euclid and DESI however, to which the pipeline developed here is immediately applicable.

          Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from a Sharp Feature in Three-field Inflation II: The Inflationary Era

 - **Abstract**
 We study the contribution of large scalar perturbations sourced by a sharp feature during cosmic inflation to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), extending our previous work to include the SGWB sourced during the inflationary era. We focus in particular on three-field inflation, since the third dynamical field is the first not privileged by the perturbations' equations of motion and allows a more direct generalization to $N$-field inflation. For the first time, we study the three-field isocurvature perturbations sourced during the feature and include the effects of isocurvature masses. In addition to a two-field limit, we find that the third field's dynamics during the feature can source large isocurvature transients which then later decay, leaving an inflationary-era-sourced SGWB as their only observable signature. We find that the inflationary-era signal shape near the peak is largely independent of the number of dynamical fields and has a greatly enhanced amplitude sourced by the large isocurvature transient, suppressing the radiation-era contribution and opening a new window of detectable parameter space with small adiabatic enhancement. The largest enhancements we study could easily violate backreaction constraints, but much of parameter space remains under perturbative control. These SGWBs could be visible in LISA and other gravitational wave experiments, leaving an almost universal signature of sharp features during multi-field inflation, even when the sourcing isocurvature decays to unobservability shortly afterwards.

          Learning Theory Informed Priors for Bayesian Inference: A Case Study with Early Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models are often motivated and formulated in the language of particle physics, using quantities such as the axion decay constant, but tested against data using ostensibly physical quantities, such as energy density ratios, assuming uniform priors on the latter. This approach neglects priors on the model from fundamental theory, including from particle physics and string theory, such as the preference for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. We introduce a novel approach to learning theory-informed priors for Bayesian inference using normalizing flows (NF), a flexible generative machine learning technique that generates priors on model parameters when analytic expressions are unavailable or difficult to compute. As a test case, we focus on early dark energy (EDE), a model designed to address the Hubble tension. Rather than using uniform priors on the $\textit{phenomenological}$ EDE parameters $f_{\rm EDE}$ and $z_c$, we train a NF on EDE cosmologies informed by theory expectations for axion masses and decay constants. Our method recovers known constraints in this representation while being $\sim 300,000$ times more efficient in terms of total CPU compute time. Applying our NF to $\textit{Planck}$ and BOSS data, we obtain the first theory-informed constraints on EDE, finding $f_{\rm EDE} \lesssim 0.02$ at $95\%$ confidence with an $H_0$ consistent with $\textit{Planck}$, but in $\sim 6\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. This yields the strongest constraints on EDE to date, additionally challenging its role in resolving the Hubble tension.
