 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a hot Jupiter candidate orbiting HS Psc, a K7 ($\approx$0.7 $M_\odot$) member of the $\approx$130 Myr AB Doradus moving group. Using radial velocities over 4 years from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, we find a periodic signal at $P_b = 3.986_{-0.003}^{+0.044}$ d. A joint Keplerian and Gaussian process stellar activity model fit to the RVs yields a minimum mass of $m_p \sin i = 1.5_{-0.4}^{+0.6}$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$. The stellar rotation period is well constrained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve ($P_\mathrm{rot} = 1.086 \pm 0.003$ d) and is not an integer harmonic nor alias of the orbital period, supporting the planetary nature of the observed periodicity. HS Psc b joins a small population of young, close-in giant giant planet candidates with robust age and mass constraints and demonstrates that giant planets can either migrate to their close-in orbital separations by 130 Myr or form $in \; situ$. Given its membership in a young moving group, HS Psc represents an excellent target for follow-up observations to further characterize this young hot Jupiter, refine its orbital properties, and search for additional planets in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a continuation of our Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) search for short-period pulsations in compact stellar objects observed during Years 2 and 4 of the TESS mission that targeted the northern ecliptic hemisphere. For many of the targets, we exploit unpublished spectroscopic data to confirm or determine the object's spectral classification. From the TESS photometry, we identify 50 short-period hot-subdwarf pulsators, including 35 sdB and 15 sdOB stars. The sample contains 26 pulsators not known before the TESS mission. Nine stars show signals at both low and high frequencies, and are therefore ``hybrid'' pulsators. For each pulsator, we report the list of prewhitened frequencies and we show amplitude spectra calculated from the TESS data. We attempt to identify possible multiplets caused by stellar rotation, and we report five candidates with rotation periods between 11 and 46d. Having the search for p-mode pulsating hot subdwarfs in TESS Sectors 1 - 60 done, we discuss the completeness of the study, as well as instability strip and the evolutionary status of the stars we found. We also compare the distribution of pulsation periods as a function of effective temperature and surface gravity with theoretical predictions.
#### No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and dynamics of the central bar of the Milky Way are still under debate whilst being fundamental ingredients for the evolution of our Galaxy. The recent Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented detailed view of the 6D phase-space of the MW. We aim to characterise the dynamical moving groups across the MW disc, and use their large-scale distribution to help constrain the properties of the Galactic bar. We used wavelet transforms of the azimuthal velocity ($V_\phi$) distribution in bins of radial velocity to robustly detect the kinematic substructure in the Gaia DR3 catalogue. We then connected these structures across the disc to measure the azimuthal ($\phi$) and radial ($R$) gradients of the moving groups. We simulated thousands of perturbed distribution functions using Backwards Integration of feasible Galaxy models that include a bar, to compare them with the data and to explore and quantify the degeneracies. The radial gradient of the Hercules moving group ($\partial V_\phi/\partial R$ = 28.1$\pm$2.8 km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$kpc$^{-1}$) cannot be reproduced by our simple models of the Galaxy which show much larger slopes both for a fast and a slow bar. This suggests the need for more complex dynamics (e.g. spiral arms, a slowing bar, external perturbations, etc.). We measure an azimuthal gradient for Hercules of $\partial V_\phi/\partial \phi$ = -0.63$\pm$0.13$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$deg$^{-1}$ and find that it is compatible with both the slow and fast bar models. Our analysis points out that using this type of analysis at least two moving groups are needed to start breaking the degeneracies. We conclude that it is not sufficient for a model to replicate the local velocity distribution; it must also capture its larger-scale variations. The accurate quantification of the gradients, especially in the azimuthal direction, will be key for the understanding of the dynamics governing the disc. (ABR)

 - **Abstract**
 With the expected large number of binary neutron star (BNS) observations through gravitational waves (GWs), third-generation GW detectors, Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), will be able to constrain the tidal deformability, and hence the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) with exquisite precision. A subset of the detected BNS systems can retain residual eccentricity in the detector frequency band. We study the systematic errors due to unmodeled eccentricity in the tidal deformability measurement and its implications for NS EoS and redshift measurement via the Love siren method. We find that the systematic errors in the tidal deformability parameter exceed the statistical errors at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$) at $10$Hz reference GW frequency for CE (ET). We show that these biases on tidal deformability parameter can significantly bias the NS EoS inference. Furthermore, the error on tidal deformability propagates to the source frame NS mass, which in turn biases the redshift inference. For CE, the redshift inference is significantly biased at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ (at a reference frequency of $10$Hz). We also study the implications of biased tidal deformability in testing the Kerr nature of black holes. Systematic error on the tidal deformability parameter leads to a non-zero value of tidal deformability for binary black holes, indicating a false deviation from the Kerr nature. Finally, we show that including eccentricity in the waveform model increases the statistical errors in tidal deformability measurement by a factor of $\lesssim 2$. Our study, therefore, highlights the importance of using accurate eccentric waveform models for GW parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbital evolution is a critical process that sculpts planetary systems, particularly during their early stages where planet-disk interactions are expected to lead to the formation of resonant chains. Despite the theoretically expected prominence of such configurations, they are scarcely observed among long-period giant exoplanets. This disparity suggests an evolutionary sequence wherein giant planet systems originate in compact multi-resonant configurations, but subsequently become unstable, eventually relaxing to wider orbits--a phenomenon mirrored in our own solar system's early history. In this work, we present a suite of N-body simulations that model the instability-driven evolution of giant planet systems, originating from resonant initial conditions, through phases of disk-dispersal and beyond. By comparing the period ratio and normalized angular momentum deficit distributions of our synthetic aggregate of systems with the observational census of long-period Jovian planets, we derive constraints on the expected rate of orbital migration, efficiency of gas-driven eccentricity damping, and typical initial multiplicity. Our findings reveal a distinct inclination towards densely-packed initial conditions, weak damping, and high giant planet multiplicities. Furthermore, our models indicate that resonant chain origins do not facilitate the formation of Hot Jupiters via the coplanar high-eccentricity pathway at rates high enough to explain their observed prevalence.
#### Giant Biconical Dust Filaments in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 1808

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength archival data on the multi-phase outflow in the starburst galaxy NGC 1808. We report the detection at 70 and 100 um of dust filaments that extend up to ~ 13 kpc from the galactic mid-plane and trace an edge-brightened biconical structure along the minor axis of the galaxy. The inner filaments are roughly co-spatial with previously identified optical dust filaments, extraplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and neutral and ionized gaseous outflows. The 70/160 um flux ratio, a proxy for dust temperature, is elevated along the edges of the cones, indicating that the dusty medium has been driven out of the central regions of these cones and possibly shock-heated by an outflow. We establish lower limits on the extraplanar dust mass and mean height above the stellar disk of log(M_d/M_sun) = 6.48 and |z| ~ 5 kpc, respectively. The energy requirement of (5.1-9.6) x 10^{56} ergs needed to lift the dusty material, assuming Milky-Way like dust-to-gas ratio, can be supplied by the current starburst, with measured star formation rate of 3.5-5.4 M_sun yr^{-1}, over a timescale of (4-26) xi^{-1} Myr, where xi is the efficiency of energy transfer. We conclude that a starburst-driven outflow is the most likely mechanism by which the dust features were formed.
#### The vertical structure of galactic discs: nonlocal gravity versus dark  matter

 - **Abstract**
 Recent isolated galactic simulations show that the morphology of galactic discs in modified gravity differs from that of the standard dark matter model. In this study, we focused on the vertical structure of galactic discs and compared the bending instability in the vertical direction for both paradigms. To achieve this, we utilized high-resolution N-body simulations to construct two models in a specific nonlocal gravity theory (NLG) and the standard dark matter model and compared their stability against the bending perturbations. Our numerical results demonstrate that the outer regions of the disc are more susceptible to the instability in NLG, whereas the disc embedded in the dark matter halo is more unstable in the central regions. We then interpret these results based on the dispersion relation of the bending waves. To do so, we presented an analytical study to derive the dispersion relation in NLG. Our numerical results align with the predictions of our analytical models. Consequently, we conclude that the analysis of bending instability in galactic discs offers an explanation for the distinct vertical structures observed in simulated galactic discs under these two theories. These findings represent a significant step towards distinguishing between the modified gravity and dark matter models.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern simulation-based inference techniques use neural networks to solve inverse problems efficiently. One notable strategy is neural posterior estimation (NPE), wherein a neural network parameterizes a distribution to approximate the posterior. This approach is particularly advantageous for tackling low-latency or high-volume inverse problems. However, the accuracy of NPE varies significantly within the learned parameter space. This variability is observed even in seemingly straightforward systems like coupled-harmonic oscillators. This paper emphasizes the critical role of prior selection in ensuring the consistency of NPE outcomes. Our findings indicate a clear relationship between NPE performance across the parameter space and the number of similar samples trained on by the model. Thus, the prior should match the sample diversity across the parameter space to promote strong, uniform performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel procedure, in which amortized and sequential NPE are combined to swiftly refine NPE predictions for individual events. This method substantially improves sample efficiency, on average from nearly 0% to 10-80% within ten minutes. Notably, our research demonstrates its real-world applicability by achieving a significant milestone: accurate and swift inference of posterior distributions for low-mass binary black hole (BBH) events with NPE.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory relies on an array of photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light produced by charged particles in the South Pole ice. IceCube data analyses depend on an in-depth characterization of the glacial ice, and on novel approaches in event reconstruction that utilize fast approximations of photoelectron yields. Here, a more accurate model is derived for event reconstruction that better captures our current knowledge of ice optical properties. When evaluated on a Monte Carlo simulation set, the median angular resolution for in-ice particle showers improves by over a factor of three compared to a reconstruction based on a simplified model of the ice. The most substantial improvement is obtained when including effects of birefringence due to the polycrystalline structure of the ice. When evaluated on data classified as particle showers in the high-energy starting events sample, a significantly improved description of the events is observed.

 - **Abstract**
 The TESS mission has provided a wealth of asteroseismic data for solar-like oscillators. However, these data are subject to varying cadences, large gaps, and unequal sampling, which complicates analysis in the frequency domain. One solution is to model the oscillations in the time domain by treating them as stochastically damped simple harmonic oscillators through a linear combination of Gaussian Process kernels. We demonstrate this method on the well-studied subgiant star nu Indi and a sample of Kepler red giant stars observed by TESS, finding that the time domain model achieves an almost two-fold increase in accuracy for measuring {\nu}max compared to typical frequency domain methods. To apply the method to new detections, we use stellar parameters from Gaia DR3 and the TESS input catalog to calculate revised asteroseismic detection probabilities for all TESS input catalog targets with T<12 mag and a predicted {\nu}max>240{\mu}Hz. We also provide a software tool to calculate detection probabilities for any target of interest. Using the updated detection probabilities we show that time-domain asteroseismology is sensitive enough to recover marginal detections, which may explain the current small number of frequency-based detections of TESS oscillations compared to pre-flight expectations.
#### Proposed high order harmonic interferometer for aperture synthesis radio  telescope: Theory and computer simulation

 - **Abstract**
 A new type of interferometer, called High Order Harmonic Interferometer (HOHI), was proposed by Wu (1996) for imaging by aperture synthesis radio telescope. Its feasibility was proven by theoretical analysis. Before putting HOHI in practical use, computer simulation is a necessary intermediate stage. In this paper the theoretical analysis is reviewed. Then, computer simulation, including its algorithm, calculation and generated maps, is presented. The theoretical analysis is validated by studying these maps.
#### Effect of dark matter on the shadow of a distorted and deformed compact  object

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates observational properties, namely the shadow and photon ring structure, of emission profiles originated near compact objects. In particular, we consider a distorted and deformed compact object characterized by quadrupoles and surrounded by an optically thin and geometrically thin accretion disk with different emission profiles modeled by the Johnson's Standard-Unbound (SU) distribution in the reference frame of the emitter. Under these assumptions, we produce the observed intensity profiles and shadow images for a face-on observer. Our results indicate that, due to the fact that modifications of the quadrupole parameters affect the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the photon sphere (PS), the observed shadow images and their properties are significantly influenced by the quadrupole parameters and emission profiles. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the presence of a dark matter halo in the observational imprints considered and verify that both the increase in the matter contained in the halo or decrease in the length-scale of the halo lead to an increase in the size of the observed shadow. Our results indicate potential degeneracies between the observational features of distorded and deformed compact objects with those of spherically symmetric blackholes, which could be assessed by a comparison with the current and future generation of optical experiments in gravitational physics.
#### Modification to the Jeans criterion by external tides: Anisotropic  fragmentation and formation of filaments

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02612
 - **Abstract**
 The Jeans criterion sets the foundation of our understanding of gravitational collapse. Jog studied the fragmentation of gas under external tides and derived a dispersion relation $$ l' = l_{\rm Jeans} \frac{1} {(1 + \lambda_0' / 4 \pi G \rho_0)^{1/2}} \;. $$ She further concludes that the Jeans mass is $m_{\rm incorrect}'=m_{\rm Jeans} ( 1/(1 + \lambda_0' / 4 \pi G \rho_0)^{3/2})$. We clarify that due to the inhomogeneous nature of tides, this characteristic mass is incorrect. Under weak tides, the mass is $m \approx \rho\, l_1 l_2 l_3$, where the modifications to Jeans lengths along all three dimensions need to be considered; when the tide is strong enough, collapse can only occur once 1 or 2 dimensions. In the latter case, tides can stretch the gas, leading to the formation of filaments.
#### CSS_J154915.7+375506: A low-mass-ratio marginal contact binary system  with a hierarchical third body

 - **Abstract**
 We presented the multi-filter light curves of CSS_J154915.7+375506 inaugurally, which were observed by the 1.5 m AZT-22 telescope at Maidanak Astronomical Observatory. A low-resolution spectrum obtained by LAMOST reveals it is an A-type close binary. By analyzing the BVRI total-eclipse light curves, we are able to derive a reliable photometric solution for this system, which indicates that CSS_J154915.7+375506 is an extremely low-mass-ratio (q=0.138) marginal contact binary system. The location in the HR diagram shows that its secondary component with a much smaller mass is the more evolved one, indicating the mass ratio reversal occurred. The present secondary component had transferred a significant amount of mass to the present primary one. By the combination of a total of 20 times of minimum, we investigated its O-C curve. A periodic oscillation and a possible period decrease have been detected. As the period decreases, the system will evolve towards the contact phase. This makes CSS\_J154915.7+375506 a valuable case to study the formation scenario of contact binaries through mass reversal. The periodic oscillation suggested a third body with a minimal mass of $0.91\,M_{\odot}$, which is larger than that of the less massive component in the central binary. This implies that the secondary body was not replaced by the third body during early stellar interactions, indicating that it is a fossil system and retains its original dynamical information.
#### The GMRT High-Resolution Southern Sky Survey for pulsars and transients  -- VII: Timing of Spider MSP J1242-4712, A Bridge Between Redback and Black  Widow Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the timing solution for the 5.31-ms spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1242-4712, discovered with the GMRT. PSR J1242-4712 orbits a companion of minimum mass 0.08 M$_{\odot}$ with an orbital period of 7.7 hrs and occupies a relatively unexplored region in the orbital period versus companion mass space. We did not detect gamma-ray pulsations for this MSP, and also could not identify the optical counterpart for PSR J1242-4712 in available optical/near-infrared data. The profile of J1242-4712 evolves with frequency showing a clear single component at lower frequencies and a three-component profile at 650 MHz. PSR J1242-4712 eclipses for a very short duration near superior conjunction (orbital phase ~ 0.23-0.25) below 360 MHz. Moreover, significant DM delays and errors in pulse times of arrivals are observed near inferior conjunction (orbital phase ~ 0.7), along with an observed eclipse in one epoch at 650 MHz. Observed eclipses and significant orbital period variability suggest that PSR J1242-4712 is possibly not a He-WD binary, but has a semi or non-degenerate companion, indicating that this is a ``spider" MSP lying in a region between typical black widows and redbacks. This system may represent a distinct category of spider MSPs, displaying characteristics that bridge the gap between known black widow and redback MSPs.
#### Elemental abundances in the diffuse ISM from joint FUV and X-ray  spectroscopy: iron, oxygen, carbon and sulfur

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate interstellar absorption lines along the line of sight toward the galactic low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2. We combine absorption line data obtained from high-resolution X-ray spectra collected with Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites, along with Far-UV absorption lines observed by the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) Instrument. Our primary objective is to understand the abundance and depletion of oxygen, iron, sulfur, and carbon. To achieve this, we have developed an analysis pipeline that simultaneously fits both the UV and X-ray datasets. This novel approach takes into account the line spread function (LSF) of HST/COS, enhancing the precision of our results. We examine the absorption lines of FeII, SII, CII, and CI present in the FUV spectrum of Cygnus X-2, revealing the presence of at least two distinct absorbers characterized by different velocities. Additionally, we employ Cloudy simulations to compare our findings concerning the ionic ratios for the studied elements. We find that gaseous iron and sulfur exist in their singly ionized forms, Fe II and S II, respectively, while the abundances of CII and CI do not agree with the Cloudy simulations of the neutral ISM. Finally, we explore discrepancies in the X-ray atomic data of iron and discuss their impact on the overall abundance and depletion of iron.

 - **Abstract**
 The project aims to use machine learning algorithms to fit the free parameters of an isotopic scaling model to elemental observations. The processes considered are massive star nucleosynthesis, Type Ia SNe, the s-process, the r-process, and p-isotope production. The analysis on the successful fits seeks to minimize the reduced chi squared between the model and the data. Based upon the successful refinement of the isotopic parameterized scaling model, a table providing the 287 stable isotopic abundances as a function of metallicity, separated into astrophysical processes, is useful for identifying the chemical history of them. The table provides a complete averaged chemical history for the Galaxy, subject to the underlying model constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank anti-symmetric tensor fields, such as space-time torsion, in any natural phenomena. Here we address the possible explanation of torsion, which may often be identified with the field strength tensor of the second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field. Within the framework of f(R) gravity, we explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general higher curvature model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while the values of different cosmological parameters follow acceptable values in the framework of standard cosmology at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only for Starobinsky model (n = 2), the Kalb Ramond field gets naturally suppressed with cosmological evolution. In contrast, for other models (n both positive and negative), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar field associated with the higher derivative degree of freedom induces an enhancement in Kalb-Ramond field and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does note change even if we include the Cosmological Constant. Thus our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of space-time torsion along with a consistent cosmological evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft successfully impacted the Didymos-Dimorphos binary asteroid system on 2022 September 26 UTC. We provide an update to its pre-impact mutual orbit and estimate the post-impact physical and orbital parameters, derived using ground-based photometric observations taken from July 2022 to February 2023. We found that the total change of the orbital period was $-33.240 \pm 0.072$ min. (all uncertainties are 3$\sigma$). We obtained the eccentricity of the post-impact orbit to be $0.028 \pm 0.016$ and the apsidal precession rate of $7.3 \pm 2.0$ deg./day from the impact to 2022 December 2. The data taken later in December to February suggest that the eccentricity dropped close to zero or the orbit became chaotic approximately 70 days after the impact. Most of the period change took place immediately after the impact but in a few weeks following the impact it was followed by additional change of $-27^{+19}_{-58}$ seconds or $-19 \pm 18$ seconds (the two values depend on the approach we used to describe the evolution of the orbital period after the impact -- an exponentially decreasing angular acceleration or an assumption of a constant orbital period, which changed abruptly some time after the impact, respectively). We estimate the pre-impact Dimorphos-Didymos size ratio was $0.223 \pm 0.012$ and the post-impact is $0.202 \pm 0.018$, which indicates a marginally significant reduction of Dimorphos' volume by ($9 \pm 9) \%$ as the result of the impact.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the observations with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope of the black hole X-ray transient 4U~1543-47 during its outburst in 2021. We find a clear state transition during the outburst decay of the source. Using previous measurements of the black-hole mass and distance to the source, the source luminosity during this transition is close to the Eddington limit. The light curves before and after the transition can be fitted by two exponential functions with short ($\sim 16$ days) and long ($\sim 130$ days) decay time scales, respectively. We detect strong reflection features in all observations that can be described with either the RelxillNS or Reflionx_bb reflection models, both of which have a black-body incident spectrum. In the super-Eddington state, we observe a Comptonized component characterized by a low electron temperature of approximately 2.0 keV. We suggest that this component appears exclusively within the inner radiation-pressure dominated region of the supercritical disk as a part of the intrinsic spectrum of the accretion disk itself. This feature vanishes as the source transitions into the sub-Eddington state. The emissivity index of the accretion disk in the reflection component is significantly different before and after the transition, $\sim3.0$-$5.0$ and $\sim7.0$-$9.0$ in the super- and sub-Eddington states, respectively. Based on the reflection geometry of returning disk radiation, the geometrically thicker the accretion disk, the smaller the emissivity index. Therefore, we propose that the transition is primarily driven by the change of the accretion flow from a supercritical to a thin disk configuration.

 See thesis for complete abstract. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form in the early universe, and there are several mass windows in which their abundance today may be large enough to comprise a significant part of the dark matter density. Additionally, numerical relativity (NR) allows one to investigate the formation processes of PBHs in the fully nonlinear strong-gravity regime. In this thesis, we will describe the use of NR methods to study PBH formation, motivated in particular by open questions about the nonspherical effects PBH formation in a matter-dominated early universe. We demonstrate that superhorizon non-linear perturbations can collapse and form PBHs via the direct collapse or the accretion collapse mechanisms in a matter-dominated universe. The heaviest perturbations collapse via the direct collapse mechanism, while lighter perturbations trigger an accretion process that causes a rapid collapse of the ambient DM. From the hoop conjecture we propose an analytic criterion to determine whether a given perturbation will collapse via the direct or accretion mechanism and we compute the timescale of collapse. Independent of the formation mechanism, the PBH forms within an efold after collapse is initiated and with a small initial mass compared to the Hubble horizon, $M_\textrm{BH} H_0\sim 10^{-2}m_\mathrm{Pl}^2$. Finally, we find that PBH formation is followed by extremely rapid growth $M_\textrm{BH}\propto H^{-\beta}$ with $\beta\gg 1$, during which the PBH acquires most of its mass. Furthermore, we study the formation of spinning primordial black holes during an early matter-dominated era. Using non-linear 3+1D general relativistic simulations, we compute the efficiency of mass and angular momentum transfer in the process -- which we find to be $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of solid macroscopic grains (pebbles) in protoplanetary discs is the first step toward planet formation. We aim to study the distribution of pebbles and the chemical composition of their ice mantles in a young protoplanetary disc. We use the two-dimensional hydrodynamical code FEOSAD in the thin-disc approximation, which is designed to model the global evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disc taking into account dust coagulation and fragmentation, thermal balance, and phase transitions and transport of the main volatiles (H$_2$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$ and CO), which can reside in the gas, on small dust ($<1$ $\mu$m), on grown dust ($>1$ $\mu$m) and on pebbles. We model the dynamics of the protoplanetary disc from the cloud collapse to the 500 kyr moment. We determine the spatial distribution of pebbles and composition of their ice mantles and estimate the mass of volatiles on pebbles, grown dust and small dust. We show that pebbles form as early as 50 kyr after the disc formation and exist until the end of simulation (500 kyr), providing prerequisites for planet formation. All pebbles formed in the model are covered by icy mantles. Using a model considering accretion and desorption of volatiles onto dust/pebbles, we find that the ice mantles on pebbles consist mainly of H$_2$O and CO$_{2}$, and are carbon-depleted compared to gas and ices on small and grown dust, which contain more CO and CH$_4$. This suggests a possible dominance of oxygen in the composition of planets formed from pebbles under these conditions.

 We discuss some of the the open questions and the roadmap in the physics of primordial black holes. Black holes are the only dark matter candidate that is known to actually exit. Their conjectured primordial role is admittedly based on hypothesis rather than fact, most straightforwardly as a simple extension to the standard models of inflation, or even, in homage to quantum physics, more controversially via a slowing-down of Hawking evaporation. Regardless of one's stance on the theoretical basis for their existence, the possibility of primordial black holes playing a novel role in dark matter physics and gravitational wave astronomy opens up a rich astrophysical phenomenology that we lay out in this brief overview.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting members of open or globular clusters offer a great opportunity to study exoplanet populations systematically as stars within clusters provide a mostly homogeneous sample at least in chemical composition and stellar age. However, even though there have been coordinated efforts to search for exoplanets in stellar clusters, only a small number of planets has been detected. One successful example is the seven-year radial velocity (RV) survey "Search for giant planets in M67" of 88 stars in the open cluster M67 which led to the discovery of five giant planets, including three close-in ($P < 10$ days) hot-Jupiters. In this work, we continue and extend the observation of stars in M67 with the aim to search for additional planets. We conducted spectroscopic observations with the HPF, HARPS, HARPS-North, and SOPHIE spectrographs of 11 stars in M67. Six of our targets showed a variation or long-term trends in their RV during the original survey, while the other five were not observed in the original sample bringing the total number of stars to 93. An analysis of the radial velocities revealed one additional planet around the turn-off point star S1429 and gave solutions for the orbits of stellar companions around S2207 and YBP2018. S1429 b is a warm Jupiter on a likely circular orbit with a period of $77.48_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ days and a minimum mass $\text{M} \sin i = 1.80 \pm 0.2$ M$_\text{J}$. We update the hot-Jupiter occurrence rate in M67 to include the five new stars, deriving $4.2_{-2.3}^{+4.1} \%$ when considering all stars, and $5.4_{-3.0}^{+5.1} \%$ if binary star systems are removed.

 SRON (Netherlands Institute for Space Research) is developing the Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) for Athena X-IFU, whose Demonstration Model (DM) will use for the first time a time domain multiplexing (TDM)-based readout system for the on-board transition-edge sensors (TES). We report on the characterization activities on a TDM setup provided by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and tested in SRON cryogenic test facilities. The goal of these activities is to study the impact of the longer harness, closer to X-IFU specs, in a different EMI environment and switching from a single-ended to a differential readout scheme. In this contribution we describe the advancement in the debugging of the system in the SRON cryostat, which led to the demonstration of the nominal spectral performance of 2.8 eV at 5.9~keV with 16-row multiplexing, as well as an outlook for the future endeavours for the TDM readout integration on X-IFU's FPA-DM at SRON.

 - **Abstract**
 At SRON we have been developing X-ray TES micro-calorimeters as backup technology for the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) of the Athena mission, demonstrating excellent resolving powers both under DC and AC bias. We also developed a frequency-domain multiplexing (FDM) readout technology, where each TES is coupled to a superconducting band-pass LC resonator and AC biased at MHz frequencies through a common readout line. The TES signals are summed at the input of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which performs a first amplification at cryogenic stage. Custom analog front-end electronics and digital boards take care of further amplifying the signals at room temperature and of the modulation/demodulation of the TES signals and bias carrier, respectively. We report on the most recent developments on our FDM technology, which involves a two-channel demonstration with a total of 70 pixels with a summed energy resolution of 2.34 +/- 0.02 eV at 5.9 keV without spectral performance degradation with respect to single-channel operation. Moreover, we discuss prospects towards the scaling-up to a larger multiplexing factor up to 78 pixels per channel in a 1-6 MHz readout bandwidth.

 - **Abstract**
 We report new Very Large Array high-resolution observations of the radio jet from the outbursting high-mass star S255IR~NIRS3. The images at 6, 10, and 22.2 GHz confirm the existence of a new lobe emerging to the SW and expanding at a mean speed of ~285 km/s, about half as fast as the NE lobe. The new data allow us to reproduce both the morphology and the continuum spectrum of the two lobes with the model already adopted in our previous studies. We conclude that in all likelihood both lobes are powered by the same accretion outburst. We also find that the jet is currently fading down, recollimating, and recombining.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the various candidates for dark matter (DM), ultralight vector DM can be probed by laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors through the measurement of oscillating length changes in the arm cavities. In this context, KAGRA has a unique feature due to differing compositions of its mirrors, enhancing the signal of vector DM in the length change in the auxiliary channels. Here we present the result of a search for $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson DM using the KAGRA data from auxiliary length channels during the first joint observation run together with GEO600. By applying our search pipeline, which takes into account the stochastic nature of ultralight DM, upper bounds on the coupling strength between the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson and ordinary matter are obtained for a range of DM masses. While our constraints are less stringent than those derived from previous experiments, this study demonstrates the applicability of our method to the lower-mass vector DM search, which is made difficult in this measurement by the short observation time compared to the auto-correlation time scale of DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations by the Voyager and Cassini spacecrafts have revealed various striking features of the gap structure in Saturn's ring, such as the density waves, sharp edge, and vertical wall structure. In order to explain these features in a single simulation, we perform a high-resolution (N~10^6-10^7) global full N-body simulation of gap formation by an embedded satellite considering gravitational interactions and inelastic collisions among all ring particles and the satellite, while these features have been mostly investigated separately with different theoretical approaches: the streamline models, 1D diffusion models, and local N-body simulation. As a first attempt of a series of papers, we here focus on the gap formation by separating satellite migration with fixing the satellite orbit in a Keplerian circular orbit. We reveal how the striking gap features - the density waves, sharp edge, and vertical wall structure - are simultaneously formed by an interplay of the satellite-ring and ring particle-particle interactions. In particular, we propose a new mechanism to quantitatively explain the creation of the vertical wall structure at the gap edge. Inelastic collisions between ring particles damp their eccentricity excited by the satellite's perturbations to enhance the surface density at the gap edge, making its sharp edges more pronounced. We find the eccentricity damping process inevitably raises the vertical wall structures the most effectively in the second epicycle waves. Particle-particle collisions generally convert their lateral epicyclic motion into vertical motion. Because the excited epicyclic motion is the greatest near the ring edge and the epicycle motions are aligned in the first waves, the conversion is the most efficient in the gap edge of the second waves and the wall height is scaled by the satellite Hill radius, which are consistent with the observations.

 We report on our new calculations of unified line profiles of K perturbed by He using ab initio potential data for the conditions prevailing in cool substellar brown dwarfs and hot dense planetary atmospheres with temperatures from $T_\mathrm{eff}$=500~$\ \mathrm{K}$ to 3000~$\ \mathrm{K}$. For such objects with atmospheres of H$_2$ and He, conventional laboratory absorption spectroscopy can be used to examine the line wings and test the line shape theories and molecular potentials. We find that an analytical Lorentzian profile is useful for a few cm$^{-1}$ from the line center, but not in the line wings, where the radiative transfer is a consequence of the K-He radiative collisions that are sensitive to the interaction potentials. Tables of the K--He absorption coefficients of the resonance lines allow accurate model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. For this purpose, we present new opacities from comprehensive line shape theory incorporating accurate ab initio potentials. Use of these new tables for the modeling of emergent spectra will be an improvement over previous line shape approximations based on incomplete or inaccurate potentials. We also present Lorentzian impact parameters obtained in the semi-classical and quantum theory for the K $4s-4p$ resonance line centered at 0.77~$\mu$m specifically for the line core regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of time delay interferometry (TDI). Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, the inputs of our TDIR algorithm are interferometric measurements that have only undergone a 0.1 ms accuracy preliminary clock synchronization using the ground tracking data. This significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. In order to encode the information of time-varying light travel times and clock desynchronizations, we adopt a general polynomial parametrization to represent the delays. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of parameters exhibit a bias of only 5.28 ns from the ''true'' delays, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Furthermore, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar binaries are ubiquitous in the galaxy and a laboratory for astrophysical effects. We use TESS to study photometric modulations in the lightcurves of 162 unequal mass eclipsing binaries from the EBLM (Eclipsing Binary Low Mass) survey, comprising F/G/K primaries and M-dwarf secondaries. We detect modulations on 81 eclipsing binaries. We catalog the rotation rates of the primary star in 69 binaries and discover 17 ellipsoidal variables. In a large portion (at least $\sim 51\%$) of our sample, we detect photometric modulations consistent with two over-densities of spots on the primary star that are roughly $180^{\circ}$ apart. We show that these so-called active longitudes are preferentially at the sub- and anti-stellar points on the primary star. Physically, this means that the spots on the primary star preferentially face directly towards and away from the secondary star.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the theoretical biases affecting the asteroseismic grid-based estimates of stellar parameters in the presence of a mismatch between the heavy element mixture of observed stars and stellar models. We performed a controlled simulation adopting effective temperature, [Fe/H], average large frequency spacing, and frequency of maximum oscillation power as observational constraints. Synthetic stars were sampled from grids of stellar models computed with different [alpha/Fe] values from 0.0 to 0.4. The mass, radius, and age of these objects were then estimated by adopting a grid of models with a fixed [alpha/Fe] value of 0.0. The experiment was repeated assuming different sets of observational uncertainties. In the reference scenario, we adopted an uncertainty of 1.5% in seismic parameters, 50 K in effective temperature, and 0.05 dex in [Fe/H]. A higher uncertainty in the atmospheric constraints was also adopted in order to explore the impact on the precision of the observations of the estimated stellar parameters. Our simulations showed that estimated parameters are biased up to 3% in mass, 1.5% in radius, and 4% in age when the reference uncertainty scenario was adopted. These values correspond to 45%, 48%, and 16% of the estimated uncertainty in the stellar parameters. These biases in mass and radius disappear when adopting larger observational uncertainties because of the possibility of the fitting algorithm exploring a wider range of possible solutions. However, in this scenario, the age is significantly biased by -8%. Finally, we verified that the stellar mass, radius, and age can be estimated with a high accuracy by adopting a grid with the incorrect value of [alpha/Fe] if the metallicity [Fe/H] of the target is adjusted to match the Z in the fitting grid. In this scenario, the maximum bias in the age was reduced to 1.5%.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of spectral observations in the $\sim 84-92$ GHz frequency range of six objects in the southern sky containing dense cores and associated with regions of massive stars and star clusters formation are presented. The observations were carried out with the MOPRA-22m radio telescope. Within the framework of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation, the column densities and abundances of the H$^{13}$CN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HN$^{13}$C, HC$_3$N, c-C$_3$H$_2$, SiO, CH$_3$C$_2$H and CH$_3$CN molecules are calculated. Estimates of kinetic temperatures ($\sim 30-50$ K), sizes of emission regions ($\sim 0.2-3.1$ pc) and virial masses ($\sim 70-4600~M_{\odot}$) are obtained. The line widths in the three cores decrease with increasing distance from the center. In four cores, asymmetry in the profiles of the optically thick lines HCO$^+$(1-0) and HCN(1-0) is observed, indicating the presence of systematic motions along the line of sight. In two cases, the asymmetry can be caused by contraction of gas. The model spectral maps of HCO$^+$(1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1-0), obtained within the framework of the non-LTE spherically symmetric model, are fitted into the observed ones. The radial profiles of density ($\propto r^{-1.6}$), turbulent velocity ($\propto r^{-0.2}$), and contraction velocity ($\propto r^{0.5}$) in the G268.42--0.85 core have been calculated. The contraction velocity profile differs from that expected both in the case of free fall of gas onto a protostar ($\propto r^{-0.5}$), and in the case of global core collapse (contraction velocity does not depend on distance). A discussion of the obtained results is provided.

 - **Abstract**
 The CLEAN algorithm, first published by H\"{o}gbom and its later variants such as Multiscale CLEAN (msCLEAN) by Cornwell, has been the most popular tool for deconvolution in radio astronomy. Interferometric imaging used in aperture synthesis radio telescopes requires deconvolution for removal of the telescopes point spread function from the observed images. We have compared source fluxes produced by different implementations of H\"{o}gbom and msCLEAN (WSCLEAN, CASA) with a prototype implementation of H\"{o}gbom and msCLEAN for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) on two datasets. First is a simulation of multiple point sources of known intensity using H\"{o}gbom, where none of the software packages detected all the simulated point sources to within 1.0% of the simulated values. The second is of supernova remnant G055.7+3.4 taken by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) using msCLEAN, where each of the software packages produced different images for the same settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy submillimetre number counts are a fundamental measurement in our understanding of galaxy evolution models. Most early measurements are obtained via single-dish telescopes with substantial source confusion, whereas recent interferometric observations are limited to small areas. We used a large database of ALMA continuum observations to accurately measure galaxy number counts in multiple (sub)millimetre bands, thus bridging the flux density range between single-dish surveys and deep interferometric studies. We continued the Automated Mining of the ALMA Archive in the COSMOS Field project (A3COSMOS) and extended it with observations from the GOODS-South field (A3GOODSS). The database consists of ~4,000 pipeline-processed continuum images from the public ALMA archive, yielding 2,050 unique detected sources. To infer galaxy number counts, we constructed a method to reduce the observational bias inherent to targeted pointings that dominate the database. This method comprises a combination of image selection, masking, and source weighting. The effective area was calculated by accounting for inhomogeneous wavelengths, sensitivities, and resolutions and for spatial overlap between images. We tested and calibrated our method with simulations. We obtained the first number counts derived in a consistent and homogeneous way in four different ALMA bands covering a relatively large area. The results are consistent with number counts from the literature within the uncertainties. We extended the available depth in ALMA Band 4 by 0.4 dex with respect to previous studies. In Band 7, at the depth of the inferred number counts, ~40% of the cosmic infrared background is resolved into discrete sources. This fraction, however, decreases with wavelength, reaching ~4% in Band 3. Finally, we used the number counts to test models of dusty galaxy evolution, and find a good agreement within the uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we search for Globular Clusters (GCs) in the inner halo of the Circinus galaxy using a combination of observational data. Our dataset includes observations from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX), optical data from Gaia Release 3 (DR3), and observations from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). These multiple data sources provide a comprehensive basis for our analysis. Our search was concentrated within a 50 kpc radius from the centre, leading to the identification of 93 sources that met our established criteria. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted multiple examinations for sample contamination. These examinations incorporated tests based on Gaia Astrometric Excess Noise (AEN), the Blue Photometer (BP)/Red Photometer (RP) Excess Factor (BRexcess), as well as comparisons with stellar population models. This analysis confidently classified 41 sources as genuine GCs, as they successfully passed both the 3$\sigma$ Gaia AEN and BRexcess tests. We used the ISHAPE program to determine the structural parameters (half-light radii) of the GC candidates, with a peak effective radius of 4$\pm$ 0.5 pc. The catalogue mainly consists of bright GCs. Relationships between colour, size, and distance were found in the GC candidates, alongside confirmation of bi-modality in colour distributions.
#### On the (non-)degeneracy of massive neutrinos and elastic interactions in  the dark sector

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models featuring an elastic interaction in the dark sector at linear order has been shown to provide a promising scenario for alleviating the $\sigma_8$ tension. A natural question for these scenarios is whether there could be a degeneracy between the interaction and massive neutrinos that also contribute to erasing structures at late times. In this work we investigate the presence of such a degeneracy and show that the two effects do not exhibit strong correlations.
