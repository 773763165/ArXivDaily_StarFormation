#### Spectral energy distributions of classical cepheids in the Magellanic  Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) In this study, we constructed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 142 LMC and 77 SMC fundamental-mode classical Cepheids (CCs) using photometric data from the literature. When possible, the data were taken to be representative of mean light or averaged over the light curve. The sample was built from stars that either have a metallicity determination from high-resolution (HR) spectroscopy or have been used in Baade-Wesselink types of analyses, or have a radial velocity curve published in Gaia DR3 or have Walraven photometry, or have their light- and radial-velocity curves modelled by pulsation codes. The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature. Only one star with a significant infrared excess was found in the LMC and none in the SMC, suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW cepheids than in the Magellanic Clouds. For the large majority of stars, the position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is consistent with theoretical instability strips. Period-luminosity (PL) and period-radius relations were derived and compared to these relations in the MW. For a fixed slope, the zero point of the bolometric PL relation does not depend on metallicity, contrary to recent findings of a significant metallicity term when considering the PL relation in different photometric bands. An intriguing result concerns the flux-weighted gravity (FWG, a quantity derived from gravity and Teff) and its relation to period and luminosity. Both relations agree with theory, with the results for the MW, and with the independent estimates from the six known LMC eclipsing binaries that contain CCs. However, the FWG (as determined from dedicated HR spectroscopy for the sample) is too low by about 0.8 dex in 90 percent of the cases.
#### $\texttt{BTSbot}$: A Multi-input Convolutional Neural Network to  Automate and Expedite Bright Transient Identification for the Zwicky  Transient Facility
 - **Authors:** Nabeel Rehemtulla, Adam A. Miller, Michael W. Coughlin, Theophile Jegou du Laz

 - **Abstract**
 The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) relies on visual inspection ("scanning") to select sources for accomplishing its mission of spectroscopically classifying all bright extragalactic transients found by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We present $\texttt{BTSbot}$, a multi-input convolutional neural network, which provides a bright transient score to individual ZTF detections using their image data and 14 extracted features. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ eliminates the need for scanning by automatically identifying and requesting follow-up observations of new bright ($m\,<18.5\,\mathrm{mag}$) transient candidates. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ outperforms BTS scanners in terms of completeness (99% vs. 95%) and identification speed (on average, 7.4 hours quicker).

 - **Abstract**
 Solar-type prestellar cores and protostars display large amounts of deuterated organic molecules. Recent findings on CHD$_2$OH and CD$_3$OH toward IRAS 16293-2422 suggest that even fully deuterated methanol, CD$_3$OD, may be detectable as well. However, searches for CD$_3$OD are hampered in particular by the lack of intensity information from a spectroscopic model. The objective of the present investigation is to develop a spectroscopic model of CD$_3$OD in low-lying torsional states that is sufficiently accurate to facilitate searches for this isotopolog in space. We carried out a new measurement campaign for CD$_3$OD involving two spectroscopic laboratories that covers the 34 GHz-1.1 THz range. A torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed for our analysis. Our resulting model describes the ground and first excited torsional states of CD$_3$OD well up to quantum numbers $J \leq 51$ and $K_a \leq 23$. We derived a line list for radio-astronomical observations from this model that is accurate up to at least 1.1 THz and should be sufficient for all types of radio-astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog. This line list was used to search for CD$_3$OD in data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293$-$2422 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. While we found several emission features that can be attributed largely to CD$_3$OD, their number is still not sufficiently high enough to establish a clear detection. Nevertheless, the estimate of 2$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ derived for the CD$_3$OD column density may be viewed as an upper limit that can be compared to column densities of CD$_3$OH, CH$_3$OD, and CH$_3$OH. The comparison indicates that the CD$_3$OD column density toward IRAS 16293-2422 is in line with the enhanced D/H ratios observed for multiply deuterated complex organic molecules.
#### Another look at the dayside spectra of WASP-43b and HD 209458b: are  there scattering clouds?

 - **Abstract**
 The search for clouds on the dayside of hot Jupiters has been disadvantaged due to hot Jupiters having a limited number of high quality space-based observations. To date, retrieval studies have found no evidence for grey clouds on the dayside, however none of these studies explored the impact of scattering clouds. In this study we reanalyse the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b considering the different Spitzer data in the literature. We find that, in 2 of the 4 data sets explored, retrieving with a model that contains a scattering cloud is favoured over a cloud free model by a confidence of 3.13 - 3.36 $\sigma$. The other 2 data sets finds no evidence for scattering clouds. We find that the retrieved H$_2$O abundance is consistent regardless of the Spitzer data used and is consistent with literature values. We perform the same analysis for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b and find no evidence for dayside clouds, consistent with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival near-infrared observations from the Keck and Lick Observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope, we document the evolution of Neptune's cloud activity from 1994 to 2022. We calculate the fraction of Neptune's disk that contained clouds, as well as the average brightness of both cloud features and cloud-free background over the planet's disk. We observe cloud activity and brightness maxima during 2002 and 2015, and minima during 2007 and 2020, the latter of which is particularly deep. Neptune's lack of cloud activity in 2020 is characterized by a near-total loss of clouds at mid-latitudes and continued activity at the South Pole. We find that the periodic variations in Neptune's disk-averaged brightness in the near-infrared H (1.6 $\mu$m), K (2.1 $\mu$m), FWCH4P15 (893 nm), F953N (955 nm), FWCH4P15 (965 nm), and F845M (845 nm) bands are dominated by discrete cloud activity, rather than changes in the background haze. The clear positive correlation we find between cloud activity and Solar Lyman-Alpha (121.56 nm) irradiance lends support to the theory that the periodicity in Neptune's cloud activity results from photochemical cloud/haze production triggered by Solar ultraviolet emissions.
#### Using spectral modeling to break light-curve degeneracies of type II  supernovae interacting with circumstellar material

 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of red-supergiant stars seem to be enshrouded by circumstellar material (CSM) at the time of explosion. Relative to explosions in a vacuum, this CSM causes both a luminosity boost at early times as well as the presence of symmetric emission lines with a narrow core and electron-scattering wings typical of type IIn supernovae (SNe). For this study, we performed radiation-hydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculations for a variety of CSM configurations (i.e., compact, extended, and detached) and documented the resulting ejecta and radiation properties. We find that models with a dense, compact, and massive CSM of ~0.5Msun can match the early luminosity boost of type II-P SNe but fail to produce type IIn-like spectral signatures (aka ``flash features''). These only arise if the photon mean free path in the CSM is large enough (i.e, if the density is low enough) to allow for a radiative precursor through a long-lived (i.e., a day to a week), radially extended unshocked optically thick CSM. The greater radiative losses and kinetic-energy extraction in this case boost the luminosity even for modest CSM masses -- this boost is delayed for a detached CSM. The inadequate assumption of high CSM density, in which the shock travels quasi adiabatically, overestimates the CSM mass and associated mass-loss rate. Our simulations also indicate that type IIn-like spectral signatures last as long as there is optically-thick unshocked CSM. Constraining the CSM structure therefore requires a combination of light curves and spectra, rather than photometry alone. We emphasize that for a given total energy, the radiation excess fostered by the presence of CSM comes at the expense of kinetic energy, as evidenced by the disappearance of the fastest ejecta material and the accumulation of mass in a dense shell. Both effects can be constrained from spectra well after the interaction phase.
#### Discovery of the elusive carbonic acid (HOCOOH) in space

 - **Abstract**
 After a quarter century since the detection of the last interstellar carboxylic acid, acetic acid (CH$_3$COOH), we report the discovery of a new one, the \textit{cis-trans} form of carbonic acid (HOCOOH), toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. HOCOOH stands as the first interstellar molecule containing three oxygen atoms and also the third carboxylic acid detected so far in the interstellar medium. Albeit the limited available laboratory measurements (up to 65 GHz), we have also identified several pairs of unblended lines directly in the astronomical data (between 75-120 GHz), which allowed us to slightly improve the set of spectroscopic constants. We derive a column density for \textit{cis-trans} HOCOOH of $N$ = (6.4 $\pm$ 0.4) $\times$ 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which yields an abundance with respect to molecular H$_2$ of 4.7 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Meanwhile, the extremely low dipole moment (about fifteen times lower) of the lower-energy conformer, \textit{cis-cis} HOCOOH, precludes its detection. We obtain an upper limit to its abundance with respect to H$_2$ of $\leq$ 1.2 $\times$10$^{-9}$, which suggests that \textit{cis-cis} HOCOOH might be fairly abundant in interstellar space, although it is nearly undetectable by radio astronomical observations. We derive a \textit{cis-cis}/\textit{cis-trans} ratio $\leq$ 25, consistent with the smaller energy difference between both conformers compared with the relative stability of \textit{trans-} and \textit{cis}-formic acid (HCOOH). Finally, we compare the abundance of these acids in different astronomical environments, further suggesting a relationship between the chemical content found in the interstellar medium and the chemical composition of the minor bodies of the Solar System, which could be inherited during the star formation process.
