 - **Abstract**
 We report discovery and characterization of a main-sequence G star orbiting a dark object with mass $1.90\pm 0.04\,M_{\odot}$. The system was discovered via Gaia astrometry and has an orbital period of 731 days. We obtained multi-epoch RV follow-up over a period of 600 days, allowing us to refine the Gaia orbital solution and precisely constrain the masses of both components. The luminous star is a $\gtrsim 12$ Gyr-old, low-metallicity halo star near the main-sequence turnoff ($T_{\rm eff} \approx 6000$ K; $\log\left(g/\left[{\rm cm\,s^{-2}}\right]\right)\approx 4.0; \rm [Fe/H]\approx-1.25$; $M\approx0.79\,M_{\odot}$) with a highly enhanced lithium abundance. The RV mass function sets a minimum companion mass for an edge-on orbit of $M_2 > 1.67\,M_{\odot}$, well above the Chandrasekhar limit. The Gaia inclination constraint, $i=68.8\pm 1.4$ deg, then implies a companion mass of $M_2= 1.90\pm 0.04\,M_{\odot}$. The companion is most likely a massive neutron star: the only viable alternative is two massive white dwarfs in a close binary, but this scenario is disfavored on evolutionary grounds. The system's low eccentricity ($e=0.122\pm 0.003$) disfavors dynamical formation channels and implies that the neutron star formed with very little mass loss ($\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$) and with a weak natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$). The current orbit is too small to have accommodated the neutron star progenitor as a red supergiant or super-AGB star. The simplest formation scenario -- isolated binary evolution -- requires the system to have survived stable mass transfer or common envelope evolution with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $>10$. The system, which we call Gaia NS1, is likely a progenitor of symbiotic X-ray binaries and long-period millisecond pulsars. Its discovery challenges binary evolution models and bodes well for Gaia's census of compact objects in wide binarie

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution spectral study of Fe L-shell extinction by the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the direction of the X-ray binaries Cygnus X-1 and GX 339-4, using the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometer. The majority of interstellar Fe is suspected to condense into dust grains in the diffuse ISM, but the compounds formed from this process are unknown. Here, we use the laboratory cross sections from Kortright & Kim (2000) and Lee et al. (2009) to model the absorption and scattering profiles of metallic Fe, and the crystalline compounds fayalite (Fe$_2$SiO$_4$), ferrous sulfate (FeSO$_4$), hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), and lepidocrocite ($\gamma$-FeOOH), which have oxidation states ranging from Fe$^{0}$ to Fe$^{3+}$. We find that the observed Fe L-shell features are systematically offset in energy from the laboratory measurements. An examination of over two dozen published measurements of Fe L-shell absorption finds a 1-2 eV scatter in energy positions of the L-shell features. Motivated by this, we fit for the best energy-scale shift simultaneously with the fine structure of the Fe L-shell extinction cross sections. Hematite and lepidocrocite provide the best fits ($\approx +1.1$ eV shift), followed by fayalite ($\approx +1.8$ eV shift). However, fayalite is disfavored, based on the implied abundances and knowledge of ISM silicates gained by infrared astronomical observations and meteoritic studies. We conclude that iron oxides in the Fe$^{3+}$ oxidation state are good candidates for Fe-bearing dust. To verify this, new absolute photoabsorption measurements are needed on an energy scale accurate to better than 0.2 eV.

 - **Abstract**
 In the recent Astro2020 Decadal Report, ''Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s'' Adaptive Optics (AO) was identified as a crucial technology for a variety of reasons. These included an emphasis on high-contrast imaging and AO systems as being part of future technology development especially with application to the two US ELT projects. Instrument upgrades were also identified for existing 4m to 10m class telescopes which would incorporate upgrades to existing AO systems. As noted in the Report: (1) ''the central role of AO instrumentation and the importance of further development are rapidly growing, with novel concepts pushing toward wider area'', (2) ''Visible AO has high potential scientific return by opening up an entire wavelength regime to high angular resolution studies. The goal is to exploit the smaller diffraction limit of telescopes in the optical, yet both the coherence length and time decrease at shorter wavelengths requiring wavefront sensing at high spatial and temporal frequencies that are currently technologically challenging. This is an important developing area for the 2020s - 2030s.'', and (3) ''Such investments in AO systems development is a key risk mitigation strategy for ELTs, whose full resolution and sensitivity potential can only be realized with AO, and which is recognized as the most important technical risk for both GMT and TMT''. A workshop was held in May, 2023 to develop a Community Response document (this document) to provide feedback and suggested priorities to various funding agencies, such as NSF, NASA, and DoE, as to the AO Research and Development priorities to meet the technical and science objectives outlined in Astro2020 for ground-based AO, both stand-alone and in support of space missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of planetary transits in the light curves of active stars, featuring correlated noise in the form of stellar variability, remains a challenge. Depending on the noise characteristics, we show that the traditional technique that consists of detrending a light curve before searching for transits alters their signal-to-noise ratio, and hinders our capability to discover exoplanets transiting rapidly-rotating active stars. We present nuance, an algorithm to search for transits in light curves while simultaneously accounting for the presence of correlated noise, such as stellar variability and instrumental signals. We assess the performance of nuance on simulated light curves as well as on the TESS light curves of 438 rapidly-rotating M dwarfs. For each dataset, we compare our method to 5 commonly-used detrending techniques followed by a search with the Box-Least-Square algorithm. Overall, we demonstrate that nuance is the most performant method in 93% of cases, leading to both the highest number of true positives and the lowest number of false positive detections. Although simultaneously searching for transits while modeling correlated noise is expected to be computationally expensive, we make our algorithm tractable and available as the JAX-powered Python package nuance, allowing its use on distributed environments and GPU devices. Finally, we explore the prospects offered by the nuance formalism, and its use to advance our knowledge of planetary systems around active stars, both using space-based surveys and sparse ground-based observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We address in this work the nature and evolution of the long-period compact star sources, which has recently added several unexpected members. The central hypothesis is that particle winds drive their evolution, being an important factor for these relatively old sources. We show the consistency of this picture and remark some unsolved problems and caveats within it.
#### The Diffusion Limit of Photoevaporation in Primordial Planetary  Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporation is thought to play an important role in the early planetary evolution. In this study, we investigate the diffusion limit of X-ray and ultraviolet induced photoevaporation in primordial atmospheres. We find that compositional fractionation resulting from mass loss is more significant than currently recognized because it is controlled by the conditions at the top of the atmosphere, where particle collisions are less frequent. Such fractionation at the top of the atmosphere develops a compositional gradient that extends downward. Mass outflow eventually reaches a steady state in which hydrogen loss is diffusion limited. We derive new analytic expressions for the diffusion-limited mass loss rate and the crossover mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We study how close passages of interstellar objects of planetary and substellar masses may affect the immediate and long-term dynamics of the Solar system. We consider two nominal approach orbits, namely, the orbits of actual interstellar objects 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, assuming them to be typical or representative for interstellar swarms of matter. Thus, the nominal orbits of the interloper in our models cross the inner part of the Solar system. Series of massive numerical experiments are performed, in which the interloper's mass is varied with a small step over a broad range. We find that, even if a Jovian-mass interloper does not experience close encounters with the Solar system planets (and this holds for our nominal orbits), our planetary system can be destabilised on timescales as short as several million years. In what concerns substellar-mass interlopers (free-floating brown dwarfs), an immediate (on a timescale of $\sim 10 - 100$ yr) consequence of such a MISO flyby is a sharp increase in the orbital eccentricities and inclinations of the outer planets. On an intermediate timescale ($\sim 10^3 - 10^5$ yr after the MISO flyby), Uranus or Neptune can be ejected from the system, as a result of their mutual close encounters and encounters with Saturn. On a secular timescale ($\sim 10^6 - 10^7$ yr after the MISO flyby), the perturbation wave formed by secular planetary interactions propagates from the outer Solar system to its inner zone.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of a Fourier analysis of high-precision Kepler photometry of 75 double-mode RR~Lyrae (RRd) stars observed during NASA's K2 Mission (2014-18) are presented. Seventy-two of the stars are `classical' RRd (cRRd) stars lying along a well-defined curve in the Petersen diagram and showing no evidence of Blazhko modulations. The remaining three stars are `anomalous' RRd (aRRd) stars that lie well below the cRRd curve in the Petersen diagram. These stars have larger fundamental-mode amplitudes than first-overtone amplitudes and exhibit Blazhko variations. Period-amplitude relations for the individual pulsation components of the cRRd stars are examined, as well as correlations involving Fourier phase-difference and amplitude-ratio parameters that characterize the light curves for the two radial modes. A simple statistical model relating the fundamental (P0) and first-overtone (P1) periods to [Fe/H] provides insight into the functional form of the Petersen diagram. A calibration equation for estimating [Fe/H]phot abundances of `classical' RRd stars is derived by inverting the model and using 211 field and 57 globular cluster cRRd stars with spectroscopic metallicities to estimate the model coefficients. The equation is used to obtain [Fe/H]phot for the full sample of 72 K2 cRRd stars and for 2130 cRRd stars observed by the ESA Gaia Mission. Of the 49 K2 cRRd stars that are in the Gaia DR3 catalogue only five were found to be correctly classified, the remainder having been misclassified `RRc' or `RRab'.
#### Study of solar brightness profiles in the 18-26 GHz frequency range with  INAF radio telescopes II. Evidence for coronal emission

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most important objectives of solar physics is the physical understanding of the solar atmosphere, the structure of which is also described in terms of the density (N) and temperature (T) distributions of the atmospheric matter. Several multi-frequency analyses show that the characteristics of these distributions are still debated, especially for the outer coronal emission. We aim to constrain the T and N distributions of the solar atmosphere through observations in the centimetric radio domain. We employ single-dish observations from two of the INAF radio telescopes at the K-band frequencies (18 - 26 GHz). We investigate the origin of the significant brightness temperature ($T_B$) level that we detected up to the upper corona ($\sim 800$ Mm of altitude with respect to the photospheric solar surface). To probe the physical origin of the atmospheric emission and to constrain instrumental biases, we reproduced the solar signal by convolving specific 2D antenna beam models. The analysis of the solar atmosphere is performed by adopting a physical model that assumes the thermal bremsstrahlung as the emission mechanism, with specific T and N distributions. The modelled $T_B$ profiles are compared with those observed by averaging solar maps obtained during the minimum of solar activity (2018 - 2020). The T and N distributions are compatible (within $25\%$ of uncertainty) with the model up to $\sim 60$ Mm and $\sim 100$ Mm of altitude, respectively. The analysis of the role of the antenna beam pattern on our solar maps proves the physical nature of the atmospheric emission in our images up to the coronal tails seen in our $T_B$ profiles. The challenging analysis of the coronal radio emission at higher altitudes, together with the data from satellite instruments will require further multi-frequency measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy comprising three main components: the Bulge, the Disk, and the Halo. Of particular interest is the Galactic disk, which holds a significant portion of the baryonic matter angular momentum and harbors at least two primary stellar populations: the thin and thick disks. Understanding the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk is crucial for comprehending the origins and development of our Galaxy. Stellar archaeology offers a means to probe the disk's evolution by listening to the cosmological narratives of its oldest and most pristine stars, specifically the metal-poor stars. In this study, we employed accurate photometric metallicity estimates and Gaia Early Data Release 3 astrometry to curate a pure sample of the oldest Galactic stars. This proceeding presents a summary of our primary findings.
#### A Strontium-rich Ultra Metal-poor Star in the Atari Disk Component

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of the first ultra metal-poor (UMP) star 2MASS~J20500194$-$6613298 (J2050$-$6613; \mbox{[Fe/H] = $-4.05$}) selected from the Gaia BP/RP spectral catalog that belongs to the ancient Atari disk component. We obtained a high-resolution spectrum for the star with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay telescope. J2050$-$6613 displays a typical chemical abundance pattern for UMP stars, including carbon and zinc enhancements. In contrast, J2050$-$6613 shows extremely high [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/Ba] ratios compared to other stars in the [Fe/H] $<-4.0$ regime. J2050$-$6613 is most likely an early Population\,II star that formed from a gas cloud that was chemically enriched by a massive Population\,III hypernova (E $> 10^{52}$\,erg). Such a Population\,III core-collapse hypernova could simultaneously explain the origin of the abundance pattern of light and heavy elements of 2MASS~J2050$-$6613 if a large amount of Sr of $\sim10^{-5}$\,M$_{\odot}$ was produced, possibly by neutrino-driven \textbf{(wind)} ejecta. Therefore, the abundance pattern of 2MASS~J2050$-$6613 places important constraints on Sr-producing nucleosynthesis sources operating in the Atari progenitor at the earliest times.
#### cortecs: A Python package for compressing opacities

 - **Abstract**
 The absorption and emission of light by exoplanet atmospheres encode details of atmospheric composition, temperature, and dynamics. Fundamentally, simulating these processes requires detailed knowledge of the opacity of gases within an atmosphere. When modeling broad wavelength ranges at high resolution, such opacity data for even a single gas can take up multiple gigabytes of system random-access memory (RAM). This aspect can be a limiting factor when considering the number of gases to consider in a simulation, the sampling strategy used for inference, or even the architecture of the system used for calculations. Here, we present cortecs, a Python tool for compressing opacity data. cortecs provides flexible methods for fitting the temperature, pressure, and wavelength dependencies of opacity data and for evaluating the opacity with accelerated, GPU-friendly methods. The package is actively developed on GitHub (https://github.com/arjunsavel/cortecs), and it is available for download with pip.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise measurement of neutron star (NS) spins can provide important insight into the formation and evolution of compact binaries containing NS. While traditional methods of NS spin measurement rely on pulsar observations, gravitational wave detections offer a complementary avenue. However, determining component spins with gravitational waves is hindered by the small dimensionless spins of the NS and the degeneracy in the mass and spin parameters. This degeneracy can be addressed by the inclusion of higher-order modes in the waveform, which are important for systems with unequal masses. This study shows the suitability of neutron star-black hole mergers, which are naturally mass-asymmetric, for precise NS spin measurements. We explore the effects of the black hole masses and spins, higher-mode content, inclination angle, and detector sensitivity on the measurement of NS spin. We find that networks with next-generation observatories like the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope can distinguish NS dimensionless spin of 0.04 (0.1) from zero at $1-\sigma$ confidence for events within $\sim 350$ $(\sim 1000)$ Mpc. Networks with A+ and A$^{\sharp}$ detectors achieve similar distinction within $\sim 30$ $(\sim 70)$ Mpc and $\sim 50$ $(\sim 110)$ Mpc, respectively.
#### The TESS-Keck Survey. XVIII. A sub-Neptune and spurious long-period  signal in the TOI-1751 system

 - **Abstract**
 We present and confirm TOI-1751 b, a transiting sub-Neptune orbiting a slightly evolved, solar-type, metal-poor star ($T_{eff} = 5996 \pm 110$ K, $log(g) = 4.2 \pm 0.1$, V = 9.3 mag, [Fe/H] = $-0.40 \pm 0.06$ dex) every 37.47 d. We use TESS photometry to measure a planet radius of $2.77_{-0.07}^{+0.15}~\rm{R_\oplus}$. We also use both Keck/HIRES and APF/Levy radial velocities (RV) to derive a planet mass of $14.5_{-3.14}^{+3.15} ~\rm{M_\oplus}$, and thus a planet density of $3.6 \pm 0.9 \, {\rm g}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. There is also a long-period ($\sim400~\rm{d}$) signal that is observed in only the Keck/HIRES data. We conclude that this long-period signal is not planetary in nature, and is likely due to the window function of the Keck/HIRES observations. This highlights the role of complementary observations from multiple observatories to identify and exclude aliases in RV data. Finally, we investigate potential compositions of this planet, including rocky and water-rich solutions, as well as theoretical irradiated ocean models. TOI-1751 b is a warm sub-Neptune, with an equilibrium temperature of $\sim 820$ K. As TOI-1751 is a metal-poor star, TOI-1751 b may have formed in a water-enriched formation environment. We thus favor a volatile-rich interior composition for this planet.
#### Central-surface-densities correlation in general MOND theories

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07159
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07159
 - **Abstract**
 It is shown that the foundational axioms of MOND alone predict a strong correlation between a bulk measure of the baryonic surface density, $\Sigma_B$, and the corresponding dynamical one, $\Sigma_D$, of an isolated object, such as a galaxy. The correlation is encapsulated by its high- and low-$\Sigma_B$ behaviors. For $\Sigma_B\gg\Sigma_M\equiv a_0/2\pi G$ ($\Sigma_M$ is the critical MOND surface density) one has $\Sigma_D\approx\Sigma_B$. Their difference -- which would be interpreted as the contribution of dark matter -- is $\Sigma_P=\Sigma_D-\Sigma_B\sim\Sigma_M\ll\Sigma_B$. In the deep-MOND limit, $\Sigma_B\ll\Sigma_M$, one has $\Sigma_D\sim (\Sigma_M\Sigma_B)^{1/2}$. This is a primary prediction of MOND, shared by all theories that embody its basic tenets. Sharper correlations, even strict algebraic relations, $\Sigma_D(\Sigma_B)$, are predicted in specific MOND theories, for specific classes of mass distribution -- e.g., pure discs, or spherical systems -- and for specific definitions of the surface densities. I proceed to discuss such tighter correlations for the central surface densities of axisymmetric galactic systems, $\Sigma^0_B$ and $\Sigma^0_D$. Past work has demonstrated such relations for pure discs in the AQUAL and QUMOND theories. Here I consider them in broader classes of MOND theories. For most observed systems, $\Sigma^0_D$ can not be determined directly at present, but, in many cases, a good proxy for it is the acceleration integral $\mathcal{G}\equiv\int_0^\infty g_r d\ln~r$, where $g_r$ is the radial acceleration along a reflection symmetry of a system, such as a disc galaxy. $\mathcal{G}$ can be determined directly from the rotation curve. I discuss the extent to which $\mathcal{G}$ is a good proxy for $\Sigma^0_D$, and how the relation between them depends on system geometry, from pure discs, through disc-plus-bulge ones, to quasi-spherical systems.
#### The orbital evolution of the tidally stripped star and disk-driven  stable mass transfer for QPEs in GSN 069

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07177
 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is possibly mass loss at the periastron of a body moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a high eccentric orbit. Such a tidally stripped star is expected to radiate gravitational wave thereby leading to shrinkage of the periastron distance, and thus will eventually be disrupted by the SMBH in the previous studies. This scenario predicts a gradually increasing mass transfer, contradicting the observed decay in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. In this paper, we first revisited the orbital evolution of the stripped star. The effect of the mass transfer finally dominates the orbital evolution, resulting in the stripped star finally escaping the SMBH rather than being disrupted by it. Then we suggested a model of a tidal stripped WD moving inside an accretion disk for QPEs in GSN 069. The drag force by the disk can effectively reduce mass transfer and thus explain the observed decay in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. The disk is likely a fallback disk of the tidal disruption event in GSN 069. Considering the evolution of its accretion rate, the increase in the intensity of the latest eruption can also be explained.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-677 b is part of an emerging class of ``tidally-detached'' gas giants ($a/R_\star \gtrsim 11$) that exhibit large orbital eccentricities and yet low stellar obliquities. Such sources pose a challenge for models of giant planet formation, which must account for the excitation of high eccentricities without large changes in the orbital inclination. In this work, we present a new Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) measurement for the tidally-detached warm Jupiter TOI-677 b, obtained using high-precision radial velocity observations from the PFS/Magellan spectrograph. Combined with previously published observations from the ESPRESSO/VLT spectrograph, we derive one of the most precisely constrained sky-projected spin-orbit angle measurements to date for an exoplanet. The combined fit offers a refined set of self-consistent parameters, including a low sky-projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda=3.2^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ deg and a moderately high eccentricity of $e=0.460^{+0.019}_{-0.018}$, that further constrains the puzzling architecture of this system. We examine several potential scenarios that may have produced the current TOI-677 orbital configuration, ultimately concluding that TOI-677 b most likely had its eccentricity excited through disk-planet interactions. This system adds to a growing population of aligned warm Jupiters on eccentric orbits around hot ($T_{\rm eff}>6100$ K) stars.

 - **Abstract**
 When low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve off the main sequence, they expand and cool into the red giant stages of evolution, which include those associated with shell H burning (the red giant branch), core He burning (the red clump), and shell He burning (the asymptotic giant branch). The majority of red giants have masses $< 2 M_\odot$, and red giants more massive than this are often excluded from major studies. Here we present a study of the highest-mass stars ($M > 3.0 M_\odot$) in the Kepler sample of 16,000 red giants. We begin by re-estimating their global seismic properties with new light curves, highlighting the differences between using the SAP and PDCSAP light curves provided by Kepler. We use the re-estimated properties to derive new mass estimates for the stars, ending with a final sample of 48 confirmed high-mass stars. We explore their oscillation envelopes, confirming the trends found in recent works such as low mean mode amplitude and wide envelopes. We find, through probabilistic means, that our sample is likely all core He burning stars. We measure their dipole and quadrupole mode visibilities and confirm that the dipole mode visibility tends to decrease with mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed structural and gas kinematic study of the star-forming complex W5-NW. A cloud-cloud collision scenario unravels with evidences of collision induced star and cluster formation. Various signatures of cloud-cloud collision such as "complementary distribution" and "bridging-features" are explored. At the colliding region, the two clouds have complementary morphologies, where W5-NWb has a filamentary key-like shape which fits into the U-shaped cavity in W5-NWa that behaves like a keyhole. The interaction region between the two clouds is characterised by bridging features with intermediate velocities connecting the two clouds. A skewed V-shaped bridging feature is also detected at the site of collision. A robust picture of the molecular gas distribution highlighting the bridges is seen in the position-position-velocity diagram obtained using the SCOUSEPY algorithm. Star cluster formation with an over-density of Class I and Class II young stellar objects is also seen towards this cloud complex, likely triggered by the cloud collision event.

 - **Abstract**
 Helioseismology has revealed an increase in the rotation rate with depth in a thin ($\sim$30 Mm) near-surface layer. The normalized rotational shear in this layer is independent of latitude. This rotational state is shown to be a consequence of the short characteristic time of near-surface convection compared to the rotation period, and the radial anisotropy of the convective turbulence. Analytical derivations within mean-field hydrodynamics reproduce the observed normalized rotational shear and are in agreement with numerical experiments on the radiative hydrodynamics of solar convection. The near-surface shear layer is the source of the global meridional flow important for the solar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme environments of ultra-short-period planets (USPs) make excellent laboratories to study how exoplanets obtain, lose, retain, and/or regain gaseous atmospheres. We present the confirmation and characterization of the USP TOI-1347 b, a $1.8 \pm 0.1$ R$_\oplus$ planet on a 0.85 day orbit that was detected with photometry from the TESS mission. We measured radial velocities of the TOI-1347 system using Keck/HIRES and HARPS-N and found the USP to be unusually massive at $11.1 \pm 1.2$ M$_\oplus$. The measured mass and radius of TOI-1347 b imply an Earth-like bulk composition. A thin H/He envelope (>0.01% by mass) can be ruled out at high confidence. The system is between 1 and 1.8 Gyr old; therefore, intensive photoevaporation should have concluded. We detected a tentative phase curve variation (3$\sigma$) and a secondary eclipse (2$\sigma$) in TESS photometry, which if confirmed could indicate the presence of a high-mean-molecular-weight atmosphere. We recommend additional optical and infrared observations to confirm the presence of an atmosphere and investigate its composition.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze data retrieved by the Imaging Science System onboard the Cassini spacecraft to study the horizontal velocity and vorticity fields of Saturn's Polar Regions (latitudes 60-90$^\circ$N in June-December 2013 and 60-90$^\circ$S in October 2006 and July-December 2008), including the Northern region where the hexagonal wave is prominent. With the aid of an automated two dimensional correlation algorithm we determine two-dimensional maps of zonal and meridional winds, and deduce vorticity maps. We extract zonal averages of zonal winds, providing wind profiles that reach latitudes as high 89.5$^\circ$ in the south and 89.9$^\circ$ in the north. Wind measurements cover the intense polar cyclonic vortices that reach similar peak velocities of 150 ms-1 at 88.5$^\circ$. The hexagonal wave lies in the core of an intense eastward jet at planetocentric latitude 75.8$^\circ$N with motions that become non-zonal at the hexagonal feature. In the south hemisphere the peak of the eastward jet is located at planetocentric latitude 70.4$^\circ$S. A large anticyclone (the South Polar Spot, SPS), similar to the North Polar Spot (NPS) observed at the Voyager times (1980-81), has been observed in images from April 2008 to January 2009 in the South Polar Region at latitude -66.1$^\circ$ close to the eastward jet. The SPS does not apparently excite a wave on the jet. We analyze the stability of the zonal jets, finding potential instabilities at the flanks of the eastward jets around 70$^\circ$ and we measure the eddy wind components, suggesting momentum transfer from eddy motion to the westward jets closer to the poles.

 Searching the data of gravitational-wave detectors for signals from compact binary mergers is a computationally demanding task. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been proposed to address current and future challenges. However, the results of these publications often differ greatly due to differing choices in the evaluation procedure. The Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Challenge was organized to resolve these issues and produce a unified framework for machine-learning search evaluation. Six teams submitted contributions, four of which are based on machine learning methods and two are state-of-the-art production analyses. This paper describes the submission from the team TPI FSU Jena and its updated variant. We also apply our algorithm to real O3b data and recover the relevant events of the GWTC-3 catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of modeling spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for blazars, we extend the method that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to include external inverse Compton processes. The model assumes that relativistic electrons within the emitting region can interact and up-scatter external photon originating from the accretion disk, the broad-line region, and the torus, to produce the observed high-energy emission. We trained the CNN on a numerical model that accounts for the injection of electrons, their self-consistent cooling, and pair creation-annihilation processes, considering both internal and all external photon fields. Despite the larger number of parameters compared to the synchrotron self-Compton model and the greater diversity in spectral shapes, the CNN enables an accurate computation of the SED for a specified set of parameters. The performance of the CNN is demonstrated by fitting the SED of two flat-spectrum radio quasars, namely 3C 454.3 and CTA 102, and obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. For the first source, the available data in the low-energy band allowed us to constrain the minimum Lorentz factor of the electrons, $\gamma_{\rm min}$, while for the second source, due to the lack of these data, $\gamma_{\rm min} = 10^2$ was set. We used the obtained parameters to investigate the energetics of the system. The model developed here, along with one from B\'egu\'e et al. (2023), enables self-consistent, in-depth modeling of blazar broadband emissions within leptonic scenario.

 Bernard Lyot invented the monochromatic birefringent filter in 1933 in order to investigate the coronal emissions of solar structures above the limb with the coronagraph installed at the Pic du Midi observatory. The filter was improved later and he made the first observations of the chromosphere above the solar disk in 1948, at Meudon. After his death, Grenat and Laborde continued the development in the frame of the coming International Geophysical Year (IGY 1957-1958). A modern H$\alpha$ heliograph was completed soon and the flare patrol started in 1956. This instrument was reproduced by two companies (SECASI and OPL) and disseminated around the world in order to contribute to the IGY common effort dedicated to the solar activity survey. We describe in this short paper the capabilities of one of these copies operating at Haute Provence station from 1958 to 1994.

 - **Abstract**
 Though efforts to detect them have been made with a variety of methods, no technique can claim a successful, confirmed detection of a moon outside the Solar System yet. Moon detection methods are restricted in capability to detecting moons of masses beyond what formation models would suggest, or they require surface temperatures exceeding what tidal heating simulations allow. We expand upon spectroastrometry, a method that makes use of the variation of the centre of light with wavelength as the result of an unresolved companion, which has previously been shown to be capable of detecting Earth-analogue moons around nearby exo-Jupiters, with the aim to place bounds on the types of moons detectable using this method. We derived a general, analytic expression for the spectroastrometric signal of a moon in any closed Keplerian orbit, as well as a new set of estimates on the noise due to photon noise, pointing inaccuracies, background and instrument noise, and a pixelated detector. This framework was consequently used to derive bounds on the temperature required for Solar System-like moons to be observable around super-Jupiters in nearby systems, with $\epsilon$ Indi Ab as an archetype. We show that such a detection is possible with the ELT for Solar System-like moons of moderate temperatures (150-300 K) in line with existing literature on tidal heating, and that the detection of large (Mars-sized or greater) icy moons of temperatures such as those observed in our Solar System in the very nearest systems may be feasible.

 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is the first scientific endeavour to detect and study gravitational waves from space. LISA will survey the sky for Gravitational Waves in the 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz frequency band which will enable the study of a vast number of objects ranging from Galactic binaries and stellar mass black holes in the Milky Way, to distant massive black-hole mergers and the expansion of the Universe. This definition study report, or Red Book, presents a summary of the very large body of work that has been undertaken on the LISA mission over the LISA definition phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of `A Big Ring on the Sky' (BR), the second ultra-large-scale structure (uLSS) found in MgII-absorber catalogues, following the previously reported Giant Arc (GA). In cosmological terms the BR is close to the GA - at the same redshift $z \sim 0.8$ and with a separation on the sky of only $\sim 12^\circ$. Two extraordinary uLSSs in such close configuration raises the possibility that together they form an even more extraordinary cosmological system. The BR is a striking circular, annulus-like, structure of diameter $\sim 400$ Mpc (proper size, present epoch). The method of discovery is as described in the GA paper, but here using the new MgII-absorber catalogues restricted to DR16Q quasars. Using the Convex Hull of Member Spheres (CHMS) algorithm, we estimate that the annulus and inner absorbers of the BR have departures from random expectations, at the density of the control field, of up to $5.2\sigma$. We present the discovery of the BR, assess its significance using the CHMS, Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), FilFinder and Cuzick & Edwards (CE) methods, show it in the context of the GA+BR system, and suggest some implications for the origins of uLSS and for our understanding of cosmology. For example, it may be that unusual geometric patterns, such as these uLSSs, have an origin in cosmic strings.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale structure in cosmology is highly non-Gaussian at late times and small length scales, making it difficult to describe analytically. Parameter inference, data reconstruction, and data generation tasks in cosmology are greatly aided by various machine learning models. In order to retain as much information as possible while solving these problems, this work operates at the field level, rather than at the level of summary statistics. The probability density function of the large-scale structure is learned with normalizing flows, a class of probabilistic generative models. Normalizing flows learn the transformation from a simple base distribution to a more complicated distribution, much like the matter content evolved to its present day complexities from a Gaussian field at early times. While the normalizing flows have accurately modelled 2-dimensional projections of the matter content, we find that denoising diffusion models are well-suited for volumetric data. A super-resolution emulator is developed for cosmological simulation volumes, generating high-resolution baryonic simulation volumes conditional on low-resolution dark matter simulations. The super-resolution emulator is trained to perform outpainting, and can thus upgrade very large cosmological volumes from low-resolution to high-resolution using an iterative outpainting procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 Any astrophysical object can, in principle, serve as a probe of the interaction between Dark Matter and regular, baryonic matter. This method is based on the potential observable consequences annihilations of captured Dark Matter has on the surface temperature of the object itself. In a series of previous papers we developed and validated simple analytic approximations for the total capture rates of Dark Matter (DM) valid in four distinct regions of the DM-nucleon scattering cross section ($\sigma$) vs. DM particle mass ($m_X$) parameter space. In this work we summarize those previous results and extend them significantly, by deriving a completely general, closed form solution for the total capture rate of Dark Matter in the multiscatter regime. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a region in the $\sigma$ vs. $m_X$ parameter space where the constraining power of any astrophysical object heated by annihilations of captured DM is lost. This corresponds to a maximal temperature ($T_{crit}$) any astrophysical object can have, such that it can still serve as a DM probe. Any object with observed temperature $T_{obs}>T_{crit}$ loses its DM constraining power. We provide analytic formulae that can be used to estimate $T_{crit}$ for any object.

 - **Abstract**
 We have successfully integrated $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a promising model for alleviating cosmological tensions, into a theoretical framework by endowing it with a specific Lagrangian from the VCDM model, a type-II minimally modified gravity. In this theory, we demonstrate that an auxiliary scalar field with a linear potential induces an effective cosmological constant, enabling the realization of an abrupt mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe through a piecewise linear potential. To eliminate the sudden singularity in this setup and ensure stable transitions, we smooth out this potential. Realized within the VCDM theory, the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model facilitates two types of rapid smooth mirror AdS-dS transitions: (i) the agitated transition, associated with a smooth jump in the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, and consequently $H$, exhibits a bump around the transition's midpoint; and (ii) the quiescent transition, associated with a smooth change in the slope of the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ transitions gracefully. These transitions are likely to leave distinct imprints on the background and perturbation dynamics, potentially allowing the observational data to distinguish between them. This novel theoretical framework propels $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM into a fully predictive model capable of exploring the evolution of the Universe including the late-time AdS-dS transition epoch, and extends the applicability of the model. We believe further research is crucial in establishing $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM as a leading candidate or guide for a new concordance cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical and multiwavelength photometric studies of young open cluster IC 1590. We identified 91 cluster members using $Gaia$ DR3 astrometry data using ensemble-based unsupervised machine learning techniques. From $Gaia$ EDR3 data, we estimate the best-fitted parameters for IC 1590 using the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis package (ASteCA) yielding the distance $d$ $\sim$ 2.87 $\pm$ 0.02 Kpc, age $\sim$ 3.54 $\pm$ 0.05 Myr, metallicity $z$ $\sim$ 0.0212 $\pm$ 0.003, binarity value of $\sim$ 0.558, and extinction $A_v$ $\sim$ 1.252 $\pm$ 0.4 mag for an $R_v$ value of $\sim$ 3.322 $\pm$ 0.23. We estimate the initial mass function slope of the cluster to be $\alpha$ = 1.081 $\pm$ 0.112 for single stars and $\alpha$ = 1.490 $\pm$ 0.051 for a binary fraction of $\sim$ 0.558 in the mass range 1 M$_{\odot}$ $\leq$ m(M$_{\odot}$) $\leq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$. The $G$-band luminosity function slope is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.33 $\pm$ 0.09. We use $(J-H)$ versus $(H-K_s)$ color-color diagram to identify young stellar objects (YSOs). We found that all the identified YSOs have ages $\leq$ 2 Myr and masses $\sim$ 0.35 - 5.5 M$_{\odot}$. We also fit the radial surface density profile. Using the galpy we performed orbit analysis of the cluster. The extinction map for the cluster region has been generated using the PNICER technique and it is almost similar to the dust structure obtained the dust structure from the 500 $\mu$$m$ dust continuum emissions map of $Herschel$ SPIRE. We finally at the end discussed the star formation scenario in the cluster region.
#### The Strength and Shapes of Contact Binary Objectcts

 - **Abstract**
 While contact binary objects are common in the solar system, their formation mechanism is unclear. In this work we examine several contact binaries and calculate the necessary strength parameters that allow the two lobes to merge without the smaller of the two being gravitationally destroyed by the larger. We find a small but non-zero amount of cohesion or a large friction angle is required for the smaller lobe to survive the merging process, consistent with observations. This means it is possible for two previously separated rubble piles to experience a collapse of their mutual orbit and form a contact binary. The necessary strength required to survive this merger depends on the relative size, shape, and density of the body, with prolate shapes requiring more cohesion than oblate shapes.
#### TIaRA TESS 1: Estimating exoplanet yields from Year 1 and Year 3 SPOC  lightcurves

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the detection efficiency for the TESS mission, focusing on the yield of longer-period transiting exoplanets ($P > 25$ days). We created the Transit Investigation and Recoverability Application (TIaRA) pipeline to use real TESS data with injected transits to create sensitivity maps which we combine with occurrence rates derived from Kepler. This allows us to predict longer-period exoplanet yields, which will help design follow-up photometric and spectroscopic programs, such as the NGTS Monotransit Program. For the TESS Year 1 and Year 3 SPOC FFI lightucurves, we find $2271^{+241}_{-138}$ exoplanets should be detectable around AFGKM dwarf host stars. We find $215^{+37}_{-23}$ exoplanets should be detected from single-transit events or "monotransits". An additional $113^{+22}_{-13}$ detections should result from "biennial duotransit" events with one transit in Year 1 and a second in Year 3. We also find that K dwarf stars yield the most detections by TESS per star observed. When comparing our results to the TOI catalogue we find our predictions agree within $1\sigma$ of the number of discovered systems with periods between 0.78 and 6.25\,days and agree to $2\sigma$ for periods between 6.25 and 25\,days. Beyond periods of 25 days we predict $403^{+64}_{-38}$ detections, which is 3 times as many detections as there are in the TOI catalogue with $>3\sigma$ confidence. This indicates a significant number of long-period planets yet to be discovered from \tess\ data as monotransits or biennial duotransits.

 - **Abstract**
 One common approach for solving collisions between protoplanets in simulations of planet formation is to employ analytical scaling laws. The most widely used one was developed by Leinhardt & Stewart (2012) from a catalog of ~ 180 N-body simulations of rubble-pile collisions. In this work, we use a new catalogue of more than 20,000 SPH simulations to test the validity and the prediction capability of Leinhardt & Stewart (2012) scaling laws. We find that these laws overestimate the fragmentation efficiency in the merging regime and they are not able to properly reproduce the collision outcomes in the super-catastrophic regime. In the merging regime, we also notice a significant dependence between the collision outcome, in terms of the largest remnant mass, and the relative mass of the colliding protoplanets. Here, we present a new set of scaling laws that are able to better predict the collision outcome in all regimes and it is also able to reproduce the observed dependence on the mass ratio. We compare our new scaling laws against a machine learning approach and obtain similar prediction efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune's external mean motion resonances play an important role in sculpting the observed population of transneptunian objects (TNOs). The population of scattering TNOs are known to 'stick' to Neptune's resonances while evolving in semimajor axis ($a$), though simulations show that resonance sticking is less prevalent at $a\gtrsim200-250$ au. Here we present an extensive numerical exploration of the strengths of Neptune's resonances for scattering TNOs with perihelion distances $q=33$ au. We show that the drop-off in resonance sticking for the large $a$ scattering TNOs is not a generic feature of scattering dynamics, but can instead be attributed to the specific configuration of Neptune and Uranus in our solar system. In simulations with just Uranus removed from the giant planet system, Neptune's resonances are strong in the scattering population out to at least $\sim300$ au. Uranus and Neptune are near a 2:1 period ratio, and the variations in Neptune's orbit resulting from this near resonance are responsible for destabilizing Neptune's resonances for high-$e$ TNO orbits beyond the $\sim20$:1 resonance at $a\approx220$ au. Direct interactions between Uranus and the scattering population are responsible for slightly weakening Neptune's closer-in resonances. In simulations where Neptune and Uranus are placed in their mutual 2:1 resonance, we see almost no stable libration of scattering particles in Neptune's external resonances. Our results have important implications for how the strengths of Neptune's distant resonances varied during the epoch of planet migration when the Neptune-Uranus period ratio was evolving. These strength variations likely affected the distant resonant and detached TNO populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical-near infrared spectral energy distributions (SED) and near infrared variability properties of 30 low-redshift iron low-ionization Broad Absorption Line quasars (FeLoBALQs) and matched samples of LoBALQs and unabsorbed quasars. Significant correlations between the SED properties and accretion rate indicators found among the unabsorbed comparison sample objects suggest an intrinsic origin for SED differences. A range of reddening likely mutes these correlations among the FeLoBAL quasars. The restframe optical-band reddening is correlated with the location of the outflow, suggesting a link between the outflows and the presence of dust. We analyzed WISE variability and provide a correction for photometry uncertainties in an appendix. We found an anticorrelation between the variability amplitude and inferred continuum emission region size, and suggest that as the origin of the anticorrelation between variability amplitude and luminosity typically observed in quasars. We found that the LoBALQ optical emission line and other parameters are more similar to those of the unabsorbed continuum sample objects than the FeLoBALQs. Thus, FeLoBAL quasars are a special population of objects. We interpret the results using an accretion-rate scenario for FeLoBAL quasars. The high accretion rate FeLoBAL quasars are radiating powerfully enough to drive a thick, high-velocity outflow. Quasars with intermediate accretion rates may have an outflow, but it is not sufficiently thick to include FeII absorption. Low accretion rate FeLoBAL outflows originate in absorption in a failing torus, no longer optically thick enough to reprocess radiation into the near-IR.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the characterization of two planet candidates detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), TOI-1199\:b and TOI-1273\:b, with periods of 3.7 and 4.6\,days, respectively. Follow-up observations for both targets, which include several ground-based light curves, confirmed the transit events. High-precision radial velocities from the SOPHIE spectrograph revealed signals at the expected frequencies and phases of the transiting candidates and allowed mass determinations with a precision of 8.4\% and 6.7\% for TOI-1199\:b and TOI-1273\:b, respectively. The planetary and orbital parameters were derived from a joint analysis of the radial velocities and photometric data. We find that the planets have masses of 0.239$\,\pm\,$0.020\,M$_{\mathrm{J}}$ \ and 0.222$\,\pm\,$0.015\,M$_{\mathrm{J}}$ \ and radii of 0.938$\,\pm\,$0.025\,R$_{\mathrm{J}}$ \ and 0.99$\,\pm\,$0.22\,R$_{\mathrm{J}}$,\ respectively. The grazing transit of TOI-1273\:b translates to a larger uncertainty in its radius, and hence also in its bulk density, compared to TOI-1199\:b. The inferred bulk densities of 0.358$\,\pm\,$0.041\,g\,cm$^{-3}$ \ and 0.28$\,\pm\,$0.11\,g\,cm$^{-3}$ \ are among the lowest known for exoplanets in this mass range, which, considering the brightness of the host stars ($V$$\approx$11\,mag), render them particularly amenable to atmospheric characterization via the transit spectroscopy technique. The better constraints on the parameters of TOI-1199\:b provide a transmission spectroscopy metric of 134\,$\pm$\,17, making it the better suited of the two planets for atmospheric studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of archival Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE and multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 and WFC3/UVIS narrow-band observations of the remnant associated with the ejecta of the mid-nineteenth century outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyx. These data sets are used to investigate its true 3D physical structure and the nebular expansion patterns along the line of sight and on the plane of the sky. The VLT MUSE emission line maps and 3D visualisations based on position-position-velocity diagrams reveal T Pyx as a bipolar nebula, with a knotty toroidal structure as its waist best seen in H$\beta$ and two open bowl-shaped bipolar lobes (a diabolo) best revealed by the [OIII] emission lines. The comparison of multi-epoch HST WFPC2 and WFC3/UVIS narrow-band images and VLT MUSE emission line maps of T Pyx reveals the angular expansion of the remnant through the proper motion of individual knots and nebular features. The angular expansion is confirmed to be homologous in the period from 1994.2 to 2007.4 before the recent 2011 outburst, but there is suggestive evidence that the inner knots have experienced a higher expansion rate since then.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting imprints of orbital eccentricity in gravitational wave signals promises to shed light on the formation mechanisms of binary black holes. To constrain formation mechanisms, distributions of eccentricity derived from numerical simulations of astrophysical formation channels are compared to the estimates of eccentricity inferred from GW signals. We report that the definition of eccentricity typically used in astrophysical simulations is inconsistent with the one used while modeling GW signals, with the differences mainly arising due to the choice of reference frequency used in both cases. We also posit a prescription for calculating eccentricity from astrophysical simulations by evolving ordinary differential equations obtained from post-Newtonian theory, and using the dominant ($\ell = m =2$) mode's frequency as the reference frequency; this ensures consistency in the definitions. On comparing the existing eccentricities of binaries present in the Cluster Monte Carlo catalog of globular cluster simulations with the eccentricities calculated using the prescription presented here, we find a significant discrepancy at $e \gtrsim 0.2$; this discrepancy becomes worse with increasing eccentricity. We note the implications this discrepancy has for existing studies, and recommend that care be taken when comparing data-driven constraints on eccentricity to expectations from astrophysical formation channels.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a dedicated transit and radial velocity survey of planets orbiting subgiant stars observed by the TESS Mission. Using $\sim$$16$ nights on Keck/HIRES, we confirm and characterize $12$ new transiting planets -- $\rm TOI-329\,b$, $\rm HD\,39688\,b$ ($\rm TOI-480$), $\rm TOI-603\,b$, $\rm TOI-1199\,b$, $\rm TOI-1294\,b$, $\rm TOI-1439\,b$, $\rm TOI-1605\,b$, $\rm TOI-1828\,b$, $\rm HD\,148193\,b$ ($\rm TOI-1836$), $\rm TOI-1885\,b$, $\rm HD\,83342\,b$ ($\rm TOI-1898$), $\rm TOI-2019\,b$ -- and provide updated properties for 9 previously confirmed TESS subgiant systems ($\rm TOI-197$, $\rm TOI-954$, $\rm TOI-1181$, $\rm TOI-1296$, $\rm TOI-1298$, $\rm TOI-1601$, $\rm TOI-1736$, $\rm TOI-1842$, $\rm TOI-2145$). We also report the discovery of an outer, non-transiting planet, $\rm TOI-1294\,c$ ($P=160.1\pm2.5$ days, $M_{\mathrm{p}}=148.3^{+18.2}_{-16.4} \,M_{\oplus}$), and three additional stars with long-term RV trends. We find that at least $19\pm8\%$ of subgiants in our sample of $21$ stars have outer companions, comparable to main-sequence stars. We perform a homogeneous analysis of the stars and planets in the sample, with median uncertainties of $3\%$, $8\%$ and $15\%$ for planet radii, masses and ages, doubling the number of known planets orbiting subgiant stars with bulk densities measured to better than $10\%$. We observe a dearth of giant planets around evolved stars with short orbital periods, consistent with tidal dissipation theories that predict the rapid inspiral of planets as their host stars leave the main sequence. We note the possible evidence for two distinct classes of hot Jupiter populations, indicating multiple formation channels to explain the observed distributions around evolved stars. Finally, continued RV monitoring of planets in this sample will provide a more comprehensive understanding of demographics for evolved planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Data from the Kepler space telescope have led to the discovery of thousands of planet candidates. Most of these candidates are likely to be real exoplanets, but a significant number of false positives still contaminate the sample, especially in candidate lists from the K2 mission. Identifying and rejecting the false positives lurking in the planet candidates sample is important for prioritizing follow-up resources and measuring the most accurate population statistics. Here, we identify false positives in the K2 planet candidate sample using a technique called "ephemeris matching," in which we compare the period and transit time of different signals. When signals from different stars show the same period and time of transit, we can conclude that at least one of the two signals is contamination. We identify 42 false positives among published K2 planet candidates (nearly 2% of the complete list), one of which (K2-256 b) was previously validated as genuine exoplanet. This work increases the reliability of the K2 planet sample and helps boost confidence in the surviving planet candidates.
