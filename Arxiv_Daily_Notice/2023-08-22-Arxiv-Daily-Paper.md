 - **Abstract**
 The influx of massive amounts of data from current and upcoming cosmological surveys necessitates compression schemes that can efficiently summarize the data with minimal loss of information. We introduce a method that leverages the paradigm of self-supervised machine learning in a novel manner to construct representative summaries of massive datasets using simulation-based augmentations. Deploying the method on hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we show that it can deliver highly informative summaries, which can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, including precise and accurate parameter inference. We demonstrate how this paradigm can be used to construct summary representations that are insensitive to prescribed systematic effects, such as the influence of baryonic physics. Our results indicate that self-supervised machine learning techniques offer a promising new approach for compression of cosmological data as well its analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube has opened a new window on our Universe. While IceCube has measured the flux of these neutrinos at energies up to several PeV, much remains to be discovered regarding their origin and nature. Currently, measurements are limited by the small sample size of astrophysical neutrinos and by the difficulty of discriminating between electron and tau neutrinos. TAMBO is a next-generation neutrino observatory specifically designed to detect tau neutrinos in the 1-100 PeV energy range, enabling tests of neutrino physics at high energies and the characterization of astrophysical neutrino sources. The observatory will comprise an array of water Cherenkov and plastic scintillator detectors deployed on the face of the Colca Canyon in the Peruvian Andes. This unique geometry will facilitate a high-purity measurement of astrophysical tau neutrino properties. In this talk, I will present the prospects of TAMBO in the context of next-generation neutrino observatories and provide an overview of its current status.
#### Non-linear CMB lensing with neutrinos and baryons: FLAMINGO simulations  vs. fast approximations

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background is rapidly emerging as a powerful probe of neutrinos, dark energy, and new physics. We present a fast computation of the non-linear CMB lensing power spectrum which combines non-linear perturbation theory at early times with power spectrum emulation using cosmological simulations at late times. Comparing our calculation with lightcones from the FLAMINGO 5.6 Gpc cube dark-matter-only simulation, we confirm its accuracy to 1% (2%) up to multipoles L = 3000 (L = 5000) for a nuLambdaCDM cosmology consistent with current data. Clustering suppression due to small-scale baryonic phenomena such as feedback from active galactic nuclei can reduce the lensing power by of order 10%. To our perturbation theory and emulator-based calculation we add SP(k), a new fitting function for this suppression, and confirm its accuracy compared to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to 4% at L = 5000, with similar accuracy for massive neutrino models. We further demonstrate that scale-dependent suppression due to neutrinos and baryons approximately factorize, implying that a careful treatment of baryonic feedback can limit biasing neutrino mass constraints.
#### QPOs in compact sources as a non-linear hydrodynamical resonance:  Determining spin of compact objects

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09759
 - **Abstract**
 Origin of wide varieties of quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observed in compact sources is still not well established. Its frequencies range from mHz to kHz spanning all compact objects. Are different QPOs, with different frequencies, originating from different Physics? We propose that the emergence of QPOs is the result of nonlinear resonance of fundamental modes present in accretion disks forced by external modes including that of the spin of the underlying compact object. Depending on the properties of accreting flow, e.g. its velocity and gradient, resonances, and any mode locking, take place at different frequencies, exhibiting low to high frequency QPOs. We explicitly demonstrate the origin of higher frequency QPOs for black holes and neutron stars by a unified model and outline how the same physics could be responsible to produce lower frequency QPOs. The model also predicts the spin of black holes, and constrains the radius of neutron stars and the mass of both.
#### Periodic changes in the morphology of the Galactic resonance rings

 - **Abstract**
 We study the periodic enhancement of either trailing or leading segments of the resonance elliptical rings in the dynamical model of the Galaxy which reproduces distributions of observed velocities derived from Gaia DR3 (EDR3) data along the Galactocentric distance. The model disc forms a nuclear ring, an inner combined ring and outer resonance rings R1 and R2. The backbone of the inner combined ring is banana-type orbits around the Lagrange equilibrium points L4 and L5. Orbits associated with the unstable equilibrium points L1 and L2 also support the inner ring. We have found the changes of the morphology of the inner ring with a period of P=0.57+/-0.02 Gyr, which is close to the period of revolution along the long-period orbits around the points L4 and L5. A possible explanation of these morphological changes is the formation of an overdensity which then begins circulating along the closed contour. In the region of the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR), we have found the changes of the morphology of the outer rings with a period of P=2.0+/-0.1 Gyr. Probably, the morphological changes of the outer rings are due to the orbits trapped by the OLR. These orbits exhibit librations of the direction of orbital elongation with respect to the minor axis of the bar as well as the long-term variations in the stellar angular momentum, energy, average radius of the orbit, and eccentricity. Among many librating orbits, we discovered orbits with the libration period of P=1.91+/-0.01 Gyr, which may cause the morphological changes of the outer rings.
#### Exploring the Potential of the Pulsed Laser onboard the CALIPSO  Satellite to Improve Calibration with VERITAS

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09770
 - **Abstract**
 Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) are used to detect bright nanosecond-duration flashes of optical light originating from interactions of cosmic/gamma-rays in the atmosphere. A natural calibration source with similar characteristics does not exist; however, satellite-based laser systems provide a potential alternative. The CALIPSO satellite is one such facility which uses a suite of instruments to gather information about the atmosphere. Of particular interest is the CALIOP instrument, which emits 20-nanosecond laser pulses at 1064 nm and 532 nm at a rate of 20 Hz towards the Earth. The TAIGA-HiSCORE collaboration announced a detection of CALIOP laser pulses at the 37th ICRC in 2021, demonstrating that the laser footprint extends to at least tens of kilometers from the subsatellite point. We have used the VERITAS IACT to observe CALIPSO, and show here the results of using these observations to help to calibrate the array. We also discuss the potential of this technique for cross-calibration between different IACT facilities and for relative calibration between the telescopes of future large arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel readout architecture that uses multiple non-destructive floating-gate amplifiers to achieve sub-electron readout noise in a thick, fully-depleted silicon detector is presented. This Multi-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) can perform multiple independent charge measurements with each amplifier; measurements with multiple amplifiers can then be combined to further reduce the readout noise. The readout speed of this detector scales roughly linearly with the number of amplifiers without requiring segmentation of the active area. The performance of this detector is demonstrated, emphasizing the ability to resolve individual quanta and the ability to combine measurements across amplifiers to reduce readout noise. The unprecedented low noise and fast readout of the MAS-CCD make it a unique technology for astronomical observations, quantum imaging, and low-energy interacting particles.
#### Scalar-tensor-vector-gravity and NGC-1277

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09838
 - **Abstract**
 NGC1277 is a compact but massive lenticular galaxy that shows no signs of the presence of dark matter. We find that this galaxy's behavior is consistent not only with Newtonian dynamics, but also with the predictions of Scalar--Tensor--Vector--Gravity, also known as MOG (MOdified Gravity). The compact size of the galaxy, in combination with its large mass, ensures that there are no observable deviations between the predictions of Newtonian and MOG orbital velocities within the galaxy's visible radius.
#### Can a binary star host three giant circumbinary planets?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09841
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital stability of a tilted circumbinary planetary system with three giant planets. The planets are spaced by a constant number ($\Delta$) of mutual Hill radii in the range $\Delta=3.4-12.0$ such that the period ratio of the inner pair is the same as the outer pair. A tilted circumbinary planetary system can be unstable even if the same system around a coplanar binary is stable. For an equal mass binary, we find that the stability of a three-planet system is qualitatively similar to that of a two-planet system, but the three-planet system is more unstable in mean motion resonance regions. For an unequal mass binary, there is significantly more instability in the three-planet system as the inner planets can undergo von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Generally in unstable systems, the inner planets are more likely to be ejected than the outer planets. The most likely unstable outcome for closely spaced systems, with $\Delta \lesssim 8$, is a single remaining stable planet. For more widely separated systems, $\Delta \gtrsim 8$, the most likely unstable outcome is two stable planets, only one being ejected. An observed circumbinary planet with significant eccentricity may suggest that it was formed from an unstable system. Consequently, a binary can host three tilted giant planets if the binary stars are close to equal mass and provided that the planets are well spaced and not close to a mean motion resonance.
#### The effect of the adiabatic assumption on asteroseismic scaling  relations for luminous red giants
 - **Authors:** Joel C. Zinn, Marc H. Pinsonneault, Lars Bildsten, Dennis Stello

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09854
 - **Abstract**
 Although stellar radii from asteroseismic scaling relations agree at the percent level with independent estimates for main sequence and most first-ascent red giant branch stars, the scaling relations over-predict radii at the tens of percent level for the most luminous stars ($R \gtrsim 30 R_{\odot}$). These evolved stars have significantly superadiabatic envelopes, and the extent of these regions increase with increasing radius. However, adiabaticity is assumed in the theoretical derivation of the scaling relations as well as in corrections to the large frequency separation. Here, we show that a part of the scaling relation radius inflation may arise from this assumption of adiabaticity. With a new reduction of Kepler asteroseismic data, we find that scaling relation radii and Gaia radii agree to within at least $2\%$ for stars with $R \lesssim 30 R_{\odot}$, when treated under the adiabatic assumption. The accuracy of scaling relation radii for stars with $50 R_{\odot} \lesssim R \lesssim 100 R_{\odot}$, however, is not better than $10\%-15\%$ using adiabatic large frequency separation corrections. We find that up to one third of this disagreement for stars with $R \approx 100 R_{\odot}$ could be caused by the adiabatic assumption, and that this adiabatic error increases with radius to reach $10\%$ at the tip of the red giant branch. We demonstrate that, unlike the solar case, the superadiabatic gradient remains large very deep in luminous stars. A large fraction of the acoustic cavity is also in the optically thin atmosphere. The observed discrepancies may therefore reflect the simplified treatment of convection and atmospheres.
#### Revisiting the Properties of GW190814 and Its Formation History
 - **Authors:** F. Lyu, L. Yuan, D. H. Wu, W. H. Guo, Y. Z. Wang, S. X. Yi, Q. W. Tang, R.-C. Hu, J.-P. Zhu, X. W. Shu, Y. Qin, E. W. Liang

 - **Abstract**
 GW190814 was reported during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run with the most asymmetric component masses (a $\sim 23$ $M_{\odot}$ black hole and a $\sim2.6$ $M_{\odot}$ compact object). Under the assumption that this event is a binary black hole (BBH) merger formed through the isolated binary evolution channel, we reanalyze the publicly released data of GW190814 with the modified astrophysical priors on the effective spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and further explore its formation history using detailed binary modeling. We show that GW190814 is likely to have been formed through the classical common envelope channel. Our findings show that the properties inferred using the modified astrophysical priors are consistent with those inferred by the uniform priors. With the newly-inferred properties of GW190814, we perform detailed binary evolution of the immediate progenitor of the BBH (namely a close binary system composed of a BH and a helium star) in a large parameter space, taking into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, supernova kicks, and tidal interactions between the helium star and the BH companion. Our findings show that GW190814-like events could be formed in limited initial conditions just after the common envelope phase: a $\sim 23$ $M_{\odot}$ BH and a helium star of $M_{\rm ZamsHe}$ $\sim$ 8.5 $M_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity ($\sim$ 7.5 $M_{\odot}$ at 10\% solar metallicity) with an initial orbital period at around 1.0 day. Additionally, the inferred low spin of the secondary indicates that the required metallicity for reproducing GW190814-like events should not be too low (e.g., Z $\gtrsim$ 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$).
#### Constraining the $f(R,T) = R + 2λT$ cosmological model using  recent observational data

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we consider a comprehensive investigation of the cosmological model described by $f(R,T) = R + 2\lambda T$ (where $\lambda$ represents a free parameter) in light of the most recent observational data. By constraining the model using $Hubble$ and $Pantheon$ datasets, we determine its compatibility with the observed behavior of the Universe. For this purpose, we adopt a parametric form for the effective equation of state (EoS) parameter. This parametric form allows us to describe the evolution of the EoS parameter with respect to redshift and investigate its behavior during different cosmic epochs. The analysis of the deceleration parameter reveals an accelerating Universe with a present value of $q_0=-0.64^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$, indicating the current phase of accelerated expansion. The transition redshift is found to be $z_{tr}=0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$, marking the epoch of transition from deceleration to acceleration. We also analyze the evolution of important cosmological parameters including density parameter, pressure, effective EoS, and stability. These findings collectively demonstrate the viability of the $f(R,T)$ cosmological model as a robust candidate capable of engendering the requisite negative pressure, thereby efficiently propelling cosmic expansion. Moreover, the undertaken stability analysis underscores the model's stability within the broader cosmic landscape. By providing the best-fit values for the coupling parameter $\lambda$, this approach motivates and encourages further explorations into the extensive landscape of this model and its potential applications across diverse realms of cosmology and astronomy.
#### Multiples among B stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus association

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the properties of companions to B stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus association (age ~15 Myr, 181 B-stars). We gathered available data combining high contrast imaging samples with evidence of companions from Gaia, from eclipsing binaries, and from spectroscopy. We evaluated the completeness of the binary search and estimated the mass and semi-major axis for all detected companions. These data provide a complete sample of stellar secondaries for separation >3 au, and they are highly informative as to closer companions. We found evidence for 200 companions around 181 stars. The fraction of single star is 15.2\pm 4.1% for stars with M_A>3.5 Msun while it is 31.5\pm 5.9% for lower-mass stars. The median semi-major axis of the orbits of the companions is smaller for B than in A stars, confirming a turn-over previously found for OB stars. The mass distribution of the very wide (a>1000 au) and closer companions is different. Very few companions of massive stars M_A>5.0 Msun have a mass below solar and even fewer are M stars with a semi-major axis <1000 au. The scarcity of low-mass companions extends throughout the whole sample. Most early B stars are in compact systems with massive secondaries, while lower-mass stars are mainly in wider systems with a larger spread in mass ratios. We interpret our results as the formation of secondaries with a semi-major axis <1000 au (about 80% of the total) by fragmentation of the disk of the primary and selective mass accretion on the secondaries. The observed trends with primary mass may be explained by a more prolonged phase of accretion episodes on the disk and by a more effective inward migration. We detected twelve new stellar companions from the BEAST survey and of a new BD companion at 9.6 arcsec from HIP74752 using Gaia data, and we discuss the cases of possible BD and low-mass stellar companions to HIP59173, HIP62058, and HIP64053.
#### Photometric and Spectroscopic Properties of the Eclipsing System V864  Monocerotis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10000
 - **Abstract**
 We present the orbital period variability and evolutionary status of the W UMa-type binary system V864 Mon from accurately measured fundamental parameters. New $BV$ photometric observations of this system were performed in 2019 January and 2022 January, and the first high-resolution spectroscopic observations were carried out on three nights between 2019 January and March. A total of 29 times of minimum light were collected to examine the behavior of the orbital period. Our analysis of these timings indicates a continuous period increase at a rate of $+$2.62$\times$10$^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$ over the past 20 years, which can be interpreted as a mass transfer from the less massive primary to the secondary component with a rate of 1.22$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We measured the radial velocities (RVs) for both components, and determined the effective temperature and projected rotational velocity of the more massive secondary star to be $T_{\rm eff,2}$ = 5450 $\pm$ 94 K and $v_2 \sin i$ = 192 $\pm$ 40 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, from the comparison of the observed spectrum at the primary minimum and the theoretical models. The individual masses and radii of both components were determined from a simultaneous analysis of the light and RV curves, which are $M_1$ = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.02 M$_\odot$, $R_1$ = 0.69 $\pm$ 0.01 R$_\odot$, and $M_2$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_\odot$, $R_2$ = 1.16 $\pm$ 0.02 R$_\odot$, respectively. Our results indicate that V864 Mon is a W-subtype of W UMa stars with time-varying spot activity. The positions in the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams indicate that the secondary star belongs to the main sequence region, while the hotter primary is located beyond the terminal-age main sequence.
#### Recurrent Symbiotic Nova T Coronae Borealis Before Outburst

 - **Abstract**
 The results of photometric and spectral observations of T CrB obtained in a wide range of wavelengths in 2011-2023 are presented. We use the near-IR light curves to determine a new ephemeris $JD_{min} = 2455828.9 + 227.55 \cdot E$ for the times of light minima when the red giant is located between the observer and the hot component. The flux ratio H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ varied from ~3 to ~8 in 2020-2023, which may be due to a change in the flux ratio between the X-ray and optical ranges. It is shown that the value of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ depends on the rate of accretion onto the hot component of the system. Based on high-speed follow-up observations obtained on June 8, 2023, we detected a variability of the HeII $\lambda 4686$ line with a characteristic time-scale of ~25 min, the amplitude of variability in the $B$ band was ~0.07$^m$. Simulations of the near-IR light curves accounting for the ellipsoidal effect allowed us to obtain the parameters of the binary system: the Roche lobe filling factor of the cool component $\mu=1.0$, the mass ratio $q=M_{cool}/M_{hot}=0.65\pm0.2$, the orbit inclination $i=56^\circ\pm4^\circ$. A comparison of the light curve obtained in 2005-2023 with the 1946 outburst template made it possible to predict the date of the upcoming outburst - January 2024.
#### Constraints on (2060) Chiron's size, shape, and surrounding material  from the November 2018 and September 2019 stellar occultations

 - **Abstract**
 After the discovery of rings around the largest known Centaur object, (10199) Chariklo, we carried out observation campaigns of stellar occultations produced by the second-largest known Centaur object, (2060) Chiron, to better characterize its physical properties and presence of material on its surroundings. We predicted and successfully observed two stellar occultations by Chiron. These observations were used to constrain its size and shape by fitting elliptical limbs with equivalent surface radii in agreement with radiometric measurements. Constraints on the (2060) Chiron shape are reported for the first time. Assuming an equivalent radius of R$_{equiv}$ = 105$^{+6}_{-7}$ km, we obtained a semi-major axis of a = 126 $\pm$ 22 km. Considering Chiron's true rotational light curve amplitude and assuming it has a Jacobi equilibrium shape, we were able to derive a 3D shape with a semi-axis of a = 126 $\pm$ 22 km, b = 109 $\pm$ 19 km, and c = 68 $\pm$ 13 km, implying in a volume-equivalent radius of R$_{vol}$ = 98 $\pm$ 17 km, implying a density of 1119 $\pm$ 4 kg m$^{-3}$. We determined the physical properties of the 2011 secondary events around Chiron, which may then be directly compared with those of Chariklo rings, as the same method was used. Data obtained from SAAO in 2018 do not show unambiguous evidence of the proposed rings, mainly due to the large sampling time. Meanwhile, we discarded the possible presence of a permanent ring similar to (10199) Chariklo's C1R in optical depth and extension. Using the first multi-chord stellar occultation by (2060) Chiron and considering it to have a Jacobi equilibrium shape, we derived its 3D shape. New observations of a stellar occultation by (2060) Chiron are needed to further investigate the material's properties around Chiron, such as the occultation predicted for September 10, 2023.

 - **Abstract**
 Representative samples of F-, G-, K-type stars located out of the Solar Neighbourhood has started to be available in spectroscopic surveys. The fraction of metal-poor ([Fe/H]~$\lesssim -0.8$~dex) giants becomes increasingly relevant to far distances. In metal-poor stars, effective temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) based on LTE spectroscopy and on former colour-$T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ relations of still wide use have been reported to be inaccurate. It is necessary to re-calibrate chemical abundances based on these $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ scales in the multiple available surveys to bring them to the same standard scale for their simultaneous use. For that, a complete sample of standards is required, which so far, is restricted to a few stars with quasi-direct $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ measurements. We aim at providing a legacy sample of metal-poor standards with proven accurate atmospheric parameters. We add 47 giants to the sample of metal-poor dwarfs of Giribaldi et al. 2021, thereby constituting the Titans metal-poor reference stars. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ was derived by 3D non-LTE H$\alpha$ modelling, whose accuracy was tested against interferometry and InfraRed Flux Method (IRFM). Surface gravity (log $g$) was derived by fitting Mg~I~b triplet lines, whose accuracy was tested against asteroseismology. Metallicity was derived using Fe II lines, which was verified to be identical to the [Fe/H] derived from non-LTE spectral synthesis. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from 3D non-LTE H$\alpha$ is equivalent to interferometric and IRFM temperatures within a $\pm$46~K uncertainty. We achieved precision of $\sim$50~K for 34 stars with spectra with the highest S/N. For log $g$, we achieved a total uncertainty of $\pm$0.15~dex. For [Fe/H], we obtained a total uncertainty of $\pm$0.09~dex. We find that the ionization equilibrium of Fe lines under LTE is not valid in metal-poor giants.

 - **Abstract**
 For bright transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) operates under event mode at early phases, which records incident positions and arrival time for each photon. The event file is able to be screened into many exposures to study the early light curve of GRBs with a high time resolution, including in particular the rapid brightening of the UV/Optical emission. Such a goal, however, is hampered for some extremely bright GRBs by the saturation in UVOT event images. For moderately saturated UVOT sources, in this work we develop the method proposed in Jin et al. (2023) to recover their photometries. The basic idea is to assume a stable point spread function (PSF) of UVOT images, for which the counts in the core region (i.e., an aperture of a radius of 5 arcsec) and the wing region (i.e., an annulus ranging from 15 arcsec to 25 arcsec) should be a constant and the intrinsic flux can be reliably inferred with data in the ring. We demonstrate that in a given band, a tight correlation does hold among the background-removed count rates in the core and the wing. With the new method, the bright limit of measuring range for UVOT V and B bands increases ~ 1.7 mag, while only ~ 0.7 mag for U band due to the lack of bright calibration sources. Systematic uncertainties are ~ 0.2 mag for V, B and U bands.

 - **Abstract**
 The destiny of complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions is interlinked with various evolutionary phases. Therefore, identifying these species in diversified environments of identical star-forming regions would help to comprehend their physical and chemical heritage. We identified multiple COMs utilizing the Large Program `Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM' (ASAI) data, dedicated to chemical surveys in Sun-like star-forming regions with the IRAM 30 m telescope. It was an unbiased survey in the millimetre regime, covering the prestellar core, protostar, outflow region, and protoplanetary disk phase. Here, we have reported some transitions of seven COMs, namely, methanol (CH3OH), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), methyl formate (CH3OCHO), ethanol (C2H5OH), propynal (HCCCHO), dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), and methyl cyanide (CH3CN) in some sources L1544, B1-b, IRAS4A, and SVS13A. We found a trend among these species from the derived abundances using the rotational diagram method and MCMC fit. We have found that the abundances of all of the COMs, except for HCCCHO, increase from the L1544 (prestellar core) and peaks at IRAS16293-2422 (class 0 phase). It is noticed that the abundance of these molecules correlate with the luminosity of the sources. The obtained trend is also visible from the previous interferometric observations and considering the beam dilution effect.

 - **Abstract**
 A unique X-ray occultation event in NGC 6814 during an XMM-Newton observation in 2016 has been reported, providing useful information of the absorber and the corona. We revisit the event with the aid of the hardness ratio (HR) - count rate (CR) plot and comparison with two other absorption-free XMM exposures in 2009 and 2021. NGC 6814 exhibits a clear "softer-when-brighter" variation pattern during the exposures, but the 2016 exposure significantly deviates from the other two in the HR - CR plot. While spectral fitting does yield transient Compton-thin absorption corresponding to the eclipse event in 2016, rather than easing the tension between exposures in the HR - CR plot, correcting the transient Compton-thin absorption results in new and severe deviation within the 2016 exposure. We show that the eclipsing absorber shall be clumpy (instead of a single Compton-thin cloud), with an inner denser region composed of both Compton-thin and Compton-thick clouds responsible for the previously identified occultation event, and an outer sparser region with Compton-thin clouds which eclipses the whole 2016 exposure. With this model, all the tension in the HR - CR plots could be naturally erased, with the observed spectral variability during the 2016 exposure dominated by the variation of absorption. Furthermore, the two warm absorbers (with different ionization and column densities but similar outflowing velocities) detected in the 2016 exposure shall also associate with the transient absorber, likely due to ablated or tidal stretched/disrupted fragments. This work highlights the unique usefulness of the HR - CR plot while analysing rare occultation events.

 - **Abstract**
 To explain both the dynamics of a globular cluster and its production of gravitational waves from coalescing binary black holes, it is necessary to understand its population of dynamically-formed binaries. We provide a theoretical understanding of this population, benchmarked by direct $N$-body models. We find that clusters on average have only one dynamically-assembled binary at any given time. This is different from theoretical expectations and models of binary populations, which predict a larger number of binaries ($\sim 5$), especially for low-$N$ clusters ($\sim 100$), or in the case of two-mass models, low number of black holes. We argue that the presence of multiple binaries is suppressed by a high rate of binary-binary interactions, which efficiently ionise one of the binaries involved. These also lead to triple formation and potentially gravitational wave (GW) captures, which may provide an explanation for the recently reported efficiency of binary black hole mergers with non-zero ($\gtrsim 0.01$) eccentricity in low-mass clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme Ultraviolet images of the Sun are becoming an integral part of space weather prediction tasks. However, having different surveys requires the development of instrument-specific prediction algorithms. As an alternative, it is possible to combine multiple surveys to create a homogeneous dataset. In this study, we utilize the temporal overlap of SoHO/EIT and SDO/AIA 171~\AA ~surveys to train an ensemble of deep learning models for creating a single homogeneous survey of EUV images for 2 solar cycles. Prior applications of deep learning have focused on validating the homogeneity of the output while overlooking the systematic estimation of uncertainty. We use an approach called `Approximate Bayesian Ensembling' to generate an ensemble of models whose uncertainty mimics that of a fully Bayesian neural network at a fraction of the cost. We find that ensemble uncertainty goes down as the training set size increases. Additionally, we show that the model ensemble adds immense value to the prediction by showing higher uncertainty in test data that are not well represented in the training data.

 - **Abstract**
 A planetary system can undergo multiple episodes of intense dynamical activities throughout its life, resulting in the production of star-grazing planetesimals (or exocomets) and pollution of the host star. Such activity is especially pronounced when giant planets interact with other small bodies during the system's evolution. However, due to the chaotic nature of the dynamics, it is difficult to determine the properties of the perturbing planet(s) from the observed planetesimal-disruption activities. In this study, we examine the outcomes of planetesimal-planet scatterings in a general setting, with the goal of determining the likelihood and timescale of planetesimal disruption by the host star as a function of the planet properties. We obtain a new analytical expression for the minimum distance a scattering body can reach, extending previous results by considering finite planet eccentricity and non-zero planetesimal mass. Through N-body simulations, we derive the distribution of minimum distances and the likelihood and timescales of three possible outcomes of planetesimal-planet scatterings: collision with the planet, ejection, and disruption by the star. We identify four defining dimensionless parameters (the planet eccentricity, planet-to-star mass ratio, planet radius to semi-major axis ratio, and the stellar disruption radius to planet semi-major axis ratio) that enable us to scale the problem and generalize our findings to a wide range of orbital configurations. Using these results, we explore three applications: falling evaporating bodies in the Beta Pictoris system, white dwarf pollution due to planetesimal disruption and planet engulfment by main-sequence stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a previously undetected periodicity at a frequency of 49.08$\pm$0.01 d$^{-1}$ (period of 29.34$\pm$0.01 minutes) during a super-outburst of V844 Her observed by TESS. V844 Her is an SU UMa type cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 78.69 minutes, near the period minimum. The frequency of this new signal is constant in contrast to the superhump oscillations commonly seen in SU UMa outbursts. We searched without success for oscillations during quiescence using MDM, TESS, and XMM-Newton data. The lack of a periodic signal in the XMM light curve and the relatively low X-ray luminosity of V844 Her suggests that it is not a typical IP. We consider the possibility that the 29 min signal is the result of super-Nyquist sampling of a Dwarf Nova Oscillation with a period near the 2-minute cadence of the TESS data. Our analysis of archival AAVSO photometry from a 2006 super-outburst supports the existence of a 29 min oscillation, although a published study of an earlier superoutburst did not detect the signal. We compare the X-ray properties of V844 Her with short orbital period intermediate polars (IP), V1025 Cen and DW Cnc. We conclude that the new signal is a real photometric oscillation coming from the V844 Her system and that it is unlikely to be an aliased high-frequency oscillation. The steady frequency of the new signal suggests that its origin is related to an asynchronously rotating white dwarf in V844 Her, although the precise mechanism producing the flux variations remains unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 Close-in lava planets represent an extreme example of terrestrial worlds, but their high temperatures may allow us to probe a diversity of crustal compositions. The brightest and most well-studied of these objects is 55 Cancri e, a nearby super-Earth with a remarkably short 17-hour orbit. However, despite numerous studies, debate remains about the existence and composition of its atmosphere. We present upper limits on the atmospheric pressure of 55 Cnc e derived from high-resolution time-series spectra taken with Gemini-N/MAROON-X. Our results are consistent with current crustal evaporation models for this planet which predict a thin $\sim$ 100 mbar atmosphere. We conclude that, if a mineral atmosphere is present on 55 Cnc e, the atmospheric pressure is below 100 mbar.

 Aerocapture is the technique of using planetary atmospheres to decelerate a spacecraft in a single pass to achieve nearly fuel-free orbit insertion. Aerocapture has been extensively studied since the 1980s but has never been flown yet. The entry conditions encountered during aerocapture are strongly destination dependent, and performance benefit offered by aerocapture is also destination dependent. Aerocapture is applicable to all atmosphere-bearing destinations with the exception of Jupiter and Saturn, whose extreme entry conditions make aerocapture infeasible. A recent study by the NASA Science Mission Directorate highlighted the need for baseline design reference missions, as a starting point for system level architecture studies. The present study uses the Aerocapture Mission Analysis Tool (AMAT) to compile a list of design reference missions at Venus, Earth, Mars, Titan, Uranus, and Neptune. These reference missions can provide an initial assessment of the feasibility of aerocapture for a proposed mission, and provide intial baseline values for more detailed system studies. The reference mission set provides a quick estimate of the entry conditions, control requirements, and aero-thermal loads for architectural level studies.

 - **Abstract**
 An infrared excess over the stellar photospheric emission of main-sequence stars has been found in interferometric surveys, commonly attributed to the presence of hot exozodiacal dust (HEZD). While submicrometer-sized grains in close vicinity to their host star have been inferred to be responsible for the found near-infrared excesses, the presence and amount of larger grains as part of the dust distributions are weakly constrained. We quantify how many larger grains (above-micrometer-sized) could be present in addition to submicrometer-sized grains, while being consistent with observational constraints. This is important in order to distinguish between various scenarios for the origin of HEZD and to better estimate its observational appearance when observed with future instruments. We extended a model suitable to reproduce current observations of HEZD to investigate a bimodal size distribution. By deriving the characteristics of dust distributions whose observables are consistent with observational limits from interferometric measurements in the $K$ and $N$ bands we constrained the radii of sub- and above-micrometer-sized grains as well as their mass, number, and flux density ratios. In the most extreme cases of some of the investigated systems, large grains $\gtrsim 10\,\mu$m might dominate the mass budget of HEZD while contributing up to 25$\,$% of the total flux density originating from the dust at a wavelength of 2.13$\,\mu$m and up to 50$\,$% at a wavelength of 4.1$\,\mu$m; at a wavelength of 11.1$\,\mu$m their emission might clearly dominate over the emission of small grains. While it is not possible to detect such hot-dust distributions using ALMA, the ngVLA might allow us to detect HEZD at millimeter wavelengths. Large dust grains might have a more important impact on the observational appearance of HEZD than previously assumed, especially at longer wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Directly imaging Earth-sized exoplanets with a visible-light coronagraph instrument on a space telescope will require a system that can achieve $\sim10^{-10}$ raw contrast and maintain it for the duration of observations (on the order of hours or more). We are designing, manufacturing, and testing Dual Purpose Lyot coronagraph (DPLC) masks that allow for simultaneous wavefront sensing and control using out-of-band light to maintain high contrast in the science focal plane. Our initial design uses a tiered metallic focal plane occulter to suppress starlight in the transmitted coronagraph channel and a dichroic-coated substrate to reflect out-of-band light to a wavefront sensing camera. The occulter design introduces a phase shift such that the reflected channel is a Zernike wavefront sensor. The dichroic coating allows higher-order wavefront errors to be detected which is especially critical for compensating for residual drifts from an actively-controlled segmented primary mirror. A second-generation design concept includes a metasurface to create polarization-dependent phase shifts in the reflected beam, which has several advantages including an extended dynamic range. We will present the focal plane mask designs, characterization, and initial testing at NASA's High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) facility.

 - **Abstract**
 Decayless kink oscillations of plasma loops in the solar corona may contain an answer to the enigmatic problem of solar and stellar coronal heating. The polarisation of the oscillations gives us a unique information about their excitation mechanisms and energy supply. However, unambiguous determination of the polarisation has remained elusive. Here, we show simultaneous detection of a 4-min decayless kink oscillation from two non-parallel lines-of-sights, separated by about 104\textdegree, provided by unique combination of the High Resolution Imager on Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on Solar Dynamics Observatory. The observations reveal a horizontal or weakly oblique linear polarisation of the oscillation. This conclusion is based on the comparison of observational results with forward modelling of the observational manifestation of various kinds of polarisation of kink oscillations. The revealed polarisation favours the sustainability of these oscillations by quasi-steady flows which may hence supply the energy for coronal heating.

 In the third paper of this series aimed at developing the tools for analysing resolved stellar populations using the cameras on board of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we present a detailed multi-band study of the 2 Gyr Galactic open cluster NGC 2506. We employ public calibration data-sets collected in multiple filters to: (i) derive improved effective Point Spread Functions (ePSFs) for ten NIRCam filters; (ii) extract high-precision photometry and astrometry for stars in the cluster, approaching the main-sequence (MS) lower mass of ~0.1 Msun; and (iii) take advantage of the synergy between JWST and Gaia DR3 to perform a comprehensive analysis of the cluster's global and local properties. We derived a MS binary fraction of ~57.5 %, extending the Gaia limit (~0.8 Msun) to lower masses (~0.4 Msun) with JWST. We conducted a study on the mass functions (MFs) of NGC 2506, mapping the mass segregation with Gaia data, and extending MFs to lower masses with the JWST field. We also combined information on the derived MFs to infer an estimate of the cluster present-day total mass. Lastly, we investigated the presence of white dwarfs (WDs) and identified a strong candidate. However, to firmly establish its cluster membership, as well as that of four other WD candidates and of the majority of faint low-mass MS stars, further JWST equally deep observations will be required. We make publicly available catalogues, atlases, and the improved ePSFs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental to our understanding of planetary bulk compositions is the relationship between their masses and radii, two properties that are often not simultaneously known for most exoplanets. However, while many previous studies have modeled the two-dimensional relationship between planetary mass and radii, this approach largely ignores the dependencies on other properties that may have influenced the formation and evolution of the planets. In this work, we extend the existing nonparametric and probabilistic framework of \texttt{MRExo} to jointly model distributions beyond two dimensions. Our updated framework can now simultaneously model up to four observables, while also incorporating asymmetric measurement uncertainties and upper limits in the data. We showcase the potential of this multi-dimensional approach to three science cases: (i) a 4-dimensional joint fit to planetary mass, radius, insolation, and stellar mass, hinting of changes in planetary bulk density across insolation and stellar mass; (ii) a 3-dimensional fit to the California Kepler Survey sample showing how the planet radius valley evolves across different stellar masses; and (iii) a 2-dimensional fit to a sample of Class-II protoplanetary disks in Lupus while incorporating the upper-limits in dust mass measurements. In addition, we employ bootstrap and Monte-Carlo sampling to quantify the impact of the finite sample size as well as measurement uncertainties on the predicted quantities. We update our existing open-source user-friendly \texttt{MRExo} \texttt{Python} package with these changes, which allows users to apply this highly flexible framework to a variety of datasets beyond what we have shown here.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Metal-poor brown dwarfs are poorly understood because they are extremely faint and rare. Only a few candidates have been identified as T-type subdwarfs in infrared surveys and their optical properties remain unconstrained. Aims. We aim to improve the knowledge of the optical properties of T subdwarf candidates to break the degeneracy between metallicity and temperature and to investigate their atmospheric properties. Methods. Deep $z$-band images of 10 known T subdwarf candidates were collected with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Low-resolution optical spectra for two of them were obtained with the same telescope. Photometric measurements of the $z$-band flux were performed for all the targets and they were combined with infrared photometry in $J, H, K, W1$ and $W2$-bands from the literature to obtain the colours. The spectra were compared with solar-metallicity T dwarf templates and with laboratory spectra. Results. We found that the targets segregate into three distinct groups in the $W1 - W2$ vs. $z - W1$ colour-colour diagram. Group I objects are mixed with solar-metallicity T dwarfs. Group III objects have $W1 - W2$ colours similar to T dwarfs but very red $z - W1$ colours. Group II objects lie between Group I and III. The two targets for which we obtained spectra are located in Group I and their spectroscopic properties resemble normal T dwarfs but with water features that are deeper and have a shape akin to pure water. Conclusions. We conclude that the $W1 - W2$ vs. $z - W1$ colour-colour diagram is excellent to break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for objects cooler than L-type. A revision of the spectral classification of T subdwarf might be needed in the future, according to the photometric and spectroscopic properties of WISE1810 and WISE0414 in Group III discussed in this work.

 Cloud computing offers an opportunity to run compute-resource intensive climate models at scale by parallelising model runs such that datasets useful to the exoplanet community can be produced efficiently. To better understand the statistical distributions and properties of potentially habitable planetary atmospheres we implemented a parallelised climate modelling tool to scan a range of hypothetical atmospheres.Starting with a modern day Earth atmosphere, we iteratively and incrementally simulated a range of atmospheres to infer the landscape of the multi-parameter space, such as the abundances of biological mediated gases (\ce{O2}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{H2}, and \ce{N2}) that would yield `steady state' planetary atmospheres on Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. Our current datasets comprises of \numatmospheres simulated models of exoplanet atmospheres and is available publicly on the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Our scalable approach of analysing atmospheres could also help interpret future observations of planetary atmospheres by providing estimates of atmospheric gas fluxes and temperatures as a function of altitude. Such data could enable high-throughput first-order assessment of the potential habitability of exoplanetary surfaces and sepcan be a learning dataset for machine learning applications in the atmospheric and exoplanet science domain.

 - **Abstract**
 In our work, we analyse $5\times10^{4}$ single pulses from the recycled pulsar PSR J2222$-$0137 in one of its scintillation maxima observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). PSR J2222$-$0137 is one of the nearest and best studies of binary pulsars and a unique laboratory for testing gravitational theories. We report single pulses' energy distribution and polarization from the pulsar's main-pulse region. The single pulse energy follows the log-normal distribution. We resolve a steep polarization swing, but at the current time resolution ($64\,\mu{\rm s}$), we find no evidence for the orthogonal jump in the main-pulse region, as has been suspected. We find a potential sub-pulse drifting period of $P_{3} \sim 3.5\,P$. We analyse the jitter noise from different integrated numbers of pulses and find that its $\sigma_{j}$ is $270\pm{9}\,{\rm ns}$ for 1-hr integration at 1.25 GHz. This result is useful for optimizing future timing campaigns with FAST or other radio telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf (WD) merger process and their post-merger evolution are important in many fields of astronomy, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves, etc. The evolutionary outcomes of double ultra-massive WD merger remnants are still a subject of debate, though the general consensus is that the merger remnant will collapse to form a neutron star. In this work, we investigate the evolution of a 2.20Msun merger remnant stemmed from the coalescence of double 1.10Msun ONe WDs. We find that the remnant ignites off-centre neon burning at the position near the surface of primary WD soon after the merger, resulting in the stable inwardly propagating oxygen/neon (O/Ne) flame. The final outcomes of the merger remnant are sensitive to the effect of convective boundary mixing. If the mixing cannot stall the O/Ne flame, the flame will reach the centre within 20 years, leading to the formation of super Chandrasekhar mass silicon core, and its final fate probably be neutron star (NS) through iron-core-collapse supernova. In contrast, if the convective mixing is effective enough to prevent the O/Ne flame from reaching the centre, the merger remnant will undergo electron capture supernova to form an ONeFe WD. Meanwhile, we find that the wind mass loss process may hardly alter the final fate of the remnant due to its fast evolution. Our results imply that the coalescence of double ONe WDs can form short lived giant like object, but the final outcomes (NS or ONeFe WD) are influenced by the uncertain convective mixing in O/Ne flame.

 - **Abstract**
 India's third Moon mission Chandrayaan 3 will deploy a lander and a rover at a high latitude location of the Moon enabling us to carry out first ever in-situ science investigations of such a pristine location that will potentially improve our understanding on primary crust formation and subsequent modification processes. The primary landing site (PLS), is situated at 69.367621 degS, 32.348126 degE. As a contingency, an alternate landing site (ALS) was also selected at nearly the same latitude but nearly 450 km west to PLS. In this work, a detailed study of the geomorphology, composition, and temperature characteristics of ALS has been carried out using the best-ever high resolution Chandrayaan 2 OHRC DEMs and Ortho images, datasets obtained from Chandrayaan 1 and on-going Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. For understanding the thermophysical behaviour, we used a well-established thermophysical model. We found that the Chandrayaan 3 ALS is characterised by a smooth topography with an elevated central part. The ALS is a scientifically interesting site with a high possibility of sampling ejecta materials from Tycho and Moretus. Based on the spectral and elemental analysis of the site, Fe is found to be near approx. 4.8 wt.%, with Mg approx. 5 wt.%, and Ca approx. 11 wt.%. Compositionally, ALS is similar to PLS with a highland soil composition. Spatial and diurnal variability of around 40 K and 175 K has been observed in the surface temperatures at ALS. Although belonging to similar location like PLS, ALS showed reduced daytime temperatures and enhanced night-time temperatures compared to PLS, indicating a terrain of distinctive thermophysical characteristics. Like PLS, ALS is also seems to be an interesting site for science investigations and Chandrayaan 3 is expected to provide new insights into the understanding of lunar science even if it happens to land in the alternate landing site.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the observational properties between $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O and summarize the observational parameters based on 7069 clouds sample from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) CO survey in a section of the third Galactic quadrant. We find that the $^{13}$CO angular area ($A_{\rm ^{13}CO}$) generally increases with that of $^{12}$CO ($A_{\rm ^{12}CO}$), and the ratio of $A_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ to $A_{\rm ^{12}CO}$ is 0.38 by linear fitting. We find that the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO flux are tightly correlated as $F_{\rm ^{13}CO}~=~0.17~ F_{\rm ^{12}CO}$ with both fluxes calculated within the $^{13}$CO-bright region. This indicates that the abundance $X_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ is a constant to be 6.5$^{+0.1}_{-0.5}$ $\times 10^{-7}$ for all samples under assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Additionally, we observed that the X-factor is approximately constant in large sample molecular clouds. Similarly, we find $F_{\rm C^{18}O}~=~0.11~F_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ with both fluxes calculated within C$^{18}$O-bright region, which indicates that the abundance ratios ${X_{\rm ^{13}CO}/X_{\rm C^{18}O}}$ stays the same value 9.7$^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$ across the molecular clouds under LTE assumption. The linear relationships of $F_{\rm ^{12}CO}$ vs. $F_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ and $F_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ vs. $F_{\rm C^{18}O}$ hold not only for the $^{13}$CO-bright region or C$^{18}$O-bright region, but also for the entire molecular cloud scale with lower flux ratio. The abundance ratio ${X_{\rm ^{13}CO}/X_{\rm C^{18}O}}$ inside clouds shows a strong correlation with column density and temperature. This indicates that the ${X_{\rm ^{13}CO}/X_{\rm C^{18}O}}$ is dominated by a combination of chemical fractionation, selectively dissociation, and self-shielding effect inside clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the synergies between heliospheric and dust science, the open science questions, the technological endeavors and programmatic aspects that are important to maintain or develop in the decade to come. In particular, we illustrate how we can use interstellar dust in the solar system as a tracer for the (dynamic) heliosphere properties, and emphasize the fairly unexplored, but potentially important science question of the role of cosmic dust in heliospheric and astrospheric physics. We show that an Interstellar Probe mission with a dedicated dust suite would bring unprecedented advances to interstellar dust research, and can also contribute-through measuring dust - to heliospheric science. This can, in particular, be done well if we work in synergy with other missions inside the solar system, thereby using multiple vantage points in space to measure the dust as it `rolls' into the heliosphere. Such synergies between missions inside the solar system and far out are crucial for disentangling the spatially and temporally varying dust flow. Finally, we highlight the relevant instrumentation and its suitability for contributing to finding answers to the research questions.

 - **Abstract**
 Atom interferometers offer promising new avenues for detecting ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). The exceptional sensitivity of atom interferometers to fluctuations in the local gravitational potential exposes them to sources of noise from human (anthropogenic) and animal (synanthropic) activity, which may obscure signals from ULDM. We characterise potential anthropogenic and synanthropic noise sources and examine their influence on a year-long measurement campaign by AION-10, an upcoming atom interferometer experiment that will be located at the University of Oxford. We propose a data cleaning framework that identifies and then masks anthropogenic and synanthropic noise. With this framework, we demonstrate that even in noisy conditions, the sensitivity to ULDM can be restored to within between 10% and 40% of an atom shot noise-limited experiment, depending on the specific composition of the anthropogenic and synanthropic noise. This work provides an important step towards creating robust noise reduction analysis strategies in the pursuit of ULDM detection with atom interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 We test the tenet of statistical isotropy of the standard cosmological model via a homology analysis of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps. Examining small sectors of the normalized maps, we find that the results exhibit a dependence on whether we compute the mean and variance locally from the masked patch, or from the full masked sky. Assigning local mean and variance for normalization, we find the maximum discrepancy between the data and model in the galactic northern hemisphere at more than $3.5$ s.d. for the PR4 dataset at degree-scale. For the PR3 dataset, the C-R and SMICA maps exhibit higher significance than the PR4 dataset at $\sim 4$ and $4.1$ s.d. respectively, however the NILC and SEVEM maps exhibit lower significance at $\sim 3.4$ s.d. The southern hemisphere exhibits high degree of consistency between the data and the model for both the PR4 and PR3 datasets. Assigning the mean and variance of the full masked sky decreases the significance for the northern hemisphere, the tails in particular. However the tails in the southern hemisphere are strongly discrepant at more than $4$ standard deviations at approximately $5$ degrees. The $p$-values obtained from the $\chi^2$-statistic exhibit commensurate significance in both the experiments. Examining the quadrants of the sphere, we find the first quadrant to be the major source of the discrepancy. Prima-facie, the results indicate a breakdown of statistical isotropy in the CMB maps, however more work is needed to ascertain the source of the anomaly. Regardless, these map characteristics may have serious consequences for downstream computations such as parameter estimation, and the related Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 U Equ is an unusual maser-hosting IR source discovered in the 1990s. It was tentatively classified as a post-AGB star with a unique optical spectrum displaying rare emission and absorption features from molecular gas. In 2022, we discovered that its optical spectrum has drastically changed. Methods: Optical high-resolution spectra of U Equ from SALT are supplemented by archival data and NIR photometry from NOT. New spectral line observations with the Effelsberg telescope and ALMA are presented. Results: No circumstellar molecular features are present in the contemporary optical spectra of U Equ. Non-photospheric absorption and emission from neutral and ionized species dominate the current spectrum. Some of the observed features indicate an outflow with a terminal velocity of 215 km\s. The H\&K lines of [Ca II] indicate a photosphere of spectral type F. Photometric measurements show that the source has been monotonically increasing its optical and NIR fluxes since the beginning of this century. SEDs at different epochs show dusty circumstellar material arranged in a highly-inclined disk. At a distance of 4 kpc, the source's luminosity is 10$^4$ L$_{\odot}$. Conclusions: The object has changed considerably in the last three decades, either due to geometrical reconfiguration of the circumstellar medium, evolutionary changes in the central star, or owing to an accretion event that has started in the system very recently. Observationally, U Equ appears to resemble the Category 0 of disk-hosting post-AGB stars, especially the post-common envelope binary HD 101584. It is uncertain if the drastic spectral change and the associated optical/MIR rise in brightness are common in post-AGB stars but such a radical change may be related to the real-time onset of the evolution of the system into a planetary nebula. We find that the post-AGB star V576 Car has undergone a similar transformation as U Equ.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ground and space-based photometric observations of TOI-270 (L231-32), a system of three transiting planets consisting of one super-Earth and two sub-Neptunes discovered by TESS around a bright (K-mag=8.25) M3V dwarf. The planets orbit near low-order mean-motion resonances (5:3 and 2:1), and are thus expected to exhibit large transit timing variations (TTVs). Following an extensive observing campaign using 8 different observatories between 2018 and 2020, we now report a clear detection of TTVs for planets c and d, with amplitudes of $\sim$10 minutes and a super-period of $\sim$3 years, as well as significantly refined estimates of the radii and mean orbital periods of all three planets. Dynamical modeling of the TTVs alone puts strong constraints on the mass ratio of planets c and d and on their eccentricities. When incorporating recently published constraints from radial velocity observations, we obtain masses of $M_{\mathrm{b}}=1.48\pm0.18\,M_\oplus$, $M_{c}=6.20\pm0.31\,M_\oplus$ and $M_{\mathrm{d}}=4.20\pm0.16\,M_\oplus$ for planets b, c and d, respectively. We also detect small, but significant eccentricities for all three planets : $e_\mathrm{b} =0.0167\pm0.0084$, $e_{c} =0.0044\pm0.0006$ and $e_{d} = 0.0066\pm0.0020$. Our findings imply an Earth-like rocky composition for the inner planet, and Earth-like cores with an additional He/H$_2$O atmosphere for the outer two. TOI-270 is now one of the best-constrained systems of small transiting planets, and it remains an excellent target for atmospheric characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the updated open-source code Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS) that can be applied to modeling supernovae (SNe) arising from an interaction with massive circumstellar medium (CSM) as well as the formation process of the CSM. Our update mainly concerns with extensions to hydrogen-poor SNe from stripped progenitors, targeting modeling of interaction-powered SNe Ibc such as Type Ibn and Icn SNe. We successfully reproduce the basic properties of the light curves of these types of SNe that occur after partial eruption of the outermost layer with a mass of $0.01$--$0.1\,M_\odot$ at $\lesssim 1$ year before explosion. We also find that the luminosity of the observed precursors can be naturally explained by the outburst that creates the dense CSM, given that the energy of the outburst is efficiently dissipated by collision with an external material, possibly generated by a previous mass eruption. We discuss possible scenarios causing eruptive mass-loss based on our results.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the first comprehensive study of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with $\sim$25 MeV solar energetic proton (SEP) events in 1980-2013 observed in the low/inner corona by the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters. Where possible, these observations are combined with spacebased observations from the Solar Maximum Mission C/P, P78-1 SOLWIND or SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs. The aim of the study is to understand directly-measured (rather than inferred from proxies) CME motions in the low to middle corona and their association with SEP acceleration, and hence attempt to identify early signatures that are characteristic of SEP acceleration in ground-based CME observations that may be used to warn of impending SEP events. Although we find that SEP events are associated with CMEs that are on average faster and wider than typical CMEs observed by MLSO, a major challenge turns out to be determining reliable estimates of the CME dynamics in the low corona from the 3-minute cadence Mk3/4 observations since different analysis techniques can produce inconsistent results. This complicates the assessment of what early information on a possible SEP event is available from these low coronal observations
#### Scintillated microlensing: measuring cosmic distances with fast radio  bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel means of directly measuring cosmological distances using scintillated microlensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In standard strong lensing measurements of cosmic expansion, the main source of systematic uncertainty lies in modeling the mass profile of galactic halos. Using extra-galactic stellar microlensing to measure the Hubble constant avoids this systematic uncertainty as the lens potential of microlenses depends only on a single parameter: the mass of the lens. FRBs, which may achieve nanosecond precision on lensing time delays, are well-suited to precision measurements of stellar microlensing, for which the time delays are on the order of milliseconds. However, typical angular separations between the microlensed images on the order of microarcseconds make the individual images impossible to spatially resolve with ground-based telescopes. We propose leveraging scintillation in the ISM to resolve the microlensed images, effectively turning the ISM into an astrophysical-scale interferometer. Using this technique, we estimate a 6\% uncertainty on $H_0$ from a single observed scintillated microlensing event, with a sub-percent uncertainty on $H_0$ achievable with only 30 such events. With an optical depth for stellar microlensing of $10^{-3}$, this may be achievable in the near future with upcoming FRB telescopes.
#### 3D hydrodynamics simulations of a 3 $M_{\odot}$ core-helium burning star

 - **Abstract**
 The inner structure of core-helium burning (CHeB) stars remains uncertain due to the yet unknown nature of mixing at the boundary of their cores. Large convective cores beyond a bare Schwarzschild model are favoured both from theoretical arguments and from asteroseismological constraints. However, the exact nature of this extra mixing, and in particular the possible presence of semiconvective layers, is still debated. In this work, we approach this problem through a new avenue by performing the first full-sphere 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the interiors of CHeB stars. We use the PPMstar explicit gas dynamics code to simulate the inner 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ of a 3 $M_{\odot}$ CHeB star. Simulations are performed using different Cartesian grid resolutions (768$^3$, 1152$^3$ and 1728$^3$) and heating rates. We use two different initial states, one based on MESA's predictive mixing scheme (which yields a large overshoot region) and one based on the convective premixing approach (which exhibits a semiconvective interface). The general behaviour of the flow in the convective core and in the stable envelope (where internal gravity waves are observed) is consistent with our recent simulations of core convection in massive main-sequence stars, and so are the various scaling relations. The semiconvective layers are dominated by strong internal gravity waves that do not produce measurable species mixing, but overshooting motions from the convective core gradually homogenize the semiconvective interface. This process can possibly completely erase the semiconvective layers, which would imply that CHeB stars do not harbour a semiconvection zone.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological constraints derived from peak counts, minimum counts, and the angular power spectrum of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam first-year (HSC Y1) weak lensing shear catalog. Weak lensing peak and minimum counts contain non-Gaussian information and hence are complementary to the conventional two-point statistics in constraining cosmology. In this work, we forward-model the three summary statistics and their dependence on cosmology, using a suite of $N$-body simulations tailored to the HSC Y1 data. We investigate systematic and astrophysical effects including intrinsic alignments, baryon feedback, multiplicative bias, and photometric redshift uncertainties. We mitigate the impact of these systematics by applying cuts on angular scales, smoothing scales, statistic bins, and tomographic redshift bins. By combining peaks, minima, and the power spectrum, assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM model, we obtain $S_{8} \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}= 0.810^{+0.022}_{-0.026}$, a 35\% tighter constraint than that obtained from the angular power spectrum alone. Our results are in agreement with other studies using HSC weak lensing shear data, as well as with Planck 2018 cosmology and recent CMB lensing constraints from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) through hierarchical mergers of stellar origin black holes (BHs), as well as BH mergers formed dynamically in nuclear star clusters. Using a semi-analytical approach which incorporates probabilistic mass-function-dependent double BH (DBH) pairing, binary-single encounters, and a mass-ratio-dependent prescription for energy dissipation in hardening binaries, we find that IMBHs with masses of $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$~--~$\mathcal{O}(10^4)\,\rm M_\odot$ can be formed solely through hierarchical mergers in timescales of a few $100$\,Myrs to a few\,Gyrs. Clusters with escape velocities $\gtrsim400$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ inevitably form high-mass IMBHs. The spin distribution of IMBHs with masses $\gtrsim 10^3M_\odot$ is strongly clustered at $\chi\sim 0.15$; while for lower masses, it at $\chi\sim 0.7$. Eccentric mergers are more frequent for equal-mass binaries containing first- and/or second-generation BHs. Metal-rich, young, dense clusters can produce up to $20\%$ of their DBH mergers with eccentricity $\geq0.1$ at $10\,\rm Hz$, and $\sim2$~--~$9\%$ of all in-cluster mergers can form at $>10$\,Hz. Nuclear star clusters are therefore promising environments for the formation of highly-eccentric DBH mergers, detectable with current gravitational-wave detectors. Clusters of extreme mass ($\sim10^8$\,M$_\odot$) and density ($\sim10^8$\,M$_\odot$pc$^{-3}$) can have about half of all of their DBH mergers with primary masses $\geq100$\,M$_\odot$. The fraction of in-cluster mergers increases rapidly with increasing cluster escape velocity, being nearly unity for $v_{\rm esc}\gtrsim 200$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. Cosmological merger rate of DBHs from nuclear clusters varies $\approx0.01-1$\,Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 For a pair of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the remnant of a dual galaxy merger, well-known models exist to describe their dynamical evolution until the final coalescence accompanied by the emission of a low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) signal. In this article, we investigate the dynamical evolution of three SMBH triple systems recovered from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation to explore common dynamical evolution patterns and assess typical coalescence times. For this purpose, we construct initial conditions from the ROMULUS25 data and perform high-resolution gravitodynamical \N-body simulations. We track the orbital evolution from the galactic inspiral to the formation of hard binaries at sub-parsec separation and use the observed hardening rates to project the time of coalescence. In all cases, the two heaviest black holes form an efficiently hardening binary that merges within fractions of the Hubble time. The lightest SMBH either gets ejected, forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, forms a hardening binary with the previously merged binary's remnant, or remains on a wide galactic orbit. The coalescence times of the lighter black holes are thus significantly longer than for the heavier binary, as they experience lower dynamical friction and stellar hardening rates. We observe the formation of hierarchical triples when the density profile of the galactic nucleus is sufficiently steep.
