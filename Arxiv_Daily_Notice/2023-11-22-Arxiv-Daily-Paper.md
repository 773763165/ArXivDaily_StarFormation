 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were instrumental in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. By virtue of their combination of distance reach, precision, and prevalence, they continue to provide key cosmological constraints, complementing other cosmological probes. Individual SN surveys cover only over about a factor of two in redshift, so compilations of multiple SN datasets are strongly beneficial. We assemble an updated "Union" compilation of 2087 cosmologically useful SNe Ia from 24 datasets ("Union3"). We take care to put all SNe on the same distance scale and update the light-curve fitting with SALT3 to use the full rest-frame optical. Over the next few years, the number of cosmologically useful SNe Ia will increase by more than a factor of ten, and keeping systematic uncertainties subdominant will be more challenging than ever. We discuss the importance of treating outliers, selection effects, light-curve shape and color populations and standardization relations, unexplained dispersion, and heterogeneous observations simultaneously. We present an updated Bayesian framework, called UNITY1.5 (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY), that incorporates significant improvements in our ability to model selection effects, standardization, and systematic uncertainties compared to earlier analyses. As an analysis byproduct, we also recover the posterior of the SN-only peculiar-velocity field, although we do not interpret it in this work. We compute updated cosmological constraints with Union3 and UNITY1.5, finding weak 1.7--2.6sigma tension with LambdaCDM and possible evidence for thawing dark energy. We release our binned SN distances to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD) is a significant event for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring the use of sound in conveying information and data. Since its inception in 1994, the conference has served as a vital forum for exchanging ideas and presenting research findings in the field of auditory display. While the conference primarily focuses on auditory display and sound design, astronomy has made its presence felt in the proceedings of the conference over the years. However, its not until the current ICAD conference where astronomy features a dedicated session. This paper aims to provide an statistical overview of the presence of astronomy in the ICAD conference's history from 1994 to 2022, highlighting some of the contributions made by researchers in this area, as well as the topics of interest that have captured the attention of sound artists.
#### A Comprehensive Theory for Neutron Star and Black Hole Kicks and Induced  Spins

 - **Abstract**
 Using twenty long-term 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, we find that lower compactness progenitors that explode quasi-spherically due to the short delay to explosion experience smaller neutron star recoil kicks in the $\sim$100$-$200 km s$^{-1}$ range, while higher compactness progenitors that explode later and more aspherically leave neutron stars with kicks in the $\sim$300$-$1000 km s$^{-1}$ range. In addition, we find that these two classes are correlated with the gravitational mass of the neutron star. This correlation suggests that the survival of binary neutron star systems may in part be due to their lower kick speeds. We also find a correlation of the kick with both the mass dipole of the ejecta and the explosion energy. Furthermore, one channel of black hole birth leaves masses of $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$, is not accompanied by a neutrino-driven explosion, and experiences small kicks. A second is through a vigorous explosion that leaves behind a black hole with a mass of $\sim$3.0 $M_{\odot}$ kicked to high speeds. We find that the induced spins of nascent neutron stars range from seconds to $\sim$10 milliseconds and that a spin/kick correlation for pulsars emerges naturally. We suggest that if an initial spin biases the explosion direction, a spin/kick correlation is a common byproduct of the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Finally, the induced spin in explosive black hole formation is likely large and in the collapsar range. This new 3D model suite provides a greatly expanded perspective and appears to explain some observed pulsar properties by default.
#### Characterizing Structure Formation through Instance Segmentation

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter haloes form from small perturbations to the almost homogeneous density field of the early universe. Although it is known how large these initial perturbations must be to form haloes, it is rather poorly understood how to predict which particles will end up belonging to which halo. However, it is this process that determines the Lagrangian shape of protohaloes and is therefore essential to understand their mass, spin and formation history. Here, we present a machine-learning framework to learn how the protohalo regions of different haloes emerge from the initial density field. This involves one neural network to distinguish semantically which particles become part of any halo and a second neural network that groups these particles by halo membership into different instances. This instance segmentation is done through the Weinberger method, in which the network maps particles into a pseudo-space representation where different instances can be distinguished easily through a simple clustering algorithm. Our model reliably predicts the masses and Lagrangian shapes of haloes object-by-object, as well as summary statistics like the halo-mass function. We find that our model extracts information close to optimal by comparing it to the degree of agreement between two N-body simulations with slight differences in their initial conditions. We publish our model open-source and suggest that it can be used to inform analytical methods of structure formation by studying the effect of systematic manipulations of the initial conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) with The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is among the mission science objectives. Disentangling SGWBs of astrophysical and cosmological origin is a challenging task, further complicated by the noise level uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a Bayesian methodology to infer upon SGWBs, taking inspiration from Gaussian stochastic processes. We investigate the suitability of the approach for signal of unknown spectral shape. We do by discretely exploring the model hyperparameters, a first step towards a more efficient transdimensional exploration. We apply the proposed method to a representative astrophysical scenario: the inference on the astrophysical foreground of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals, recently estimated in~\cite{Pozzoli2023}. We find the algorithm to be capable of recovering the injected signal even with large priors, while simultaneously providing estimate of the noise level.
#### Optimal photometry of point sources: Joint source flux and background  determination on array detectors -- from theory to practical implementation

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the joint determination of source and background flux for point sources as observed by digital array detectors. We explicitly compute the two-dimensional Cram\'er-Rao absolute lower bound (CRLB) as well as the performance bounds for high-dimensional implicit estimators from a generalized Taylor expansion. This later approach allows us to obtain computable prescriptions for the bias and variance of the joint estimators. We compare these prescriptions with empirical results from numerical simulations in the case of the weighted least squares estimator (introducing an improved version, denoted stochastic weighted least-squares) as well as with the maximum likelihood estimator, finding excellent agreement. We demonstrate that these estimators provide quasi-unbiased joint estimations of the flux and background, with a variance that approaches the CRLB very tightly and are, hence, optimal, unlike the case of sequential estimation used commonly in astronomical photometry which is sub-optimal. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations of realistic observations, as well as with observations of a bona-fide non-variable stellar source observed with TESS, and compare it to the results from the sequential estimation of background and flux, confirming our theoretical expectations. Our practical estimators can be used as benchmarks for general photometric pipelines, or for applications that require maximum precision and accuracy in absolute photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry is one of the main pillars of astronomy, and one of its oldest branches. Over the years, an increasing number of astrometric works by means of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data have revolutionized our understanding of various phenomena. With the launch of JWST, it becomes almost instinctive to want to replicate or improve these results with data taken with the newest, state-of-the-art, space-based telescope. In this regard, the initial focus of the community has been on the Near-Infrared (NIR) detectors on board of JWST because of their high spatial resolution. This paper begins the effort to capture and apply what has been learned from HST to the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) of JWST by developing the tools to obtain high-precision astrometry and photometry with its imager. We describe in detail how to create accurate effective point-spread-function (ePSF) models and geometric-distortion corrections, analyze their temporal stability, and test their quality to the extent of what is currently possible with the available data in the JWST MAST archive. We show that careful data reduction provides deep insight on the performance and intricacies of the MIRI imager, and of JWST in general. In an effort to help the community to devise new observing programs, we make our ePSF models and geometric-distortion corrections publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic ($T_{\parallel} > T_{\perp}$), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and non-zero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of $^3$He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of $^3$He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated $^3$He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of $^3$He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of $^4$He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of $^3$He observed in impulsive flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the inexorable increase in the Sun's luminosity, Earth will exit the habitable zone in ~1 Gyr. There is a negligible chance that Earth's orbit will change during that time through internal Solar System dynamics. However, there is a ~1% chance per Gyr that a star will pass within 100 au of the Sun. Here, we use N-body simulations to evaluate the possible evolutionary pathways of the planets under the perturbation from a close stellar passage. We find a ~92% chance that all eight planets will survive on orbits similar to their current ones if a star passes within 100 au of the Sun. Yet a passing star may disrupt the Solar System, by directly perturbing the planets' orbits or by triggering a dynamical instability. Mercury is the most fragile, with a destruction rate (usually via collision with the Sun) higher than that of the four giant planets combined. The most probable destructive pathways for Earth are to undergo a giant impact (with the Moon or Venus) or to collide with the Sun. Each planet may find itself on a very different orbit than its present-day one, in some cases with high eccentricities or inclinations. There is a small chance that Earth could end up on a more distant (colder) orbit, through re-shuffling of the system's orbital architecture, ejection into interstellar space (or into the Oort cloud), or capture by the passing star. We quantify plausible outcomes for the post-flyby Solar System.
#### Insight into the Formation of $β$ Pic b through the Composition of  Its Parent Protoplanetary Disk as Revealed by the $β$ Pic Moving Group  Member HD 181327

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that $\beta$ Pic b has a supersolar metallicity and subsolar C/O ratio. Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for the star $\beta$ Pic and therefore the planet's parent protoplanetary disk, $\beta$ Pic b's C/O ratio suggests that it formed via core accretion between its parent protoplanteary disk's H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ ice lines. $\beta$ Pic b's high metallicity is difficult to reconcile with its mass $M_{\text{p}}~=~11.7~M_{\text{Jup}}$ though. Massive stars can present peculiar photospheric abundances that are unlikely to record the abundances of their former protoplanetary disks. This issue can be overcome for early-type stars in moving groups by infering the elemental abundances of the FGK stars in the same moving group that formed in the same molecular cloud and presumably share the same composition. We infer the photospheric abundances of the F dwarf HD 181327, a $\beta$ Pic moving group member that is the best available proxy for the composition of $\beta$ Pic b's parent protoplanetary disk. In parallel, we infer updated atmospheric abundances for $\beta$ Pic b. As expected for a planet of its mass formed via core-accretion beyond its parent protoplanetary disk's H$_{2}$O ice line, we find that $\beta$ Pic b's atmosphere is consistent with stellar metallicity and confirm that is has superstellar carbon and oxygen abundances with a substellar C/O ratio. We propose that the elemental abundances of FGK dwarfs in moving groups can be used as proxies for the otherwise difficult-to-infer elemental abundances of early-type and late-type members of the same moving groups.
#### The merger of hard binaries in globular clusters as the primary channel  for the formation of second generation stars

 - **Abstract**
 We have recently presented observational evidence which suggests that the origin of the second generation (G2) stars in globular clusters (GCs) is due to the binary-mediated collision of primordial (G1) low-mass main-sequence (MS) stars. This mechanism avoids both the mass budget problem and the need of external gas for dilution. Here, we report on another piece of evidence supporting this scenario: (1) the fraction of MS binaries is proportional to the fraction of G1 stars in GCs and, at the same time, (2) the smaller the fraction of G1 stars is, the more deficient binaries of higher mass ratio (q$>0.7$) are. They are, on average, harder than their smaller mass-ratio counterparts due to higher binding energy at a given primary mass. Then (2) implies that (1) is due to the merging\slash collisions of hard binaries rather than to their disruption. These new results complemented by the present-day data on binaries lead to the following conclusions: (i) the mass-ratio distribution of binaries, particularly short-period ones, with low-mass primaries, $M_{\rm P} < 1.5$ M$_{\sun}$, is strongly peaked close to q$=1.0$, whereas (ii) dynamical processes at high stellar density tend to destroy softer binaries and make hard (nearly) twin binaries to become even harder and favor their mergers and collisions. G2 stars formed this way gain mass that virtually doubles the primary one, $2M_{\rm P}$, at which the number of G1 stars is $\sim5$ times smaller than at $M_{\rm P}$ according to the slope of a Milky Way-like IMF at $M_{\rm MS} < 1.0$ M$_{\sun}$.
#### The first Ka-band (26.1-35 GHz) blind line survey towards Orion KL

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a Ka-band (26.1--35 GHz) line survey towards Orion KL using the TianMa 65-m Radio Telescope (TMRT). It is the first blind line survey in the Ka band, and achieves a sensitivity of mK level (1--3 mK at a spectral resolution of $\sim$1 km s$^{-1}$). In total, 592 Gaussian features are extracted. Among them, 257 radio recombination lines (RRLs) are identified. The maximum $\Delta n$ of RRLs of H, He and C are 20, 15, and 5, respectively. Through stacking, we have detected the $\beta$ lines of ion RRLs (RRLs of C$^+$ with possible contribution of other ions like O$^+$) for the first time, and tentative signal of the $\gamma$ lines of ion RRLs can also be seen on the stacked spectrum. Besides, 318 other line features were assigned to 37 molecular species, and ten of these species were not detected in the Q-band survey of TMRT. The vibrationally excited states of nine species were also detected. Emission of most species can be modeled under LTE. A number of transitions of E-CH3OH ($J_2-J_1$) display maser effects, which are confirmed by our modeling, and besides the bumping peak at $J\sim 6$ there is another peak at $J\sim 13$. Methylcyanoacetylene (CH$_3$C$_3$N) is detected in Orion KL for the first time. This work emphasizes that the Ka band, which was long-ignored for spectral line surveys, is very useful for surveying RRLs and molecular lines simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing "Brain Coral" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain. The segmentation masks and source code are available on Github for the community to explore and build upon.
#### Under the light of a new star: evolution of planetary atmospheres  through protoplanetary disc dispersal and boil-off

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12295
 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of small, close-in exoplanets are vulnerable to rapid mass-loss during protoplanetary disc dispersal via a process referred to as `boil-off', in which confining pressure from the local gas disc reduces, inducing atmospheric loss and contraction. We construct self-consistent models of planet evolution during gaseous core accretion and boil-off. As the surrounding disc gas dissipates, we find that planets lose mass via subsonic breeze outflows which allow causal contact to exist between disc and planet. Planets initially accrete of order $\sim 10\%$ in atmospheric mass, however, boil-off can remove $\gtrsim 90\%$ of this mass during disc dispersal. We show that a planet's final atmospheric mass fraction is strongly dictated by the ratio of cooling timescale to disc dispersal timescale, as well as the planet's core mass and equilibrium temperature. With contributions from core cooling and radioactivity, we show that core luminosity eventually leads to the transition from boil-off to core-powered mass-loss. We find that smaller mass planets closest to their host star may have their atmospheres completely stripped through a combination of boil-off and core-powered mass-loss during disc dispersal, implying the existence of a population-level radius gap emerging as the disc disperses. We additionally consider the transition from boil-off/core-powered mass-loss to X-ray/EUV (XUV) photoevaporation by considering the penetration of stellar XUV photons below the planet's sonic surface. Finally, we show that planets may open gaps in their protoplanetary discs during the late stages of boil-off, which may enhance mass-loss rates.

 - **Abstract**
 An epoch of matter domination in the early universe can enhance the primordial stochastic gravitational wave signal, potentially making it detectable to upcoming gravitational wave experiments. However, the resulting gravitational wave signal is quite sensitive to the end of the early matter-dominated epoch. If matter domination ends gradually, a cancellation results in an extremely suppressed signal, while in the limit of an instantaneous transition, there is a resonant-like enhancement. The end of the matter dominated epoch cannot be instantaneous, however, and previous analyses have used a Gaussian smoothing technique to account for this, and consider only a limited regime around the fast transition limit. In this work, we present a study of the enhanced gravitational wave signal from early matter domination without making either approximation and show how the signal smoothly evolves from the strongly suppressed to strongly enhanced regimes.
#### The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey V: cataloguing the sky at 1367.5 MHz  and the second data release of RACS-mid

 - **Abstract**
 The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) has surveyed the sky at multiple frequencies as part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). The first two RACS observing epochs, at 887.5 (RACS-low) and 1367.5 (RACS-mid) MHz, have been released (McConnell et al., 2020; Duchesne et al., 2023). A catalogue of radio sources from RACS-low has also been released, covering the sky south of declination +30$^\circ$ (Hale et al., 2021). With this paper, we describe and release the first set of catalogues from RACS-mid, covering the sky below declination +49$^\circ$. The catalogues are created in a similar manner to the RACS-low catalogue, and we discuss this process and highlight additional changes. The general purpose primary catalogue covering 36 200 deg$^2$ features a variable angular resolution to maximise sensitivity and sky coverage across the catalogued area, with a median angular resolution of 11.2" times 9.3". The primary catalogue comprises 3 105 668 radio sources, including those in the Galactic Plane (2 861 923 excluding Galactic latitudes of $|b|<5^\circ$) and we estimate the catalogue to be 95% complete for sources above 1.6 mJy. With the primary catalogue, we also provide two auxiliary catalogues. The first is a fixed-resolution, 25-arcsec catalogue approximately matching the sky coverage of the RACS-low catalogue. This 25-arcsec catalogue is constructed identically to the primary catalogue, except images are convolved to a less-sensitive 25-arcsec angular resolution. The second auxiliary catalogue is designed for time-domain science, and is the concatenation of source-lists from the original RACS-mid images with no additional convolution, mosaicking, or de-duplication of source entries to avoid losing time-variable signals. All three RACS-mid catalogues, and all RACS data products, are available through the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA).
#### Note on Granda-Oliveros Holographic Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 This article revisits Granda-Oliveros holographic dark energy (GOHDE) model, explores the features of the parameter space and shows that its ability to explain the late-time acceleration is only due to the integration constant that appears by construction. We show that the GOHDE behaves like the dominant energy component and naturally behaves like dark energy in the late phase. In the matter-dominated period, it acts like pressureless matter and exhibits radiation-like behaviour in the very early stages. Adjusting the free parameters could subdue or enhance these characteristics. Depending on the parameters, GOHDE can act similarly to concordance, phantom or quintessence-like dark energies with singular equation of states. From the point of local observations, we show that the GOHDE model is observationally indistinguishable from $w$CDM and encompasses $\Lambda$CDM as a specific case. Our analysis reveals that while a departure from $\Lambda$CDM could account for late-time acceleration, it falls short of a consistent description of the entire cosmic history. Furthermore, we utilize various datasets, including OHD, Pantheon, CMB Shift parameter, BAO, and QSO, to constrain the free parameters of the GOHDE model. Our analysis indicates that the best fit, assuming the GO cut-off, aligns with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, we use statistical quantifiers such as AIC, BIC, and $\chi^2$ to test the model's goodness with various data combinations and estimate the Bayes factor to contrast the models. Our study suggests that the standard GOHDE model is equally likely as the $\Lambda$CDM model, ultimately favouring the latter, with $\beta=0.686^{+0.048}_{-0.044}$ and $w{z_0}=-0.988^{+0.042}_{-0.044}$. Given the current observations, we conclude that, for a flat universe, the $\Lambda$CDM case is statistically the best and probably the only consistent solution from the GOHDE construction.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] The inner few AU of disks around young stars are best probed in the infrared. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now starting to characterize the chemistry of these regions in unprecedented detail. One peculiar subset of sources are the so-called ``CO2-only sources'', in which only a strong 15 $\mu$m CO2 feature was detected in the spectrum. One scenario that could explain the weak emission from H2O is the presence of a small, inner cavity in the disk. If this cavity were to extend past the H2O snowline, but not past the CO2 snowline, this could strongly suppress the H2O line flux w.r.t. that of CO2. In this work, we aim to test the validity of this statement. Using the thermo-chemical code Dust And LInes (DALI), we created a grid of T Tauri disk models with an inner cavity, meaning we fully depleted the inner region of the disk in gas and dust starting from the dust sublimation radius and ranging until a certain cavity radius. We present the evolution of the CO2 and H2O spectra of a disk with inner cavity size, showing that, when a large-enough cavity is introduced, a spectrum that was initially dominated by H2O lines can become CO2-dominated instead. However, the cavity size needed for this is around 4-5 AU, exceeding the nominal position of the CO2 snowline in a full disk. The cause of this is most likely the alteration of the thermal structure by the cavity, which pushes the snowlines outward. Alternative explanations for bright CO2 emission are also briefly discussed. Our modeling work shows that it is possible for the presence of a small inner cavity to explain strong CO2 emission in a spectrum. However, the cavity needed to do so is larger than what was initially expected. As such, this scenario will be easier to test with sufficiently high angular resolution (millimeter) observations.

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-107b is a warm ($\sim$740 K) transiting planet with a Neptune-like mass of $\sim$30.5 $M_{\oplus}$ and Jupiter-like radius of $\sim$0.94 $R_{\rm J}$, whose extended atmosphere is eroding. Previous observations showed evidence for water vapour and a thick high-altitude condensate layer in WASP-107b's atmosphere. Recently, photochemically produced sulphur dioxide (SO$_2$) was detected in the atmosphere of a hot ($\sim$1,200 K) Saturn-mass planet from transmission spectroscopy near 4.05 $\mu$m, but for temperatures below $\sim$1,000 K sulphur is predicted to preferably form sulphur allotropes instead of SO$_2$. Here we report the 9$\sigma$-detection of two fundamental vibration bands of SO$_2$, at 7.35 $\mu$m and 8.69 $\mu$m, in the transmission spectrum of WASP-107b using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the JWST. This discovery establishes WASP-107b as the second irradiated exoplanet with confirmed photochemistry, extending the temperature range of exoplanets exhibiting detected photochemistry from $\sim$1,200 K down to $\sim$740 K. Additionally, our spectral analysis reveals the presence of silicate clouds, which are strongly favoured ($\sim$7$\sigma$) over simpler cloud setups. Furthermore, water is detected ($\sim$12$\sigma$), but methane is not. These findings provide evidence of disequilibrium chemistry and indicate a dynamically active atmosphere with a super-solar metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 The IRDC G14.225-0.506 is associated with a network of filaments, which result in two different dense hubs, as well as with several signposts of star formation activity. The aim of this work is to study the cm continuum emission to characterize the stellar population in G14.2. We performed deep (~1.5-3 microJy) radio continuum observations at 6 and 3.6 cm using the VLA in the A configuration (~0.3''). We have also made use of observations taken during different days to study the presence of variability at short timescales. We detected a total of 66 sources, 32 in the northern region G14.2-N and 34 in the southern region G14.2-S. Ten of the sources are found to be variable. Based on their spectral index, the emission in G14.2-N is mainly dominated by non-thermal sources while G14.2-S contains more thermal emitters. Approximately 75% of the sources present a counterpart at other wavelengths. In the inner 0.4~pc region around the center of each hub, the number of IR sources in G14.2-N is larger than in G14.2-S by a factor of 4. We also studied the relation between the radio luminosity and the bolometric luminosity, finding that the thermal emission of the studied sources is compatible with thermal radio jets. For our sources with X-ray counterparts, the non-thermal emitters follow a G\"udel-Benz relation with k = 0.03. We found similar levels of fragmentation between G14.2-N and G14.2-S, suggesting that both regions are most likely twin hubs. The non-thermal emission found in the less evolved objects suggests that G14.2-N may be composed of more massive YSOs as well as being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, consistent with the filament-halo gradient in age and mass from previous works. Our results confirm a wider evolutionary sequence starting in G14.2-S as the youngest part, followed by G14.2-N, and ending with the most evolved region M17.

 - **Abstract**
 B[e] type stars are characterised by strong emission lines, photometric $\&$ spectroscopic variabilities and unsteady mass-loss rates. MWC 137 is a galactic B[e] type star situated in the constellation Orion. Recent photometric observation of MWC 137 by TESS has revealed variabilities with a dominant period of 1.9 d. The origin of this variability is not known but suspected to be from stellar pulsation. To understand the nature and origin of this variability, we have constructed three different set of models of MWC 137 and performed non-adiabatic linear stability analysis. Several low order modes are found to be unstable in which models having mass in the range of 31 to 34 M$_{\odot}$ and 43 to 46 M$_{\odot}$ have period close to 1.9 d. The evolution of instabilities in the non-linear regime for model having solar chemical composition and mass of 45 M$_{\odot}$ leads to finite amplitude pulsation with a period of 1.9 d. Therefore in the present study we confirm that this variability in MWC 137 is due to pulsation. Evolutionary tracks passing through the location of MWC 137 in the HR diagram indicate that the star is either in post main sequence evolutionary phase or about to enter in this evolutionary phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO, VIRGO and KAGRA Gravitational-wave (GW) observatories are getting ready for their fourth observational period, O4, scheduled to begin in March 2023, with improved sensitivities and thus higher event rates. GW-related computing has both large commonalities with HEP computing, particularly in the domain of offline data processing and analysis, and important differences, for example in the fact that the amount of raw data doesn't grow much with the instrument sensitivity, or the need to timely generate and distribute "event candidate alerts" to EM and neutrino observatories, thus making gravitational multi-messenger astronomy possible. Data from the interferometers are exchanged between collaborations both for low-latency and offline processing; in recent years, the three collaborations designed and built a common distributed computing infrastructure to prepare for a growing computing demand, and to reduce the maintenance burden of legacy custom-made tools, by increasingly adopting tools and architectures originally developed in the context of HEP computing. So, for example, HTCondor is used for workflow management, Rucio for many data management needs, CVMFS for code and data distribution, and more. We will present GW computing use cases and report about the architecture of the computing infrastructure as will be used during O4, as well as some planned upgrades for the subsequent observing run O5.

 - **Abstract**
 Minkowski functionals quantify the morphology of smooth random fields. They are widely used to probe statistical properties of cosmological fields. Analytic formulae for ensemble expectations of Minkowski functionals are well known for Gaussian and mildly non-Gaussian fields. In this paper we extend the formulae to composite fields which are sums of two fields and explicitly derive the expressions for the sum of uncorrelated mildly non-Gaussian and Gaussian fields. These formulae are applicable to observed data which is usually a sum of the true signal and one or more secondary fields that can be either noise, or some residual contaminating signal. Our formulae provide explicit quantification of the effect of the secondary field on the morphology and statistical nature of the true signal. As examples, we apply the formulae to determine how the presence of Gaussian noise can bias the morphological properties and statistical nature of Gaussian and non-Gaussian CMB temperature maps.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-732 is an M dwarf hosting two transiting planets, which are located on the two opposite sides of the radius valley. By doubling the number of available space-based observations and increasing the number of radial velocity (RV) measurements, we aim at refining the parameters of TOI-732 b and c. We also aim at using the results to study the slope of both the radius valley and the density valley for a well characterised sample of M dwarf exoplanets. We performed a global MCMC analysis by jointly modelling ground-based light curves, CHEOPS and TESS observations, along with RV time series both taken from the literature and obtained with the MAROON-X spectrograph. The slopes of the M dwarf valleys were quantified via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) procedure. TOI-732 b is an ultra short period planet ($P\sim0.77$ d) with a radius $R_b=1.325_{-0.058}^{+0.057}$ $R_{\oplus}$ and a mass $M_b=2.46\pm0.19$ $M_{\oplus}$ (mean density $\rho_b=5.8_{-0.8}^{+1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$), while the outer planet at $P\sim12.25$ d has $R_c=2.39_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ $R_{\oplus}$, $M_c=8.04_{-0.48}^{+0.50}$ $M_{\oplus}$, and thus $\rho_c=3.24_{-0.43}^{+0.55}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Also considering our interior structure calculations TOI-732 b is a super-Earth and TOI-732 c is a mini-Neptune. Following the SVM approach, we quantified $\mathrm{d}\log{R_{p,{\mathrm{valley}}}}/\mathrm{d}\log{P}=-0.065_{-0.013}^{+0.024}$, which is flatter than for Sun-like stars. In line with former analyses, we noted a more filled radius valley for M-planets and we further quantified the density valley slope as $\mathrm{d}\log{\hat{\rho}_{\mathrm{valley}}}/\mathrm{d}\log{P}=-0.02_{-0.04}^{+0.12}$. Compared to FGK stars, the weaker dependence of the position of the radius valley with orbital period might indicate a heavier influence of formation relative to evolution mechanisms in shaping the radius valley around M-dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) relation of exoplanets is important for exoplanet characterization. Here we present a re-analysis of the $M$-$R$ relations and their transitions using exoplanetary data from the PlanetS catalog which accounts only for planets with reliable mass and radius determination. We find that "small planets" correspond to planets with masses of up to $7.80^{+9.74}_{-4.33} M_\oplus$ where $R \propto M^{0.41 \pm 0.09}$. Planets with masses between $7.80^{+9.74}_{-4.33} M_\oplus$ and $125^{+11}_{-10} M_\oplus$ can be viewed as "intermediate-mass" planets, where $R \propto M^{0.65 \pm 0.03}$. Massive planets, or gas giant planets, are found to have masses beyond $125^{+11}_{-10}M_\oplus$ with an $M$-$R$ relation of $R \propto M^{-0.02 \pm 0.01}$. By analyzing the radius-density relation we also find that the transition between "small" to "intermediate-size" planets occurs at a planetary radius of $1.69^{+0.45}_{-0.35}R_\oplus$. Our results are consistent with previous studies and provide an ideal fit for the currently-measured planetary population.

 - **Abstract**
 The reconstruction method has been widely employed to improve the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurement in spectroscopic survey data analysis. In this study, we explore the reconstruction of the BAO signals in the realm of photometric data. By adapting the Zel'dovich reconstruction technique, we develop a formalism to reconstruct the transverse BAO in the presence of photo-$z$ uncertainties. We access the performance of the BAO reconstruction through comoving $N$-body simulations. The transverse reconstruction potential can be derived by solving a 2D potential equation, with the surface density and the radial potential contribution acting as the source terms. The solution is predominantly determined by the surface density. As is evident in dense samples, such as the matter field, the transverse BAO reconstruction can enhance both the strength of the BAO signals and their cross correlation with the initial conditions. We contrast the 2D potential results with the 3D Poisson equation solution, wherein we directly solve the potential equation using the position in photo-$z$ space, and find good agreement. Additionally, we examine the impact of various conditions, such as the smoothing scales and the level of photo-$z$ uncertainties, on the reconstruction results. We envision the straightforward application of this method to survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 Familiar concepts in physics, such as Lorentz symmetry, are expected to be broken at energies approaching the Planck energy scale as predicted by several quantum-gravity theories. However, such very large energies are unreachable by current experiments on Earth. Current and future Cherenkov telescope facilities may have the capability to measure the accumulated deformation from Lorentz symmetry for photons traveling over large distances via energy-dependent time delays. One of the best natural laboratories to test Lorentz Invariance Violation~(LIV) signatures are Gamma-ray bursts~(GRBs). The calculation of time delays due to the LIV effect depends on the cosmic expansion history. In most of the previous works calculating time lags due to the LIV effect, the standard $\Lambda$CDM (or concordance) cosmological model is assumed. In this paper, we investigate whether the LIV signature is significantly different when assuming alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. Specifically, we consider cosmological models with a non-trivial dark-energy equation of state ($w \neq -1$), such as the standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder~(CPL) parameterization, the quadratic parameterization of the dark-energy equation of state, and the Pade parameterizations. We find that the relative difference in the predicted time lags is small, of the order of at most a few percent, and thus likely smaller than the systematic errors of possible measurements currently or in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar tachocline is an internal region of the Sun possessing strong radial and latitudinal shears straddling the base of the convective envelope. Based on helioseismic inversions, the tachocline is known to be thin (less than 5\% of the solar radius). Since the first theory of the solar tachocline in 1992, this thinness has not ceased to puzzle solar physicists. In this review, we lay out the grounds of our understanding of this fascinating region of the solar interior. We detail the various physical mechanisms at stake in the solar tachocline, and put a particular focus on the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain its thinness. We also examine the full range of MHD processes including waves and instabilies that are likely to occur in the tachocline, as well as their possible connection with active region patterns observed at the surface. We reflect on the most recent findings for each of them, and highlight the physical understanding that is still missing and that would allow the research community to understand, in a generic sense, how the solar tachocline and stellar tachocline are formed, are sustained, and evolve on secular timescales.

 JEM--EUSO is an international program for the development of space-based Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray observatories. The program consists of a series of missions which are either under development or in the data analysis phase. All instruments are based on a wide-field-of-view telescope, which operates in the near-UV range, designed to detect the fluorescence light emitted by extensive air showers in the atmosphere. We describe the simulation software ESAFin the framework of the JEM--EUSO program and explain the physical assumptions used. We present here the implementation of the JEM--EUSO, POEMMA, K--EUSO, TUS, Mini--EUSO, EUSO--SPB1 and EUSO--TA configurations in ESAF. For the first time ESAF simulation outputs are compared with experimental data.
#### A systematic study of the high-frequency bump in the black-hole low-mass  X-ray binary GX 339-4

 - **Abstract**
 The high-frequency bump, characterized by a frequency exceeding ~30 Hz, represents a seldom-explored time-variability feature in the power density spectrum (PDS) of black-hole X-ray binaries. In the 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2010 outbursts of GX 339-4, the bump has been occasionally observed in conjunction with type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We systematically study the properties of the bump during these four outbursts observed by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) in the 2-60 keV bands and detect the bump in 39 observations. While the frequencies of the type-C QPOs are in the range of ~0.1-9 Hz, the root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of the bump shows an evolution in the hardness ratio versus the type-C QPO frequency plot. By comparing the rms amplitude of the bump with the corona temperature and simultaneous radio jet flux of the source, as previously studied in GRS 1915+105, we establish that in the hard state of GX 339-4, the bump is always strong, with the measurements of the rms amplitude in the range of 4-10%. At the same time, the corona temperature is high and the radio flux is low. These findings indicate that, using the bump as a proxy, the majority of the accretion energy is directed towards the hot corona rather than being channeled into the radio jet. We discuss this phenomenon in terms of an inefficient energy transfer mechanism between the corona and jet in GX 339-4.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a non-Gaussianity consistency relation that enables the calculation of the squeezed limit bispectrum of the curvature perturbation in single-field inflationary models by carefully inspecting the background evolution and the linear perturbation theory. The consistency relation is more general than others in the literature since it does not require any specific symmetry, conservation of the curvature perturbation at large scales, attractor background evolution or canonical kinetic energy of the inflaton field. We demonstrate that all known examples of the squeezed limit bispectrum in single-field models of inflation can be reproduced within this framework.
#### The need for spatially resolved observations of PAHs in protoplanetary  discs

 - **Abstract**
 The signatures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been observed in protoplanetary discs, and their emission features obtained from spectral energy distributions (SED) have been used in the literature to characterise their size and determine their abundance. Two simple disc models (uniform PAH distribution against a PAH gap in the inner disc) are compared to investigate the difference of their SED and obtainable information. We used the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to model the SED of two protoplanetary discs orbiting a typical Herbig star, one of which features a depletion of PAHs in the inner disc. We further created artificial images of the discs at face-on view to extract radial profiles of the PAH emission in the infrared. We find that the extracted PAH features from an SED provide limited information about the PAHs in protoplanetary disc environments, except for the ionisation state. The distribution of PAHs in a protoplanetary disc influences the total observed PAH luminosity in a non-linear fashion and alters the relative strength between the 3.3\,$\mu$m and 11.3\,$\mu$m features. Furthermore, we produced radial profiles at the 3\,$\mu$m, 6\,$\mu$m and, 11\,$\mu$m PAH emission features and find that they follow a double power-law profile where the slope reflects the radiative environment (single photon regime vs. multi-photon regime) in which the PAHs lie. Using spatially resolved techniques such as IFU or imaging in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope, we find that multi-wavelength radial emission profiles will not only provide information on the spatial distribution of the PAHs, but may also provide information on their size and underlying UV environment, which is crucial for photo-evaporative disc wind models.
