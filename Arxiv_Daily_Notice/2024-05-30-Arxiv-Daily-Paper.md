          Binary craters on Ceres and Vesta and implications for binary asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Airless planetary objects have their surfaces covered by craters, and these can be used to study the characteristics of asteroid populations. Planetary surfaces present binary craters that are associated with the synchronous impact of binary asteroids. Aims. We identify binary craters on asteroids (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta, and aim to characterize the properties (size ratio and orbital plane) of the binary asteroids that might have formed them. Methods. We used global crater databases developed in previous studies and mosaics of images from the NASA DAWN mission high-altitude and low-altitude mapping orbits. We established selection criteria to identify craters that were most likely a product of the impact of a binary asteroid. We performed numerical simulations to predict the orientation of the binary craters assuming the population of impactors has mutual orbits coplanar with heliocentric orbits, as the current census of binary asteroids suggests. We compared our simulations with our survey of binary craters on Ceres and Vesta through a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results. We find geomorphological evidence of 39 and 18 synchronous impacts on the surfaces of Ceres and Vesta, respectively. The associated binary asteroids are widely separated and similar in diameter. The distributions of the orientation of these binary craters on both bodies are statistically different from numerical impact simulations that assume binary asteroids with coplanar mutual and heliocentric orbits. Conclusions. Although the identification of binary craters on both bodies and the sample size are limited, these findings are consistent with a population of well-separated and similarly sized binary asteroids with nonzero obliquity that remains to be observed, in agreement with the population of binary craters identified on Mars.

          Dust dynamics in RAMSES -- II. Equilibrium drift velocity distributions of charged dust grains

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the gas-grain relative drift velocity distributions of charged astrophysical dust grains in MHD turbulence. We do this using a range of MHD-PIC simulations spanning different plasma-$\beta$, sonic/Alfvén Mach number, and with grains of varying size and charge-to-mass ratio. We find that the root-mean-square drift velocity is a strong function of the grain size, following a power law with a 1/2 slope. The r.m.s. value has only a very weak dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. On the other hand, the shape of the distribution is a strong function of the grain charge-to-mass ratio, and in compressible turbulence, also the grain size. We then compare these results to simple analytic models based upon time-domain quasi-linear theory and solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. These models explain qualitatively the r.m.s. drift velocity's lack of charge-to-mass ratio dependence, as well as why the shape of the distribution changes as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. Finally we scale our results to astrophysical conditions. As an example, at a length scale of one parsec in the cold neutral medium, 0.1 $\mu$m grains should be drifting at roughly 40% of the turbulent velocity dispersion. These findings may serve as a basis for a model for grain velocities in the context of grain-grain collisions, non-thermal sputtering, and accretion of metals. These findings also have implications for the transport of grains through the galaxy, suggesting that grains may have non-negligible random motions at length-scales that many modern galaxy simulations approach.

          Probing Intracluster Dynamics and Evolution of Globular Clusters through Cataclysmic Variable Populations

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical interactions in globular clusters (GCs) significantly impact the formation and evolution of binary sources, including cataclysmic variables (CVs). This study investigates the connection between dynamical states of GCs and X-ray luminosity ($L_{x}$) distributions of CV populations through both simulations and actual observations. Utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation tool, MOCCA, we categorize the simulated GCs into three different evolutionary stages which are referred to as Classes I/II/III. Significant differences are found in the $L_{x}$ distributions of the CVs among these three Classes. In observational aspects, we have analyzed 179 CV candidates in 18 GCs observed by the {\it Chandra} X-ray Observatory. By dividing these GCs into three Families of different dynamical ages, namely Families I/II/III, the $L_{x}$ distributions of the CV candidates also show significant differences among these three Families. Both simulations and observational results suggest that CVs in more dynamically evolved clusters (Class/Family III) exhibit brighter X-ray emission. This highlights the influence of the dynamical status of a GC on the properties of its hosted compact binaries. Similar to blue stragglers, CV populations can serve as tracers of a GC's dynamical history. Our findings provide insights for understanding the interplay between intracluster dynamics and the evolution of compact binaries in GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN with flash spectroscopy features which exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at $\sim$7 Mpc. The light-curve evolution over the first 30 hours can be fit by two power law indices with a break after 22 hours, rising from $M_V \approx -12.95$ mag at +0.66 days to $M_V \approx -17.91$ mag after 7 days. In addition, the densely sampled color curve shows a strong blueward evolution over the first few days and then behaves as a normal SN II with a redward evolution as the ejecta cool. Such deviations could be due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Early high- and low-resolution spectra clearly show high-ionization flash features from the first spectrum to +3.42 days after the explosion. From the high-resolution spectra, we calculate the CSM velocity to be 37 $\pm~4~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} $. We also see the line strength evolve rapidly from 1.22 to 1.49 days in the earliest high-resolution spectra. Comparison of the low-resolution spectra with CMFGEN models suggests that the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of SN 2024ggi falls in a range of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is similar to that derived for SN 2023ixf. However, the rapid temporal evolution of the narrow lines in the spectra of SN 2024ggi ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 2.7 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) could indicate a smaller spatial extent of the CSM than in SN 2023ixf ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 5.4 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) which in turn implies lower total CSM mass for SN 2024ggi.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses Mpbh < 10^9 g undergo Hawking evaporation, around the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch. The evaporation process modifies the Universe's expansion rate and the baryon-to-photon ratio, leading to an alteration of the primordial abundance of light nuclei. We present numerical solutions for the set of equations describing this physics, considering different values of PBH masses and abundances at their formation, showing how their evaporation impacts the abundances of light nuclei, obtained by incorporating the non-standard Hubble rate and baryon-to-photon ratio into the BBN code PArthENoPE. The results are then used to place upper bounds for the PBH relative abundance at formation in the range 10^8 g < Mpbh < 10^9 g, providing the strongest constraints existing to-date in this mass range.

          Improving Harmonic Analysis using Multitapering: Precise frequency estimation of stellar oscillations using the harmonic F-test

 - **Abstract**
 In Patil et. al 2024a, we developed a multitaper power spectrum estimation method, mtNUFFT, for analyzing time-series with quasi-regular spacing, and showed that it not only improves upon the statistical issues of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, but also provides a factor of three speed up in some applications. In this paper, we combine mtNUFFT with the harmonic F-test to test the hypothesis that a strictly periodic signal or its harmonic (as opposed to e.g. a quasi-periodic signal) is present at a given frequency. This mtNUFFT/F-test combination shows that multitapering allows detection of periodic signals and precise estimation of their frequencies, thereby improving both power spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis. Using asteroseismic time-series data for the Kepler-91 red giant, we show that the F-test automatically picks up the harmonics of its transiting exoplanet as well as certain dipole ($l=1$) mixed modes. We use this example to highlight that we can distinguish between different types of stellar oscillations, e.g., transient (damped, stochastically-excited) and strictly periodic (undamped, heat-driven). We also illustrate the technique of dividing a time-series into chunks to further examine the transient versus periodic nature of stellar oscillations. The harmonic F-test combined with mtNUFFT is implemented in the public Python package tapify (this https URL), which opens opportunities to perform detailed investigations of periodic signals in time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter subhalos orbiting in a galactic halo perturb the orbits of stars in thin stellar streams. Over time the random velocities in the streams develop non-Gaussian wings. The rate of velocity increase is approximately a random walk at a rate proportional to the number of subhalos, primarily those in the mass range $\approx 10^{6-7} M_\odot$. The distribution of random velocities in long, thin, streams is measured in simulated Milky Way-like halos that develop in representative WDM and CDM cosmologies. The radial velocity distributions are well modeled as the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The resulting MCMC fits find Gaussian cores of 1-2 km/sec and exponential wings that increase from 3 km/sec for 5.5 keV WDM, 4 km/sec for 7 keV WDM, to 6 km/sec for a CDM halo. The observational prospects to use stream measurements to constrain the nature of galactic dark matter are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) is a mission concept for a far-infrared observatory developed under the recent Astrophysics Probe Explorer opportunity from NASA. The enabling element of the program is a 14 m diameter inflatable primary mirror, M1. Due to its importance to SALTUS and potentially other space observatories, this paper focuses entirely on M1. We present a historical overview of inflatable systems, illustrating that M1 is the logical next step in the evolution of such systems. The process of design and manufacture is addressed. We examine how M1 performs in its environment in terms of operating temperature, interaction with the solar wind, and shape change due to non-penetrating particles. We investigate the longevity of the inflatant in detail and show it meets mission lifetime requirements with ample margin and discuss the development and testing to realize the flight M1.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern high-sensitivity radio telescopes are discovering an increased number of resolved sources with intricate radio structures and fainter radio emissions. These sources often present a challenge because source detectors might identify them as separate radio sources rather than components belonging to the same physically connected radio source. Currently, there are no reliable automatic methods to determine which radio components are single radio sources or part of multi-component sources. We propose a deep learning classifier to identify those sources that are part of a multi-component system and require component association on data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). We combine different types of input data using multi-modal deep learning to extract spatial and local information about the radio source components: a convolutional neural network component that processes radio images is combined with a neural network component that uses parameters measured from the radio sources and their nearest neighbours. Our model retrieves 94 per cent of the sources with multiple components on a balanced test set with 2,683 sources and achieves almost 97 per cent accuracy in the real imbalanced data (323,103 sources). The approach holds potential for integration into pipelines for automatic radio component association and cross-identification. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can be used to integrate different types of data and create an effective solution for managing modern radio surveys.

          Isotopic evidence of long-lived volcanism on Io

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's moon Io hosts extensive volcanism driven by tidal heating. The isotopic composition of Io's inventory of volatile elements, including sulfur and chlorine, reflects its outgassing and mass loss history and provides an avenue for exploring its evolution. We used millimeter observations of Io's atmosphere to measure sulfur isotopes in gaseous SO2 and SO, and chlorine isotopes in gaseous NaCl and KCl. We find $^{34}$S/$^{32}$S=0.0595$\pm$0.0038 ($\delta^{34}$S=+347$\pm$86 per mille), which is highly enriched compared to average Solar System values and indicates that Io has lost 94 to 99% of its available sulfur. Our measurement of $^{37}$Cl/$^{35}$Cl=0.403$\pm$0.028 ($\delta^{37}$Cl=+263$\pm$88 per mille) shows chlorine is similarly enriched. These measurements indicate that Io has been volcanically active for most or all of its history, with potentially higher outgassing and mass-loss rates at earlier times.

 - **Abstract**
 Reanalyzing contact binaries with space-based photometric data and investigating possible parameter changes can yield accurate samples for theoretical studies. We investigated light curve solutions and fundamental parameters for twenty contact binary systems. The most recent Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data is used to analyze. The target systems in the investigation have an orbital period of less than 0.58 days. Light curve solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code version 2.4.9. The results show that systems had various mass ratios from q=0.149 to q=3.915, fillout factors from f=0.072 to f=0.566, and inclinations from i=52.8deg to i=87.3deg. The effective temperature of the stars was less than 7016 K, which was expected given the features of most contact binary stars. Twelve of the target systems' light curves were asymmetrical in the maxima, showing the O'Connell effect, and a starspot was required for light curve solutions. The estimation of the absolute parameters of the binary systems was presented using the a-P empirical relationship and discussed. The orbital angular momentum (J_0) of the systems was calculated. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the M-L, M-R, q-L_ratio, M_tot-J_0, and T-M diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The YORP effect is the thermal torque generated by radiation from the surface of an asteroid. The effect is sensitive to surface topology, including small-scale roughness, boulders, and craters. Aims: The aim of this paper is to develop a computationally efficient semi-analytical model for the crater-induced YORP (CYORP) effect that can be used to investigate the functional dependence of this effect. Methods. This study obtains the temperature field in a crater over a rotational period in the form of a Fourier series, accounting for the effects of self-sheltering, self-radiation, and self-scattering. Results. We obtain the temperature field of a crater, accounting for the thermal inertia, crater shape, and crater location. We then find that the CYORP effect is negligible when the depth-to-diameter ratio is smaller than 0.05. In this case, it is reasonable to assume a convex shape for YORP calculations. Varying the thermal conductivity yields a consistent value of approximately 0.01 for the spin component of the CYORP coefficient, while the obliquity component is inversely related to thermal inertia, declining from 0.004 in basalt to 0.001 in metal. For a z-axis symmetric shape, the CYORP spin component vanishes, while the obliquity component persists. Our model confirms that the total YORP torque is damped by a few tens of percent by uniformly distributed small-scale surface roughness. Furthermore, for the first time, we calculate the change in the YORP torque at each impact on the surface of an asteroid explicitly and compute the resulting stochastic spin evolution more precisely. Conclusions. The semi-analytical method that we developed, which benefits from fast computation, offers new perspectives for future investigations of the YORP modeling of real asteroids and for the complete rotational and orbital evolution of asteroids accounting for collisions.

          DESI Constraints on Exponential Quintessence

 - **Abstract**
 The DESI collaboration have recently analyzed their first year of data, finding a preference for thawing dark energy scenarios when using parameterized equations of state for dark energy. We investigate whether this preference persists when the data is analyzed within the context of a well-studied field theory model of thawing dark energy, exponential quintessence. No preference for this model over $\Lambda$CDM is found, and both models are poorer fits to the data than the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $w_0$--$w_a$ parameterization. We demonstrate that the worse fit is due to a lack of sharp features in the potential that results in a slowly-evolving dark energy equation of state that does not have enough freedom to simultaneously fit the combination of the supernovae, DESI, and cosmic microwave background data. Our analysis provides guidance for constructing dynamical dark energy models that are able to better accommodate the data.

          Kinetic temperature of massive star-forming molecular clumps measured with formaldehyde V. The massive filament DR21

 - **Abstract**
 The kinetic temperature structure of the massive filament DR21 has been mapped using the IRAM 30 m telescope. This mapping employed the para-H$_2$CO triplet ($J_{\rm K_aK_c}$ = 3$_{03}$--2$_{02}$, 3$_{22}$--2$_{21}$, and 3$_{21}$--2$_{20}$) on a scale of $\sim$0.1 pc. By modeling the averaged line ratios of para-H$_{2}$CO with RADEX under non-LTE assumptions, the kinetic temperature of the dense gas was derived at a density of $n$(H$_{2}$) = 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. The para-H$_2$CO lines reveal significantly higher temperatures than NH$_3$ (1,1)/(2,2) and FIR wavelengths. The dense clumps appear to correlate with the notable kinetic temperature. Among the four dense cores (N44, N46, N48, and N54), temperature gradients are observed on a scale of $\sim$0.1-0.3 pc. This suggests that the warm dense gas is influenced by internal star formation activity. With the exception of N54, the temperature profiles of these cores were fitted with power-law indices ranging from $-$0.3 to $-$0.5. This indicates that the warm dense gas is heated by radiation emitted from internally embedded protostar(s) and/or clusters. While there is no direct evidence supporting the idea that the dense gas is heated by shocks resulting from a past explosive event in the DR21 region, our measurements toward the DR21W1 region provide compelling evidence that the dense gas is indeed heated by shocks originating from the western DR21 flow. Higher temperatures appear to be associated with turbulence. The physical parameters of the dense gas in the DR21 filament exhibit a remarkable similarity to the results obtained in OMC-1 and N113. This may imply that the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics and thermodynamics of dense gas traced by H$_{2}$CO in diverse star formation regions may be dominated by common underlying principles despite variations in specific environmental conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated in detail the M5.8 class solar flare that occurred on 2023-03-06. This flare was one of the first strong flares observed by the Siberian Radioheliograph in the microwave range and the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory in the X-ray range. The flare consisted of two separate flaring events (a "thermal" and a "cooler" ones), and was associated with (and probably triggered by) a filament eruption. During the first part of the flare, the microwave emission was produced in an arcade of relatively short and low flaring loops. During the second part of the flare, the microwave emission was produced by energetic electrons trapped near the top of a large-scale flaring loop; the evolution of the trapped electrons was mostly affected by the Coulomb collisions. Using the available observations and the GX Simulator tool, we created a 3D model of the flare, and estimated the parameters of the energetic electrons in it.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the subsystems of the NIGHT instrument. NIGHT (the Near Infrared Gatherer of Helium Transits) is a narrowband, high-resolution spectrograph, marking the first dedicated survey instrument for exoplanetary atmosphere observations. Developed through a collaboration between the Observatory of Geneva and the Universite de Montreal, NIGHT aims to conduct an extensive statistical survey of helium atmospheres around 100+ exoplanets over several years. The instrument will report new detections of helium in exoplanet atmospheres and perform temporal monitoring of a subset of these. NIGHT measures absorption from the metastable helium state during exoplanet transits, observable in a triplet of lines around 1083nm. The instrument comprises a vacuum enclosure housing the spectrograph, a front end unit for fiber injection at the telescope's focal plane, and a calibration and control rack containing calibration light sources and control hardware. The spectrograph is optimized for efficiency, achieving a uniform throughput of approximately 71%. The primary disperser employs a VPH grating in a unique double-pass configuration, enabling a spectral resolution of 75,000 while maintaining high throughput. The detector is a HAWAII-1 infrared array, cooled to 85K, with the spectrograph operating at room temperature. Thanks to its relatively high throughput, NIGHT on a 2m class telescope is predicted to be as sensitive as existing instruments on 4m class telescopes. The front end unit injects starlight and sky background into two separate fibers leading to the spectrograph. It also performs near-infrared guiding and includes a mechanism for injecting calibration light. The assembly and optical alignment of NIGHT's spectrograph and front end unit are scheduled for July to September 2024, with the first light anticipated before early 2025.

          PT and anti-PT symmetries for astrophysical waves

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Discrete symmetries have found numerous applications in photonics and quantum mechanics, but remain little studied in fluid mechanics, particularly in astrophysics. Aims: We aim to show how PT and anti-PT symmetries determine the behaviour of linear perturbations in a wide class of astrophysical problems. They set the location of Exceptional Points in the parameter space and the associated transitions to instability, and are associated to the conservation of quadratic quantities that can be determined explicitly. Methods: We study several classical local problems: the gravitational instability of isothermal spheres and thin discs, the Schwarzschild instability, the Rayleigh-Bénard instability and acoustic waves in dust-gas mixtures. We calculate the locations and the order of the Exceptional Points with a method of resultant, as well as the conserved quantities in the different regions of the parameter space using Krein theory. Results: All problems studied here exhibit discrete symmetries, even though Hermiticity is broken by different physical processes (self-gravity, buoyancy, diffusion, drag). This analysis provides genuine explanations for certain instabilities, and for the existence of regions in the parameter space where waves do not propagate. Those correspond to breaking of PT and anti-PT symmetries respectively. Not all instabilities are associated to symmetry breaking (e.g. the Rayleigh-Benard instability).

 - **Abstract**
 We are developing an imaging polarimeter by combining a fine-pixel CMOS image sensor with a coded aperture mask as part of the cipher project, aiming to achieve X-ray polarimetry in the energy range of $10$$\unicode{x2013}$$30~\mathrm{keV}$. A successful proof-of-concept experiment was conducted using a fine-pixel CMOS sensor with a $2.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pixel size. In this study, we conducted beam experiments to assess the modulation factor (MF) of the CMOS sensor with a $1.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pixel size manufactured by Canon and to determine if there was any improvement in the MF. The measured MF was $8.32\% \pm 0.34\%$ at $10~\mathrm{keV}$ and $16.10\% \pm 0.68\%$ at $22~\mathrm{keV}$, exceeding those of the $2.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ sensor in the $6$$\unicode{x2013}$$22~\mathrm{keV}$ range. We also evaluated the quantum efficiency of the sensor, inferring a detection layer thickness of $2.67 \pm 0.48~{\rm \mu m}$. To develop a more sensitive polarimeter, a sensor with a thicker detection layer, smaller pixel size, and reduced thermal diffusion effect is desirable.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-thrust trajectories play a crucial role in optimizing scientific output and cost efficiency in asteroid belt missions. Unlike high-thrust transfers, low-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This complexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to orbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating low-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including analytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new analytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine learning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to estimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach, utilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various attributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving the time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights, which we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this database reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer transfers. Despite challenges such as multi revolution transfers, both approaches maintain accuracy within a few percent in the final mass errors, on a database of trajectories involving numerous asteroids. This work contributes to the efficient exploration of mission opportunities in the asteroid belt, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different approximation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients

 - **Abstract**
 The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, with different methods. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.

 Aims. We report the confirmation of a new transiting exoplanet orbiting the star TOI-5076. Methods. We present our vetting procedure and follow-up observations which led to the confirmation of the exoplanet TOI-5076b. In particular, we employed high-precision {\it TESS} photometry, high-angular-resolution imaging from several telescopes, and high-precision radial velocities from HARPS-N. Results. From the HARPS-N spectroscopy, we determined the spectroscopic parameters of the host star: T$\rm_{eff}$=(5070$\pm$143) K, log~g=(4.6$\pm$0.3), [Fe/H]=(+0.20$\pm$0.08), and [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.05$\pm$0.06. The transiting planet is a warm sub-Neptune with a mass m$\rm_p=$(16$\pm$2) M$\rm_{\oplus}$, a radius r$\rm_p=$(3.2$\pm$0.1)~R$\rm_{\oplus}$ yielding a density $\rho_p$=(2.8$\pm$0.5) g cm$^{-3}$. It revolves around its star approximately every 23.445 days. Conclusions. The host star is a metal-rich, K2V dwarf, located at about 82 pc from the Sun with a radius of R$_{\star}$=(0.78$\pm$0.01) R$_{\odot}$ and a mass of M$_{\star}$=(0.80$\pm$0.07) M$_{\odot}$. It forms a common proper motion pair with an M-dwarf companion star located at a projected separation of 2178 au. The chemical analysis of the host-star and the Galactic-space velocities indicate that TOI-5076 belongs to the old population of thin-to-thick-disk transition stars. The density of TOI-5076b suggests the presence of a large fraction by volume of volatiles overlying a massive core. We found that a circular orbit solution is marginally favored with respect to an eccentric orbit solution for TOI-5076b.

 - **Abstract**
 Low radio frequency spectral index measurements are a powerful tool to distinguish between different emission mechanisms and, in turn, to understand the nature of the sources. Besides the standard method of estimating the ``broadband" spectral index of sources from observations in two different frequency ``bands", if the observations were made with large instantaneous bandwidth, the ``in-band" spectral index can be determined, either using images of emission at multiple frequency ranges within a band or using the novel Multi Term-Multi Frequency Synthesis (MT-MFS) imaging algorithm. Here, using simulated upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) data, we have systematically studied the reliability of various methods of spectral index estimation for sources with a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is found that, for synthetic uGMRT point source data, the MT-MFS imaging algorithm produces in-band spectral indices for SNR~$\lesssim100$ that have errors $\gtrsim 0.2$, making them unreliable. However, at a similar SNR, the sub-band splitting method produces errors $\lesssim 0.2$, which are more accurate and unbiased in-band spectral indices. The broadband spectral indices produce errors $\lesssim 0.2$ even for SNR $\gtrsim 15$, and hence, they are most reliable if there are no higher-order variations in the spectral index. These results may be used to improve the uGMRT observation and data analysis strategies depending on the brightness of the target source.

 - **Abstract**
 The Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS) is the visible and near-infrared imaging spectrometer onboard ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. Before its integration into the spacecraft, the instrument undergoes an extensive ground calibration to establish its baseline performances. This process prepares the imaging spectrometer for flight operations by characterizing the behavior of the instrument under various operative conditions and uncovering instrumental distortions that may depend on instrumental commands. Two steps of the on-ground calibration campaigns were held at the instrument level to produce the data. Additional in-flight measurements have recently been obtained after launch during the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase. In this article, we present the analyses of these datasets, focusing on the characterization of the spectral performances. First, we describe and analyze the spectral calibration datasets obtained using both monochromatic sources and polychromatic sources coupled with solid and gas samples. Then, we derive the spectral sampling and the spectral response function over the entire field of view. These spectral characteristics are quantified for various operational parameters of MAJIS, such as temperature and spectral binning. The derived on-ground performances are then compared with in-flight measurements obtained after launch and presented in the framework of the MAJIS performance requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 Making use of the APOGEE DR17 catalogue with high quality data for 143,509 red giant branch stars we explore the strength of different mechanisms that causes a star to radially migrate in the Milky Way stellar disk. At any position in the disk we find stars that are more metal-rich than the local interstellar medium. This is surprising and normally attributed to the migration of these stars after their formation inside their current Galactocentric-radius. Such stars are prime candidates for studying the strength of different migratory processes. We specifically select two types of metal-rich stars: i) super metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] > 0.2) and ii) stars that are more metal-rich than their local environment. For both, we explore the distribution of orbital parameters and ages as evidence of their migration history. We find that most super metal-rich stars have experienced some amount of churning as they have orbits with Rg >= 5 kpc. Furthermore, about half of the super metal-rich stars are on non-circular orbits (ecc > 0.15) and therefore also have experienced blurring. The metallicity of young stars in our sample is generally the same as the metallicity of the interstellar medium, suggesting they have not radially migrated yet. Stars with lower metallicity than the local environment have intermediate to old ages. We further find that super metal-rich stars have approximately the same age distribution at all Galactocentric-radii, which suggests that radial migration is a key mechanism responsible for the chemical compositions of stellar populations in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2007 we were part of a team that discovered the so-called ``Lorimer Burst'', the first example of a new class of objects now known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). These enigmatic events are only a few ms in duration and occur at random locations on the sky at a rate of a few thousand per day. Several thousand FRBs are currently known. While it is now well established that they have a cosmological origin, and about 10\% of all currently known sources have been seen to exhibit multiple bursts, the origins of these enigmatic sources are currently poorly understood. In this article, we review the discovery of FRBs and present some of the highlights from the vast body of work by an international community. Following a brief overview of the scale of the visible Universe in §1, we describe the key moments in radio astronomy (§2) that led up to the discovery of the Lorimer burst (§3). Early efforts to find more FRBs are described in §4 which led to the discovery of the first repeating source (§5). In §6, as we close out on the second decade of FRBs, we outline some of the many open questions in the field and look ahead to the coming years where many surprises are surely in store.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars with about 45 to 80% the mass of the Sun, so-called K dwarf stars, have previously been proposed as optimal host stars in the search for habitable extrasolar worlds. These stars are abundant, have stable luminosities over billions of years longer than Sun-like stars, and offer favorable space environmental conditions. So far, the theoretical and experimental focus on exoplanet habitability has been on even less massive, though potentially less hospitable red dwarf stars. Here we present the first experimental data on the responses of photosynthetic organisms to a simulated K dwarf spectrum. We find that garden cress Lepidium sativum under K-dwarf radiation exhibits comparable growth and photosynthetic efficiency as under solar illumination on Earth. The cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 exhibits significantly higher photosynthetic efficiency and culture growth under K dwarf radiation compared to solar conditions. Our findings of the affirmative responses of these two photosynthetic organisms to K dwarf radiation suggest that exoplanets in the habitable zones around such stars deserve high priority in the search for extrasolar life.

 WST - Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: We summarise the design challenges of instrumentation for a proposed 12m class Telescope that aims to provide a large (>2.5 square degree) field of view and enable simultaneous Multi-object (> 20,000 objects) and Integral Field spectroscopy (inner 3x3 arcminutes field of view), initially at visible wavelengths. For the MOS mode, instrumentation includes the fiber positioning units, fiber runs and the high (R~40,000) and low (R~3,000 - 4,000) resolution spectrographs. For the MUSE like Integral Field Spectrograph, this includes the relay from the Telescope Focal Plane, the multi-stage splitting and slicing and almost 150 identical spectrographs. We highlight the challenge of mass production at a credible cost and the issues of maintenance and sustainable operation.

 - **Abstract**
 The intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) may be surrounded by dark matter (DM) minispikes. The dynamical friction from these DM minispike structures can affect the dynamics and the gravitational wave (GW) emission of the IMRIs. We analyze the effects of general dynamical friction, with a particular contribution from DM particles moving faster than the stellar-mass black hole in an eccentric IMRI. The results show that the dynamical friction caused by these DM particles tends to eccentricify the orbit, and the general dynamical friction is able to increase the eccentricity. We also analyze the effects of general dynamical friction on the GW characteristic strain. The results indicate that the peak value of the characteristic strain occurs at higher frequencies as the power law index of DM minispike $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ increases. For the first time, a general analytical relation between the frequency peak value of characteristic strain of GWs and $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ is established. Using the analytical relation, the presence of DM and its halo density may be determined potentially from future GW data.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and others stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizeable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 Between 2001 and 2023, we obtained high spectral resolution mid-infrared observations of Io using the TEXES instrument at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. These observations were centered at 529.8 cm-1 (18.88 {\mu}m) and include several SO2 absorption lines. By modeling the shapes and strengths of these absorption lines, we are able to determine how Io's SO2 atmospheric density varies over the 22-year time period, covering nearly two Jovian years. Previous analysis has shown that the density of Io's atmosphere on the anti-Jovian hemisphere exhibits clear seasonal temporal variability, which can be modeled as the sum of a seasonally-varying frost sublimation component and a constant component, assumed to be volcanic. The new data show that the seasonal pattern repeats during the second Jovian year, confirming the importance of sublimation support. The considerable longitudinal variability in Io's atmospheric density found in previous work is also stable over the second Jovian year with the SO2 column density on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere being 5--8 times lower than the anti-Jovian hemisphere. For the first time, we detect seasonal variability on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere as well. This can also be modeled as a combination of sublimation and a small constant source. The lower atmospheric density on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere can plausibly be explained by the daily Jupiter eclipses, which decrease the surface temperature and therefore reduce the sublimation-driven component of the atmosphere, combined with a lower level of volcanic activity directly emitting SO2 into the atmosphere.

          Detecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes in Slow-reheating Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 After primordial inflation, the universe may have experienced a prolonged reheating epoch, potentially leading to a phase of matter domination supported by the oscillating inflaton field. During such an epoch, perturbations in the inflaton virialize upon reentering the cosmological horizon, forming inflaton structures. If the primordial overdensities are sufficiently large, these structures collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). To occur at a significant rate, this process requires an enhanced primordial power spectrum (PPS) at small scales. The enhancement of the PPS, as well as the formation and tidal interaction of the primordial structures, will in turn source a stochastic gravitational wave background(SGWB) that could be detected by current and/or future gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we study the SGWB arising from these different sources during slow-reheating, focusing on a PPS that satisfies the requirements necessary for the formation of PBHs with a mass of $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq 10^{21}$ and that constitute the entirety of dark matter in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of X-ray polarization from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary and Z-source, GX~340$+$0, using an Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation in March 2024. Along with the IXPE observation, we conducted an extensive X-ray and radio monitoring campaign to ascertain the source properties during and around the IXPE observation. The source was within the horizontal branch throughout the multiwavelength campaign. We measured a significant X-ray polarization in 2--8 keV with polarization degree (PD) = $4.02 \pm 0.35$% and polarization angle (PA) = $37.6 \pm 2.5^\circ$. The energy-dependent polarization indicates that in the 2-2.5 keV energy range, the PA is much lower, $\sim9\pm8^\circ$, while other energy bands are consistent with the PA found over 2.5--8 keV. The simultaneous AstroSat-IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations provide some evidence for independent polarization from various spectral components, hinting at a disparity in the PA from the accretion disk and the Comptonized emission, while suggesting an unpolarized emission from the blackbody component. Radio observations in the 0.7--9 GHz frequency range reveal a non-detection of radio emission in 0.7-1.5 GHz and a significant detection in 5.5--9 GHz, suggesting the presence of a spectral break in 1.5-5.5 GHz. Using ATCA observation we place upper limits on the radio polarization at $<$6% on the linear polarization and $<$4% on the circular polarization at 3$\sigma$ level. We discuss the origin of the X-ray polarization and its implications on the geometry of the spectral components.

 - **Abstract**
 Barium (Ba) stars help to verify asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star nucleosynthesis models since they experienced pollution from an AGB binary companion and thus their spectra carry the signatures of the slow neutron capture process (s process). For 180 Ba stars, we searched for AGB stellar models that match the observed abundance patterns. We employed three machine learning algorithms as classifiers: a Random Forest method, developed for this work, and the two classifiers used in our previous study. We studied the statistical behaviour of the s-process elements in the observational sample to investigate if the AGB models systematically under- or overpredict the abundances observed in the Ba stars and show the results in the form of violin plots of the residuals between spectroscopic abundances and model predictions. We find a significant trend in the residuals that implies an underproduction of the elements Nb, Mo, and Ru in the models relative to the observations. This may originate from a process (e.g. the intermediate neutron-capture process, i process) at the metallicity of the Ba stars not yet included in the AGB models. Correlations are found between the residuals of these elements, suggesting a common origin for the deviations. In addition, there is a weak metallicity dependence of their residuals. The s-process temperatures derived with the [Zr/Fe] - [Nb/Fe] thermometer have an unrealistic value for the majority of our stars. The most likely explanation is that at least a fraction of these elements are not produced in a steady-state s process, and instead may be due to processes not included in the AGB models. The mass distribution of the identified models confirms that our sample of Ba stars was polluted by low-mass AGB stars. Most of the matching AGB models require low accreted mass, but a few systems with high accreted mass are needed to explain the observations. (abridged)
