 - **Abstract**
 On 8 April 2024, tens of millions of people across North America will be able to view a total solar eclipse. Such astronomical events have been important throughout history, but with nearly 10,000 satellites in orbit, we question whether total eclipses will now reveal a sky full of satellites, fundamentally changing this experience for humanity. Using the current population of Starlink satellites, we find that the brightest satellites would be naked-eye visible in dark skies, but the high sky brightness during totality will make them undetectable to the unaided eye. Our model does not take into account the effects of chance reflections from large, flat surfaces like solar panels, which we expect will cause glints and flares that could be visible from large satellites and abandoned rocket bodies. Time-lapse all-sky imaging might reveal satellites during the eclipse.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure (LSS) through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral-angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near infrared: H$\alpha$, $[$\ion{O}{3}$]$, H$\beta$, and $[$\ion{O}{2}$]$. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ level at $z<2$. For the brightest line H$\alpha$, the $10\sigma$ sensitivity can be achieved out to $z\sim3$. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parametrizations.
#### The Hybrid Debris Disk Host Star HD 21997 is a High-Frequency Delta  Scuti Pulsator

 - **Abstract**
 HD 21997 is host to a prototypical "hybrid" debris disk characterized by debris disk-like dust properties and a CO gas mass comparable to a protoplanetary disk. We use Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite time series photometry to demonstrate that HD 21997 is a high-frequency delta Scuti pulsator. If the mode identification can be unambiguously determined in future works, an asteroseismic age of HD 21997 may become feasible.
#### On the origin of mixed morphology supernova remnants: Linking their  properties to the evolution of a red supergiant progenitor star

 - **Abstract**
 Mixed-morphology supernova remnants (MMSNRs) are characterized by a shell-like morphology in the radio and centrally-peaked thermal emission in the X-ray band. The nature of this peculiar class of supernova remnants (SNRs) remains a controversial issue. In this work, by pairing the predictions of stellar evolution theory with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations we show that the mixed morphology properties of a SNR can arise by the interaction of the SNR with the circumstellar medium shaped by a red supergiant progenitor star, embedded in a dense environment. As a study case, we model the circumstellar medium formation and the subsequent interaction of the SNR with it of a $15~\rm M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. The reflected shock, formed by the collision of the SNR with the density walls of the surrounding circumstellar cavity, accumulates and re-shocks the supernova ejecta at the center of the remnant, increasing its temperature so that the gas becomes X-ray bright. Such a formation mechanism may naturally explain the nature of MMSNRs resulted from Type II supernovae without the demand of additional physical mechanisms and/or ambient medium inhomogeneities. We discuss alternative evolutionary paths that potentially could be ascribed for the MMSNR formation within the framework of the reflected shock model.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep interferometric observations of CO and dust continuum emission are obtained with the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) at 230 GHz to investigate the physical nature of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) population in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We use J = 2-1 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission to derive the masses, sizes and velocity dispersions of 162 spatially resolved GMCs. We perform a detailed study of a subset of 117 GMCs that exhibit simple, single component line profile shapes. Examining the Larson scaling relations for these GMCs we find: 1- a highly correlated mass-size relation in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission; 2- a weakly correlated $^{12}$CO linewidth-size (LWS) relation along with a weaker, almost non-existent, $^{13}$CO LWS relation, suggesting a possible dependence of the LWS relation on spatial scale; and 3-that only 43\% of these GMCs are gravitationally bound. We identify two classes of GMCs based on the strength and extent of their $^{13}$CO emission. Examination of the Larson relations finds that both classes are individually characterized by strong $^{12}$CO mass-size relations and much weaker $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO LWS relations. The majority (73\%) of strong $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are found to be gravitationally bound. However, only 25\% of the weak $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are bound. The resulting breakdown in the Larson relations in the weak $^{13}$CO emitting population decouples the mass-size and LWS relations demonstrating that independent physical causes are required to understand the origin of each. Finally, in nearly every aspect, the physical properties of the M31 GMCs are found to be very similar to those of local Milky Way clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been accepted that the cosmos determine our personalities, relationships, and even our fate. Unlike our condensed matter colleagues - who regularly use quantum mechanics to determine the healing properties of crystals - astrology techniques have been unchanged since the 19th century. In this paper, we discuss how astrophysical messengers beyond starlight can be used to predict the future and excuse an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of our negative personality traits.

 Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5, and explore its association with ambient molecular clouds (MCs). Methods. We present large-field CO (J=1-0) molecular line observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. The observations have an angular resolution of $\sim 55 ''$. We analyzed the spatial distribution of MCs in relation to the SNR shell detected in previous Urumqi $\lambda$ 6 cm radio observations and examined the CO spectra for kinematics information. Results. We find that MCs at the velocity range of [-14, -2] km s$^{-1}$ are spatially distributed along the radio shell of the SNR. Line broadening and asymmetries are observed in the CO spectra of the clouds. Moreover, we find that the molecular clouds around the shell have systematic velocity gradients in the position-velocity (PV) diagrams. Both morphology alignment and gas kinematics suggest that the SNR is associated with the ambient MCs at $\sim$ 740 pc. Based on the CO gas distance, the dimension and the age of the SNR is estimated to be 40 pc $\times$ 33 pc and 3.8 $ \times 10^4$ years, respectively. The very high energy emission of 1LHAASO J0428+5531 toward the SNR may originate from the interaction between the SNR and the surrounding MCs.
#### Deeper Learning in Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that the best way to understand astronomical data is through machine learning, where a "black box" is set up, inside which a kind of artificial intelligence learns how to interpret the features in the data. We suggest that perhaps there may be some merit to a new approach in which humans are used instead of machines to understand the data. This may even apply to fields other than astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper argues why FLAMINGO (Fast Light Atmospheric Monitoring and Imaging Novel Gamma-ray Observatory) is the perfect name for an array of very-high-energy Cherenkov telescopes. Studies which indicate pink is the most suitable pigment for the structures of Cherenkov telescopes have passed with flying colors. Pink optimizes the absorption and reflectivity properties of the telescopes with respect to the characteristic blue color of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by high-energy particles in the atmosphere. In addition to giving the sensitivity a big leg up, a pink color scheme also adds a unique and visually appealing aspect to the project's branding and outreach efforts. FLAMINGO has a fun and memorable quality that can help to increase public engagement and interest in astrophysics and also help to promote diversity in the field with its colorful nature. In an era of increasingly unpronounceable scientific acronyms, we are putting our foot down. FLAMINGO is particularly fitting, as flamingos have eyesight optimized to detect small particles, aligning with the primary purpose of Cherenkov telescopes to detect faint signals from air showers. We should not wait in the wings just wishing for new name to come along: in FLAMINGO we have an acronym that both accurately reflects the science behind Cherenkov telescopes and provides a visually striking identity for the project. While such a sea change will be no easy feet, we are glad to stick our necks out and try: FLAMINGO captures the essence of what an array of Cherenkov telescopes represents and can help to promote the science to a wider audience. We aim to create an experiment and brand that people from all walks of life will flock to.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust radiative transfer techniques are requisite for efficiently extracting the physical and chemical information from molecular rotational lines.We study several hypotheses that enable robust estimations of the column densities and physical conditions when fitting one or two transitions per molecular species. We study the extent to which simplifying assumptions aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem introduce estimation biases and how to detect them.We focus on the CO and HCO+ isotopologues and analyze maps of a 50 square arcminutes field. We used the RADEX escape probability model to solve the statistical equilibrium equations and compute the emerging line profiles, assuming that all species coexist. Depending on the considered set of species, we also fixed the abundance ratio between some species and explored different values. We proposed a maximum likelihood estimator to infer the physical conditions and considered the effect of both the thermal noise and calibration uncertainty. We analyzed any potential biases induced by model misspecifications by comparing the results on the actual data for several sets of species and confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations. The variance of the estimations and the efficiency of the estimator were studied based on the Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound.Column densities can be estimated with 30% accuracy, while the best estimations of the volume density are found to be within a factor of two. Under the chosen model framework, the peak 12CO(1--0) is useful for constraining the kinetic temperature. The thermal pressure is better and more robustly estimated than the volume density and kinetic temperature separately. Analyzing CO and HCO+ isotopologues and fitting the full line profile are recommended practices with respect to detecting possible biases.Combining a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model with a rigorous analysis of the accuracy allows us to obtain an efficient estimator and identify where the model is misspecified. We note that other combinations of molecular lines could be studied in the future.
#### Clumpy accretion as a possible reason of prolonged eclipses of UX~Ori  type stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20065
 - **Abstract**
 The paper proposes a model of deep and prolonged eclipses of young stars of the UX~Ori type. Some of these events continue for decades and existing models cannot explain them. Our paper shows that such eclipses can be caused by the falling of gas and dust clump from the remnants of the protostellar cloud onto the protoplanetary disk. The disturbance in the disk caused by the fall of the clump leads to a surge in the accretion activity of the star and, as a consequence, to an increase in the disk wind. If the circumstellar disk is tilted at a slight angle to the line of sight, then dust raised by the wind from the surface of the disk can cause a strong decrease in the star's brightness, which can last for decades.
#### Post-AGB candidate IRAS 02143+5852: Cepheid-like variability,  three-layer circumstellar dust envelope and spectral features

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of multicolour $UBVR_{\text{C}}I_{\text{C}}JHK$ photometry, spectroscopic analysis and spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling for the post-AGB candidate IRAS 02143+5852. We detected Cepheid-like light variations with the full peak-to-peak amplitude $\Delta V\sim0.9$ mag and the pulsation period of about 24.9 d. The phased light curves appeared typical for the W Vir Cepheids. The period-luminosity relation for the Type II Cepheids yielded the luminosity $\log L/L_{\odot}\sim2.95$. From a low-resolution spectrum, obtained at maximum brightness, the following atmospheric parameters were determined: $T_\text{eff}\sim7400$ K and $\log g\sim1.38$. This spectrum contains the emission lines H$\alpha$, BaII $\lambda$6496.9, HeI $\lambda$10830 and Pa$\beta$. Spectral monitoring performed in 2019-2021 showed a significant change in the H$\alpha$ profile and appearance of CH and CN molecular bands with pulsation phase. The metal lines are weak. Unlike typical W Vir variables, the star shows a strong excess of infrared radiation associated with the presence of a heavy dust envelope around the star. We modelled the SED using our photometry and archival data from different catalogues and determined the parameters of the circumstellar dust envelope. We conclude that IRAS~02143+5852 is a low-luminosity analogue of dusty RV Tau stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offers a unique avenue for exploring the early Universe's dynamics and evolution. In this paper, we delve into the fascinating realm of slow-roll inflation, contextualizing the primordial acoustic perturbations as the resonant echoes akin to the iconic sound of Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. By extrapolating polynomial potentials for these primordial sounds, we illuminate their role in shaping the inflationary landscape. Leveraging this framework, we calculate the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), providing insights into the underlying physics governing the inflationary epoch. Employing a rigorous chi-square ($\chi^2$) analysis, we meticulously scrutinize the Planck data combined with that offered by the BICEP/Keck collaboration to identify the Chewbacca sound profile that best aligns with observational constraints. Our findings not only shed light on the intricate interplay between sound and cosmology but also unveil intriguing parallels between the cosmic symphony of the early universe and beloved cultural icons.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled the frontier of observational galaxy formation to push to ever higher redshift, deep within cosmic dawn. However, what is high-redshift, and when was cosmic dawn? While widely used, these terms (as well as many other confusing terms) are not consistently defined in the literature; this both hampers effective communication but also impedes our ability to precisely characterize and understand the phenomena under investigation. In this article we seek to address this issue of utmost importance. We begin by definitively defining terms such as ``high-redshift'', ``cosmic dawn'', etc. However, despite the rigorous definitions for them we present, both the adjective-based redshift and diurnal marker (time-of-day) division schemes suffer from issues including not being sufficiently granular, angering cosmologists, being arbitrary, and having a geocentric bias. To overcome these we introduce the \textit{redshiFt epOchs fOr everyboDy} (FOOD) framework, a revolutionary new division scheme based on eating occasions, i.e. meals.

 - **Abstract**
 A Total Solar Eclipse (TSE) is a shocking and sublime experience. In just a week hundreds of millions of Homo Sapiens will attempt to see the 2024 eclipse as it stretches across the North American continent. However, while Homo Sapiens may be uniquely positioned to understand and predict eclipses, they are not the only species capable of observing them. The precise alignment of the Moon, Earth and Sun all existed well before humans. In the same way we share this planet capable of hosting life, the fantastic astronomical experiences available on it are not exclusive either. We present a framework to calculate the number of Total Solar Eclipses experienced by a species at any point in Earth's history. This includes factoring in the evolution of the Sun-Moon-Earth system, the duration the species is extant, and average population. We normalize over the geographic range by calculating an Astronomical World Eclipse Surface cOverage MEtric (AWESOME) time. To illustrate this framework we look at the case study of the family Limulidae (Horseshoe Crabs) and estimate the number of individuals that have seen an eclipse. We compare it to the number of current Homo Sapiens that view eclipses, and predict if it is possible for another species to take the ''top'' spot before the final total solar eclipse in ~ 380 million years.
#### Estimation of Orbital Parameters from (u,v)-coverage for a Space Radio  Interferometer

 - **Abstract**
 Finding a suitable very long baseline (VLBI) interferometer geometry is a key task in planning observations, especially imaging sessions. The main characteristic of the quality of VLBI imaging data is the (u, v)-coverage. In the case when one or more radio telescopes are located in space, this task becomes more complex. This paper presents a method for recovering the optimal orbital parameters of space radio telescopes for a given desired (u, v)-coverage, which in turn is the inverse task of searching for the optimal geometry and orbital configurations of space-ground and pure space VLBI interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, cosmology has seen a surge in alternative models that purport to solve the discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ as measured by cosmological microwave background anisotropies and local supernovae, respectively. In particular, many of the most successful approaches have involved varying fundamental constants, such as an alternative value of the fine structure constant and time-varying values of the electron mass, the latter of which showed particular promise as the strongest candidate in several earlier studies. Inspired by these approaches, in this paper, we investigate a cosmological model where the value of the geometric constant $\pi$ is taken to be a free model parameter. Using the latest CMB data from Planck as well as baryon-acoustic oscillation data, we constrain the parameters of the model and find a strong correlation between $\pi$ and $H_0$, with the final constraint $H_0 = 71.3 \pm 1.1 \ \mathrm{ km/s/Mpc}$, equivalent to a mere $1.5\sigma$ discrepancy with the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration. Furthermore, our results show that $\pi = 3.206 \pm 0.038$ at $95 \%$ C.L., which is in good agreement with several external measurements discussed in the paper. Hence, we conclude that the $\pi \Lambda$CDM model presented in this paper, which has only a single extra parameter, currently stands as the perhaps strongest solution to the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, exoplanet atmospheric characterization has became what some might call the cosmology of astronomy. In an attempt to extract and understand the weak planetary signals (a few percent down to a few tens of ppm times that of their host-star signals), researchers have developed dozens of idealized planetary atmospheric models. Physical interpretations hinge on pretending that we understand stellar signals (as well behaved mostly temporarily static spherical cows), as well as planetary signals (as unidimensional objects, or sometimes quasi-multidimensional objects). The discovery of small and cool planets has lead to analyze planetary signals well below the designed photometric precision of current instrumentation. The challenge is up there, and keep us busy, so all is well. Here we present yet another open-source tool to analyze exoplanet data of time-series observations. The {\puppies} code is available via PyPI (\texttt{pip install exo-puppies}) and conda, the documentation is located at https://puppies.rtfd.io
#### The Effect of Starspots on Spectroscopic Age and Mass Estimates of  Non-Accreting T~Tauri Stars in the Taurus-Auriga Star Forming Region

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate age and mass determinations for young pre-main sequence stars are made challenging by the presence of large-scale starspots. We present results from a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of ten T-Tauri Stars in Taurus-Auriga that characterize spot filling factors and temperatures, the resulting effects on temperature and luminosity determinations, and the consequences for inferred stellar masses and ages. We constructed composite models of spotted stars by combining BTSettl-CIFIST synthetic spectra of atmospheres to represent the spots and the photosphere along with continuum emission from a warm inner disk. Using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, we find the best-fit spot and photospheric temperatures, spot filling factors, as well as disk filling factors. This methodology allowed us to reproduce the 0.75-2.40 micron stellar spectra and molecular feature strengths for all of our targets, disentangling the complicated multi-component emission. For a subset of stars with multi-epoch observations spanning an entire stellar rotation, we correlate the spectral variability and changes in the filling factors with rotational periods observed in K2 and AAVSO photometry. Combining spot-corrected effective temperatures and Gaia distances, we calculate luminosities and use the Stellar Parameters of Tracks with Starspots (SPOTS) models to infer spot-corrected masses and ages for our sample of stars. Our method of accounting for spots results in an average increase of 60% in mass and a doubling in age with respect to traditional methods using optical spectra that do not account for the effect of spots.
#### In Violation of the Prime Directive: Simulating detriments to  Delta-Quadrant civilizations from the starship Voyager's impact on planetary  rings

 - **Abstract**
 In the seven years that the starship Voyager spent in the Delta Quadrant, it used many questionable techniques to engage with alien civilizations and ultimately find its way home. From detailed studies of their logs and opening credits, we simulate Voyager's practice of orbiting a planet, to examine the effect on planetary rings. We outline a feasible planetary system and simulate the extent to which its rings would be disrupted. We find that Voyager's orbit could inflate the height of the rings in the vicinity of the spacecraft by a factor of 2, as well as increase the relative speeds of neighboring planetesimals within the rings. This increase in ring thickness has the potential to alter shadows on any moons of this planet, impacting ring-shadow based religions. Additionally, the acceleration of these planetesimals could rival their gravity, bucking any alien inhabitants and their tiny civilizations off of their planetesimal homeworlds. Finally, we posit that due to increased collisions amongst the planetesimals (which may harbor tiny intelligent life) the trajectory of these civilizations may be forever altered, violating the prime directive.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of planets in the solar system over the last three centuries has, perhaps surprisingly, been less of a fixed value than one would think it should be. In this paper, we look at the specific case of Vulcan, which was both a planet before Pluto was a planet and discarded from being a planet before Pluto was downgraded. We examine the historical context that led to its discovery in the 19th century, the decades of observations that were taken of it, and its eventual fall from glory. By applying a more modern understanding of astrophysics, we provide multiple mechanisms that may have changed the orbit of Vulcan sufficiently that it would have been outside the footprint of early 20th century searches for it. Finally, we discuss how the April 8, 2024 eclipse provides a renewed opportunity to rediscover this lost planet after more than a century of having been overlooked.

 - **Abstract**
 The super-Earth LHS 1140 b is an interesting target for atmospheric observations since it is close to the habitable zone of its star and falls in the gap of the radius distribution of small exoplanets, in the region thought to correspond to the transition between planets with and without atmospheres. Observations of the primary transit with WFC3 on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed a modulation in the planet transmission spectrum compatible with the presence of water; however this modulation may be also due to stellar activity-related phenomena. Here we present a detailed analysis of the WFC3/HST observations to probe the nature of this modulation and to understand if it can be attributable to the presence of unocculted spots on the stellar surface. Our analysis strongly suggests that LHS1140 is a rather quiet star with subsolar [Fe/H] and enriched in alpha elements. Therefore, we rule out the possibility that the planetary spectrum is affected by the presence of spots and faculae. This analysis shows the importance of a proper modelling of the stellar spectrum when analyzing transit observations. Finally, we modelled the planetary atmosphere of LHS1140 b to retrieve its atmospheric composition. However, the low resolution and the narrow spectral range of HST observations prevented us from definitively determining whether the spectral features are attributable to the presence of water or of other molecules in the planetary atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Understanding the Milky Way's formation and evolution across cosmic epochs necessitates precise stellar age determination across all Galactic components. Recent advancements in asteroseismology, spectroscopy, stellar modelling, and machine learning, coupled with all-sky surveys, now offer highly reliable stellar age estimates. Aims. This study aims to furnish accurate age assessments for the Main Red Star Sample within the APOGEE DR17 catalogue. Leveraging asteroseismic age constraints, we employ machine learning to achieve this goal. Methods. We explore optimal non-asteroseismic stellar parameters, including T$_{eff}$, L, [CI/N], [Mg/Ce], [$\alpha$/Fe], U(LSR) velocity, and 'Z' vertical height from the Galactic plane, to predict ages via categorical gradient boost decision trees. Training merges samples from the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone and Second APOKASC catalogue to mitigate data shifts, enhancing prediction reliability. Validation employs an independent dataset from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program. Results. Our model yields a median fractional age error of 20.8%, with a prediction variance of 4.77%. Median fractional errors for stars older than 3 Gyr range from 7% to 23%, from 1 to 3 Gyr range from 26% to 28%, and for stars younger than 1 Gyr, it's 43%. Applicable to 125,445 stars in the APOGEE DR17 Main Red Star Sample, our analysis confirms previous findings on the young Galactic disc's flaring and reveals an age gradient among the youngest Galactic plane stars. Additionally, we identify two groups of metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1 dex) young stars (Age < 2 Gyr) exhibiting similar chemical abundances and halo kinematics, likely remnants of the predicted third gas infall episode (~2.7 Gyr ago).

 - **Abstract**
 We aim at facilitating the visualization of astrophysical data for several tasks, such as uncovering patterns, presenting results to the community, and facilitating the understanding of complex physical relationships to the public. We present pastamarkers, a customized Python package fully compatible with matplotlib, that contains unique pasta-shaped markers meant to enhance the visualization of astrophysical data. We prove that using different pasta types as markers can improve the clarity of astrophysical plots by reproducing some of the most famous plots in the literature.
