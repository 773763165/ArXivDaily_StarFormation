 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for the prioritization of high-precision photometric monitoring of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions to detect brightness variability arising from features in their atmospheres. Measurements of photometric variability provide not only an insight into the physical appearances of these companions, but are also a direct probe of their atmospheric structures and dynamics, and yield valuable estimates of their rotation periods. JWST is uniquely capable of monitoring faint exoplanet companions over their full rotation periods, thanks to its inherent stability and powerful high-contrast coronagraphic imaging modes. Rotation period measurements can be further combined with measurements of v sin i obtained using high-resolution spectroscopy to infer the viewing angle of a companion. Photometric monitoring over multiple rotation periods and at multiple epochs will allow both short- and long-term time evolution in variability signals to be traced. Furthermore, the differences between the layers in a companion's atmosphere can be probed by obtaining simultaneous photometric monitoring at different wavelengths through NIRCam dual-band coronagraphy. Overall, JWST will reach the highest sensitivities to variability to date and enable the light curves of substellar companions to be characterised with unprecedented cadence and precision at the sub-percent level.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO), due to start full science operations in early 2025, aims to set tight constraints on inflationary physics by inferring the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from measurements of CMB polarization $B$-modes. Its nominal design targets a precision $\sigma(r=0) \leq 0.003$ without delensing. Achieving this goal and further reducing uncertainties requires the mitigation of other sources of large-scale $B$-modes such as Galactic foregrounds and weak gravitational lensing. We present an analysis pipeline aiming to estimate $r$ by including delensing within a cross-spectral likelihood, and demonstrate it on SO-like simulations. Lensing $B$-modes are synthesised using internal CMB lensing reconstructions as well as Planck-like CIB maps and LSST-like galaxy density maps. This $B$-mode template is then introduced into SO's power-spectrum-based foreground-cleaning algorithm by extending the likelihood function to include all auto- and cross-spectra between the lensing template and the SAT $B$-modes. Within this framework, we demonstrate the equivalence of map-based and cross-spectral delensing and use it to motivate an optimized pixel-weighting scheme for power spectrum estimation. We start by validating our pipeline in the simplistic case of uniform foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the absence of primordial $B$-modes, $\sigma(r)$ decreases by 37% as a result of delensing. Tensor modes at the level of $r=0.01$ are successfully detected by our pipeline. Even with more realistic foreground models including spatial variations in the dust and synchrotron spectral properties, we obtain unbiased estimates of $r$ by employing the moment-expansion method. In this case, delensing-related improvements range between 27% and 31%. These results constitute the first realistic assessment of the delensing performance at SO's nominal sensitivity level.

 - **Abstract**
 The second "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter" (MDvDM'24) meeting was held January 8-11, 2024 in Arlington, VA, USA, hosted by Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. This document collects contributions from this workshop, providing an overview of activities in the field. MDvDM'24 was the second topical workshop dedicated to the emerging field of mineral detection of neutrinos and dark matter, following a meeting hosted by IFPU in Trieste, Italy in October 2022. Mineral detectors have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, including searching for dark matter, measuring various fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos over gigayear timescales, monitoring nuclear reactors, and nuclear disarmament protocols; both as paleo-detectors using natural minerals that could have recorded the traces of nuclear recoils for timescales as long as a billion years and as detectors recording nuclear recoil events on laboratory timescales using natural or artificial minerals. Contributions to this proceedings discuss the vast physics potential, the progress in experimental studies, and the numerous challenges lying ahead on the path towards mineral detection. These include a better understanding of the formation and annealing of recoil defects in crystals; identifying the best classes of minerals and, for paleo-detectors, understanding their geology; modeling and control of the relevant backgrounds; developing, combining, and scaling up imaging and data analysis techniques; and many others. During the last years, MDvDM has grown rapidly and gained attention. Small-scale experimental efforts focused on establishing various microscopic readout techniques are underway at institutions in North America, Europe and Asia. We are looking ahead to an exciting future full of challenges to overcome, surprises to be encountered, and discoveries lying ahead of us.
#### Two shadows on two backlights: forecasting the Ly-$α$ forest  $\times$ CMB Lensing bispectrum from ACT/SO/S4 & DESI

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01628
 - **Abstract**
 We forecast the sensitivity of future correlations between CMB lensing and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum. This squeezed-limit bispectrum probes the connection between the Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission and the underlying large-scale matter density field. We recover the measured signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio obtained with Planck$\times$BOSS, and forecast a SNR of $10.3, 14.8$ and $20.2$ for DESI combined with ACT, SO and CMB-S4 respectively. For DESI and SO/CMB-S4, the correlation should be detectable at SNR$\ge 5$ in 5 redshift bins, useful for distinguishing our signal from several contaminants.Indeed, our forecast is affected by large theoretical uncertainties in the current modeling of the signal and its contaminants, such as continuum misestimation bias or damped-Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. Quantifying these more accurately will be crucial to enable a reliable cosmological interpretation of this observable in future measurements. We attempt to enumerate the features required in future Lyman-$\alpha$ forest simulations required to do so.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave detectors are observing compact object mergers from increasingly far distances, revealing the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) -- and soon the black hole-neutron star (BHNS) and binary neutron star (BNS) -- merger rate. To help interpret these observations, we investigate the expected redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate from the isolated binary evolution channel. We present a publicly available catalog of compact object mergers and their accompanying cosmological merger rates from population synthesis simulations conducted with the COMPAS software. To explore the impact of uncertainties in stellar and binary evolution, our simulations use two-parameter grids of binary evolution models that vary the common-envelope efficiency with mass transfer accretion efficiency, and supernova remnant mass prescription with supernova natal kick velocity, respectively. We quantify the redshift evolution of our simulated merger rates using the local ($z\sim 0$) rate, the redshift at which the merger rate peaks, and the normalized differential rates (as a proxy for slope). We find that although the local rates span a range of $\sim 10^3$ across our model variations, their redshift-evolutions are remarkably similar for BBHs, BHNSs, and BNSs, with differentials typically within a factor $3$ and peaks of $z\approx 1.2-2.4$ across models. Furthermore, several trends in our simulated rates are correlated with the model parameters we explore. We conclude that future observations of the redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate can help constrain binary models for stellar evolution and gravitational-wave formation channels.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to its exceptional near-infrared photometry, $\textit{JWST}$ can effectively contribute to the discovery, characterization, and understanding of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, especially at low masses where the $\textit{Hubble}$ $\textit{Space}$ $\textit{Telescope}$ ($\textit{HST}$) faces limitations. This paper continues the efforts of the $\textit{JWST}$ GO-1979 program in exploring the faintest members of the globular cluster NGC$\,$6397. Here we show that the combination of $\textit{HST}$ and $\textit{JWST}$ data allows us to identify two groups of MS stars (MSa, the first-generation, and MSb, the second-generation group). We measured the ratio between the two groups and combined it with measurements from the literature focused on more central fields and more massive stars compared to our study. We find that the MSa and MSb stars are present in a $\approx$30-70 ratio regardless of the distance from the centre of the cluster and the mass of the stars used so far.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radiation pressure can have a substantial long-term effect on the orbits of high area-to-mass ratio spacecraft, such as solar sails. We present a study of the coupling between radiation pressure and the gravitational perturbation due to polar flattening. Removing the short-period terms via perturbation theory yields a time-dependent two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, depending on one physical and one dynamical parameter. While the reduced model is non-integrable in general, assuming coplanar orbits (i.e., both Spacecraft and Sun on the equator) results in an integrable invariant manifold. We discuss the qualitative features of the coplanar dynamics, and find three regions of the parameters space characterized by different regimes of the reduced flow. For each regime, we identify the fixed points and their character. The fixed points represent frozen orbits, configurations for which the long-term perturbations cancel out to the order of the theory. They are advantageous from the point of view of station keeping, allowing the orbit to be maintained with minimal propellant consumption. We complement existing studies of the coplanar dynamics with a more rigorous treatment, deriving the generating function of the canonical transformation that underpins the use of averaged equations. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the bifurcation lines that separate the regions with different qualitative flow.

 - **Abstract**
 While the spectroscopic classification scheme for Stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) is clear, and we know that they originate from massive stars that lost some or all their envelopes of Hydrogen and Helium, the photometric evolution of classes within this family is not fully characterized. Photometric surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will discover tens of thousands of transients each night and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited, prompting the need for photometric classification and inference based solely on photometry. We have generated 54 data-driven photometric templates for SESNe of subtypes IIb, Ib, Ic, Ic-bl, and Ibn in U/u, B, g, V, R/r, I/i, J, H, Ks, and Swift w2, m2, w1 bands using Gaussian Processes and a multi-survey dataset composed of all well-sampled open-access light curves (165 SESNe, 29531 data points) from the Open Supernova Catalog. We use our new templates to assess the photometric diversity of SESNe by comparing final per-band subtype templates with each other and with individual, unusual and prototypical SESNe. We find that SNe Ibns and Ic-bl exhibit a distinctly faster rise and decline compared to other subtypes. We also evaluate the behavior of SESNe in the PLAsTiCC and ELAsTiCC simulations of LSST light curves highlighting differences that can bias photometric classification models trained on the simulated light curves. Finally, we investigate in detail the behavior of fast-evolving SESNe (including SNe Ibn) and the implications of the frequently observed presence of two peaks in their light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 To study the impact of the initial effects of metallicity (i.e., the abundance of elements heavier than helium) on star formation and the formation of different molecular species, we searched for hot molecular cores in the sub-solar metallicity environment of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We conducted an ALMA Band 6 observations of 20 fields centered on young stellar objects (YSOs) distributed over the LMC in order to search for hot molecular cores in this galaxy. We detected a total of 65 compact 1.2 mm continuum cores in the 20 ALMA fields and analyzed their spectra with XCLASS software. The main temperature tracers are CH3OH and SO2, with more than two transitions detected in the observed frequency ranges. Other molecular lines with high detection rates in our sample are CS , SO, H13CO+, H13CN, HC15 N, and SiO. More complex molecules, such as HNCO, HDCO, HC3N, CH3CN, and NH2CHO, and multiple transitions of SO and SO2 isotopologues showed tentative or definite detection toward a small subset of the cores. According to the chemical richness of the cores and high temperatures from the XCLASS fitting, we report the detection of four hot cores and one hot core candidate. With one new hot core detection in this study, the number of detected hot cores in the LMC increases to seven. Six out of seven hot cores detected in the LMC to date are located in the stellar bar region of this galaxy. These six hot cores show emission from complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3OCHO, and CH3OCH3. The only known hot core in the LMC with no detection of COMs is located outside the bar region. The metallicity in the LMC presents a shallow gradient increasing from outer regions toward the bar. We suggest that the formation of hot molecular cores containing COMs ensues from the new generation of stars forming in the more metal-rich environment of the LMC bar.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the incidence of coherent emission in solar radio bursts, using a revised catalog of 3800 solar radio bursts observed by the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters from 1988 to 2023. We focus on the 1.0 and 2.0 GHz data, where radio fluxes of order 10 billion Jansky have been observed. Previous work has suggested that these bursts are due to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. In at least one well studied case, the bright emission at 1 GHz consists of narrowband spikes of millisecond duration. Coherent emission at 1 GHz can be distinguished from traditional incoherent gyrosynchrotron flare emission based on the radio spectrum: gyrosynchrotron emission at 1 GHz usually has a spectrum rising with frequency, so bursts in which 1 GHz is stronger than higher frequency measurements are unlikely to be incoherent gyrosynchrotron. Based on this criterion it is found that, for bursts exceeding 100 sfu, three-quarters of all bursts at 1 GHz and half of all 2 GHz bursts have a dominant coherent emission component, assumed to be ECM. The majority of the very bright bursts at 1 GHz are highly circularly polarized, consistent with a coherent emission mechanism, but not always 100% polarized. The frequency range from 1 to 2 GHz is heavily utilized for terrestrial applications, and these results are relevant for understanding the extreme flux levels that may impact such applications. Further, they provide a reference for comparison with the study of ECM emission from other stars and potentially exoplanets.
#### A pole-to-pole map of hydrocarbons in Saturn's upper stratosphere and  mesosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze data from the final two years of the Cassini mission to retrieve the distributions of methane, ethane, acetylene, ethylene, and benzene in Saturn's upper stratosphere and mesosphere from stellar occultations observed by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS), spanning pole-to-pole. These observations represent the first 2D snapshot with latitude and depth of Saturn's photochemical production region around northern summer solstice. Using UVIS occultations and CIRS limb scans, we derive temperature-pressure profiles and atmospheric structure models for each occultation latitude. W detect a strong meridional trend in the homopause pressure level, which ranges from approximately 0.05 microbar around the subsolar point to around 5 microbar at the poles, implying much weaker mixing at the poles than near the subsolar point. This trend could be explained by upwelling at low latitudes and downwelling at high latitudes, requiring vertical wind speeds under 2 cm/s. Photochemical product distributions follow this trend and also show a clear seasonal trend at pressures between 0.01 and 10 microbar, with higher abundances in the summer hemisphere. We compare the observed distributions with results from 1D seasonal photochemical models, with and without ion chemistry, to explore the impact of ion chemistry. We find that ion chemistry is particularly important for matching the observed C6H6 distribution, while its impact on other species is less pronounced. The best agreement between the models and the observations is obtained in the summer hemisphere. Disagreements between model and observations in the winter hemisphere and auroral region may be due to the lack of transport by global circulation and auroral electron and ion precipitation in our photochemical models. Finally, we compare C2H2 profiles from UVIS occultations with CIRS limb scans, finding good agreement where they overlap.
#### KIC 7914906: An Eclipsing Heartbeat Star with Tidally Excited  Oscillations and Gamma Doradus/Delta Scuti Hybrid Pulsations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the eclipsing Heartbeat Star KIC 9704906 with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) and gamma Doradus/delta Scuti hybrid pulsations. The derived parameters show that it has an orbital period of $P$=8.7529108(1) days, a high eccentricity of $e$=0.467(3), and a high inclination of $i$=78$^{\circ}$.81(6). The mass ratio $q$=0.981(5), the relative radii (radius divided by semi-major axis) $r_1$=0.0639(2), and $r_2$=0.0715(4) indicate that the secondary component has a less mass and a larger radius, and may have evolved off the main sequence. The eight derived TEO candidates, $n$ = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 40, and 44 harmonics, are consistent with or close to the dominant spherical harmonic $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$, assuming that the spin and orbital axes are aligned, and the pulsations are adiabatic and standing waves. We also identify ten independent frequency candidates, but one of them, $\mathit{f_{7}}$, is more like a modulation of a quasi-periodic signal and the orbits. According to the g-mode frequencies, we find that the rotation period of one component is 11.52(29) days. Although the masses and radii cannot be further constrained due to the lack of sufficient high-precision spectra, the fascinating phenomena in the Fourier spectra are evident and valuable in this system.

 - **Abstract**
 Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space, plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres, are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in the Universe. The insights garnered from this review underline the significance of acetylene in astrochemistry and potentially contribute to our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The 1:N mean motion resonances with Neptune are of particular interest because they have two asymmetric resonance islands, where the distribution of trapped objects may bear important clues to the history of the Solar System. To explore the dynamics of these resonances and to investigate whether the imprints left by the early stage evolution can be preserved in the resonances, we conduct a comprehensive analyses on the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances. Adopt mainly the frequency analysis method, we calculate the proper frequencies of the motion of objects in the resonances, with which the secular mechanisms that influence the dynamics are determined. Use the spectral number as an indicator of orbital regularity, we construct dynamical maps on representative planes. By comparing the structures in the maps with the locations of the secular mechanisms, we find that the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism and the $g=2s$ mechanism destabilize the influenced orbits and portray the overall structure of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances. The secular resonance $2g-s=s_8$ opens a channel for objects to switch between the leading and trailing resonance islands, which can alter the population ratio between these two islands. The secondary resonances associated with the quasi 2:1 resonance between Uranus and Neptune are also detected, and they introduce more chaos to the motion. The fine dynamical structures of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances revealed in this paper, combined with knowledge of resonant capture, provide a compelling explanation for the eccentricity distribution of observed Twotinos. And we anticipate a more complete understanding of the history of planetary migration in the Solar System can be achieved by comparing the results in this paper with the populations in the 1:N resonances in future when further observations bring us more objects.
#### Revealing H$_2$O dissociation in WASP-76~b through combined high- and  low-resolution transmission spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous chemical constraints have been possible for exoplanetary atmospheres thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) from ground-based facilities as well as low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS) from space. These two techniques have complementary strengths, and hence combined HRS and LRS analyses have the potential for more accurate abundance constraints and increased sensitivity to trace species. In this work we retrieve the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76~b, using high-resolution CARMENES/CAHA and low-resolution HST WFC3 and Spitzer observations of the primary eclipse. As such hot planets are expected to have a substantial fraction of H$_2$O dissociated, we conduct retrievals including both H$_2$O and OH. We explore two retrieval models, one with self-consistent treatment of H$_2$O dissociation and another where H$_2$O and OH are vertically-homogeneous. Both models constrain H$_2$O and OH, with H$_2$O primarily detected by LRS and OH through HRS, highlighting the strengths of each technique and demonstrating the need for combined retrievals to fully constrain chemical compositions. We see only a slight preference for the H$_2$O-dissociation model given that the photospheric constraints for both are very similar, indicating $\log(\mathrm{OH/H_2O}) = 0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ at 1.5~mbar, showing that the majority of the H$_2$O in the photosphere is dissociated. However, the bulk O/H and C/O ratios inferred from the models differs significantly, and highlights the challenge of constraining bulk compositions from photospheric abundances with strong vertical chemical gradients. Further observations with JWST and ground-based facilities may help shed more light on these processes.

 - **Abstract**
 (Aims) We investigate whether volcanic exomoons can be detected in thermal wavelength light curves due to their phase variability along their orbit. The method we use is based on the photometric signal variability that volcanic features or hotspots would cause in infrared (IR) wavelengths, when they are inhomogeneously distributed on the surface of a tidally heated exomoon (THEM). (Methods) We simulated satellites of various sizes around an isolated planet and modeled the system's variability in two IR wavelengths, taking into account photon shot noise. The moon's periodic signal as it orbits the planet introduces a peak in the frequency space of the system's time-variable flux. We investigated the THEM and system properties that would make a moon stand out in the frequency space of its host's variable flux. (Results) The moon's signal can produce a prominent feature in its host's flux periodogram at shorter IR wavelengths for hotspots with temperatures similar to the ones seen on the Jovian moon, Io, while the same moon would not be identifiable in longer IR wavelengths. By comparing observations at two different wavelengths, we are able to disentangle an exomoon's signal from the planet's one in the frequency domain for system distances up to $\sim$10 pc for Mars-sized exomoons and even further for Earth-sized ones for transiting and non-transiting orbital inclinations. (Conclusions) This method enlarges the parameter space of detectable exomoons around isolated planetary mass objects and directly imaged exoplanets, as it is sensitive to Io-Earth sized exomoons with hot volcanic features for a wide range of non-transiting orbital inclinations. Exomoon transits and the detection of outgassed volcanic molecules can subsequently confirm a putative detection.

 - **Abstract**
 PINT is a pure-Python framework for high-precision pulsar timing developed on top of widely used and well-tested Python libraries, supporting both interactive and programmatic data analysis workflows. We present a new frequentist framework within PINT to characterize the single-pulsar noise processes present in pulsar timing datasets. This framework enables the parameter estimation for both uncorrelated and correlated noise processes as well as the model comparison between different timing and noise models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new framework by applying it to simulated datasets as well as a real dataset of PSR B1855+09. We also briefly describe the new features implemented in PINT since it was first described in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive numerical experiments on the long-term dynamics of planetesimal disks with planets in systems of single stars have been carried out. The planetary chaotic zone clearing timescales $T_\mathrm{cl}$ as a function of mass parameter $\mu$ (planet-star mass ratio) have been determined numerically with a high accuracy separately for the outer and inner parts of the chaotic zone. Diffusional components $\propto \mu^{-6/7}$ and $\propto \mu^{-2}$ have been revealed in the dependence $T_\mathrm{cl}(\mu)$. The results obtained are discussed and interpreted in light of existing analytical theories based on the mean motion resonance overlap criterion and in comparison with previous numerical approaches to the problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular cluster (GC) stars composed of pristine material (first-generation, 1G, stars) are not chemically homogeneous, as they exhibit extended sequences in the "Chromosome Map" (ChM). Recent studies characterized 1G stars within the center of 55 Galactic GCs, revealing metallicity variations. Despite this progress, several unanswered questions persist, particularly concerning the link between the 1G metallicity spread and factors such as the radial distance from the cluster center or the host GC parameters. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the extended 1G sequence phenomenon is exclusive to old Galactic GCs with multiple populations. This work addresses these open issues, examining 1G stars in different environments. First, we combine Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope photometry of the GC 47 Tucanae to study 1G stars at increasing distances from the cluster center. We find that metal-rich 1G stars are more centrally concentrated than metal-poor ones, suggesting a metallicity radial gradient. Additionally, the two groups of 1G stars share similar kinematics. Since our analysis focuses on giant stars in the cluster center and M dwarfs in external fields, we discuss the possibility that the metallicity distribution depends on stellar mass. Subsequently, we analyze HST multi-band photometry of two simple-population clusters, NGC 6791 and NGC 1783, revealing elongated sequences in the ChM associated with metallicity variations. Finally, we investigate the 1G color distribution in 51 GCs, finding no connections with the host cluster parameters. These results shed light on the complex nature of 1G stars, providing insights into the GC formation environment.

 The great development of astrometric accuracy since the observations by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus about 150 BC has often been displayed in diagrams showing the accuracy versus time. Two new diagrams are provided here, one for positions only, another including parallaxes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of cyanothioketene, NCCHCS, in the laboratory and toward TMC-1. This transient species was produced through a discharge of a gas mixture of CH2CHCN and CS2 using argon as carrier gas, and its rotational spectrum between 9 and 40 GHz was characterized using a Balle-Flygare narrowband-type Fourier-transform microwave spectrometer. A total of 21 rotational transitions were detected in the laboratory, all of them exhibiting hyperfine structure induced by the spin of the N nucleus. The spectrum for NCCHCS was predicted in the domain of our line surveys using the derived rotational and distortion constants. The detection in the cold starless core TMC-1 was based on the QUIJOTE line survey performed with the Yebes 40m radio telescope. Twenty-three lines were detected with K_a=0, 1, and 2 and J_u=9 up to 14. The derived column density is (1.2+/-0.1)e11 cm-2 for a rotational temperature of 8.5+/-1 K. The abundance ratio of thioketene and its cyano derivative, H2CCS/NCCHCS, is 6.5+/-1.3. Although ketene is more abundant than thioketene by about 15 times, its cyano derivative NCCHCO surprisingly is not detected with a 3sigma upper level to the column density of 3.0e10 cm-2, which results in an abundance ratio H2CCO/NCCHCO > 430. Hence, the chemistry of CN derivatives seems to be more favored for S-bearing than for O-bearing molecules. We carried out chemical modeling calculations and found that the gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions CCN + H2CS and CN + H2CCS could be a source of NCCHCS in TMC-1.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first fully and inherently relativistic derivation of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This work uses the formalism historically used to compute radiation spectra emerging from inverse Thomson/Compton sources of x-ray radiation. Comparing our results to the traditional approach based on relativistically-corrected classical Kompaneets equation, we find small, but systematic differences. Most notable are the modest (< 10 %) differences in the crossover frequency where the spectral distortion due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect vanishes, and the energy increase of the distribution at high electron cloud temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We build an effective field theory of multi-field inflationary fluctuations based on the adiabatic perturbation and on any number of matter fluctuations in the non-adiabatic sector, without imposing extra symmetries on the latter. Focusing on terms with at most two derivatives in fields' fluctuations, we argue that taking the decoupling limit -- in which gravitational interactions are neglected -- is justified in a quasi de Sitter spacetime with slow-varying Hubble scale. With these working hypotheses, we find simple forms of multi-field mixings (quadratic order) and interactions (cubic order). We explain how to break degeneracies amongst various terms, and we compare the predictions of the effective field theory to those of non-linear sigma models of inflation and more general multi-field Lagrangian in the traditional model approach. We stress that several multi-field cubic interactions are dictated by non-linearly realised spacetime symmetries and are therefore given in terms of parameters already present in the quadratic action. We propose various directions to systematically explore the phenomenology generic to multi-field inflation and beyond the lamppost of known models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been proposed as potential candidates for dark matter (DM) and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Aims. Our objective is to delve into the distinct impact of PBHs on gas properties and their potential role in shaping the cosmic structure. Specifically, we aim to analyze the evolving gas properties while considering the presence of accreting PBHs with varying monochromatic masses and in different quantities. By studying the feedback effects produced by this accretion, our final goal is to assess the plausibility of PBHs as candidates for DM. Methods. We develop a semi-analytical model which works on top of the CIELO hydrodynamical simulation around $z\sim23$. This model enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of gas properties influenced by PBHs. Our focus lies on the temperature and hydrogen abundances, placing specific emphasis on the region closest to the halo center. We explore PBH masses of $1$, $33$, and $100~\Msun$, located within mass windows where a substantial fraction of DM could exist in the form of PBHs. We investigate various DM fractions composed of these PBHs ($f_{\rm{PBH}}>10^{-4}$). Results. Our findings suggest that the existence of PBHs with masses of $1~\Msun$ and fractions greater than or equal to approximately $10^{-2}$ would be ruled out due to the significant changes induced in gas properties. The same applies to PBHs with a mass of $33~\Msun$ and $100~\Msun$ and fractions greater than approximately $10^{-3}$. These effects are particularly pronounced in the region nearest to the halo center, potentially leading to delayed galaxy formation within haloes.

 - **Abstract**
 During the last 25 years, hundreds of binary stars and planets have been discovered towards the Galactic Bulge by microlensing surveys. Thanks to a new generation of large-sky surveys, it is now possible to regularly detect microlensing events across the entire sky. The OMEGA Key Projet at the Las Cumbres Observatory carries out automated follow-up observations of microlensing events alerted by these surveys with the aim of identifying and characterizing exoplanets as well as stellar remnants. In this study, we present the analysis of the binary lens event Gaia20bof. By automatically requesting additional observations, the OMEGA Key Project obtained dense time coverage of an anomaly near the peak of the event, allowing characterization of the lensing system. The observed anomaly in the lightcurve is due to a binary lens. However, several models can explain the observations. Spectroscopic observations indicate that the source is located at $\le2.0$ kpc, in agreement with the parallax measurements from Gaia. While the models are currently degenerate, future observations, especially the Gaia astrometric time series as well as high-resolution imaging, will provide extra constraints to distinguish between them.

 - **Abstract**
 We present pyLIMASS, a novel algorithm for estimating the physical properties of the lensing system in microlensing events. The main idea of pyLIMASS is to combine all available information regarding the microlensing event, defined as observables, and to estimate the parameter distributions of the system, such as the lens mass and distance. The algorithm is based on isochrones for the stars model and combine the observables using a Gaussian Mixtures approach. After describing the mathematical formalism and its implementation, we discuss the algorithm's performance on simulated and published events. Generally, the pyLIMASS estimations are in good agreement (i.e., within 1-$\sigma$) with the results of the selected published events, making it an effective tool to estimate the lens properties and their distribution. The applicability of the method was tested by using a catalog of realistically simulated events that could be observed by the future Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By solely using constraints from the Roman lightcurves and images, pyLIMASS estimates the masses of the lens of the Roman catalog with a median precision of 20% with almost no bias.

 Gaia DR3 revealed 748,058 pulsating variable stars of mixed DSCT|GDOR|SXPHE types. This project undertakes a comprehensive examination to validate and distinguish these stars using TESS data. Aiming for reliable catalogs of bona fide $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus stars, I have validated 1715 $\delta$ Scuti stars, 1403 $\gamma$ Doradus stars, and identified 260 eclipsing binaries, one RR Lyrae star, and 460+ rotating variables from an initial sample of 16,690 objects. Notably, 15 of the newfound eclipsing binaries harbor pulsating $\gamma$ Doradus components.

 - **Abstract**
 A single-lined spectroscopic orbit for the M giant in the X-ray binary IGR J16194-2810 is determined from a time-series of optical spectra. The spectroscopic orbital period of 192.5 days is twice that of the photometric period, confirming that the M giant in the system is an ellipsoidal variable. The giant is identified as a first ascent giant approaching the red giant tip. The primary is a neutron star (NS) with its M giant companion filling its Roche lobe verifying the system classification as a Low-Mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Stellar C, N, O and Fe abundances are derived for the M giant with the C, N, O values typical for a field giant with [Fe/H] = -0.14. The system does not have a large kick velocity. Models for the evolution of the system into a binary NS-white dwarf (WD) are presented. The X-ray properties are discussed in the context of this model. This binary is a rare example of a luminous, long orbital period, LMXB early in the transient ellipsoidal phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of very early high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the nearby core-collapse (CC) supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN that ocurred in the galaxy NGC 3621, at a distance of 7.11 Mpc ($z\approx0.002435$). These observations represent the earliest high-resolution spectroscopy of a CCSN ever made. We analyze the very early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi obtained in a short interval at 26.6 and 33.8h after the SN first light. Observations were obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph MIKE ($R\approx22600-28000$) at the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory, during the night of 2024-04-12UT. We constrain emission line features in the early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi. We analyze the evolution of main spectroscopic features and the occurrence of high-ionization emission lines, by estimating their full width at half maximum (FWHM), equivalent width (EW), and blueshift velocities. We then compare our results to other early-time observations of CCSNe. The spectra show strong and narrow features of Balmer emission lines and of high-ionization species of HeI, HeII, NIII, CIII, together with relatively broader emission features of NIV and CIV. Some of these features become broader or disappear in the interval of 8h, indicating the rapid changes in the early evolution of CCSNe flash-ionization features. The HeII, CIV, NIV and Balmer emission lines have asymmetric Lorentzian profiles, with the HeII $\lambda4686$ broad component showing blue wings that extends up to $\sim-1000$ km s$^{-1}$. We also measure a CSM expansion velocity of $\sim 79 \ \textrm{km} \ \textrm{s}^{-1}$ from the blueshift in the H$\alpha$ emission profile, and a total extinction in the line of sight of $E(B-V)=0.16$ mag. Finally, we note many similarities of SN 2024ggi to the early evolution of SN 2023ixf.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Kunimoto et al. claimed that a short-lived signal in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 61 database was caused by a microlensing event with a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet (FFP) lens. In this study, we investigate TESS's ability to detect microlensing FFPs by considering the detailed source information (e.g., distance and radius), the TESS photometric accuracy, and finite-source effects. Using the FFP mass function from microlensing surveys toward the Galactic bulge, we find that only $0.0018$ microlensing events are expected to be detected in TESS Sector 61 for the entire planetary mass range. The reported signal is unlikely to be a real microlensing event, which is consistent with the evidence from the long-term OGLE data that the signal was likely due to a stellar flare. By extrapolating our result to fainter stars until $T = 16$ mag and adopting a possible optimized search algorithm, we find that only $\sim 1$ FFP events can be detected in the entire TESS mission within the first 7 years. Significant improvments of our understanding of FFPs still requires future satellite missions, such as Roman and Earth 2.0, which can detect thousands of FFPs.
