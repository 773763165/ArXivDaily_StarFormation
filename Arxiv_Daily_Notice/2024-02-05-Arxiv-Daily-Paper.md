 - **Abstract**
 The two known planets in the planetary system of Teegarden's Star are among the most Earth-like exoplanets currently known. Revisiting this nearby planetary system with two planets in the habitable zone aims at a more complete census of planets around very low-mass stars. A significant number of new radial velocity measurements from CARMENES, ESPRESSO, MAROON-X, and HPF, as well as photometry from TESS motivated a deeper search for additional planets. We confirm and refine the orbital parameters of the two know planets Teegarden's Star b and c. We also report the detection of a third planet d with an orbital period of 26.13+-0.04 d and a minimum mass of 0.82+-0.17 M_Earth. A signal at 96 d is attributed to the stellar rotation period. The interpretation of a signal at 172 d remains open. The TESS data exclude transiting short-period planets down to about half an Earth radius. We compare the planetary system architecture of very low-mass stars. In the currently known configuration, the planetary system of Teegarden's star is dynamically quite different from that of TRAPPIST-1, which is more compact, but dynamically similar to others such as GJ 1002.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mg II h&k emission lines (2803, 2796 A) are a useful tool for understanding stellar chromospheres and transition regions due to their intrinsic brightness, relatively low interstellar medium (ISM) absorption interference, and abundance of archival spectra available. Similar to other optically thick chromospheric emission lines such as H I Lya, Mg II emissions commonly present with a self-reversed line core, the depth and shape of which vary from star to star. We explore the relationship between self-reversal and the stellar atmosphere by investigating the extent that fundamental stellar parameters affect self-reversal. We present a search for correlations between photospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity with the Mg II k self-reversal depth for a group of 135 FGKM main sequence stars with high-resolution near-ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope. We modeled the observed MgII k line profiles to correct for ISM attenuation and recover the depth of emission line's self-reversal in relation to the intensity of the line. We used the PHOENIX atmosphere code to homogeneously determine the stellar parameters by computing a suite of stellar atmosphere models that include a chromosphere and transition region, and using archival photometry to guide the models of each star. We quantify the sensitivity of the visible and near-infrared photometry to chromospheric and photospheric parameters. We find weak trends between Mg II k self-reversal depth and age, rotation period, Mg II luminosity, temperature, and mass. All stars in our sample older than ~2 Gyr or rotating slower than ~10 days exhibit self-reversal.
#### On the behaviour of eccentric sub-pc massive black hole binaries  embedded in massive discs

 - **Abstract**
 Using the 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM, we investigate the evolution of the orbital properties of massive black hole binaries embedded in massive discs where gravitational instabilities (GIs) triggered by the disc self-gravity are the only source of angular momentum transport. In particular, we investigate the evolution of binaries with different initial eccentricities $e_0=0.05,\,0.5,\,0.8$ and mass ratios $q=0.1,\,0.3,\,0.9$. Our simulations suggest that there might not be a unique value of critical eccentricity. We find initially more eccentric binaries to tend to higher asymptotic eccentricity values than more circular ones. This implies that there is a range of critical eccentricity values, that depends on the initial condition of the system. In particular, we find the width of this range to be narrower for more unequal binaries. We furthermore measure preferential accretion onto our binaries, finding more accretion onto the primary only for mass ratio $q=0.3$ and eccentricity $e=0.8$. We discuss how this might have implications for the amplitude of the gravitational wave background detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) experiments. We finally measure the corresponding value of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in our simulations and discuss how this depends on the binary properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the intermediate tachyon inflation in an anisotropic background. By using the Friedmann equations obtained in the anisotropic geometry, we obtain the slow-roll parameters in the tachyon model. The presence of the anisotropic effects in the slow-roll parameters changes the perturbation parameters in our setup which may change its observational viability. To check this, we perform a numerical analysis and test the results with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14(18)+BAO data. We show that the intermediate anisotropic inflation in some ranges of the anisotropic and intermediate parameters is observationally viable. We also show that the equilateral amplitude of the non-gaussianity in our model is of the order of $10^{-2}-10^{-1}$. By studying the reheating process in our setup, we find that it is possible to have instantaneous reheating in this model. We also find that the temperature during the reheating in our setup is consistent with Big-Bang nucleosynthesis.
#### Spatially Resolved Galactic Winds at Cosmic Noon: Outflow Kinematics and  Mass Loading in a Lensed Star-Forming Galaxy at $z=1.87$

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spatially resolved outflow properties of CSWA13, an intermediate mass ($M_*=10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), gravitationally lensed star-forming galaxy at $z=1.87$. We use Keck/KCWI to map outflows in multiple rest-frame ultraviolet ISM absorption lines, along with fluorescent Si II$^*$ emission, and nebular emission from C III] tracing the local systemic velocity. The spatial structure of outflow velocity mirrors that of the nebular kinematics, which we interpret to be a signature of a young galactic wind that is pressurizing the ISM of the galaxy but is yet to burst out. From the radial extent of Si II$^*$ emission, we estimate that the outflow is largely encapsulated within $3.5$ kpc. We explore the geometry (e.g., patchiness) of the outflow by measuring the covering fraction at different velocities, finding that the maximum covering fraction is at velocities $v\simeq-150$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$. Using the outflow velocity ($v_{out}$), radius ($R$), column density ($N$), and solid angle ($\Omega$) based on the covering fraction, we measure the mass loss rate $\log\dot{m}_{out}/(\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}) = 1.73\pm0.23$ and mass loading factor $\log\eta = 0.04\pm0.34$ for the low-ionization outflowing gas in this galaxy. These values are relatively large and the bulk of the outflowing gas is moving with speeds less than the escape velocity of the galaxy halo, suggesting that the majority of outflowing mass will remain in the circumgalactic medium and/or recycle back into the galaxy. The results support a picture of high outflow rates transporting mass and metals into the inner circumgalactic medium, providing the gas reservoir for future star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galileo spacecraft had distant encounters with Earth in 1990 and 1992. Limited Solid State Imager (SSI) data acquired during these encounters has been previously presented, but the majority of the data from these Earth flybys have not been presented in the literature. Observations of Earth taken from afar are both rare and directly relevant to the development of any future exo-Earth direct imaging mission. Here we present a pipeline that vets, calibrates, and measures the disk-integrated brightness of the Earth, in multiple filters, from the complete SSI data sets from both the 1990 and 1992 Galileo flybys. The result is over 1500 usable photometric measurements for Earth as an analog for an exoplanet. The 1990 data set includes full rotational lightcurves in six bandpasses spanning the optical range. The 1992 data set is more limited, with lightcurves only spanning 14 hr. Time-averaged photometry for both encounters is presented while variability and color are discussed relative to findings from NASA's EPOXI mission (which also provided photometric lighturves for Earth). The new Galileo/SSI data are used to further validate the Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model, which often serves as a stand-in for true disk-integrated observations of our planet. The revived Galileo/SSI data for Earth is a testament to the ability of NASA's Planetary Data System to maintain data over decades-long timescales. The disk-integrated products derived from these data add to a very short list of calibrated and published whole-disk observations of the Pale Blue Dot.

 - **Abstract**
 A scale-independent energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) allows different gravitational couplings for different types of sources and has been proven to have interesting implications in cosmology. In this paper, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism and the latest observational constraints are being used in order to extract constraints on this class of modified gravity models. The model has been constrained using the light element reaction rates. Using the tight constraint from BBN on the correction term in the Friedman equation due to EMSG, we find a significant deviation in the matter power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) even for a very small allowed value of the modification parameter, thus pointing out the sensitivity of the matter power spectrum at the small scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the test results of several independent foreground-cleaning pipelines used in the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope experiment (AliCPT-1), a high-altitude CMB imager in the Northern hemisphere with thousands of detectors dedicated to the search for a primordial CMB polarization $B$-mode signature. Based on simulated data from 4 detector modules and a single season of observation, which we refer to as DC1 data, we employ different and independent pipelines to examine the robustness and effectiveness of the estimates on foreground parameters and the primordial $B$-mode detection. The foreground-cleaning strategies used in the pipelines include the parametric method of template fitting (TF) and the non-parametric methods of the constrained internal linear combination (cILC), the analytical blind separation (ABS), and the generalized least squares (GLS). We examine the impact of possible foreground residuals on the estimate of the CMB tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) for each pipeline by changing the contamination components in the simulated maps and varying the foreground models and sky patches for various tests. According to the DC1 data with the simulation input value $r_{\rm true}=0.023$, the foreground residual contamination levels in the TF/ABS/cILC/GLS pipelines are well within the corresponding statistical errors at the $2\sigma$ level. For a selected patch with relatively stronger foreground contamination, all of the proposed pipelines perform robustly in testing. Furthermore, by utilizing the tension estimator, which helps identify significant residual foreground contamination in the detection of the primordial $B$-mode signal by quantifying the discrepancy between various $r$ measurements, we conclude that the presence of small foreground residuals does not lead to any significant inconsistency in the estimation of $r$.

 - **Abstract**
 Directional wavelet dictionaries are hierarchical representations which efficiently capture and segment information across scale, location and orientation. Such representations demonstrate a particular affinity to physical signals, which often exhibit highly anisotropic, localised multiscale structure. Many physically important signals are observed over spherical domains, such as the celestial sky in cosmology. Leveraging recent advances in computational harmonic analysis, we design new highly distributable and automatically differentiable directional wavelet transforms on the $2$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and $3$-dimensional ball $\mathbb{B}^3 = \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{S}^2$ (the space formed by augmenting the sphere with the radial half-line). We observe up to a $300$-fold and $21800$-fold acceleration for signals on the sphere and ball, respectively, compared to existing software, whilst maintaining 64-bit machine precision. Not only do these algorithms dramatically accelerate existing spherical wavelet transforms, the gradient information afforded by automatic differentiation unlocks many data-driven analysis techniques previously not possible for these spaces. We publicly release both S2WAV and S2BALL, open-sourced JAX libraries for our transforms that are automatically differentiable and readily deployable both on and over clusters of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs & TPUs).
#### Patterns in water maser emission of evolved stars on the timescale of  decades

 - **Abstract**
 We present our past and current long-term monitoring program of water masers in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars, augmented by occasional interferometric observations. Using as example the Mira-variable U Her, we identify three types of variability: periodic (following the optical variation), long-term (years-decades) and short-term irregular (weeks-months). We show there are regions in the maser shell where excitation conditions are favourable, which remain stable for many years. Lifetimes of maser clouds in the wind-acceleration zone are of the order of up to a few years. Much longer lifetimes are found for the peculiar case of a maser cloud outside that zone (as in RT Vir), or in some cases where the motion of spectral features can be followed for the entire 2 decade monitoring period (as in red supergiant VX Sgr).

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to investigate the behaviour of the lithium abundance in stars with and without detected planets. Our study is based on a sample of 1332 FGK main-sequence stars with measured lithium abundances, for 257 of which planets were detected. Our method reviews the sample statistics and is addressed specifically to the influence of tides and orbital decay, with special attention to planets on close orbits, whose stellar rotational velocity is higher than the orbital period of the planet. In this case, tidal effects are much more pronounced. The analysis also covers the orbital decay on a short timescale, with planets spiralling into their parent star. Furthermore, the sample allows us to study the relation between the presence of planets and the physical properties of their host stars, such as the chromospheric activity, metallicity, and lithium abundance. In the case of a strong tidal influence, we cannot infer from any of the studies described that the behaviour of Li differs between stars that host planets and those that do not. Our sample includes stars with super-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]>0.15 dex) and a low lithium abundance (A(Li) <1.0 dex). This enabled us to analyse scenarios of the origin and existence of these stars. Considering the possible explanation of the F dip, we show that it is not a plausible scenario. Our analysis is based on a kinematic study and concludes that the possible time that elapsed in the travel from their birth places in the central regions of the Galaxy to their current positions in the solar neighbourhood is not enough to explain the high lithium depletion. It is remarkable that those of our high-metallicity low-lithium stars with the greatest eccentricity (e>0.2) are closest to the Galactic centre. A dedicated study of a set of high-metallicity low-Li stars is needed to test the migration-depletion scenario.
#### Doubly substituted isotopologues of HCCCN in TMC-1: Detection of  D13CCCN, DC13CCN, DCC13CN, DCCC15N, H13C13CCN, H13CC13CN, HC13C13CN,  HCC13C15N, and HC13CC15N

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection in space of a complete sample of nine doubly substituted isotopologues of HCCCN towards the cyanopolyyne peak of TMC-1 using observations of the QUIJOTE line survey taken with the Yebes 40 m telescope. We detected D13CCCN, DC13CCN, DCC13CN, DCCC15N, H13C13CCN, H13CC13CN, HC13C13CN, HCC13C15N, and HC13CC15N through their J=4-3 and J=5-4 lines in the 7 mm window. In addition, we present an extensive analysis of the emission of HCCCN and its singly substituted isotopologues through a large velocity gradient model of the lines detected at 7 mm and 3 mm using the Yebes 40 m and the IRAM 30 m telescopes, respectively. The derived column densities for all the isotopologues are consistent in the two spectral bands for an H2 volume density of 1e4 cm-3 and a kinetic temperature of 10 K. Whereas we observed a 13C fractionation for HCC13CN and other double isotopologues with a 13C atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom, we derived similar C/13C abundance ratios for the three 13C substituted species of DCCCN. This suggests additional chemical discrimination for deuterated isotopologues of HCCCN. Finally, we present the spatial distribution of the J=4-3 and J=5-4 lines from the singly substituted species observed with the Yebes 40 m telescope. The emission peak of the spatial distribution of DCCCN appears to be displaced by 40'' with respect to that of HCCCN and the 13C and 15N isotopologues. In addition to a different formation route for the deuterated species, we could also expect that this differentiation owing to the deuterium fractionation is more efficient at low temperatures, and therefore, that deuterated species trace a colder region of the cloud.
#### The case of the missing VHE GRBs: A retrospective study of Swift  gamma-ray bursts with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are particle acceleration sites that can emit photons in the very high-energy (VHE) domain through non-thermal processes. From 2004 until 2018, the current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) did not detect any GRB in the VHE domain. However, from 2018 to 2020, five detections have been reported. In this work, we try to solve the case of the missing VHE GBRs prior to 2018. We aim to identify GRBs that might have eluded VHE detection in the past years by the H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS IACTs. To do so, we study GRBs with known redshift detected by \emph{Swift} from 2004 until June 2022. We first identify all GRBs that could have been observed by these IACTs since 2004, considering observation conditions and visibility constraints. We assume a relation between the X-rays and the VHE gamma rays based on the VHE GRBs detected to date and combine this with the redshift measurements, instrument response information, and observation conditions to predict the observed VHE gamma-ray flux from the \emph{Swift}-XRT measurements. We report findings on 12 bright low-redshift GRBs that we identify as most likely to have been detected in the VHE domain by current IACTs. The rate of IACT-detectable GRBs with ideal observation conditions is $<$1 VHE GRB per year with the current configuration. With its lower energy threshold and higher sensitivity, this rate increases to $\sim$4 VHE GRBs per year with CTA.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The model of disc fragmentation due to gravitational instabilities offers an alternate formation mechanism for gas giant planets, especially those on wide orbits. Aims. Our goal is to determine the 3D structure of disc-instability protoplanets and to examine how this relates to the thermal physics of the fragmentation process. Methods. We modelled the fragmentation of gravitationally unstable discs using the SPH code PHANTOM, and followed the evolution of the protoplanets formed through the first and second-hydrostatic core phases (up to densities 1e-3 g/cm3). Results. We find that the 3D structure of disc-instability protoplanets is affected by the disc environment and the formation history of each protoplanet (e.g. interactions with spiral arms, mergers). The large majority of the protoplanets that form in the simulations are oblate spheroids rather than spherical, and they accrete faster from their poles. Conclusions. The 3D structure of disc-instability protoplanets is expected to affect their observed properties and should be taken into account when interpreting observations of protoplanets embedded in their parent discs.

 - **Abstract**
 We compiled a list of more than 3500 eclipsing binaries located in and near the Northern Continuous Viewing Zone (NCVZ) of the TESS space telescope that have a sufficient amount of TESS photometry to search for additional hidden components in these systems. We obtained the TESS light curves of all targets in an automated way applying convolution-aided differential photometry on the TESS Full-Frame Images from all available sectors up to Sector 60. Using a new self-developed Python GUI, we visually vetted all of these light curves, determined the eclipsing periods of the objects and calculated their eclipse timing variations (ETVs). The ETV curves were used in order to search for nonlinear variations that could be attributed to a light travel time effect (LTTE) or dynamical perturbations caused by additional components in these systems. We pre-selected 351 such candidates and tried to model their ETVs with the analytic formulae of pure LTTE or the combination of LTTE and dynamical perturbations. In total we could fit a model solution for the ETVs of 135 hierarchical triple candidates in which 10 systems were already known in the literature and the remainder of the 125 systems are new discoveries. Among these systems, there are some more noteworthy ones, such as five tight triples very close to their dynamical stability limit with a period ratio of less than 20 and three newly discovered triply eclipsing triples. We point out that dynamical perturbations are occurring in GZ Dra, which turns out to be a triple. We also made a comparison of the distributions of some orbital parameters coming from our solutions with those from the Kepler sample derived by Borkovits et al. (2016). Finally, we checked the correlations between the available parameters for systems that have Gaia Non-Single Star orbital solutions with those from our ETV solutions. (Abridged)
#### Non-resonant relaxation of rotating globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term relaxation of rotating globular clusters is investigated through an extension of the orbit averaged Chandrasekhar non-resonant formalism. A comparison is made with the long-term evolution of the distribution function in action space, measured from averages of sets of $N$-body simulations up to core collapse. The impact of rotation on in-plane relaxation is found to be weak. In addition, we observe a clear match between theoretical predictions and $N$-body measurements. For the class of rotating models considered, we find no strong gravo-gyro catastrophe accelerating core collapse. Both kinetic theory and simulations predict a reshuffling of orbital inclinations from overpopulated regions to underpopulated ones. This trend accelerates as the amount of rotation is increased. Yet, for orbits closer to the rotational plane, the non-resonant prediction does not reproduce numerical measurements. We argue that this mismatch stems from these orbits' coherent interactions, which are not captured by the non-resonant formalism that only addresses local deflections.

 - **Abstract**
 To disentangle the different competing physical processes at play in Galactic evolution, a detailed chrono chemicalkinematical, and dynamical characterisation of the disc bimodality is necessary, including high number statistics. Here we make use of an extremely precise subsample of the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalogue of stellar chemophysical parameters. The selected database is composed of 408 800 stars with a median uncertainty of 10 K, 0.03 and 0.01 dex in Teff , log(g) and [M/H], respectively. The stellar parameter precision allows to break the age-metallicity degeneracy of disc stars. For the first time, the disc bimodality in the Kiel diagramme of giant stars is observed, getting rid of interstellar absortion issues. This bimodality produces double Red Giant Branch sequences and Red Clump features for mono-metallicity populations. A comparison with BaSTI isochrones allows to demonstrate that an age gap is needed to explain the evolutionary sequences separation, in agreement with previous age-metallicity relations obtained using Main-Sequence Turn Off stars. A bimodal distribution in the stellar mass-[alpha/Fe] plane is observed at constant metallicity. Finally, a selection of stars with [M/H]=0.45 \pm 0.03 dex shows that the most metal-rich population in the Milky Way disc presents an important proportion of stars with ages in the range 5-13 Gyr. This old, extremely metal-rich population is possibly a mix of migrated stars from the internal Galactic regions, and old disc stars formed before the last major merger of the Milky Way. The Gaia GSP-Spec Kiel diagrammes of disc mono-abundance stellar populations reveal a complex, non linear age-metallicity relation crafted by internal and external processes of Galactic evolution. Their detailed analysis opens new opportunities to reconstruct the puzzle of the Milky Way disc bimodality.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to universality and attractor properties, $\alpha$-attractor quintessential inflation establishes direct relations between inflationary observables such as the scalar tilt $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and late-time dark energy equation of state parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this work, we examine three different physically motivated regimes, considering complete freedom in the parameter $\alpha$, models inspired by supergravity where $\alpha$ takes on values up to $\alpha=7/3$, and Starobinsky inflation ($\alpha=1$). We investigate the consistency and constraints imposed by Cosmic Microwave Background measurements from the Planck satellite, B-mode polarization data from the BICEP/Keck collaboration, and low-redshift observations. Additionally, we consider small-scale CMB measurements released by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, which give results approaching the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum ($n_s \approx 1$). Here $\alpha$-attractors lead to an improved fit over $\Lambda$CDM. For the large-scale CMB measurements, $\alpha\gtrsim2$ models can provide equally good fits as $\Lambda$CDM.
