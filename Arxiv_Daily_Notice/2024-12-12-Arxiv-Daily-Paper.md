 - **Abstract**
 On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. The statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.

          Yields from massive stars in binaries. Chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk

 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of massive stars in the Galaxy reside in binary systems and their evolution is different from that of single stars. The yields of massive stars, which are the main responsible for the production of metals, can be therefore affected by the binary nature of the systems. Recently, Farmer et al. (2023) computed new grids of yields for single and binary-stripped massive stars with solar chemical composition. The main purpose of this paper is to test these yields on the chemical evolution of Galactic stars. To do that, we adopt well-tested chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disk, implementing both yields for single and binary-stripped massive stars. In particular, we assume different percentages of massive binary systems within the initial mass function. We compute the evolution of 22 chemical species starting from $^{4}$He to $^{64}$Zn. Our main results can be summarized as follows: i) when adopting the yields of Farmer et al. (2023), large differences are found relative to the predicted solar abundances by chemical evolution models adopting "standard" massive star yields from the literature for $^{12}$C, $^{14}$N, $^{24}$Mg, $^{39}$K, $^{40}$Ca, $^{55}$Mn and $^{59}$Co. Generally, the yields for single stars reproduce slightly better the observed solar abundances, although for several elements a large fraction of binaries helps in reproducing the observations; ii) different fractions of massive binaries (from 50% to 100%) produce negligible differences in the predicted solar abundances, whereas the differences are more marked between models with and without binary-stripped stellar yields; iii) for the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations, the yields including massive stars in binaries produce the best results for $^{52}$Cr, while for $^{12}$C, $^{39}$K, $^{40}$Ca and $^{24}$Mg the best results are obtained with Farmer's yields with no binaries.

          X-Sifter: detecting transients in X-ray data using the optimal Poisson matched filter

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-sifter, a software package designed for near-optimal detection of sources in X-ray images and other forms of photon images in the Poisson-noise regime. The code is based on the Poisson-noise-matched filter (Ofek & Zackay), which provides an efficient method for calculating the delta log-likelihood function for source detection. The software accounts for several complexities inherent in real data, including variations in both the instrumental Point Spread Function (PSF) and background across the detector and as a function of energy. We validate the pipeline using real data with simulated source injections, as well as actual Chandra images. A comparison between the sources detected by our pipeline and those in the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) suggests an approximate ~30% increase in the number of detected (real) sources. Near the detection limit, the reported S/N of our pipeline is approximately 1.3x higher than that of the CSC. This corresponds to a factor of 1.8 increase in survey speed.

          Did IceCube discover Dark Matter around Blazars?

 - **Abstract**
 Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jet and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.

          Accretion onto WD 2226$-$210, the central star of the Helix Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 The central star of the Helix Nebula, WD 2226$-$210 presents enigmatic hard X-ray emission and mid-IR excess. The latter has been attributed to a dusty disk or a cloud-like structure around WD 2226$-$210 formed from material of Kuiper Belt-like or comet-like objects in highly eccentric orbits. We present here a detailed analysis of multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of WD 2226$-$210, comparing these to previous Einstein and ROSAT data. The luminosity of the hard X-ray component of WD 2226$-$210 has remained basically constant in the decade from 1992 to 2002, with very subtle evidence for variability in timescales of hours. Under the assumption that the X-ray emission from WD 2226$-$210 is due to accretion of material, an accretion rate of $\dot{M}\approx10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is estimated. The origin of the material accreted by WD 2226$-$210 is uncertain, and can be attributed to the disk-like structure around it or to a sub-stellar donor companion. The accretion rate proposed for the continuous replenishment by bombardment of the mid-IR-emitting structure around WD 2226$-$210 cannot match that required by the X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the process of creation of lightest elements in the early universe, is a highly robust, precise, and ultimately successful theory that forms one of the three pillars of the standard hot-Big-Bang cosmological model. Existing theoretical treatments of BBN and the associated computer codes are accurate and flexible, but are typically highly technical and opaque, and not suitable for pedagogical understanding of the BBN. Here we present BBN-simple -- a from-scratch numerical calculation of the lightest element abundances pitched at an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level. We review the physics of the early universe relevant for BBN, provide information about the reaction rates, and discuss computational-mathematics background that is essential in setting up a BBN calculation. We calculate the abundances of the principal nuclear species in a standard cosmological model, and find a reasonably good agreement with public precision-level BBN codes.

          Constraining solar wind transport model parameters using Bayesian analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We apply nested-sampling (NS) Bayesian analysis [AshtonEA22] to a model for the transport of MHD-scale solar wind fluctuations. The dual objectives are to obtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport model (TTM) and to support comparisons of distinct versions of the TTM. The TTMs analysed are essentially 1D steady-state presented in [BreechEA08] that describe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized cross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in prescribed background solar wind fields. Modelled effects present in the TTM include nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection associated with pickup-ions. These effects involve adjustable parameters that we seek to constrain. Bayesian analysis supports the efficient searching of a parameter space for the 'best' set of TTM parameter values. More advanced use provides the parameter's posterior distribution: its probability given the data, and the model. This can be used to understand the uncertainty in the provided 'best' values for the parameters and therefore the uncertainty in the suggested TTM solutions/predictions. By using NS, we can calculate the Bayesian evidence for each TTM and objectively determine which best fits the given observational data. Based on the analysis of the datasets and TTM employed, we recommend use of the 2D TTM with von Karman-Howarth parameters ${\alpha}\approx 0.16$ and $\beta \approx 0.10$ and parameter assumptions from existing literature. It is important to include the pickup ion effects in the lengthscale evolution equation by assuming $Z^{2\beta/\alpha}\lambda = const$ is locally conserved. This work is readily extended to more sophisticated solar wind models. Although more work is required to generate datasets with associated errors, which is necessary for accurate Bayesian modelling.

          3D Convective Urca Process in a Simmering White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy released by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the turbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of the fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the realistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D mixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow over many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number hydrodynamic software, we present the first full star 3D simulations of the A=23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times. Our findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic velocities of the flow, the energy loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the structure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.

          An Obliquity Measurement of the Hot Neptune TOI-1694b

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectral observations of the multiplanet host TOI-1694 during the transit of TOI-1694b, a 26.1 $M_\oplus$ hot Neptune with a 3.77-day orbit. By analyzing radial velocities obtained from the Keck Planet Finder, we modeled the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and constrained the sky-projected obliquity to ${9\degree}^{+22\degree}_{-18\degree}$, which is strong evidence for a nearly aligned orbit. TOI-1694b is one of fewer than ten small planets accompanied by confirmed outer giant planets for which the obliquity has been measured. We consider the significance of the outer planet TOI-1694c, a Jupiter-mass planet with a 1-year orbit, and its potential role in influencing the orbit of TOI-1694b to its current state. Incorporating our measurement, we discuss the bifurcation in hot Neptune obliquities and present evidence for an independent polar population. The observed polar planets nearly ubiquitously have periods of $\le 6$ days and mass ratios of $10^{-4}$. Early perturbations by outer companions from resonance crossings in the disk-dispersal stage provide the most compelling explanation for this population. Systems which lack the necessary configuration will retain their primordial obliquity, since hot Neptunes lack the angular momentum needed to realign their hosts on relevant timescales.

          Constraining Asymmetric DM Properties by Black Hole Formation in Neutron Stars and Population III Stars

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we explore the potential for Neutron Stars (NSs) at the Galactic center and Population~III stars to constrain Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM). We demonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density ($\rhox\gtrsim10^{9}\unit{GeV/cm^3}$), the effects of both multiscatter capture and DM evaporation cannot be neglected. If a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) forms from ADM, then its low temperature and densely cored profile render evaporation from the BEC negligible, strengthening detectability of low-mass DM. Because of this, we find that the most easily observable Population III stars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\sigma$ low-$\mx$ DM, maintaining efficacy below $\mx=10^{-15}\unit{GeV}$ thanks to their far lower value of $\mx$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we derive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary polytropic objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuing our initiative on advancing the calculations of planetesimal accretion in the core-accretion model, we present here the results of our recent study of the contributions of planetesimals around and beyond the orbit of Saturn. In our first two papers [ApJ, 899:45; 941:117], where our focus was on the effects of the Sun and Saturn, the initial distribution of planetesimals was limited to the regions around the accretion zone of a growing Jupiter. In this paper, we expanded that distribution to regions beyond the accretion zone of Saturn. We integrated the orbits of a large ensemble of planetesimals and studied the rate of their capture by the growing proto-Jupiter. In order to be consistent with our previous studies, we did not consider the effect of the nebular gas. Results demonstrated that the exterior planetesimals, especially those beyond 8 AU, have only slight contributions to the growth and metallicity of the growing Jupiter. The final mass and composition of this planet is mainly due to the planetesimals inside and around its accretion zone. Our study shows that although the rate of capture varies slightly by the size and composition of planetesimals, in general, the final results are independent of the size and material of these bodies. Results also pointed to a new finding: the rate of accretion follows the same trend as that of the evolution of Jupiter's envelope, with the largest accretion occurring during the envelope's collapse. We present details of our analysis and discuss the implications of their results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a global ecosystem of interoperating services that connect worldwide data archives. The VO is implemented in all major astronomy archives through common interfaces developed by the 22 members of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). It was founded in 2002, and the newest members, the SKA Observatory and the Kazakhstan Virtual Observatory, joined in 2022. The VO offers access to data on FAIR principles and from its inception has supported Open Science. The VO acts as a democratizing influence in astronomy: it provides equal access to worldwide public data sets to underserved communities as well as to large data centers, and it enables international participation in scientific research and education. Thus, astronomers from many different communities are positioned to participate in the big science questions emerging in astronomy in the 2020s, such as interpreting transient sources that will be measured in forthcoming missions such as Rubin. In addition, the IVOA has signed an MoU with the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD). Under this MoU, IVOA members participated in "Astronomy from Archival Data," which involved educational activities for undergraduate and post-graduate students organized by Dr. Priya Hasan. The IVOA plans to participate in future such educational events. The presentation describes how new communities may participate in Virtual Observatory science and educational activities, including practices for developing VO-compliant data centers and archives and education and training for developers and end users.

          SS433 Microquasar Jet and the TeV Resurgence beam

 - **Abstract**
 The understanding of microquasars in our galaxy is one of the frontiers of high energy astrophysics. Their models are based on a capturing mass Black Hole, with a nearby spiraling binary companion star. The companion star mass feeds the accretion disk around the Black Hole. This energy also fuels an orthogonal precessing X gamma jets. The spiral precessing tail of such microquasars, as the SS433 system, is due to an ultra-relativistic jet, spraying nucleons and electrons at relativistic speeds. The up-down jet is observable in radio, X, gamma spectra. Its long spirals are spread and diluted within a light-year distance. The source is inside the W50 supernova remnant nebula , whose asymmetry reflects the past and present role of the SS433 jet. Very recently HESS, HAWC discovered, surprisingly at a much far disconnected distance from the SS433, the resurgence of a twin gamma beam tail. Nearly 75 years light distance far away from the same inner jet source. The recent standard model is based on an accelerating shock wave which reaccelerates, the resurgence of a PeV nucleon beam and its TeV secondaries. The surprising recollimation of this TeV beam jet is difficult to be accepted, in the assumption of a planarlike Fermi shock wave model. Here we discuss an alternative framework based on known high energy nuclear physics, capable to simultaneously explaining both the disconnected and the aligned hard TeV jet appearance. Several consequences, that might also be able to validate the model, are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 More than 300 pulsars have been discovered in Galactic globular clusters; however, none have been found in open clusters. Here we present results from 20-hour pulsar searching observations in seven open clusters with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our first discovery is a 1.9-second pulsar (J1922+37) found in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791. The measured dispersion measure (DM) implies a distance of 4.79 kpc and 8.92 kpc based on the NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, respectively. Given the large uncertainty of DM distance estimates, it is likely that PSR J1922+37 is indeed a member of NGC 6791, for which the distance is $4.19\pm0.02$ kpc based on Gaia Data Release 3. If confirmed, PSR J1922+37 will be the first pulsar found in Galactic open clusters. We outline future observations that can confirm this pulsar-open cluster association and discuss the general prospects of finding pulsars in open clusters.

          Enhancement of small-scale induced gravitational waves from the soliton/oscillon domination

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate density fluctuations and scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the production of long-lived solitons and oscillons, which can dominate the early Universe and drive reheating prior to the standard radiation-dominated era. Curvature perturbations are generated not only by the Poisson distribution of these solitons/oscillons but are also amplified during the early matter-dominated phase when the solitons/oscillons dominate. Scalar-induced GWs with characteristic energy spectra emerge from these amplified curvature perturbations, particularly at the sudden transition from matter domination to radiation domination. We analyze this scenario and its GW predictions in detail, focusing on the impact of the initial energy fraction, the lifetime, and the average separation of these solitons/oscillons. This provides a wealth of potential observational targets for various GW detectors. Furthermore, for inflation and preheating models that produce oscillons with large separations, we derive new constraints on these models based on the upper bounds on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, as anticipated from future cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations.

 In this paper we present our results of numerical integrations of orbits of fictive massless particle in vicinity of resonance. Our goal is to study the dependences of period (frequency) of resonance perturbations and the width of the resonance on mass and orbital eccentricity of perturbing planet and on the initial difference of longitude between test particle and perturbing planet.

          Hadronic particle acceleration in the supernova remnant SN 1006 as traced by Fermi-LAT observations

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant SN 1006 is a source of high-energy particles detected at radio, X-rays, and tera-electronvolt gamma rays. It was also announced as a source of gamma rays by Fermi-LAT but only the north-east (NE) limb was detected at more than $5\sigma$ significance level. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT observation and a thorough morphological analysis above 1 GeV, we report the detection of the NE rim at the $6\sigma$ level and the south-west (SW) rim at the $5.5\sigma$ level using radio templates from the GLEAM survey. The spectral analysis performed between 100 MeV and 1 TeV allows the detection of a hard spectral index for the NE limb of $1.7 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$ while the emission detected in the SW is well reproduced with a steeper spectral index of $2.2 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$. A marginal detection (~$3\sigma$) of emission coincident with the bright north-west (NW) H$\alpha$ filament is also described with a similar spectral index of ~2.1. We successfully characterized the non-thermal multi-wavelength emission of the NE and SW limbs with a model in which inverse-Compton emission dominates in the NE while proton-proton interactions becomes significant in the SW due to the enhanced density of the medium.

          Long-term radio variability of active galactic nuclei at 37 GHz

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of analysing the long-term radio variability of active galactic nuclei at 37 GHz using data of 123 sources observed in the Aalto University Metsähovi Radio Observatory. Our aim was to constrain the characteristic timescales of the studied sources and to analyse whether up to 42 years of monitoring was enough to describe their variability behaviour. We used a periodogram to estimate the power spectral density of each source. The power spectral density is used to analyse the power content of a time series in the frequency domain, and it is a powerful tool in describing the variability of active galactic nuclei. We were interested in finding a bend frequency in the power spectrum, that is, a frequency at which the slope $\beta$ of the spectrum changes from a non-zero value to zero. We fitted two models to the periodograms of each source, namely the bending power law and the simple power law. The bend frequency in the bending power law corresponds to a characteristic timescale. We were able to constrain a timescale for 11 out of 123 sources, with an average characteristic timescale x_b = 1300 days and an average power-law slope $\beta$ = 2.3. The results suggest that up to 42 years of observations may not always be enough for obtaining a characteristic timescale in the radio domain. This is likely caused by a combination of both slow variability as well as sampling induced effects. We also compared the obtained timescales to 43 GHz very long baseline interferometry images. The maximum length of time a knot was visible was often close to the obtained characteristic timescale. This suggests a connection between the characteristic timescale and the jet structure.

          A Novel Method of Estimating GRB Peak Energies Beyond the \emph{Swift}/BAT Limit
 - **Authors:** Liang Li, Yu Wang

 - **Abstract**
 The \emph{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), operating in the 15--150 keV energy band, struggles to detect the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as most GRBs have $E_{\rm p}$ values typically distributed between 200-300 keV, exceeding BAT's upper limit. To address this, we develop an innovative method to robustly estimate the lower limit of $E_{\rm p}$ for GRBs with $E_{\rm p}>150$ keV. This approach relies on the intrinsic curvature of GRB spectra, which is already evident within the BAT energy range for such GRBs. By fitting BAT spectra with a cutoff power-law model and extrapolating the spectral curvature beyond BAT's range, we, therefore, can estimate the cutoff energy ($E^{'}_{\rm c}$) beyond 150 keV and the corresponding peak energy ($E^{'}_{\rm p}$). We applied this method to 17 GRBs, categorizing them into two main groups. Group I (10 bursts) maintains $\alpha$ within a typical range (from $\sim$ -0.8 to $\sim$ -1.20) with increasing $E_{\rm c}$; Group II (2 bursts) maintains $E_{\rm c}$ within a typical range (300-500 keV) but with varying $\alpha$. Our results show that for $E_{\rm c}\lesssim $1000 keV, the estimated $E^{'}_{\rm c}$ aligns well with observed values. Moreover, the reliability of $E^{'}_{\rm c}$ also depends on $\alpha$: bursts with harder $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha \gtrsim -2/3$) show reduced accuracy, while bursts with softer $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha \lesssim -2/3$) yield more precise estimates. In conclusion, this method is well-suited for GRB spectra with moderately observed $E_{\rm c}$ ($E_{\rm p}$) values and $\alpha$ indices that are not too hard.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing number of satellite constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) enhances global communications and Earth observation, and support of space commerce is a high priority of many governments. At the same time, the proliferation of satellites in LEO has negative effects on astronomical observations and research, and the preservation of the dark and quiet sky. These satellite constellations reflect sunlight onto optical telescopes, and their radio emission impacts radio observatories, jeopardising our access to essential scientific discoveries through astronomy. The changing visual appearance of the sky also impacts our cultural heritage and environment. Both ground-based observatories and space-based telescopes in LEO are affected, and there are no places on Earth that can escape the effects of satellite constellations given their global nature. The minimally disturbed dark and radio-quiet sky is crucial for conducting fundamental research in astronomy and important public services such as planetary defence, technology development, and high-precision geolocation. Some aspects of satellite deployment and operation are regulated by States and intergovernmental organisations. While regulatory agencies in some States have started to require operators to coordinate with their national astronomy agencies over impacts, mitigation of the impact of space objects on astronomical activities is not sufficiently regulated. To address this issue, the CPS urges States and the international community to take steps to protect the dark and quiet sky as specified in this paper.

          Andromeda's tenuous veil: extensive nebular emission near (yet far from) M31

 - **Abstract**
 A large, faint nebula was unexpectedly discovered near M31 using narrowband [O III] images. Its apparent size and the lack of a clear counterpart at other wavelengths make it unique and challenging to explain. We aim to determine whether the nebula is extragalactic or located within the Milky Way. This will enable us to constrain its physical properties and assess its nature. To do so, we obtained deep narrowband [O II]3727 and H$\alpha$+[NII] observations with the JAST80 telescope at the Observatorio Astrofísico de Javalambre, as well as high-spectral-resolution spectroscopy at four locations within the region of interest using MEGARA at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found extended [O II] emission along two near-parallel strands to the [O III], offset by six arcmin. The nebular spectra reveals up to 6 emission lines from [O III]4959,5007, H$\beta$, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731. Their receding velocities are above $-$40 km s$^{-1}$, far from the systemic velocity of M31 ($-$300 km s$^{-1}$). The fluxes and velocities are consistent for the same lines across different regions of the nebula. The nebular properties suggest a location within the Milky Way rather than being physically associated with M31. The most likely scenario is a resolved ionization structure in a Galactic nebula with a separation between [O II] and [O III] of a few parsecs. The observed receding velocities would be unprecedented for an object physically linked to M31 but are common for nearby gas filaments. Their consistency across the nebula would also be unusual if it were larger than a kiloparsec. The analysis of the emission-line ratios, line widths, and morphology suggests the possibility of it being an interstellar gas filament with an additional source of ionization to explain the [O III] emission. However, the complex properties of this object call for further observations to confirm its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new orbital solutions for 15 binaries, which were astrometrically measured during 2010-2013. We observe the binary systems using the FastCam ``lucky-imaging'' camera, installed at the 1.5-m Carlos Sánchez Telescope (CST) at the Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife (Spain). We present first orbital solutions for four binaries and revise orbits for other 11 systems. We apply two orbital calculation techniques, the ``three-dimensional grid search method'' and the Docobo's analytical method. In addition, we use our tool ``Binary Deblending'', which is based on deblending the entire observed multiband photometry into fundamental and photometric parameters for each stellar component based on PARSEC isochrones. This method allows us to obtain the total mass for all systems. Our findings include the identification of a binary system consisting of two M-type dwarfs (WOR 19), a binary of evolved components (twin F6IV-V stars) in BU 1292, accompanied by a newly discovered wide (10.5 arcsec) and faint companion with G=17.05 mag. Additionally, we explore the X-ray emission system STF 147 and a very young quadruple system, WDS 04573+5345. This comprehensive analysis significantly contributes to our understanding on the formation and evolution of these stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive air showers (EAS), produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, serve as probes of particle interactions, providing access to energies and kinematical regimes beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. Measurements from multiple cosmic-ray detectors indicate a significant, yet unexplained, discrepancy between the observed muon content in EAS and that predicted by state-of-the-art interaction models, suggesting a need for refinements in our understanding of fundamental physics. Here we show that a tiny, experimentally allowed, violation of the Lorentz invariance (LIV) may result in the suppression of the number of electrons in EAS, leaving the muon number intact and explaining both the ''muon excess'' and its energy dependence. On the other hand, we use the lack of a much stronger discrepancy between EAS data and simulations to obtain strict constraints on the LIV scale. Future experimental tests of this LIV scenario are outlined.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is non-zero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.

 Aims. We present observational results of H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3, SiO 4-3, HC$_{3}$N 19-18 and C$^{18}$O 1-0 toward a sample of 51 late-stage massive star-forming regions, to study relationships among H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS, HCS$^{+}$ and SiO in hot cores. Chemical connections of these S-bearing molecules are discussed based on the relations between relative abundances in sources. Results. H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3 and HC$_{3}$N 19-18 were detected in 50 of the 51 sources, while SiO 4-3 was detected in 46 sources. C$^{18}$O 1-0 was detected in all sources. The Pearson correlation coefficients between H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^+$ normalized by H$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$S are 0.94 and 0.87, respectively, and a tight linear relationship is found between them with slope of 1.00 and 1.09, while they are 0.77 and 0.98 between H$_2$S and H$_2$CS, respectively, and 0.76 and 0.97 between H$_2$S and HCS$^+$. The values of full width at half maxima (FWHM) of them in each source are similar to each other, which indicate that they can trace similar regions. Comparing the observed abundance with model results, there is one possible time (2-3$\times$10$^{5}$ yr) for each source in the model. The abundances of these molecules increase with the increment of SiO abundance in these sources, which implies that shock chemistry may be important for them. Conclusions. Close abundance relation of H$_2$S, H$_2$CS and HCS$^+$ molecules and similar line widths in observational results indicate that these three molecules could be chemically linked, with HCS$^+$ and H$_2$CS the most correlated. The comparison of the observational results with chemical models shows that the abundances can be reproduced for almost all the sources at a specific time. The observational results, including abundances in these sources need to be considered in further modeling H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^{+}$ in hot cores with shock chemistry.

          Calibrating the Tully-Fisher Relation to Measure the Hubble Constant

 - **Abstract**
 Boubel et al. 2024 (B24) recently used the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation to measure calibrated distances in the Hubble flow and found $H_0= 73.3 \pm 2.1 (stat) \pm 3.5 (sys)$ km/s/Mpc. The large systematic uncertainty was the result of propagating the conflict between two sources of empirical distance calibration: a difference in zeropoint when calibrating the TF relation with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) versus Cepheids and Tip-of-the-Red-Giant-Branch (TRGB) and an apparent difference in zeropoint between two distinct TRGB datasets. We trace the SN Ia-based calibration used in the TF analysis to a study where $H_0$ was fixed to 70 km/s/Mpc rather than measured, (with host distances derived from redshifts and the Hubble law), thus introducing a discrepancy with the other empirically calibrated indicators. In addition, we trace the difference in TRGB zeropoints to a miscalibration of $0.14$ mag that should be $\sim0.01-0.04$ mag. Using the consistent Cepheid and TRGB calibration from B24 while removing the problematic data reduces the systematic error by a factor of two and results in $H_0 = 76.3 \pm 2.1 \textrm{(stat)} \pm 1.5 \textrm{(sys)}$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement is consistent with previous determinations of $H_0$ using the TF relation. We also show that most determinations of $H_0$ measurements that replace Type Ia supernovae measurements with another far-field distance indicator yield $H_0>73$ km/s/Mpc, reinforcing previous findings that the Hubble tension is not tied to any one distance indicator.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs have become increasingly important in the detection of exoplanets and the study of Earth-sized planets and their habitability. However, 20-30% of M dwarfs have companions that can impact the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We use high-resolution imaging and Gaia astrometry to detect stellar companions around M dwarf exoplanet hosts discovered by TESS and determine the projected separation and estimated stellar masses for each system. We find 47 companions around 216 M dwarfs and a multiplicity rate of $19.4\pm2.7$% that is consistent with field M dwarfs. The binary projected separation distribution is shifted to larger separations, confirming the lack of close binaries hosting transiting exoplanets seen in previous studies. We correct the radii of planets with nearby companions and examine the properties of planets in M dwarf multi-star systems. We also note three multi-planet systems that occur in close binaries ($\lesssim 50$ au) where planet formation is expected to be suppressed.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze four super-Earth exoplanets, LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c, which orbit M-dwarf stars in the habitable zone. Their relative proximity, within 40 parsecs, makes them prime candidates for follow-up observations and atmospheric and habitability studies. This paper aims to assess their internal structure and habitability, considering their tidal heating, atmospheric heating, and global transport. We model the interior structure of the planets by applying Bayesian inference to an exoplanet's interior model. A constant quality factor model is used to calculate the range of tidal heating, and a one-dimensional analytical model of tidally locked planets is used to assess their surface temperature distribution and habitability. Assuming no or only thin atmospheres, K2-18 b and TOI-1468 c are likely to be water worlds. However, TOI-1452 b and LHS 1140 b may have rocky surfaces. We find that tidal heating is not enough to raise the global mean surface temperature, but greenhouse heating can effectively do so. If the considered planets have retained thick atmospheres, K2-18 b, TOI-1468 c, and TOI-1452 b may, for significant atmospheric heating and heat transport factors, be too hot to sustain liquid water on their surface. However, the lower instellation of LHS 1140 b and the non-zero probability of it having a rocky surface give more space for habitable conditions on the planet.

 Currently, data-intensive scientific applications require vast amounts of compute resources to deliver world-leading science. The climate emergency has made it clear that unlimited use of resources (e.g., energy) for scientific discovery is no longer acceptable. Future computing hardware promises to be much more energy efficient, but without better optimized software this cannot reach its full potential. In this vision paper, we propose a generic AI-driven co-design methodology, using specialized Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), to effectively generate efficient code for emerging computing hardware. We describe how we will validate our methodology with two radio astronomy applications, with sustainability as the key performance indicator. This paper is a modified version of our accepted SuperCode project proposal. We present it here in this form to introduce the vision behind this project and to disseminate the work in the spirit of Open Science and transparency. An additional aim is to collect feedback, invite potential collaboration partners and use-cases to join the project.

 We present the study of seven systems, three of which TOI-2295, TOI-2537, and TOI-5110 are newly discovered planetary systems. Through the analysis of TESS photometry, SOPHIE radial velocities, and high-spatial resolution imaging, we found that TOI-2295b, TOI-2537b, and TOI-5110b are transiting warm Jupiters with orbital periods ranging from 30 to 94 d, masses between 0.9 and 2.9 MJ, and radii ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 RJ. Both TOI-2295 and TOI-2537 each harbor at least one additional, outer planet. Their outer planets TOI-2295c and TOI-2537c are characterized by orbital periods of 966.5 +/- 4.3 and 1920^{+230}_{-140} d, respectively, and minimum masses of 5.61^{+0.23}_{-0.24} and 7.2 +/- 0.5 MJ, respectively. We also investigated and characterized the two recently reported warm Jupiters TOI-1836b and TOI-5076b, which we independently detected in SOPHIE RVs. Additionally, we study the planetary candidates TOI-4081.01 and TOI-4168.01. For TOI-4081.01, despite our detection in radial velocities, we cannot rule out perturbation by a blended eclipsing binary and thus exercise caution regarding its planetary nature. On the other hand, we identify TOI-4168.01 as a firm false positive. Finally, we highlight interesting characteristics of these new planetary systems. The transits of TOI-2295b are highly grazing, with an impact parameter of 1.056$^{+0.063}_{-0.043}$. TOI-2537b, in turn, is a temperate Jupiter with an effective temperature of 307+/-15 K and can serve as a valuable low-irradiation control for models of hot Jupiter inflation anomalies. We also detected significant transit timing variations (TTVs) for TOI-2537b, which are likely caused by gravitational interactions with the outer planet TOI-2537c. Finally, TOI-5110b stands out due to its orbital eccentricity of 0.75+/- 0.03, one of the highest planetary eccentricities discovered thus far.

 Aims: We aim to observe the transits and occultations of WASP-33b, which orbits a rapidly-rotating $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, with the goal of measuring the orbital obliquity via the gravity-darkening effect, and constraining the geometric albedo via the occultation depth. Methods: We observed four transits and four occultations with CHEOPS, and employ a variety of techniques to remove the effects of the stellar pulsations from the light curves, as well as the usual CHEOPS systematic effects. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of low-resolution spectral and Gaia data to re-determine the stellar properties of WASP-33. Results: We measure an orbital obliquity 111.3 +0.2 -0.7 degrees, which is consistent with previous measurements made via Doppler tomography. We also measure the planetary impact parameter, and confirm that this parameter is undergoing rapid secular evolution as a result of nodal precession of the planetary orbit. This precession allows us to determine the second-order fluid Love number of the star, which we find agrees well with the predictions of theoretical stellar models. We are unable to robustly measure a unique value of the occultation depth, and emphasise the need for long-baseline observations to better measure the pulsation periods.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) come in various flavors and are classified into different types based on emission and absorption lines in their spectra. SN candidates are now abundant with the advent of large systematic dynamic sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), however, the identification bottleneck lies in their spectroscopic confirmation and classification. Fully robotic telescopes with dedicated spectrographs optimized for SN follow-up have eased the burden of data acquisition. However, the task of classifying the spectra still largely rests with the astronomers. Automating this classification step reduces human effort, and can make the SN type available sooner to the public. For this purpose, we have developed a deep-learning based program for classifying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with ultra-low resolution spectra obtained with the SED-Machine IFU spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. The program consists of hierarchical classification task layers, with each layer composed of multiple binary classifiers which are run in parallel to produce a reliable classification. The binary classifiers utilize RNN and CNN architecture and are designed to take multiple inputs, to supplement spectra with g- and r-band photometry from ZTF. On non-host-contaminated and good quality SEDM spectra ("gold" test set), CCSNscore is ~94% accurate (correct classifications) in distinguishing between hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) CCSNe. With the help of light curve input, CCSNscore classifies ~83% of the gold set with high confidence (score >= 0.8 and score-error < 0.05), with ~98% accuracy.

          A New Approach to the Low Frequency Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background: Constraints from Quasars and the Astrometric Hellings-Downs Curve

 - **Abstract**
 We present new astrometric constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background and construct the first astrometric Hellings-Downs curve using quasar proper motions. From quadrupolar vector spherical harmonic fits to the Gaia proper motions of 1,108,858 quasars, we obtain a frequency-integrated upper limit on the gravitational wave energy density, $h_{70}^2\Omega_{GW} \leq 0.023$ (95% confidence limit), for frequencies between 11.2 nHz and $3.1\times10^{-9}$ nHz ($1.33/t_0$). However, from the astrometric Hellings-Downs curve that describes the correlated proper motions between 2,104,609,881 quasar pairs as a function of their angular separation, we find a much stronger constraint: a characteristic strain of $h_{c} \leq 2.9 \times 10^{-12}$ for $f_{\rm ref} = 1$ yr$^{-1}$ and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{\rm GW} \leq 0.010$ at 95% confidence. We probe down to $\pm$0.005 $\mu$as$^2$ yr$^{-2}$ in correlated power and obtain the lowest astrometric limit to date. This is also the first time that optical wavelength astrometry surpasses limits from radio-frequency interferometry. This astrometric analysis does not yet reach the sensitivity needed to detect the pulsar timing-based red gravitational wave spectrum extrapolated to the quasar gravitational wave sensitivity window, assuming that the turnover in the spectrum occurs at $\sim$1 nHz for massive black hole binaries. The limits presented here may exclude some exotic interpretations of the stochastic gravitational wave background.

          Testing the equivalence principle across the Universe: a model-independent approach with galaxy multi-tracing

 - **Abstract**
 We present a test of the equivalence principle on cosmological scales involving minimal assumptions. Our approach relies on the cross-correlation of two different galaxy populations with large-scale relativistic corrections. We construct a measurable quantity $E_P$ acting as a null test, i.e. deviating from unity whenever the weak equivalence principle is violated. We provide forecasts with the DESI Bright Galaxy Sample and with the Square Kilometre Array Phase 2 (SKA2). The relativistic corrections can be detected with high significance by both surveys, while $E_P$ can only be measured by SKA2. We forecast a precision around 10-15$\%$ across the redshift range between 0.25 and 0.75.
