 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a class of mechanical lattices with reconfigurable, zero-stiffness structures has been proposed, called Totimorphic structures. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that allows continuous reprogramming of a Totimorphic lattice's effective properties, such as mechanical and optical properties, via continuous geometric changes alone. Our approach is differentiable and guarantees valid Totimorphic lattice configurations throughout the optimisation process, thus providing not only specific configurations with desired properties but also trajectories through configuration space connecting them. It enables re-programmable structures where actuators are controlled via automatic differentiation on an objective-dependent cost function, altering the lattice structure at all times to achieve a given objective - which is interchangeable to achieve different functionalities. Our main interest lies in deep space applications where harsh, extreme, and resource-constrained environments demand solutions that offer flexibility, resource efficiency, and autonomy. We illustrate our framework through two proofs of concept: a re-programmable metamaterial as well as a space telescope mirror with adjustable focal length, both made from Totimorphic structures. The introduced framework is easily adjustable to a variety of Totimorphic designs and objectives, providing a light-weight model for endowing physical prototypes of Totimorphic structures with autonomous self-configuration and self-repair capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 In this chapter, we describe how the IceCube Neutrino Observatory transformed a cubic kilometer of natural ice at the geographic South Pole into a neutrino telescope. The concept of using the neutrino as an astronomical messenger is as old as the neutrino itself, and the challenge to open this new window on the high-energy universe was technological in nature. We discuss how IceCube was constructed and how the detector operates, including some detail on the 5,484 optical sensors that comprise the array. We highlight some of the primary results of the experiment, including the discovery of a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos reaching us from the cosmos, the observation of the first high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, and the observation of our Galaxy in neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present tonalli, a spectroscopic analysis python code that efficiently predicts effective temperature, stellar surface gravity, metallicity, $\alpha$-element abundance, and rotational and radial velocities for stars with effective temperatures between 3200 and 6250 K, observed with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2). tonalli implements an asexual genetic algorithm to optimise the finding of the best comparison between a target spectrum and the continuum-normalised synthetic spectra library from the Model Atmospheres with a Radiative and Convective Scheme (MARCS), which is interpolated in each generation. Using simulated observed spectra and the APOGEE-2 solar spectrum of Vesta, we study the performance, limitations, accuracy and precision of our tool. Finally, a Monte Carlo realisation was implemented to estimate the uncertainties of each derived stellar parameter. The ad hoc continuum-normalised library is publicly available on Zenodo (DOI https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12736546).

          Once a giant, (almost) always a giant: Partial Tidal Disruption Events of Giant Stars
 - **Authors:** Nuria Navarro Navarro, Tsvi Piran

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) of giant stars by supermassive black holes (SMBH) differ significantly from those of main sequence ones. Most (all for SMBH of more than a~ few times 10^5 m_\odot) giant-TDEs are partial: only a fraction of the envelope is torn apart. The dense stellar core and the rest of the envelope remain intact. In this work, we explore, using the stellar evolution code MESA, the fate of the remnants. We find that after a short period, comparable to the thermal time scale, the remnant returns to a giant structure with a radius comparable to the progenitor giant one, a slightly larger luminosity (as compared with a regular giant with the same mass), and a comparable lifetime until it collapses to a white dwarf. If such a giant with a mass less than approx 0.9 m_\odot is discovered, it can be identified as an outlier - a giant that is too light for the current age of the Universe. If the remnant orbit is not perturbed significantly during the encounter, the remnant will undergo successive partial tidal disruptions until its mass is $0.6-0.7 m_\odot$. We expect a few dozen to a few hundred such remnants in the Galactic nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical solutions of Kepler's Equation are critical components of celestial mechanics software, and are often computation hot spots. This work uses symbolic regression and a genetic learning algorithm to find new initial guesses for iterative Kepler solvers for both elliptical and hyperbolic orbits. The new initial guesses are simple to implement, and result in modest speed improvements for elliptical orbits, and major speed improvements for hyperbolic orbits.

          Where is the Super-virial Gas? II: Insight from the Survey of Galactic Sightlines

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed a super-virial temperature gas phase at log(T/K) $\sim7$ in the Milky Way, challenging existing galaxy-formation models. This hot gas phase was discovered toward extragalactic absorption sightlines and blank-sky emission fields, both at high galactic latitudes. The location of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray spectra from Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations of 27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component is present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of SXVI K$\alpha$, SiXIV K$\alpha$, and NeX K$\alpha$, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27 targets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources displaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems. Additionally, most of the detected lines are time-variable, reinforcing their likely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the super-virial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, in line with some recent simulation results.

          Metal-Poor Stars in the Milky Way System

 - **Abstract**
 Ancient, long-lived stars remain present in all components of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Born a few hundred million after the Big Bang and during a time that marked the very beginning of the chemical evolution, these stars display very low abundances of elements heavier and hydrogen and helium, making them "metal-poor". Studying the chemical composition of these stars reveals direct information about the conditions of the early universe because each of them has long preserved the local chemical signature of their individual birth gas clouds in their stellar atmosphere. There are many different types of metal-poor stars, each of them providing information on a different element production history that occurred prior to their own births. Large samples of metal-poor stars enable the reconstruction of nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy, early star formation processes, and various aspects of the assembly and evolution of the Milky Way.

          Puzzling High-Velocity Calcium Absorption Features Of Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption features Ca II NIR and Ca II H&K of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by their strong high-velocity features (HVFs). We find that, for these two features of calcium there is a puzzling anti-correlation between the line strengths of HVF and photospheric (PHO) components, and an unexpected positive correlation between the velocity difference and line strength ratio of HVF and PHO components. In comparison, HVFs of Si II $\lambda$6355 and O I $\lambda$7773 show a positive correlation between the line strengths of HVF and PHO components, and no clear correlation between the velocity difference and line strength ratio of the two components. The differences may be associated with the fact that calcium was mostly synthesized in deeper layers than silicon and oxygen, and thus experienced much more serious blocking by substances in outer layers. These observations can shed light on the physics of HVFs.

          SILVERRUSH. XIV. Lya Luminosity Functions and Angular Correlation Functions from ~20,000 Lya Emitters at z~2.2-7.3 from upto 24 ${\rm deg}^2$ HSC-SSP and CHORUS Surveys: Linking the Post-Reionization Epoch to the Heart of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 We present the luminosity functions (LFs) and angular correlation functions (ACFs) derived from 18,960 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=2.2-7.3$ over a wide survey area of $\lesssim24 {\rm deg^2}$ that are identified in the narrowband data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) and the Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) surveys. Confirming the large sample with the 241 spectroscopically identified LAEs, we determine Ly$\alpha$ LFs and ACFs in the brighter luminosity range down to $0.5L_{\star}$, and confirm that our measurements are consistent with previous studies but offer significantly reduced statistical uncertainties. The improved precision of our ACFs allows us to clearly detect one-halo terms at some redshifts, and provides large-scale bias measurements that indicate hosting halo masses of $\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$ over $z\simeq 2-7$. By comparing our Ly$\alpha$ LF (ACF) measurements with reionization models, we estimate the neutral hydrogen fractions in the intergalactic medium to be $x_{\rm \HI}<0.05$ (=${0.06}^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$), $0.15^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ (${0.21}^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$), $0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$, and $0.75^{+0.09}_{-0.13}$ at $z=5.7$, $6.6$, $7.0$, and $7.3$, respectively. Our findings suggest that the neutral hydrogen fraction remains relatively low, $x_{\rm \HI} \lesssim 0.2$, at $z=5-7$, but increases sharply at $z > 7$, reaching $x_{\rm \HI} \sim 0.9$ by $z \simeq 8-9$, as indicated by recent JWST studies. The combination of our results from LAE observations with recent JWST observations suggests that the major epoch of reionization occurred around $z \sim 7-8$, likely driven by the emergence of massive sources emitting significant ionizing photons.

          Chemical Links between a Young M-type T Tauri Star and its Substellar Companion: Spectral Analysis and C/O Measurement of DH Tau A

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundance measurements of host stars and their substellar companions provide a powerful tool to trace the formation mechanism of the planetary systems. We present a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a young M-type star, DH Tau A, which is located in the Taurus molecular cloud belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This star is host to a low-mass companion, DH Tau b, and both star and the companion are still in their accreting phase. We apply our technique (Hejazi et al. 2024) to measure the abundances of carbon and oxygen using carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules, such as CO and OH, respectively. We determine a near-solar carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of C/O=0.555$\pm$0.063 for the host star DH Tau A. We compare this stellar abundance ratio with that of the companion from our previous study (C/O=0.54$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, Xuan et al. 2024), which also has a near-solar value. This confirms the chemical homogeneity in the DH Tau system, which suggests a formation scenario for the companion consistent with a direct and relatively fast gravitational collapse, rather than a slow core accretion process.

 - **Abstract**
 The increased bandwidth coupled with the large numbers of antennas of several new radio telescope arrays has resulted in an exponential increase in the amount of data that needs to be recorded and processed. In many cases, it is necessary to process this data in real time, as the raw data volumes are too high to be recorded and stored. Due to the ability of graphics processing units (GPUs) to process data in parallel, GPUs are increasingly used for data-intensive tasks. In most radio astronomy digital instrumentation (e.g. correlators for spectral imaging, beamforming, pulsar, fast radio burst and SETI searching), the processing power of modern GPUs is limited by the input/output data rate, not by the GPU's computation ability. Techniques for streaming ultra-high-rate data to GPUs, such as those described in this paper, reduce the number of GPUs and servers needed, and make significant reductions in the cost, power consumption, size, and complexity of GPU based radio astronomy backends. In this research, we developed and tested several different techniques to stream data from network interface cards (NICs) to GPUs. We also developed an open-source UDP/IPv4 400GbE wrapper for the AMD/Xilinx IP demonstrating high-speed data stream transfer from a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to GPU.

          Triple Evolution Pathways to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Insights from V404 Cygni

 - **Abstract**
 A recent discovery shows that V404 Cygni, a prototypical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH-LMXB) is a hierarchical triple: the BH and donor star are orbited by a $1.2$ M$_{\odot}$ tertiary at a distance of at least $3500$ au. Motivated by this system, we evolve a grid of $\sim50,000$ triple star systems, spanning a broad range of initial orbits. Our calculations employ {\tt MESA} stellar evolution models, using {\tt POSYDON}, and self-consistently track the effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations, mass loss, tides, and BH natal kicks. In our simulations, the progenitors of V404 Cygni-like systems have initial outer separations of $1000 - 10000$ au and inner separations of $\sim100$ au, such that they avoid Roche lobe overflow most of the time. Later on, EKL oscillations drive the inner binary to high eccentricities until tides shrink the orbit and mass transfer begins. Notably, such systems only form in simulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\lesssim 5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations also predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical common-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe. The formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated binaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range of initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope. Our calculations demonstrate that at least some stellar BHs form with extremely weak kicks, and that triple evolution is a significant formation channel for BH-LMXBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The chemistry and Galactic velocity components of the star HD 65907 suggest that despite its young isochronal age of $\sim$5 Gyr, it is in fact a merger of two old Population II stars. Its low Li abundance is also consistent with a mass accretion episode. Aims. We determine Li and Be abundances for this star and evaluate its radial velocity time series, activity cycle, and spectral energy distribution in search of clues regarding the origin of this enigmatic star. Methods. Li and Be abundances were determined via spectral synthesis of their resonance lines using HARPS and UVES spectra, respectively. HARPS data were also used to study variations in the star's radial velocity and activity levels. Photometric data were adopted to evaluate the stellar spectral energy distribution. Results. HD 65908 is severely Li- and Be-depleted. Its radial velocity is nearly constant ($\sigma =$ 2 m/s), with a small modulation likely associated with stellar activity, and the star shows no further signs of an undetected close companion. The excess infrared emission is consistent with a 30 K blackbody, which is interpreted as a debris disk surrounding the star. The post-merger mass, rotation rate, and evolution of this star are discussed. Conclusions. The low Li and Be abundances, in addition to the lack of evidence for a companion, are strong pieces of evidence in favor of the stellar merger scenario. In this context, Be can be used to confirm other blue stragglers among field solar-type stars, as proposed in the literature.

          Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object lives for a short time at the termination of the CEE phase and alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.

          SURF Report: High Accuracy Methods for Computing Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Force Fields Near the Surface of Irregularly Shaped 3-Dimensional Bodies

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate gravity field calculations are necessary for landing on planets, moons, asteroids, minimoons, or other irregularly shaped bodies, but current methods become increasingly inaccurate and slow near the surface. We present high accuracy, fast methods for computing gravitational potential and gravitational force fields, which are needed for future space missions. Notably, gravitational force and potential computations are simplified, with high accuracy enhanced by bringing the derivative inside the gravitational potential integral. In addition, we present a new gravitational field calculus, which lets us combine simpler potentials and force fields to create more complex ones without accuracy loss. Several examples are provided, for instance, where we subtract different shapes from a spherical body making a variety of craters. The calculus will also work well with volumetric octree methods. Additionally, we use new bounds in the gravitational potential integral, to avoid trying to fit smooth basis functions to non-smooth curves, and harness new computational tools where tasks can be migrated to GPUs. We also have found that cylindrical coordinates can have special advantages in tailoring shape models. We have created a series of algorithms and preliminary MATLAB and Mathematica toolboxes utilizing these methods and the gravitational calculus. These methods are newly customizable for necessary high-accuracy gravity computations in future missions planned by JPL and other space agencies to navigate near irregularly shaped bodies in the solar system.

          A 44-minute periodic radio transient in a supernova remnant

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a newly discovered class of radio emitters with yet incomprehensibly long rotation periods, ranging from minutes to hours. The astrophysical nature of their isolated counterparts remains undetermined. We report a new LPT, DART J1832-0911 (2656.23 $\pm$ 0.15 s period), the first evidence associating such objects to supernova remnants (SNRs). Its dispersion measure distance aligns well with the distance of the SNR, confirming its origin from a supernova explosion. The source displays either phase-locked circularly polarized emission or nearly 100% linear polarization in radio bands. No detectable optical counterpart was found, even with a 10 m class telescope. The J1832-0911's SNR association, stable, highly polarized emission, and abnormally long period strongly favor its origin from a young neutron star, whose spin has been braked, possibly by interaction with supernova's fallback materials. This discovery provides critical insights into the nature of ultra-long period transients and their evolutionary link to stellar remnants.

          A Reassessment of Hemispherical Power Asymmetry in CMB Temperature Data from Planck PR4 using LVE method

 - **Abstract**
 We undertake a reassessment of one of the large angular scale anomalies observed in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature signal referred to as Hemispherical Power Asymmetry (HPA). For the present analysis we used \texttt{sevem} cleaned CMB maps from \emph{Planck}'s 2020 final data release (public release 4/PR4). To probe HPA, we employed the local variance estimator (LVE) method with different disc radii ranging from $1^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. It is reaffirmed that HPA is confined to low multipoles or large angular scales of the CMB sky. A dipole like anisotropy was found in the LVE maps with anomalous power for disc radii of $2^\circ$ and upward up to $36^\circ$ at $\gtrsim2\sigma$. In the range $4^\circ$ to $10^\circ$ none of the 600 \texttt{sevem} CMB simulations were found to have a dipole amplitude higher than the data when using LVE method as proposed. Our emphasis here was to revalidate the LVE method in various ways for its optimal usage and probe the hemispherical power asymmetry in the form of a dipole modulation field underlying CMB sky. By and large, our results are in agreement with earlier reported ones with more detailed presentation of explicit and not-so-explicit assumptions involved in the estimation process. The above reported values fall in the reliability range of LVE method after this extensive re-evaluation. We conclude that the hemispherical power asymmetry still remains as a challenge to the standard model.

          General parametrization for energy density of quintessence field

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general parametrization for energy density of a quintessence field, a minimally coupled canonical scalar field which rolls down slowly during the late time. This parametrization can mimic all classes of quintessence dynamics, namely scaling-freezing, tracker and thawing dynamics for any redshift. For thawing dynamics the parametrization needs two free parameters while for scaling-freezing and tracker dynamics it needs at least four free parameters. More parameters make the model less interesting from the observational data analysis point of view but as we expect more precise data in future it may be possible to constrain the models with multiple free parameters which can tell about the dynamics more precisely. One of the main advantage of this parametrization is that it reduces the computational time to significant amount while mimicking the actual scalar field dynamics for all redshifts which may not be possible with other existing parametrizations. We compare the parametrization with two and four parameters with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmological observational data from Planck 2018 (distance priors), DESI $2024$ DR1, PantheonPlus, Hubble parameter measurements and the redshift space distortion. We find that the observational data prefers standard $\Lambda$CDM model over other models. If we allow phantom region then it is more preferred by the data compared to non-phantom thawing quintessence. Also, we can not strictly comment on the preference on the dynamical dark energy over a cosmological constant as claimed by the DESI 2024 DR1 results.

 - **Abstract**
 This work compares the performance of different antenna configurations in radio astronomy interferometry, including the golden spiral, a grid, a random arrangement, and the "Y" configuration similar to the Very Large Array. One hundred antennas are simulated in each configuration, and the resulting UV coverage and image quality are analyzed. The results show that the golden spiral provides more uniform UV coverage without significant gaps, which improves image quality by reducing sidelobes and artifacts. In comparison, the grid exhibits periodic structures in the UV coverage that can degrade image quality due to gaps and artifacts. The random arrangement offers more natural coverage but is less efficient in terms of resolution and sidelobe control. The "Y" configuration proves effective in achieving high resolution along its arms but lacks complete coverage in certain directions, which can negatively affect image quality at those angles. The self-similar nature of the golden spiral allows for efficient capture of both large and small structures in observed sources, maximizing the spatial information obtained. We conclude that, for applications where resolution and sensitivity are critical, the golden spiral represents the optimal configuration, followed by the "Y" configuration, with the grid being the least suitable.

 We demonstrate an approach that allows separating two-point correlations created by a Gaussian random field from correlations created by cosmic foregrounds such as polarized dust emission, gravitational lensing and other non-Gaussian signals. The result of traditional approaches should typically be a 'foreground-cleaned' two-dimensional CMB map of the anisotropy or polarization. Our method does not create a clean map, but extracts the part of the two-point correlations, or equivalently the part of the power spectrum, which is due only to the Gaussian component of the observed signal produced by inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is the most sensitive telescope at the L-band (1.0-1.5GHz) and has been used to carry out the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey in the last 5 years. Up to now, the survey has covered one-fourth of the planned areas within $10^{\circ}$ from the Galactic plane visible by the FAST, and discovered 751 pulsars. After the first publishing of the discovery of 201 pulsars and one rotating radio transient (RRAT) in 2021 and 76 RRATs in 2023, here we report the discovery of 473 new pulsars from the FAST GPPS survey, including 137 new millisecond field pulsars and 30 new RRATs. We find that 34 millisecond pulsars discovered by the GPPS survey which can be timed with a precision better than 3~$\mu$s by using FAST 15-minute observations and can be used for the pulsar timing arrays. The GPPS survey has discovered 8 pulsars with periods greater than 10~s including one with 29.77~s. The profiles of integrated profiles of pulsars and individual pulses of RRATs are presented. During the FAST GPPS survey, we also detected previously known pulsars and updated parameters for 45 pulsars. In addition, we discover 2 fast radio bursts plus one probable case with high dispersion measures indicating their extragalactic origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters are fundamental stellar systems where predictions from star-formation theories can be robustly contrasted with observations. Aims: We aim to provide the astrophysical community with a free and open-source code to infer the phase-space (i.e. positions and velocities) parameters of stellar systems with $\lesssim$1000 stars based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry and possibly observed radial velocities. Methods: We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model and extend it to model 3D (positions) and 6D (positions and velocities) stellar coordinates and system parameters with a flexible variety of statistical models, including a linear velocity field. This velocity field allows for the inference of internal kinematics, including expansion, contraction, and rotation. Results: We extensively validated our statistical models using realistic simulations that mimic the properties of the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We applied \textit{Kalkayotl} to $\beta$-Pictoris, the Hyades, and Praesepe, recovering parameter values compatible with those from the literature. In particular, we found an expansion age of $19.1\pm1.0$ Myr for $\beta$-Pictoris and rotational signal of $32\!\pm\!11\,\rm{m\,s^{-1}\,pc^{-1}}$ for the Hyades and that Praesepe's rotation reported in the literature comes from its periphery. Conclusions: The robust and flexible Bayesian hierarchical model that we make publicly available here represents a step forward in the statistical modelling of stellar systems. The products it delivers, such as expansion, contraction, rotation, and velocity dispersions, can be directly contrasted with predictions from star-formation theories.

          Measurement of Very-high-energy Diffuse Gamma-ray Emissions from the Galactic Plane with LHAASO-WCDA

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is a very important tool used to study the propagation and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this work, we report the measurements of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, covering Galactic longitudes from $15^{\circ}$ to $235^{\circ}$ and latitudes from $-5^{\circ}$ to $+5^{\circ}$, in an energy range of 1 TeV to 25 TeV, with the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). After masking the sky regions of known sources, the diffuse emission is detected with $24.6\sigma$ and $9.1\sigma$ significance in the inner Galactic plane($15^{\circ}<l<125^{\circ}$, $|b|<5^{\circ}$) and outer Galactic plane ($125^{\circ}<l<235^{\circ}$, $|b|<5^{\circ}$), respectively. The WCDA spectra in both regions can be well described by a power-law function, with spectral indices of $-2.67\pm0.05_{\rm stat}$ in the inner region and $-2.83\pm0.19_{\rm stat}$ in the outer region, respectively. Combined with the Square Kilometer Array (KM2A) measurements at higher energies, a clear softening of the spectrum is found in the inner region, with change of spectral indices by $\sim0.5$ at a break energy around $30$ this http URL fluxes of the diffuse emission are higher by a factor of $1.5-2.7$ than the model prediction assuming local CR spectra and the gas column density, which are consistent with those measured by the KM2A. Along Galactic longitude, the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission shows deviation from that of the gas column density. The spectral shape of the diffuse emission are possibly variation in different longitude region. The results indicate further that the conventional model prediction of diffuse emission from cosmic ray interactions is not enough to account for the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles necessitates addressing dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile that is closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide assistance for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5<!PCT!> for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be envisaged that the optimal indicator can provide insights into the radiation mechanism of radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 To elucidate the robustness of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in capturing the dynamical behavior of dark energy, we assess the model dependence of the evidence for dynamical dark energy inferred from the DESI BAO data. While the DESI BAO data slightly tightens the constraints on model parameters and increases the tension between the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model and the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that the influence of DESI BAO data on the constraint of $w_0$ is small in the SSLCPL model. In comparison to the CPL model, the tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model is reduced for the SSLCPL model, suggesting that the evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI BAO data is dependent on cosmological models. The inclusion of spatial curvature has little impact on the results in the SSLCPL model.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and future gravitational-wave observatories rely on large-scale, precision interferometers to detect the gravitational-wave signals. However, microscopic imperfections on the test masses, known as point absorbers, cause problematic heating of the optic via absorption of the high-power laser beam, which results in diminished sensitivity, lock loss, or even permanent damage. Consistent monitoring of the test masses is crucial for detecting, characterizing, and ultimately removing point absorbers. We present a machine-learning algorithm for detecting point absorbers based on the object-detection algorithm You Only Look Once (YOLO). The algorithm can perform this task in situ while the detector is in operation. We validate our algorithm by comparing it with past reports of point absorbers identified by humans at LIGO. The algorithm confidently identifies the same point absorbers as humans with minimal false positives. It also identifies some point absorbers previously not identified by humans, which we confirm with human follow-up. We highlight the potential of machine learning in commissioning efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 If QCD axion dark matter formed post-inflation, axion miniclusters emerged from isocurvature fluctuations and later merged hierarchically into minihalos. These minihalos, potentially disrupted by stellar encounters in the Milky Way, affect axion detectability. We extend prior analyses by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This work highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have challenged the long-held opinion that the duration of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is determined by the activity epochs of the central engine. Specifically, the observations of GRB 230307A have revealed a different scenario in which the duration of the prompt emission is predominantly governed by the energy dissipation process following a brief initial energy injection from the central engine. In this paper, we explore a mechanism where the energy injection from the central engine initially causes turbulence in a small region and radiates locally. This turbulence then propagates to more distant regions and radiates. Consequently, the emission regions form concentric rings that extend outward. Using an idealized toy model, we show that such a mechanism, initiated by a pulsed energy injection, can produce a prompt emission light curve resembling a single broad pulse exhibiting the typical softer-wider/softer-later feature. Under some parameters, the main characteristics of the GRB 230307A spectra and light curves can be reproduced by the toy model.

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk-metallicity determination of giant exoplanets is essential to constrain their formation and evolution pathways and to compare them to the solar system. Previous studies inferred an inverse relation between the mass and bulk metallicity. However, the data almost exclusively contained planets that orbit FGK stars. The recent discoveries of giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars present an opportunity to probe whether they follow a mass-metallicity trend different from that of their FGK counterparts. Using evolution models we characterised the interiors of giant exoplanets with reliable mass-radius measurements that orbit FGK and M-dwarf stars. We then inferred the mass-metallicity trends for both populations. We found that the bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars is overall lower compared to those around FGK stars. This yielded mass-metallicity relations for the two populations with similar slopes but significantly different offsets. The lack of metal-rich giant planets around M dwarfs could explain the difference in the inferred offset and be a result of different formation conditions. However, there were only 20 successful bulk-metallicity retrievals for the giant planets around M dwarfs, which resulted in rather large uncertainties. Therefore, it is of great importance to continue detecting these planets with both transit and radial velocities. Additionally, the characterisation of the atmospheres of giant planets around M-stars can further help to constrain their interiors and to investigate the atmosp

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we quantitatively examine the manner pulsar wind, supernova ejecta and defunct stellar wind materials distribute and melt together into plerions. We performed 2.5D MHD simulations of the entire evolution of their stellar surroundings and different scenarios are explored, whether the star dies as a red supergiant and Wolf Rayet supernova progenitors, and whether it moved with velocity 20 km/s or 40 km/s through the ISM. Within the post explosion, early 10 kyr, the H burning products rich red supergiant wind only mixes by <= 20 per cent, due to its dense circumstellar medium filling the progenitor bow shock trail, still unaffected by the supernova blastwave. Wolf Rayet materials, enhanced in C, N, O elements, distribute circularly for the 35 Mo star moving at 20 km/s and oblongly at higher velocities, mixing efficiently up to 80 per cent. Supernova ejecta, filled with Mg, Si, Ca, Ti and Fe, remain spherical for longer times at 20 km/s but form complex patterns at higher progenitor speeds due to earlier interaction with the bow shock, in which they mix more efficiently. The pulsar wind mixing is more efficient for Wolf Rayet (25 per cent) than red supergiant progenitors (20 per cent). This work reveals that the past evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar environments critically shapes the internal distribution of chemical elements on plerionic supernova remnants, and, therefore, governs the origin of the various emission mechanisms at work therein. This is essential for interpreting multi-frequency observations of atomic and molecular spectral lines, such as in optical, infrared, and soft X rays.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2023 October-November, the blazar BL Lacertae underwent a very large-amplitude submm outburst. The usual single-zone leptonic model with the lower energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) fit by the synchrotron emission from one distribution of relativistic electrons in the jet and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of lower energy photons from the synchrotron radiation in the jet itself (synchrotron self-Compton or SSC) or those from the broad line region and torus by the same distribution of electrons cannot satisfactorily fit the broadband SED with simultaneous data at submm--optical--X-ray--GeV energies. Furthermore, simultaneous observations with IXPE indicate the X-ray polarization is undetected. We consider two different synchrotron components, one for the high flux in the submm wavelengths and another for the data at the optical band, which are supposedly due to two separate distributions of electrons. In that case, the optical emission is dominated by the synchrotron radiation from one electron distribution while the X-rays are mostly due to SSC process by another, which may result in low polarization fraction due to the IC scattering. We show that such a model can fit the broadband SED satisfactorily as well as explain the low polarization fraction at the X-rays.

 Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success across various scientific domains, motivating our exploration of their potential in solar physics. In this paper, we present Solaris, the first foundation model for forecasting the Sun's atmosphere. We leverage 13 years of full-disk, multi-wavelength solar imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, spanning a complete solar cycle, to pre-train Solaris for 12-hour interval forecasting. Solaris is built on a large-scale 3D Swin Transformer architecture with 109 million parameters. We demonstrate Solaris' ability to generalize by fine-tuning on a low-data regime using a single wavelength (1700 Å), that was not included in pre-training, outperforming models trained from scratch on this specific wavelength. Our results indicate that Solaris can effectively capture the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere and transform solar forecasting.

 Comets offer valuable insights into the early Solar System's conditions and processes. Stellar occultations enables detailed study of cometary nuclei typically hidden by their coma. Observing the star's light passing through the coma helps infer dust's optical depth near the nucleus and determine dust opacity detection limits. 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, a Centaur with a diameter of approximately 60 km, lies in a region transitioning from Centaurs to Jupiter-Family comets. Our study presents the first-ever observed occultation by 29P, allowing in the future a more refined orbit and thus better predictions for other occultations. The light curve reveals a solid-body detection lasting $3.65\pm0.05$ seconds, corresponding to a chord length of approximately 54 km. This provides a lower limit for the object's radius, measured at $27.0\pm0.7$ km. We identified features on both sides of the main-body occultation around 1,700 km from the nucleus in the sky plane for which upper limits on apparent opacity and equivalent width were determined. Gradual dimming within 23 km of the nucleus during ingress only is interpreted as a localised dust cloud/jet above the surface, with an optical depth of approximately $\tau \sim 0.18$.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin(s) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), mysterious radio bursts coming from extragalactic distances, remains unknown. Multi-wavelength observations are arguably the only way to answer this question unambiguously. We attempt to detect hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray counterparts to one of the most active FRB sources, FRB20121102, as well as improve understanding of burst properties in radio through a long-term monitoring campaign using the Nançay Radio Telescope (NRT). Multi-wavelength campaigns involving the International Gamma-ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) satellite, the Nançay Radio Observatory, the optical telescopes at the Observatoire de Haute Provence as well as Arecibo were conducted between 2017 and 2019. In 2017, the telescopes were scheduled to observe simultaneously between Sept 24-29. We specifically used the Fast Response Enhanced CCDs for the optical observations to ensure a high time resolution. In 2019, we changed the strategy to instead conduct ToO observations on INTEGRAL and other available facilities upon positive detection triggers from the NRT. In the 2017 campaign, FRB20121102 was not in its burst activity window. We obtain a 5-sigma optical flux limit of 12 mJy ms using the GASP and a 3-sigma limit from OHP T120cm R-band image of R=22.2 mag of any potential persistent emission not associated to radio bursts. In the 2019 campaign, we have simultaneous INTEGRAL data with 11 radio bursts from the NRT and Arecibo. We obtain a 5-sigma upper limit of 2.7e-7 erg/cm2 in the 25-400 keV energy range for contemporary radio and high energy bursts, and a 5-sigma upper limit of 3.8e-11 erg/cm2 for permanent emission in the 25-100 keV energy range. In addition, we report on the regular observations from NRT between 2016-2020, which accounts for 119 additional radio bursts from FRB20121102. We present an updated fit of the periodic active window of 154+/-2 days.

 This paper presents Taylor expansions for the imaging and timing characteristics of spherical optical systems with infinitesimal mirror facets, sometimes referred to as ''modified Davies-Cotton'' telescopes. Such a system comprises a discontinuous spherical mirror surface whose curvature radius is different from its focal length, and whose mirrors are aligned to suppress spherical aberration. Configurations that range between two ''optima'' are, one of which minimises tangential comatic aberration and the other that minimises timing dispersion.

 - **Abstract**
 How Supernova Remnant (SNR) shocks impact nearby molecular clouds is still poorly observationally constrained. It is unclear if SNRs can positively or negatively affect clouds star formation potential. We have studied the dense gas morphology and kinematics toward the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G034.77-00.55, shock-interacting with the SNR W44, to identify evidence of early stage star formation induced by the shock. We have used high-angular resolution N2H+(1-0) images across G034.77-00.55, obtained with ALMA. N2H+ is a well known tracer of dense and cold material, optimal to identify gas with the highest potential to harbour star formation. The N2H+ emission is distributed into two elongated structures, one toward the dense ridge at the edge of the source and one toward the inner cloud. Both elongations are spatially associated with well-defined mass-surface density features. The velocities of the gas in the two structures i.e., 38-41 km s-1 and 41-43 km s-1 are consistent with the lowest velocities of the J- and C-type parts of the SNR-driven shock, respectively. A third velocity component is present at 43-45.5 km s-1. The dense gas shows a fragmented morphology with core-like fragments of scales consistent with the Jeans lengths, masses $\sim$1-20 M$_{\odot}$, densities (n(H$_2$)$\geq$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$) sufficient to host star formation in free-fall time scales (few 10$^4$ yr) and with virial parameters that hint toward possible collapse. The W44 driven shock may have swept up the encountered material which is now seen as a dense ridge, almost detached from the main cloud, and an elongation within the inner cloud, well constrained in both N2H+ emission and mass surface density. This shock compressed material may have then fragmented into cores that are either in a starless or pre-stellar stage. Additional observations are needed to confirm this scenario and the nature of the cores.

 - **Abstract**
 In sunspot umbrae, the core of some chromospheric lines exhibits periodic brightness enhancements known as umbral flashes. The consensus is that they are produced by the upward propagation of shock waves. This view has recently been challenged by the detection of downflowing umbral flashes and the confirmation of the existence of a resonant cavity above sunspots. We aim to determine waves' propagating or standing nature in the low umbral chromosphere and confirm or refute the existence of downflowing umbral flashes. Spectroscopic temporal series of Ca II 8542 Å, Ca II H, and Halpha in a sunspot were acquired with the Swedish Solar Telescope. The Halpha velocity was inferred using bisectors. Simultaneous inversions of the Ca II 8542 Å line and the Ca II H core were performed using the NICOLE code. The nature of the oscillations and insights into the resonant oscillatory pattern were determined by analyzing the phase shift between the velocity signals and examining the temporal evolution. Propagating waves in the low chromosphere are more common in regions with frequent umbral flashes, where the transition region is shifted upward, making resonant cavity signatures less noticeable. In contrast, areas with fewer umbral flashes show velocity fluctuations that align with standing oscillations. Evidence suggests dynamic changes in the location of velocity resonant nodes due to variations in transition region height. Downflowing profiles appear at the onset of some umbral flashes, but upflowing motion dominates during most of the flash. These downflowing flashes are more common in standing umbral flashes. We confirm the existence of a chromospheric resonant cavity above sunspot umbrae produced by wave reflections at the transition region. The oscillatory pattern depends on the transition region height, which exhibits spatial and temporal variations due to the impact of the waves.

 We present a simple web-based tool, STDWeb, for a quick-look photometry and transient detection in astronomical images. It tries to implement a self-consistent and mostly automatic data analysis workflow that would work on any image uploaded to it, allowing to perform basic interactive masking, do object detection, astrometrically calibrate the image, and build the photometric solution based on a selection of catalogues and supported filters, optionally including the color term and positionally varying zero point. It also allows you to do image subtraction using either user-provided or automatically downloaded template images, and do a forced photometry for a specified target in either original or difference images, as well as transient detection with basic rejection of artefacts. The tool may be easily deployed allowing its integration into the infrastructure of robotic telescopes or data archives for effortless analysis of their images.

 In recent years, intensity interferometry has been successfully applied to the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes H.E.S.S. , MAGIC, and VERITAS. All three telescope systems have proven the feasibility and capability of this method. After our first campaign in 2022, when two of the H.E.S.S. telescopes in Namibia were equipped with our external setup and the angular diameter of two stars was measured, our setup was upgraded for a second campaign in 2023, where the goal is to perform simultaneous two colour measurements. The second campaign not only involves a third equipped telescope, but also each mechanical setup now includes two interference filters at two different wavelengths (375 nm and 470 nm) with a broader bandwidth of 10 nm. This enables having simultaneous two colour measurements, which yields information about the star's physical size at different wavelengths. This is the first time that simultaneous dual-waveband intensity interferometry measurements are performed. The angular diameter results of the 4 stars, Mimosa (beta Cru), Eta Centauri (eta Cen), Nunki (sigma Sgr) and Dschubba (delta Sco), are reported, where the effects of limb darkening are also taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether the Pre-Big Bang (PBB) scenario from string cosmology can explain the stochastic gravitational wave background signal reported in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. Using Bayesian analysis techniques, we constrain the key parameters of the PBB model by comparing its theoretical predictions with the observed data. Our analysis yields $\beta = 3.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($90\%$ credible interval) for the dilaton-dynamics parameter, which significantly exceeds the theoretically allowed range of $0 \leq \beta < 3$ at the $5\sigma$ level. Additionally, model comparison strongly favors a simple power-law spectrum over the PBB scenario, with a Bayes factor of approximately $106$. These results demonstrate that the PBB scenario, in its current formulation, cannot adequately explain the NANOGrav observations, highlighting the need for either significant modifications to the model or alternative explanations for the observed signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Water-Cherenkov-based observatories form the high-duty-cycle and wide field of view backbone for observations of the gamma-ray sky at very high energies. For gamma-ray observations, precise event reconstruction and highly effective background rejection are crucial and have been continuously improving in recent years. In this work, we propose a deep learning application based on graph neural networks (GNNs) for background rejection and energy reconstruction and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches. We find that GNNs outperform hand-designed classification algorithms and observables in background rejection and find an improved energy resolution compared to template-based methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Isolated planetary-mass objects share their mass range with planets but do not orbit a star. They lack the necessary mass to support fusion in their cores and thermally radiate their heat from formation as they cool, primarily at infrared wavelengths. Many isolated planetary-mass objects show variations in their infrared brightness consistent with non-uniform atmospheric features modulated by their rotation. SIMP J013656.5+093347.3 is a rapidly rotating isolated planetary-mass object, and previous infrared monitoring suggests complex atmospheric features rotating in and out of view. The physical nature of these features is not well understood, with clouds, temperature variations, thermochemical instabilities, and infrared-emitting aurora all proposed as contributing mechanisms. Here we report JWST time-resolved low-resolution spectroscopy from 0.8 - 11 micron of SIMP J013656.5+093347.3 which supports the presence of three specific features in the atmosphere: clouds, hot spots, and changing carbon chemistry. We show that no single mechanism can explain the variations in the time-resolved spectra. When combined with previous studies of this object indicating patchy clouds and aurorae, these measurements reveal the rich complexity of the atmosphere of SIMP J013656.5+093347.3. Gas giant planets in the solar system, specifically Jupiter and Saturn, also have multiple cloud layers and high-altitude hot spots, suggesting these phenomena are also present in worlds both within and beyond our solar-system.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the hydrodynamic solutions for expanding bubbles in cosmological first-order phase transitions going beyond local thermal equilibrium approximation. Under the assumption of a tangenosidal field profile, we supplement the matching conditions with the entropy produced due to the interaction of the bubble wall with ambient plasma. This allows us to analytically compute the corresponding fluid profiles and find bubble-wall velocity. We show that due to the entropy production, two stable solutions corresponding to a deflagration or hybrid and a detonation can coexist. Finally, we use numerical real-time simulations of bubble growth to show that in such cases it is typically the faster detonation solution which is realised. This effect can be explained in terms of the fluid profile not being fully formed into the predicted steady-state solution as the wall accelerates past this slower solution.
