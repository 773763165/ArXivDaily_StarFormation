 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes - volatile-rich exoplanets smaller than Neptune - are intrinsically the most common type of planet known. However, the formation and nature of these objects, as well as the distinctions between sub-classes (if any), remain unclear. Two powerful tools to tease out the secrets of these worlds are measurements of (i) atmospheric composition and structure revealed by transit and/or eclipse spectroscopy, and (ii) mass, radius, and density revealed by transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy. Here we present OrCAS, a survey to better elucidate the origins, compositions, and atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. This radial velocity survey uses a repeatable, quantifiable metric to select targets suitable for subsequent transmission spectroscopy and address key science themes about the atmospheric & internal compositions and architectures of these systems. Our survey targets 26 systems with transiting sub-Neptune planet candidates, with the overarching goal of increasing the sample of such planets suitable for subsequent atmospheric characterization. This paper lays out our survey's science goals, defines our target prioritization metric, and performs light-curve fits and statistical validation using existing TESS photometry and ground-based follow-up observations. Our survey serves to continue expanding the sample of small exoplanets with well-measured properties orbiting nearby bright stars, ensuring fruitful studies of these systems for many years to come.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a large extended radio jet associated with the extremely radio-loud quasar J1601+3102 at $z\sim5$ from sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the LOFAR International Telescope. These large radio lobes have been argued to remain elusive at $z>4$ due to energy losses in the synchrotron emitting plasma as a result of scattering of the strong CMB at these high redshifts. Nonetheless, the 0.3" resolution radio image of J1601+3102 reveals a Northern and Southern radio lobe located at 9 and 57 kpc from the optical quasar, respectively. The measured jet size of 66 kpc makes J1601+3102 the largest extended radio jet at $z>4$ to date. However, it is expected to have an even larger physical size in reality due to projection effects brought about by the viewing angle. Furthermore, we observe the rest-frame UV spectrum of J1601+3102 with Gemini/GNIRS to examine its black hole properties, which results in a mass of 4.5$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ with an Eddington luminosity ratio of 0.45. The BH mass is relatively low compared to the known high-$z$ quasar population, which suggests that a high BH mass is not strictly necessary to generate a powerful jet. This discovery of the first $\sim100$ kpc radio jet at $z>4$ shows that these objects exist despite energy losses from Inverse Compton scattering and can put invaluable constraints on the formation of the first radio-loud sources in the early Universe.

          Mixed origins: strong natal kicks for some black holes and none for others

 - **Abstract**
 Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.

          Critical Condition of Core-Collapse Supernovae I: One Dimensional Models

 - **Abstract**
 When the core of a massive star collapses, neutrino heating can energize the stalled accretion shock, leading to a successful supernova. The critical condition that characterizes the transition from accretion to explosion is a central topic of study and is often characterized by a critical proto-neutron star (PNS) neutrino luminosity $L_\nu^{\rm crit}$, which depends on the post-collapse mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ from the progenitor. We examine the critical condition by solving the spherically symmetric time-dependent Euler equations with a general equation of state and realistic microphysics for a range of $\dot{M}$, average neutrino energy $\left< \epsilon_{\nu}\right>$, luminosity $L_{\nu}$, PNS radius $R_{\star}$, mass $M_{\star}$, and pre-shock Mach number $\mathcal{M}$ for a fixed neutrino optical depth from the PNS surface of $2/3$. We derive $L_{\nu}^{\mathrm{crit}}$ as a function of the input parameters. We show that pressurized pre-shock flow, as parameterized by low $\mathcal{M}$, changes the normalization of the critical condition because accretion of higher entropy shells at later times after collapse leads to lower $L_{\nu}^{\mathrm{crit}}$. We connect this finding to the onset of explosion due to compositional interface accretion. Across our parameter space, we test critical conditions that have been proposed in the literature, including the ``antesonic" condition, the ``force explosion condition," and the heuristic heating-advection timescale condition. We discuss how shock oscillations impact these critical conditions. Compared to other explosion conditions, we find that the antesonic ratio shows the least variation across the model space we explore. This work is preparatory for similar experiments in 2D axisymmetry and 3D.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of applying anomaly detection algorithms to a quasar spectroscopic sub-sample from the SDSS DR16 Quasar Catalog, covering the redshift range 1.88 < z < 2.47. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for dimensionality reduction of the quasar spectra, followed by hierarchical K-Means clustering in a 20-dimensional PCA eigenvector hyperspace. To prevent broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from being identified as the primary anomaly group, we conducted the analysis with and without them, comparing both datasets for a clearer identification of other anomalous quasar types. We identified 1,888 anomalous quasars, categorized into 10 broad groups. The anomalous groups include C IV Peakers-quasars with extremely strong and narrow C IV emission lines; Excess Si IV emitters-quasars where the Si IV line is as strong as the C IV line; and Si IV Deficient anomalies, which exhibit significantly weaker Si IV emission compared to typical quasars. The anomalous nature of these quasars is attributed to lower Eddington ratios for C IV Peakers, super-solar metallicity for Excess Si IV emitters, and sub-solar metallicity for Si IV Deficient anomalies. Additionally, we identified four groups of BAL anomalies: Blue BALs, Flat BALs, Reddened BALs, and FeLoBALs, distinguished primarily by the strength of reddening in these sources. Further, among the non-BAL quasars, we identified three types of reddened anomaly groups classified as heavily reddened, moderately reddened, and plateau-shaped spectrum quasars, each exhibiting varying degrees of reddening. The detected anomalies are presented as a value-added catalog.

          Water-rich sub-Neptunes and rocky super Earths around different Stars: Radii shaped by Volatile Partitioning, Formation, and Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii has been compiled. It can be used to test the prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes by planet formation theory. We want to find out whether this water reservoir is included in photoevaporative winds and how much of it can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or complete segregation. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is best matched under the mixed assumption without water sequestration to the interior. We quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass. Fractionation is not found to significantly alter the composition of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. In contrast, water sequestration has a profound effect on the radius evolution and compositional budget of the planets. The model predicts the preservation of large quantities of water even if the gaseous envelope is lost. Planets with corresponding bulk densities are not observed in comparably large numbers. By combining formation and evolution model, we probe a parameter space favored by core accretion theory. We conclude that the dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps for comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction.

          Expanded Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (eGNILC) Framework for the 21-cm Foreground Removal

 - **Abstract**
 The Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method is a non-parametric component separation algorithm to remove the foreground contamination of the 21-cm intensity mapping data. In this work, we perform the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along the frequency axis in the expanded GNILC framework (denoted eGNILC) which helps reduce the power loss in low multipoles, and further demonstrate its performance. We also calculate the eGNILC bias to modify the criterion for determining the degrees of freedom of the foreground (dof), and embed the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in mixing matrix computation to obtain a blind component separation method. We find that the eGNILC bias is related to the averaged domain size and the dof of the foreground but not the underlying 21-cm signal. In case of no beam effect, the eGNILC bias is negligible for simple power law foregrounds outside the Galactic plane. We also examine the eGNILC performance in the SKA-MID (SKA Phase-I in mid-frequency) and BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) simulations. We show that if the adjacent frequency channels are not highly correlated, eGNILC can recover the underlying 21-cm signal with good accuracy. With the varying Airy disk beam applied to both SKA-MID and BINGO, the power spectra of 21-cm can be effectively recovered at the multipoles $\ell \in [20, 250]$ and $[20, 300]$ respectively. With no instrumental noise, the SKA-MID exhibits $\lesssim 20\%$ power loss and BINGO exhibits $\sim 10\%$ power loss. The varying Airy-disk beam only causes significant errors at large multipoles.

          Super sample covariance and the volume scaling of galaxy survey covariance matrices

 - **Abstract**
 Super sample covariance (SSC) is important when estimating covariance matrices using a set of mock catalogues for galaxy surveys. If the underlying cosmological simulations do not include the variation in background parameters appropriate for the simulation sizes, then the scatter between mocks will be missing the SSC component. The coupling between large and small modes due to non-linear structure growth makes this pernicious on small scales. We compare different methods for generating ensembles of mocks with SSC built in to the covariance, and contrast against methods where the SSC component is computed and added to the covariance separately. We find that several perturbative expansions, developed to derive background fluctuations, give similar results. We then consider scaling covariance matrices calculated for simulations of different volumes to improve the accuracy of covariance matrix estimation for a given amount of computational time. On large scales, we find that the primary limitation is from the discrete number of modes contributing to the measured power spectrum, and we propose a new method for correcting this effect. Correct implementation of SSC and the effect of discrete mode numbers allows covariance matrices created from mocks to be scaled between volumes, potentially leading to a significant saving on computational resources when producing covariance matrices. We argue that a sub-percent match is difficult to achieve because of the effects of modes on scales between the box sizes, which cannot be easily included. Even so, a 3% match is achievable on scales of interest for current surveys scaling the simulation volume by 512x, costing a small fraction of the computational time of running full-sized simulations. This is comparable to the agreement between analytic and mock-based covariance estimates to be used with DESI Y1 results.

          Partial Alignment of Astrometric Position Excursions of International Celestial Reference Frame Quasars with Radio Jet Structures

 - **Abstract**
 Published analyses of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data for the sources included in the third International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) catalog have revealed object-specific, excess astrometric variability and quasi-coherent trajectories as functions of time. A fraction of these sources show markedly elongated distributions of positions on the sky measured with diurnal observations. Here we apply a novel statistical and data-processing method to the diurnal position measurements stretching over 40 years to quantify the degree of elongation and its position angle, for each source with more than 200 data points. We find that 49\% of the examined sources have distribution elongations in excess of 1.3. Robust uncertainties of the directions of maximal astrometric dispersion are computed by the bootstrapping method, and the results are compared with a larger catalog of radio jet directions by Plavin et al. 2022. Nearly one-half of the sources with smaller position angle uncertainties are found to have astrometric position excursions from their mean positions aligned with the radio jet structures within $\pm 30\degr$.

          Revisiting the conundrum of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert. A new approach that incorporates stellar properties

 - **Abstract**
 The search for exoplanets has led to the identification of intriguing patterns in their distributions, one of which is the so-called sub-Jovian and Neptune desert. The occurrence rate of Neptunian exoplanets with an orbital period $P\lesssim 4$ days sharply decreases in this region in period-radius and period-mass space. We present a novel approach to delineating the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert by considering the incident stellar flux $F$ on the planetary surface as a key parameter instead of the traditional orbital period of the planets. Through this change of perspective, we demonstrate that the incident flux still exhibits a paucity of highly irradiated Neptunes, but also captures the proximity to the host star and the intensity of stellar radiation. Leveraging a dataset of confirmed exoplanets, we performed a systematic analysis to map the boundaries of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert in the $(F,R_p)$ and $(F,M_p)$ diagrams, with $R_p$ and $M_p$ corresponding to the planetary radius and mass, respectively. By using statistical techniques and fitting procedures, we derived analytical expressions for these boundaries that offer valuable insights into the underlying physical mechanisms governing the dearth of Neptunian planets in close proximity to their host stars. We find that the upper and lower bounds of the desert are well described by a power-law model in the $(F,R_p)$ and $(F,M_p)$ planes. We also obtain the planetary mass-radius relations for each boundary by combining the retrieved analytic expressions in the two planes. This work contributes to advancing our knowledge of exoplanet demographics and to refining theoretical models of planetary formation and evolution within the context of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert.

          Thorium in Kilonova Spectra: Exploring the Heaviest Detectable Element

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonova spectra provide us with the direct information of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. In this paper, we study the signatures of elements beyond the third r-process peak expected to be produced in neutron-rich ejecta in the photospheric spectra of kilonova. Ra II, Ac III, and Th III are our candidates because they have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, which tend to result in strong absorption features. We systematically calculate the strength of bound-bound transitions of these candidates by constructing the line list based on the available atomic database. We find that Th III is the most promising species showing strong transitions at the NIR wavelengths. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we find that Th III produces broad absorption features at ~18000 A in the spectra when the mass ratio of actinides to lanthanides is larger than the solar r-process ratio and the mass fraction of lanthanides is $\lesssim 6\times10^{-4}$. Our models demonstrate that the Th feature may be detectable if the bulk of the ejecta in the line-forming region is dominated by relatively light r-process elements with the mixture of a small fraction of very neutron-rich material. Such conditions may be realized in the mergers of unequal-mass neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries. To detect the Th absorption features, the observations from the space (such as JWST) or high-altitude sites are important as the wavelength region of the Th features is overlapped with that affected by the strong telluric absorption.

          SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200Å\,is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 \Msun\,of \Nifs\,was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.

          Comment on "Did the terrestrial planets of the Solar System form by pebble accretion?"

 - **Abstract**
 Morbidelli, Kleine & Nimmo (2024) (MKN) recently published a critical analysis on whether the terrestrial planets in the Solar System formed by rapid pebble accretion or by the classical route of multiple giant impacts between planetary embryos after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. They arrive at the conclusion that the terrestrial planets did not form by pebble accretion. Although we welcome debate on this topic, we want to emphasize here several points that we disagree on. We will not address in detail every claim made in MKN, but rather stick to four main points. Our conclusion is that pebble accretion remains a viable mechanism to drive significant growth of protoplanets in the protoplanetary disc, with as much as 70% of Earth formed by pebble accretion. This rapid growth phase must nevertheless have been followed by an extended period of collisional growth after the end of the protoplanetary disc phase, likely culminating with the moon-forming giant impact. We emphasize here an important recent result from Sharp & Olson (2023), namely that significant growth by pebble accretion can be reconciled with the Hf-W decay system even for a canonical moon-forming giant impact with a Mars-mass protoplanet - a near-equal mass impactor, as proposed in Johansen et al. (2023), is not necessary. Given that terrestrial planet formation naturally involves both pebble accretion and a combination of small and large impactors, this challenges the very notion of making an either/or distinction between the classical collision model and the pebble accretion model.

          Accretion disc dynamics in extragalactic black hole X-ray binaries: A comprehensive study of M33 X-7, NGC 300 X-1 and IC 10 X-1

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic Black Hole X-ray Binaries (BH-XRBs) are the most intriguing X-ray sources as some of them are `home' to the most massive stellar-mass BHs ever found. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of three massive, eclipsing extragalactic BH-XRBs i.e., M33X-7, NGC300X-1, and IC10X-1 and using entire X-ray observations available from \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} till date. Preliminary analysis using \textit{diskbb} and \textit{powerlaw} models shows that the sources have steep spectra and sub-Eddington luminosities (L<0.69 L$_{Edd}$), with major flux contribution from non-thermal component, resembling the relatively uncharted Steep Powerlaw State (SPL). To understand the accretion disc properties in this state, we explore alternate modelling scenario that reveals the presence of a `hot' ($kT_{in}=1-2$ keV) slim-disc (\textit{diskpbb}) with radial temperature profile $T(r)\propto r^{-p}$ ($p=0.5-0.66$), along with a cooler ($kT_{in}=0.1-0.2$ keV) standard thermal disc (\textit{diskbb}). We carry out the continuum-fitting method using relativistic slim-disc model (\textit{slimbh}) and estimate the mass range of M33 X-7, NGC300X-1 and IC10X-1 is to be 9$-$15 M$_{\odot}$, 9$-$28 M$_{\odot}$ and 10$-$30 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Further, eclipse periods are determined by modelling the lightcurve, using which we estimate the size of the eclipsing bodies. Modelling of the eclipse spectra revealed the complete obscuration of soft spectral component during eclipse, implying the emission of hard component from an extended accretion region. Based on our findings, we provide an inference on geometry of accretion disc in these wind-fed systems and compare their properties with the other two extragalactic BH-XRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring the formation and evolution of second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) and post-Red Giant Branch (post-RGB) binaries, provides valuable insights into the complex binary interaction process that concludes the red-giant phase of evolution in these systems. Additionally, it offers a novel opportunity to investigate the formation of second-generation planets within dusty discs surrounding evolved stars. We present a pilot multi-wavelength polarimetric imaging study of the post-AGB binary system IRAS 08544-4431 using the European Southern Observatory-Very Large Telescope/SPHERE instrument. This study is focused on optical V- and I'-band ZIMPOL data to complement near-infrared H-band IRDIS data presented previously. The study aims to investigate the dust scattering properties and surface morphology of the post-AGB circumbinary disc as a function of wavelength. We successfully resolved the extended disc structure of IRAS\,08544-4431, revealing a complex disc morphology, high polarimetric disc brightness (up to ~1.5%), and significant forward scattering at optical wavelengths. Additionally, we found that the disc shows a grey polarimetric colour in both optical and near-infrared. The findings highlight similarities between post-AGB circumbinary discs and protoplanetary discs, suggesting submicron-size porous aggregates as the dominant surface dust composition, and indicating potential warping within the disc. However, further expansion of the multi-wavelength analysis to a larger sample of post-AGB binary systems, as well as high-resolution observations of dust continuum and gas emission, is necessary to fully explore the underlying structure of post-AGB circumbinary discs and associated physical mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Fermi balls are non-topological solitons that can naturally form in an early universe containing a dark sector with heavy fermions and an attractive interaction mediated by a light scalar field. We compute the Fermi ball mass and radius scaling relations when the potential of the scalar field $\varphi$ has a non-negligible quartic coupling $\lambda\varphi^4$. The resulting Fermi balls reach `saturation' very rapidly, even when their radius is much smaller than the effective Yukawa force range. These objects can therefore grow by mergers or by accretion of ambient dark fermions, until they become so dense that they fall within their Schwarzschild radius and collapse to black holes. This setup, therefore, provides an example of a rather natural and economical dark sector scenario for the formation of primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the lack of experimental data on extremely neutron-rich nuclei, theoretical values derived from nuclear physics models are essential for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Metal-poor stars enriched by the $r$-process offer valuable cases for studying the impact of nuclear physics models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis. This study analyzes four widely used nuclear physics models in detail: Finite-Range Droplet Model, Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov, Duflo-Zuker, and Weizs$\ddot{\rm a}$cker-Skyrme (WS4). Theoretical values predicted by the WS4 model are found to be in good agreement with experimental data, with deviations significantly smaller than those predicted by other models. The heavy element abundances observed in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars can be accurately reproduced by $r$-process nucleosynthesis simulations using the WS4 model, particularly for the rare earth elements. This suggests that nuclear data provided by nuclear physics model like WS4 are both essential and crucial for $r$-process nucleosynthesis studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, with an inferred mass and radius of $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km, presents a great challenge for the theory of neutron stars. Within this context, we revisit the theory of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars and infer the physical properties of this compact object, such as the Fermi momentum of dark matter necessary to compress the star at such low radius, its equation of state, speed of sound, and some macroscopic properties, such as the inertia moment and the dimensionless tidal parameter. We also compare the physical properties of the XTE J1814-338 with other pulsars, such as the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$, the PSR J0740 + 6620, and the HESS J1731-347.

 - **Abstract**
 European Space Agency's Rosetta mission is the only space mission that performed long-term monitoring of comet at close distances. Its over two years' rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko revealed diverse evolutionary processes of the cometary nucleus. One of the most striking events is the migration of a 30-m boulder in the southern hemisphere region of Khonsu. Previous works found the boulder's 140-m displacement occurred during the three months from August to October 2015, and several triggering mechanisms were proposed, including outburst at the boulder site, seismic vibrations from nearby activities, or surface erosion of the slope beneath the boulder. In this work, we further analyze this impressive event by analysing imaging data from Rosetta's OSIRIS camera. We constrained the boulder's migration time to within 14 hours and derived a detailed timeline of the boulder migration event and local dust activities. High-resolution thermophysical modelling shows significant dichotomy in the thermal history of the boulder's southern and northern sides, which could have triggered or facilitated its migration via its own volatile activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern radio telescopes generate large amounts of data, with the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) expected to feed up to 292 GB of visibilities per second to the science data processor (SDP). However, the continued exponential growth in the power of the world's largest supercomputers suggests that for the foreseeable future there will be sufficient capacity available to provide for astronomers' needs in processing 'science ready' products from the new generation of telescopes, with commercial platforms becoming an option for overflow capacity. The purpose of the current work is to trial the use of commercial high performance computing (HPC) for a large scale processing task in astronomy, in this case processing data from the GASKAP-HI pilot surveys. We delineate a four-step process which can be followed by other researchers wishing to port an existing workflow from a public facility to a commercial provider. We used the process to provide reference images for an ongoing upgrade to ASKAPSoft (the ASKAP SDP software), and to provide science images for the GASKAP collaboration, using the joint deconvolution capability of WSClean. We document the approach to optimising the pipeline to minimise cost and elapsed time at the commercial provider, and give a resource estimate for processing future full survey data. Finally we document advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned from the project, which will aid other researchers aiming to use commercial supercomputing for radio astronomy imaging. We found the key advantage to be immediate access and high availability, and the main disadvantage to be the need for improved HPC knowledge to take best advantage of the facility.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.

 - **Abstract**
 In the detection of gravitational waves in space, during the science phase of the mission, the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) serves to steer a laser beam to compensate for the angle generated by the relative motion of the two spacecrafts (SCs) during the approximately 10 seconds of flight time a laser beam will take from one SC to reach a distant SC of three million kilometers away. The common practice for pointing stability control of a laser beam is to first do a coarse tracking by the PAAM to steer a laser beam to compensate for the relative motion between two SCs, to be followed by a fine pointing stability control. In the present work, by exploiting the near-circular orbit structure of individual SC in the triangular constellation, the feasibility of inserting an adaptive Kalman filter (AEKF) into the PAAM control loop is investigated. By adopting a colored measurement noise model that closely resembles the prospective on orbit situation, numerical simulation suggests that the dynamic range of the PAAM may be reduced to the level of nano-radians using the prediction of the pointing head angle (PAA) by the AEKF. This will cut down on the TTL coupling noise and the position noise budget allocated to the PAAM. This in turn reduces the dynamic range of the fine pointing control and leaves room to improve its accuracy, thereby offers the prospect of reduction of the position noise budget allocated to the laser pointing instability as a whole.

 We continue to study the structure and kinematics of HH flows. Herbig-Haro (HH) flows exhibit large variety of morphological and kinematical structures. Both proper motion (PM) and radial velocity investigations are essential to understand the physical nature of such structures. We investigate the kinematics and PM of spectrally separated structures in the PV Cep HH flow HH 215. We present the observational results obtained with a 6 m telescope (Russia) using the SCORPIO multi-mode focal reducer with scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the PV Cep region in H$\alpha$ and [SII] emission (2003 and 2020-2021) allowed us to study the morphology of HH 215 jet in detail and to measure the PM and the radial velocities for its inner structures. Already known emission knots in the HH 215 flow and new features were studied. Moreover, a newly-formed HH knot was revealed, presumably formed during the large maximum of PV Cep star in 1976-1977. We found the high-velocity inner channel in the HH 215 ionized outflow, oriented accordingly to the mean direction of the whole HH outflow and the axis of the symmetry of the reflection nebula. The HH-knots located along the axis of the high-velocity channel have a position angle coinciding with its axis (abut 325$^{\circ}$), however other ones have completely different value (about 25$^{\circ}$), which supports the idea that those knots are formed by oblique shocks. We derived the value of i $\approx$ 30$^{\circ}$$\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$ for the inclination angle between the flow axis and the line of sight. The total length of HH 215 outflow should be about 0.2 pc, and the full length of the bipolar outflow from PV Cep (HH 315 + HH 215) can be estimated as 3.6 pc, assuming that it more or less keeps the same inclination angle.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the processes within compact stars hinges on astrophysical observations. A recent study reported on the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20} \ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.40_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ \rm{km}$, making it the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest that neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of about $1.17M_{\odot}$, raising the question: is this object a typical neutron star, or could it be our first encounter with an "exotic" star? To explore this, we employ the Color-Flavored Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), aiming to constrain it by integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 event with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we model hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, incorporating phase transitions via Maxwell construction. Our analysis indicates that CFL quark matter adequately explains all measurements, including the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. In contrast, hybrid models featuring CFL quark phases fail to account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a hybrid numerical scheme for the fuzzy dark matter model: It combines a wave-based approach to solve the Schrödinger equation using Fourier continuations with Gram polynomials and a fluid-based approach to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations. This hybrid scheme facilitates zoom-in simulations for cosmological volumes beyond the capabilities of wave-based solvers alone and accurately simulates the full nonlinear dynamics of fuzzy dark matter. We detail the implementation of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung solver, the methodology for phase matching at fluid-wave boundaries, the development of a local pseudospectral wave solver based on Fourier continuations, new grid refinement criteria for both fluid and wave solvers, an interpolation algorithm based on Fourier continuations, and the integration of these building blocks into the adaptive mesh refinement code GAMER. The superiority of the scheme is demonstrated through various performance and accuracy tests, tracking the linear power spectrum evolution in a 10 Mpc/h box, and a hybrid cosmological simulation in a 5.6 Mpc/h box. The corresponding code is published as part of the GAMER project on this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the results of X-ray observations (XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL and Swift) of two hard X-ray sources, IGR J17503-2636 and IGR J17507-2647, whose nature is not fully elucidated in the literature. Three XMM-Newton observations covered the field of IGR J17503-2636, in 2020 and twice in 2023. The analysis of the two XMM-Newton observations performed in September 2023, six days apart, did not detect IGR J17503-2636, allowing us to pose the most stringent 3sigma upper limit on the source flux to date (~9.5x10^-14 erg/cm2/s, 2-10 keV, flux corrected for absorption). This value implies that the amplitude of the X-ray flux variability exceeds a factor of ~2100, compared with the discovery outburst in 2018. A candidate X-ray periodicity at 0.335397(3) seconds has been barely detected (significance of about 3.8sigma) from IGR J17503-2636 with XMM-Newton (pulsed fraction of (10+/-1) per cent). The new data, put into the context of previous literature, allow us to propose a new classification of IGR J17503-2636 as a symbiotic X-ray binary, rather than a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient. IGR J17507-2647 was formerly reported below 10 keV only during Chandra observations performed in 2009. We report here on two XMM-Newton observations that serendipitously covered the source field in 2020 and in 2023, finding a stable X-ray emission, both in X-ray flux and spectral shape. The long-term, persistent X-ray emission has also been probed by several Swift/XRT short observations and by INTEGRAL data spanning several years. We have detected an iron line in the emission (with centroid energy in the range of 6.3-6.6 keV), never reported before in the IGR J17507-2647 spectrum. The source properties favor the identification with a cataclysmic variable.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability criteria of rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental in binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of many important systems, such as X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, and merging gravitational-wave sources. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We built the adiabatic mass-loss model and systematically surveyed the thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of possible donor star evolutionary states. Many studies indicate that new mass transfer stability thresholds play an essential role in the formation and properties of double compact object populations and the progenitors of SNe Ia and detectable GW sources. For example, our studies show that the mass transfer in the red giant and the asymptotic giant branch stars and the massive stars can be more stable than previously believed. Consequently, detailed binary population synthesis studies, using updated unstable mass transfer criteria, predicate the non-conservative stable mass transfer may dominate the formation channel of double stellar-mass black holes and can explain the population of the large mass ratio double stellar-mass black holes. Using our updated mass transfer thresholds, binary population thesis studies by Li et al. show that Ge et al.'s results support the observational double white dwarfs merger rate distribution per Galaxy and the space density of double white dwarfs in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) is a first-generation instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Europe's next-generation 39 m ground-based telescope for optical and infrared wavelengths. METIS will offer diffraction-limited imaging, low- and medium-resolution slit spectroscopy, and coronagraphy for high-contrast imaging between 3 and 13 microns, as well as high-resolution integral field spectroscopy between 3 and 5 microns. The main METIS science goals are the detection and characterisation of exoplanets, the investigation of proto-planetary disks, and the formation of planets. The Single-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) system corrects atmospheric distortions and is thus essential for diffraction-limited observations with METIS. Numerous challenging aspects of an ELT Adaptive Optics (AO) system are addressed in the mature designs for the SCAO control system and the SCAO hardware module: the complex interaction with the telescope entities that participate in the AO control, wavefront reconstruction with a fragmented and moving pupil, secondary control tasks to deal with differential image motion, non-common path aberrations and mis-registration. A K-band pyramid wavefront sensor and a GPU-based Real-Time Computer (RTC), tailored to the needs of METIS at the ELT, are core components. This current paper serves as a natural sequel to our previous work presented in Hippler et al. (2018). It includes updated performance estimations in terms of several key performance indicators, including achieved contrast curves. We outline all important design decisions that were taken, and present the major challenges we faced and the main analyses carried out to arrive at these decisions and eventually the final design. We also elaborate on our testing and verification strategy, and, last not least, comprehensively present the full design, hardware and software.

 - **Abstract**
 In an ongoing effort to understand planet formation the link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of resulting planets have long been a subject of interest. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-massed planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small, co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $\sim 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulfur carrying ices: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and H$_2$S are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species like CS, SO, and SO$_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, CS, and H$_2$CS in our model and find that their values are consistent with previous observational studies.

          The unreasonable effectiveness of the $n \Sigma v$ approximation

 - **Abstract**
 In kinetic theory, the classic $n \Sigma v$ approach calculates the rate of particle interactions from local quantities: the number density of particles $n$, the cross-section $\Sigma$, and the average relative speed $v$. In stellar dynamics, this formula is often applied to problems in collisional (i.e. dense) environments such as globular and nuclear star clusters, where blue stragglers, tidal capture binaries, binary ionizations, and micro-tidal disruptions arise from rare close encounters. The local $n \Sigma v$ approach implicitly assumes the ergodic hypothesis, which is not well motivated for the densest star systems in the Universe. In the centers of globular and nuclear star clusters, orbits close into 1D ellipses because of the degeneracy of the potential (either Keplerian or harmonic). We find that the interaction rate in perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potentials is determined by a global quantity -- the number of orbital intersections -- and that this rate can be far lower or higher than the ergodic $n \Sigma v$ estimate. However, we find that in most astrophysical systems, deviations from a perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potential (due to e.g. granularity or extended mass) trigger sufficient orbital precession to recover the $n \Sigma v$ interaction rate. Astrophysically relevant failures of the $n \Sigma v$ approach only seem to occur for tightly bound stars orbiting intermediate-mass black holes, or for the high-mass end of collisional cascades in certain debris disks.

          Kinetic Field Theory Applied to Planetesimal Formation I: Freely Streaming Dust Particles

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation in the solar system was started when the first planetesimals were formed from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. Numerical simulations of this process, especially in the framework of streaming instability, produce various power laws for the initial mass function for planetesimals. While recent advances have shed light on turbulence and its role in particle clustering, a comprehensive theoretical framework linking turbulence characteristics to particle cluster properties and planetesimal mass function remains incomplete. Recently, a kinetic field theory for ensembles of point-like classical particles in or out of equilibrium has been applied to cosmic structure formation. This theory encodes the dynamics of a classical particle ensemble by a generating functional specified by the initial probability distribution of particles in phase space and their equations of motion. Here, we apply kinetic field theory to planetesimal formation. A model for the initial probability distribution of dust particles in phase space is obtained from a quasi-initial state for a three-dimensional streaming-instability simulation that is a particle distribution with velocities for gas and particles from the Nakagawa relations. The equations of motion are chosen for the simplest case of freely streaming particles. We calculate the non-linearly evolved density power spectrum of dust particles and find that it develops a universal $k^{-3}$ tail at small scales, suggesting scale-invariant structure formation below a characteristic and time-dependent length scale. Thus, the KFT analysis indicates that the initial state for streaming instability simulations does not impose a constraint on structure evolution during planetesimal formation.

 The results of the analysis of 205 brightest sources ( $S>15$ mJy), which were found in the sky survey at the declination of the pulsar in the Crab Nebula, are presented. The survey was conducted at a frequency of 4.7~GHz using a three-beam radiometer complex installed in the focus of the Western Sector of the RATAN-600 radio telescope in 2018-2019. Based on the measurements and data collected in the database of astrophysical catalogs CATS built radio spectra of objects. For a quarter of all detected sources, data at a frequency higher than 4~GHz were obtained for the first time, and for the rest, they were appended. The variability of radiation sources on the scales of the year, from days to months, was studied. The greatest change in the radio flux was found in the blazar B2~1324+22. The search for daily variability was carried out for 26 the brightest sources with an average value of $S_{4.7} \sim 250$ mJy. All sources are identified with objects from optical and infrared catalogs. Radio luminosity is calculated for 112 objects with a known redshift.

          Dimming events of evolved stars due to clouds of molecular gas. Scenarios based on 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD

 - **Abstract**
 The dramatic dimming episode of the red supergiant Betelgeuse in 2019/2020, caused by a partial darkening of the stellar disk, has highlighted gaps in the understanding of the evolution of massive stars. We analyzed numerical models to investigate the processes behind the formation of dark surface patches and the associated reduction in the disk-integrated stellar light. With the CO5BOLD code, we performed global 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of evolved stars, including convection in the stellar interior, self-excited pulsations, and the resulting atmospheric dynamics with strong radiative shocks. We attribute dimming phenomena to obscuring clouds of cool gas in the lower atmosphere, forming according to three different scenarios. One process transports material outward in a strong shock, similar to what occurs in 1D simulations of radially pulsating AGB stars. Another mechanism is triggered by a large convective upflow structure, in combination with exceptionally strong radial pulsations. This induces Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, causing plumes of material to be sent outward into the atmosphere. The third and rarest scenario involves large-amplitude convective fluctuations, leading to enhanced flows in deep downdrafts, which rebound and send material outward. In all cases, the dense gas above the stellar surface cools and darkens rapidly in visible light. AGB stars show localized dark patches regularly during intermediate phases of their large-amplitude pulsations, while more massive stars will only intermittently form such patches during luminosity minima. The episodic levitation of dense gas clumps above the stellar surface, followed by the formation of complex molecules in the cooling gas and possibly dust grains at a later stage, can account for the dark patches and strong dimming events of supergiant stars such as Betelgeuse.

 - **Abstract**
 The helium abundances in the multiple populations that are now known to comprise all closely studied Milky Way globular clusters are often inferred by fitting isochrones generated from stellar evolutionary models to globular cluster photometry. It is therefore important to build stellar models that are chemically self-consistent in terms of their structure, atmosphere, and opacity. In this work we present the first chemically self-consistent stellar models of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 2808 using MARCS model atmospheres, OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities, and AESOPUS low-temperature radiative opacities. These stellar models were fit to the NGC 2808 photometry using Fidanka , a new software tool that was developed to optimally fit cluster photometry to isochrones and for population synthesis. Fidanka can determine, in a relatively unbiased way, the ideal number of distinct populations that exist within a dataset and then fit isochrones to each population. We achieve this outcome through a combination of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Modeling and a novel number density estimation algorithm. Using Fidanka and F275W-F814W photometry from the Hubble UV Globular Cluster Survey we find that the helium abundance of the second generation of stars in NGC 2808 is higher than the first generation by $15\pm3\%$. This is in agreement with previous studies of NGC 2808. This work, along with previous work by Dotter et al. (2015) focused on NGC 6752, demonstrates that chemically self-consistent models of globular clusters do not significantly alter inferred helium abundances, and are therefore unlikely to be worth the significant additional time investment.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the large-scale clustering of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Quasar (QSO) sample from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In particular, we constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) parameter $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ via the large-scale scale-dependent bias in the power spectrum using $1,631,716$ LRGs ($0.6 < z < 1.1$) and $1,189,129$ QSOs ($0.8 < z < 3.1$). This new measurement takes advantage of the enormous statistical power at large scales of DESI DR1 data, surpassing the latest data release (DR16) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). For the first time in this kind of analysis, we use a blinding procedure to mitigate the risk of confirmation bias in our results. We improve the model of the radial integral constraint proposing an innovative correction of the window function. We also carefully test the mitigation of the dependence of the target selection on the photometry qualities by incorporating an angular integral constraint contribution to the window function, and validate our methodology with the blinded data. Finally, combining the two samples, we measure $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = {-3.6}_{-9.1}^{+9.0}$ at $68\%$ confidence, where we assume the universality relation for the LRG sample and a recent merger model for the QSO sample about the response of bias to primordial non-Gaussianity. Adopting the universality relation for the PNG bias in the QSO analysis leads to $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = 3.5_{-7.4}^{+10.7}$ at $68\%$ confidence. This measurement is the most precise determination of primordial non-Gaussianity using large-scale structure to date, surpassing the latest result from eBOSS by a factor of $2.3$.

          Validating the Orbital Periods of the Coolest TESS Exoplanet Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the resulting eclipse causes an observable decrease in stellar flux, and when multiple such transits are detected, the orbital period of the exoplanet can be determined. Over the past six years, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered thousands of potential planets by this method, mostly with short orbital periods, although some have longer reported values over one hundred days. These long orbital periods, however, are note easy to confirm due to frequent lengthy data gaps. Here we show that while the majority of these long period candidates likely have periods much shorter than reported, there are a sizable number of TESS candidates with true long periods. These candidates generally only have two reported transits, but the periods of duo-transits like this, and even candidates with three or more transits, can be confirmed if the data rules out all possible shorter period aliases. Using TESS data, we confirm long orbital periods for nine candidate planets, and present five others that are likely long period. Due to their long periods, these planets will have relatively cool equilibrium temperatures, and may be more likely to host exomoons or rings. We present these TOIs, along with a variety of small corrections to other TESS orbital periods and three planet candidates with possible transit timing variations, with the goal of refining the TESS data set and enabling future research with respect to cool transiting planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (>100 parsecs) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 \texttt{PSpectCosmo} is a high-performance \texttt{C++} program developed to investigate early-universe cosmological dynamics, with a specific emphasis on the inflationary epoch. Utilizing a Fourier-space pseudo-spectral method, \texttt{PSpectCosmo} enables the precise evolution of interacting scalar fields and gravitational waves, ensuring accurate representation of the power spectrum during inflation. This approach overcomes key limitations of finite difference methods, particularly in maintaining consistency between effective and lattice wave vectors. The code employs the adaptive step size velocity-Verlet algorithm for time integration, offering a balance of numerical stability and high precision. Additionally, \texttt{PSpectCosmo} incorporates a robust mechanism to compute convergent energy density, effectively resolving the issue of divergent energy density at the onset of inflation. These capabilities establish \texttt{PSpectCosmo} as a reliable and versatile tool for probing non-linear cosmological phenomena and inflationary dynamics with exceptional accuracy. The code is publicly available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

          Tungsten isotope evolution during Earth's formation and new constraints on the viability of accretion simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The Hf-W isotopic system is the reference chronometer for determining the chronology of Earth's accretion and differentiation. However, its results depend strongly on uncertain parameters, including the extent of metal-silicate equilibration and the siderophility of tungsten. Here we show that a multistage core-formation model based on N-body accretion simulations, element mass balance and metal-silicate partitioning, largely eliminates these uncertainties. We modified the original model of Rubie et al. (2015) by including (1) smoothed particle hydrodynamics estimates of the depth of melting caused by giant impacts and (2) the isotopic evolution of 182W. We applied two metal-silicate fractionation mechanisms: one when the metal delivered by the cores of large impactors equilibrates with only a small fraction of the impact-induced magma pond and the other when metal delivered by small impactors emulsifies in global magma oceans before undergoing progressive segregation. The latter is crucial for fitting the W abundance and 182W anomaly of Earth's mantle. In addition, we show, for the first time, that the duration of magma ocean solidification has a major effect on Earth's tungsten isotope anomaly. We re-evaluate the six Grand Tack N-body simulations of Rubie et al. (2015). Only one reproduces epsilon182W=1.9+/-0.1 of Earth's mantle, otherwise accretion is either too fast or too slow. Depending on the characteristics of the giant impacts, results predict that the Moon formed either 143-183 Myr or 53-62 Myr after the start of the solar system. Thus, independent evaluations of the Moon's age provide an additional constraint on the validity of accretion simulations.
