#### Title:
          Cross-correlating the patchy screening and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects as a new probe of reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) and patchy screening effect are two complementary cosmic microwave background (CMB) probes of the reionization era. The kSZ effect is a relatively strong signal, but is difficult to disentangle from other sources of temperature anisotropy, whereas patchy screening is weaker but can be reconstructed using the cleaner polarization channel. Here, we explore the potential of using upcoming CMB surveys to correlate a reconstructed map of patchy screening with (the square of) the kSZ map, and what a detection of this cross-correlation would mean for reionization science. To do this, we use simulations and theory to quantify the contributions to this signal from different redshifts. We then use the expected survey properties for CMB-S4 and CMB-HD to make detection forecasts before exploring how the signal depends on reionization parameters. We forecast that CMB-S4 will obtain a hint of this signal at up to 1.8$\sigma$ and CMB-HD will detect it at up to 14$\sigma$. We find that this signal contains unique information about the timing and morphology of reionization, particularly sensitivity to the first half of reionization and to the bispectrum of the ionized gas distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at $z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $\sim2$ Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z\sim10$. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative $\sim2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, $\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}$, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.

          The coexistence of the streaming instability and the vertical shear instability in protoplanetary disks: Scale-dependence of dust diffusion

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical shear instability and the streaming instability are two robust sources of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. The former has been found to induce anisotropic turbulence that is stronger in the vertical than in the radial dimension and to be overall stronger compared to the largely isotropic turbulence caused by the streaming instability. In this study, we shed light on the dust diffusion by the vertical shear instability and the streaming instability separately and together, and in particular on the direction- and scale-dependence of the diffusion. To this end, we employ two-dimensional global models of the two instabilities either in isolation or in combination. The vertical shear instability in isolation diffuses dust more strongly in the vertical direction than the streaming instability in isolation, resulting in a wave-shaped dust layer in our two-dimensional simulations. Compared with this large-scale diffusion, though, our study highlights that the vertical shear instability causes substantially weaker or even negligible small-scale diffusion. We validate this result using previously published three-dimensional simulations. In particular when simulating centimetre-sized dust, the undulating dust layer becomes internally razor-thin. In contrast, the diffusion owing to the streaming instability exhibits only a marginal scale-dependence, with the dust layer possessing a Gaussian shape. In models including both instabilities, the undulating mid-plane layer is broadened to a width set by the intrinsic diffusion level caused by the streaming instability.

 - **Abstract**
 With enough X-ray flux to be detected in a 160s scan by SRG/eROSITA, the $z = 6.19$ quasar CFHQS J142952+544717 is, by far, the most luminous X-ray source known at $z > 6$. We present deep (245 ks) NuSTAR observations of this source; with $\sim180$ net counts in the combined observations, CFHQS J142952+544717 is the most distant object ever observed by the observatory. Fortuitously, this source was independently observed by Chandra $\sim110$ days earlier, enabling the identification of two nearby (30'' and 45'' away), fainter X-ray sources. We jointly fit both Chandra and NuSTAR observations--self-consistently including interloper sources--and find that, to greater than 90% confidence, the observed 3-7 keV flux varied by a factor of $\sim2.6$ during that period, corresponding to approximately two weeks in the quasar rest-frame. This brightening is one the most extreme instances of statistically significant X-ray variability seen in the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss possible scenarios that could produce such rapid change, including X-ray emission from jets too faint at radio frequencies to be observed.

          Numerical and Physical Challenges to Nebular Spectroscopy in Thermonuclear Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Thermodynamical explosions of White Dwarfs (WD)are one of the keys to high precision cosmology. Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are an effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion physics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for simulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light curves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light is emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and low-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical equilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and gamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy photons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on the proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The low-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a mostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a quasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several years after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the over-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The requirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar atmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code (HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are demonstrated using observations as a benchmark. At some examples, we establish the power of high-precision nebular spectroscopy as quantitative tool. Centrally ignited, off-center delayed-detonation near Chandrasekhar-mass models can reproduce line-ratios and line profiles of Branch-normal and underluminous SNe Ia observed with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations collected over the last decades have revealed a strongly variable X-ray signal within the Milky Way's Galactic center, interpreted as X-ray echoes from its supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These echoes are traced by the strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV of which its intensity is proportional to the density of the illuminated molecular gas. Over time, the echo scans through molecular clouds (MCs) in our Galactic center, revealing their 3D structure and highlighting their densest parts. While previous studies have utilized spectral line doppler shifts along with kinematic models to constrain the geometry of the CMZ or to study the structure of individual clouds, these methods have limitations, particularly in the turbulent region of the CMZ. We use archival Chandra X-ray data to construct one of the first 3D representations of one prominent MC, the Stone Cloud, located at (l = 0.068°, b = -0.076°) at a distance of ~20pc from Sgr A* in projection. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we followed the X-ray echo in this cloud from 2008 to 2017. We combine this data with 1.3 mm dust continuum emission observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Herschel Space Observatory to re-construct the 3D structure of the cloud and estimate the column densities for each year's observed slice. The analysis of the X-ray echoes along with velocities from SMA molecular line data indicate that the structure of the Stone cloud can be described as a very diffuse background with multiple dense clumps throughout.

 - **Abstract**
 PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Using optical and near-infrared images of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant covering the time period 1951 to 2022, together with optical spectra of selected filaments, we present an investigation of Cas A's reverse shock velocity and the effects it has on the remnant's metal-rich ejecta. We find the sequence of optical ejecta brightening and the appearance of new optical ejecta indicating the advancement of the remnant's reverse shock in the remnant's main shell has velocities typically between 1000 and 2000 km/s, which is ~1000 km/s less than recent measurements made in X-rays. We further find the reverse shock appears to move much more slowly and is nearly even stationary in the sky frame along the remnant's western limb. However, we do not find the reverse shock to move inward at velocities as large as ~2000 km/s as has been reported. Optical ejecta in Cas A's main emission shell have proper motions indicating outward tangential motions ~3500 - 6000 km/s, with the smaller values preferentially along the remnant's southern regions which we speculate may be partially the cause of the remnant's faint and more slowly evolving southern sections. Following interaction with the reverse shock, ejecta knots exhibit extended mass ablated trails 0.2" - 0.5" in length leading to extended emission indicating reverse shock induced decelerated velocities as large as 1000 km/s. Such ablated material is most prominently seen in higher ionization line emissions, whereas denser parts of ejecta knots show surprisingly little deceleration.

          Towards a self-consistent hydrodynamical model of the solar tachocline

 - **Abstract**
 The solar tachocline is an internal boundary layer in the Sun located between the differentially-rotating convection zone and the uniformly-rotating radiative interior beneath. Spiegel and Zahn (1992) proposed the first hydrodynamical model, which here we call SZ92, arguing that the tachocline is essentially in a steady state of thermal-wind balance, angular-momentum balance, and thermal equilibrium. Angular momentum transport in their model is assumed to be dominated by strongly anisotropic turbulence, primarily horizontal owing to the strong stable stratification of the radiative interior. By contrast, the heat transport is assumed to be dominated by a predominantly vertical diffusive heat flux owing to the thinness of the tachocline. In this paper, we demonstrate that these assumptions are not consistent with the new model of stratified turbulence recently proposed by Chini et al. (2022) and Shah et al. (2024), which has been numerically validated by Garaud et al. (2024). We then propose a simple self-consistent alternative to the SZ92 model, namely, a scenario wherein angular momentum and heat transport are both dominated by horizontal turbulent diffusion. The thickness of the tachocline in the new model scales as $\Omega_\odot / N_m$, where $\Omega_\odot$ is the mean angular velocity of the Sun, and $N_m$ the buoyancy frequency in the tachocline region. We discuss other properties of the model, and show that it has several desirable features, but does not resolve some of the other well-known problems of the SZ92 model.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers have used observations of the Galactic gas and dust via infrared, microwave, and radio to study molecular clouds in extreme environments such as the Galactic center. More recently, X- ray telescopes have opened up a new wavelength range in which to study these molecular clouds. Previous flaring events from SgrA* propagate X-rays outwards in all directions, and these X-rays interact with the surrounding molecular gas, illuminating different parts of the clouds over time. We use a combination of X-ray observations from Chandra and molecular gas tracers (line data from Herschel and the Submillimeter Array) to analyze specific features in the Sticks cloud, one of three clouds in the Three Little Pigs system in the Central Molecular Zone (Galactic longitude and latitude of 0.106 and -0.082 degrees respectively). We also present a novel X-ray tomography method we used to create 3-D map of the Sticks cloud. By combining X-ray and molecular tracer observations, we are able to learn more about the environment inside the Sticks cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in binary systems are precise laboratories for tests of gravity and the physics of dense matter. Their orbits can show relativistic effects that provide a measurement of the neutron star mass and the pulsars are included in timing array experiments that search for gravitational waves. Neutron star mass measurements are key to eventually solving the neutron star equation of state and these can be obtained by a measure of the Shapiro delay if the orbit is viewed near edge-on. Here we report on the timing and noise analysis of five MSPs observed with the MeerKAT radio telescope: PSRs J0900$-$3144, J0921$-$5202, J1216$-$6410, J1327$-$0755 and J1543$-$5149. We searched for the Shapiro delay in all of the pulsars and obtain weak detections for PSRs J0900$-$3144, J1216$-$6410, and J1327$-$0755. We report a higher significance detection of the Shapiro delay for PSR J1543$-$5149, giving a precise pulsar mass of $M_{\rm p} = 1.349^{+0.043}_{-0.061}\,$M$_\odot$ and companion white-dwarf mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.223^{+0.005}_{-0.007}\,$M$_\odot$. This is an atypically low mass measurement for a recycled MSP. In addition to these Shapiro delays, we also obtain timing model parameters including proper motions and parallax constraints for most of the pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of both multi-messenger and time-domain astrophysics over the last decade has seen a large interest in the development of small-scale, cheap, and robust gamma-ray detectors. This has been further encouraged by the availability of CubeSat platforms. Of particular interest are detectors capable of producing spectral and localization measurements of X and gamma-ray transients to allow for accurate follow-up measurements at different wavelengths. A vast number of the instruments developed for such purposes in the last years use a combination of scintillators and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) for photon detection. Here, we present the design, performance, and space qualification of a readout system capable of reading out 64 SiPM channels. This low-power and low-cost system was originally designed for the POLAR-2 mission, a large scale gamma-ray polarimeter. However, its flexible design makes it equally suitable for use on various CubeSat missions. The system was found to perform well when reading out both plastic and high Z scintillators using a total of 1.8~W. The space qualified design furthermore relies on commercial off-the-shelf components, thereby also removing most international export issues. In this paper, we will present the overall design, the performance of the electronics, its performance when reading out various scintillators and the successful space-qualification of this design.

          Using the Kaniadakis horizon entropy in the presence of neutrinos to alleviate the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ Tensions

 - **Abstract**
 The $H_{0}$ tension stands as a prominent challenge in cosmology, serving as a primary driver for exploring alternative models of dark energy. Another tension arises from measurements of the $ S_{8} $ parameter, which is characterize the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe. In this study, we address the alleviation of both the Hubble tension and $ S_{8} $ tension by incorporating Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We investigate two scenarios to explore the impact of this entropy on cosmological parameters. In the first scenario, utilizing modified Friedmann equations through Kaniadakis entropy, we estimate the values of $H_{0}$ and $ S_{8} $. In the subsequent scenario, we introduce the neutrino term and assess its effect on mitigating the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Our findings reveal that when considering the first scenario, the results closely align with Planck's 2018 outcomes for Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Moreover, with the inclusion of neutrinos, these tensions are alleviated to approximately 2$\sigma$, and the $ S_{8} $ value is in full agreement with the results from the KiDS and DES survey. Furthermore, we impose a constraint on the parameter $K$ in each scenario. Our analysis yields $K = 0.12\pm 0.41$ for Kaniadakis entropy without neutrinos and $K = 0.39\pm 0.4$ for the combined dataset considering Kaniadakis entropy in the presence of neutrinos. We demonstrate that the value of K may be affected by neutrino mass, which can cause energy transfer between different parts of the universe and alter the Hubble parameter value.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.

          High-Contrast Imaging: Hide and Seek with Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 So far, most of the about 5700 exoplanets have been discovered mainly with radial velocity and transit methods. These techniques are sensitive to planets in close orbits, not being able to probe large star--planet separations. $\mu$-lensing is the indirect method that allows us to probe the planetary systems at the snow-line and beyond, but it is not a repeatable observation. On the contrary, direct imaging (DI) allows for the detection and characterization of low mass companions at wide separation (\mbox{$\leq$ 5--6 au}). The main challenge of DI is that a typical planet--star contrast ranges from $10^{-6}$, for a young Jupiter in emitted light, to $10^{-9}$ for Earth in reflected light. In the last two decades, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to combining large (D $\geq$ 5 m) telescopes (to reduce the impact of diffraction) with coronagraphs and high-order adaptive optics (to correct phase errors induced by atmospheric turbulence), with sophisticated image post-processing, to reach such a contrast between the star and the planet in order to detect and characterize cooler and closer companions to nearby stars. Building on the first pioneering instrumentation, the second generation of high-contrast imagers, SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO, allowed us to probe hundreds of stars (e.g., 500--600 stars using SHINE and GPIES), contributing to a better understanding of the demography and the occurrence of planetary systems. The DI offers a possible clear vision for studying the formation and physical properties of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs, and the future DI (space and ground-based) instruments with deeper detection limits will enhance this vision. In this paper, we briefly review the methods, the instruments, the main sample of targeted stars, the remarkable results, and the perspective of this rising technique.

          Easy remote observations using web interfaces: controlling an Italian telescope from Japan, and more

 - **Abstract**
 Remote observations are often limited by user interfaces, which seem frozen to another computer era: low performances, outdated programming languages, command-line scripting, high version-dependent software. Instead, web-based tools are standard: using nothing more than a browser, astronomers can interact with a generic observatory in a native cross-platform, remote-born way. We used this approach while advancing in the remotization of the 1m-class OARPAF telescope, located in Northern Italy. The web-based control software provides easy and integrated management of its components. This solution can be exported not only to similar hardware/software facilities, but also to large instruments such as SHARK-NIR at LBT; not only for single operations, but also for procedure scripting. In this contribution we describe our best practices and present two recent, orthogonal use cases: an in-place professional use for exoplanetary transit follow-ups, and the first remote control of the telescope from a Japanese high school, allowing students to independently observe, in their daytime, globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of SHARK-NIR (System for coronagraphy with High Order adaptive optics in Z and H band), we present the development of SHINS, the SHARK-NIR INstrument control Software, in particular focusing on the changes introduced during the Assembly, Integration, and Test (AIT) phase. SHARK-NIR observing sessions will be carried out with "ESO-style" Observation Blocks (OBs) based on so-called Templates scripts that will be prepared by observers. We decided to develop Templates also for the large number of AIT tests (flexures, coronagraphic mask alignment, scientific camera performances...). Here we present the adopted HTTP API for the OBs generation and a web-based frontend that implements it. Taking advantage of this approach, we decided to expose APIs also for individual device movement and monitoring, as well as for general status. These APIs are then used in the web-based instrument control and synoptic panels. During the recent AIT phase, a potential collision issue between two motorized components emerged. While we are exploring the possibility of a hardware interlock, we present a software solution developed at the Observation Software level, that is also available while using other software such as engineering panels.

 - **Abstract**
 A 2.1-year periodic oscillation of the gamma-ray flux from the blazar PG 1553+113 has previously been tentatively identified in almost 7 year of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. After 15 years of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report >7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4 sigma against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability <0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity. Multiwavelength new data from Swift X-Ray Telescope, Burst Alert Telescope, and UVOT, and from KAIT, Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Owens Valley Radio Observatory ground-based observatories as well as archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite-All Sky Monitor data, published optical data of Tuorla, and optical historical Harvard plates data are included in our work. Optical and radio light curves show clear correlations with the gamma-ray modulation, possibly with a nonconstant time lag for the radio flux. We interpret the gamma-ray periodicity as possibly arising from a pulsational accretion flow in a sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system of elevated mass ratio, with orbital modulation of the supplied material and energy in the jet. Other astrophysical scenarios introduced include instabilities, disk and jet precession, rotation or nutation, and perturbations by massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes in polar orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 OARPAF (Osservatorio Astronomico Regionale Parco Antola Comune di Fascia, Italy) hosts an 80cm Astelco telescope with a Gambato Dome, SBIG-STX camera, Davis weather station, and SBIG AllSky camera. We present a layer-structured python3 framework to control these devices. Layer 1 provides straightforward getter/setter interface for "atomic" operations on devices. Layer 2 wraps the above mentioned atomic operations into "ESO-style" Templates, to perform sequences of common pointing, observation, and calibration operations called "Observation Blocks" (OBs) that are run by a sequencer. Layer 3 is a REST API based on HTTP verbs to expose methods that control Layer 1 devices and Layer 2. We also present a web interface built on top of this layer. The work is part of the frame for remoting and robotizing the observatory.

          Spectroscopic study of the late B-type eclipsing binary system AR Aurigae A and B: Towards clarifying the differences in atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances

 - **Abstract**
 AR Aur A+B is a close binary of astrophysical interest, because dissimilar surface compositions are reported between similar late B-type dwarfs. A new spectroscopic study on this system was carried out based on the disentangled spectra, in order to determine their atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances, The effective temperature and microturbulence (determined from the equivalent widths of Fe II lines) turned out (11150K, 0.9km/s) and (10650K, 0.1km/s) for A and B. The chemical abundances of 28 elements were derived while taking into account the non-LTE effect for Z<=15 elements (Z: atomic number). The following trends were elucidated for [X/H] (abundance of X relative to the Sun): (1) Qualitatively, [X/H] shows a rough global tendency of increasing with Z, with the gradient steeper for A than for B. (2) However, considerable dispersion is involved for A, since prominently large peculiarities are seen in specific elements reflecting the characteristics of HgMn stars (e.g., very deficient N, Al, Sc, Ni; markedly overabundant P, Mn). (3) In contrast, the Z-dependence of [X/H] for B tends to be nearly linear with only a small dispersion. These observational facts may serve as a key to understanding the critical condition for the emergence of chemical anomaly.

 - **Abstract**
 Open star clusters are dynamic systems whose evolution is critically influenced by initial conditions such as star formation efficiency and orbital parameters. Understanding their dissolution mechanisms provides insight into stellar population dynamical mixing in the Milky Way. We aim to investigate the dynamical evolution and dissolution of initially non-virialised open clusters by examining how different global star formation efficiencies and orbital characteristics impact the cluster longevity and structural changes. We followed the evolution of the clusters up to their dissolution time on the basis of our calculations. We compare our open cluster dynamical evolutionary models with the observed open clusters in our Galaxy's solar vicinity. Using high-order direct N-body simulations, we modelled cluster evolution across different Galactic orbits, systematically varying initial star formation efficiencies to comprehensively explore dissolution mechanisms. Our simulations reveal that open clusters typically survive approximately ten orbital periods, with cluster lifetime being strongly dependent on global star formation efficiency and only marginally influenced by orbital eccentricity. We estimate gas expulsion timescales of 0.9 Myr, with initial supernova explosions efficiently removing gaseous components from the cluster. The expected lifetime of the cluster (in units of orbital periods) strongly depends on the cluster global star-formation efficiency and only slightly on the orbital eccentricities of the cluster. The theoretical models demonstrate a remarkable agreement of the Roche-volobe filling parameter with the recent observed Gaia DR3 cluster catalogues in the solar vicinity. By incorporating a mixed sample of clusters with varying star formation efficiencies, we provide a more nuanced understanding of open cluster evolution in the Galactic disc.

          Farside helioseismology with Sun-as-a-star data: the solar cycle as seen with 7-day-long BiSON timeseries

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from fitting $p$-mode spectra derived from 7-d segments of Sun-as-a-star helioseismic observations from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network covering 32 yr. The results show a clear dependence of the mode frequencies on solar activity, and the frequency dependence of the sensitivity to activity can also be seen. Because we use data segments that cover less than half of a solar rotation, we are able to test for the effect of activity on the solar far side. By fitting with a model that takes into account activity on the far side of the Sun, we show that the frequency shifts are sensitive to activity from the whole Sun, not just the side facing the observer. Our results suggest that there is potential to investigate activity-related asteroseismic frequency shifts in solar-like oscillators using short time series of observations.

          Architecture Classification for Extrasolar Planetary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a classification framework for the architectures of planetary systems based on a complete survey of the confirmed exoplanet population. With nearly 6000 confirmed exoplanets discovered, including more than 300 multiplanet systems with three or more planets, the current observational sample has reached the point where it is both feasible and useful to build a classification system that divides the observed population into meaningful categories. This framework provides a criterion to split planetary systems into inner and outer regimes, and then further divides inner systems into dynamical classes. The resulting categories include "peas-in-a-pod systems" with uniformly small planets and "warm Jupiter systems" with a mix of large and small planets, as well as "closely-spaced systems" and "gapped systems," with further subdivisions based on the locations of gaps and other features. These categories can classify nearly all of the confirmed systems with three or more planets with minimal ambiguity. We qualitatively examine the relative prevalence of each type of system, subject to observational selection effects, as well as other notable features such as the presence of hot Jupiters. A small number of outlier systems are also discussed. Potential additional classes of systems yet to be discovered are proposed.

          Vertical CO surfaces as a probe for protoplanetary disk mass and carbon depletion

 - **Abstract**
 As the sample of mid-inclination disks with measured CO emission surfaces grows, a fundamental unanswered question is how these vertical profiles connect to their host properties. This project aims to relate the vertical extent of protoplanetary disks as traced by $^{12}$CO $2-1$ to key stellar and physical parameters. In order to produce a result that is applicable towards an observational analysis, we benchmark our results with ALMA observations of CO emission from nineteen disks. We produce a grid of disk models using the physical-chemical code DALI, for a template T Tauri and Herbig star. Our models use an iterative solver to calculate the hydrostatic equilibrium equations and determine a physically-motivated density structure. Key stellar and disk parameters such as stellar luminosity and temperature, total disk mass, carbon abundance and critical radius are varied to determine their effect on the CO emitting surface. Each vertical profile is fitted by an exponentially tapered power-law and characterized by the $z/r$ value that represents the structure inwards of 80% of the tapering radius. The CO emission surface location is primarily determined by the disk mass ($M_d$) and the level of volatile carbon depletion. T Tauri and Herbig systems show different vertical profiles, with disks around T Tauri stars being more vertically extended. We derive a $z/r$-$M_d$ relationship, which for each stellar type has a degeneracy with the volatile carbon abundance. In order to reconcile total disk mass estimates from the characteristic $z/r$ and the values obtained based on dust continuum analysis, a volatile carbon depletion of 10-100 (with respect to the ISM) is needed for the majority of our sources. Our carbon depletion values are in agreement with previous literature estimates, highlighting the potential of this method to rapidly calculate key disk parameters.
