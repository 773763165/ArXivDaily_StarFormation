          The Forward Physics Facility at the HL-LHC and its Synergies with Astroparticle Physics

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a vast flux of particles along the beam collision axis, a region not accessible by current LHC experiments. The study of multi-particle production in the far-forward region is especially important for astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays create extensive air showers (EAS) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions in the non-perturbative QCD regime. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is crucial for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for searches of astrophysical neutrinos, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC, hosting various far-forward experiments designed to detect particles outside the current LHC acceptance. We will outline the current plans for the FPF and highlight its synergies with astroparticle physics. Specifically, we will discuss how FPF measurements will enhance the modeling of high-energy interactions in the atmosphere, helping to reduce the associated uncertainties in multi-messenger astrophysics.

          Network and Kinetics-based Biosignatures: Implications for the Putative Habitable World Observatory Design

 - **Abstract**
 The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory is intended to observe the atmospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets with a resolution greater than that of any previous instrument. While these observations present a substantial opportunity for astrobiology, they also incur the risk of false positives and false negatives. Here, we explore the use of systems science (in the form of network theory and thermochemical kinetics) to mitigate these risks, and briefly describe the technical specifications HWO would require in order to use these methodologies.
#### Title:
          An original classification of obscuration-free telescopes designs unfolded in two dimensions

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we propose an original classification method for unobscured imaging systems unfolded in two dimensions. This classification is based on a study of off-axis properties, and relies on topology and algorithm of real algebraic geometry to find at least one instance by connected component of a semialgebraic set. Our corresponding nomenclature provides intrinsic information about the system, in terms of geometry and manufacturability. The proposed systems for each name of the nomenclature, can be used as starting points for parallel optimizations, allowing for a much more comprehensive search of an unobscured solution, given a set of specifications. We exemplify our method on three and four mirrors imaging systems.

          Approximating non-Gaussian Bayesian partitions with normalising flows: statistics, inference and application to cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Subject of this paper is the simplification of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as used in Bayesian statistical inference by means of normalising flows, a machine learning method which is able to construct an invertible and differentiable transformation between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random distributions. We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.

 - **Abstract**
 Joint analysis of position measurements and radial velocities of six triple stellar systems is conducted to determine their inner and/or outer orbits. Accumulation of such data is needed to study the architecture of stellar hierarchies and its relation to the formation mechanisms. The inner periods in the six systems (HIP 11783, 64836, 72423, 84720, 89234, and 105404) range from 0.5 days to 44 yr. The shortest outer period of 3.34 yr is found in the compact triple HIP~105404 (BS Ind). The resolved triple system HIP 64836 has comparable inner and outer periods (5 and 30 yr), placing it near the limit of dynamical stability, while its quasi-circular and coplanar orbits suggest a 1:6 mean motion resonance. The periods in HIP 89234 (44 and ~450 yr) are also comparable, but the mutual orbit inclination is large, 54 degrees. Masses of the components are estimated and each system is discussed individually.

          Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.

          Identifying Flare Locations Through Exoplanet Transit Occultations

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy, with long lifespans, a high occurrence rate of rocky planets, and close-in habitable zones. However, high stellar activity in the form of frequent flaring and any associated coronal mass ejections may drive atmospheric escape with the bombardment of radiation and high-energy particles, drastically impacting the habitability of these systems. The stellar latitude where flares and coronal mass ejections occur determines the space weather that exoplanets are subject to, with high-energy particle events associated with equatorial flares producing significant atmospheric erosion. However, the flaring latitudes for M dwarfs remain largely unconstrained. To aid in the effort to locate these flaring regions we explore the applicability of flare occultations using optical photometry to identify the latitudes of flares. As a planet transits in front of an ongoing flare the timing and geometry of the transit can be used to constrain the latitude and longitude of the flare. We predict the probability of detecting an occultation for known transiting planets and eclipsing binaries. From this, we estimate 3-22 detectable occultations exist within the TESS primary mission photometry, with the majority occurring in eclipsing binary observations. To demonstrate this technique, we analyze a candidate flare occultation event for the eclipsing binary CM Draconis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first characterization of the statistical relationship between a large sample of novae in M31 and their progenitor stellar populations in the form of a delay time distribution. To this end, we leverage the spatially resolved stellar age distribution of the M31 disk derived from deep HST photometry by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and a large catalog of novae in M31. Our delay time distribution has two statistically significant detections: one population of nova progenitors, ages between 2 and 3.2 Gyr, with an unnormalized rate of ($3.7^{+6.8}_{-3.5} \pm 2.1) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$, and another of ages between 7.9 Gyr and the age of the Universe with ($4.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \pm 0.2) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$ (uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively). Together with the upper limits we derive at other time bins, these detections are consistent with either a constant production efficiency or a higher production efficiency of novae at earlier delay times.

          The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) VI: The RACS-high 1655.5 MHz images and catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted a widefield, wideband, snapshot survey using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) referred to as the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). RACS covers $\approx$ 90% of the sky, with multiple observing epochs in three frequency bands sampling the ASKAP frequency range of 700 to 1800 MHz. This paper describes the third major epoch at 1655.5 MHz, RACS-high, and the subsequent imaging and catalogue data release. The RACS-high observations at 1655.5 MHz are otherwise similar to the previously released RACS-mid (at 1367.5 MHz), and were calibrated and imaged with minimal changes. From the 1493 images covering the sky up to declination $\approx$ +48$^\circ$, we present a catalogue of 2 677 509 radio sources. The catalogue is constructed from images with a median root-mean-square noise of $\approx$ 195 $\mu$Jy PSF$^{-1}$ (point-spread function) and a median angular resolution of 11.8" by 8.1". The overall reliability of the catalogue is estimated to be 99.18%, and we find a decrease in reliability as angular resolution improves. We estimate the brightness scale to be accurate to 10%, and the astrometric accuracy to be within $\approx$ 0.6" in right ascension and $\approx$ 0.7" in declination after correction of a systematic declination-dependent offset. All data products from RACS-high, including calibrated visibility datasets, images from individual observations, full-sensitivity mosaics, and the all-sky catalogue are available at the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive.

          Multiple Populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2257: No Major Environmental Effect on the Formation of Multiple Populations of the Old Globular Clusters in Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 How the environment of the host galaxy affects the formation of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is one of the outstanding questions in the near-field cosmology. To understand the true nature of the old GC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry of the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated populational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\pm$4), where the FG and SG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar cumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is dynamically old. We obtain [Fe/H] = $-$1.78$\pm$0.00 dex($\sigma$=0.05 dex) and our metallicity is $\sim$0.2 dex larger than that from the high-resolution spectroscopy by other, due to their significantly lower temperatures by $\sim$ $-$200 K. The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than the SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to Galactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic of GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium enhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit that the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with the GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass. We show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in the $\Delta$W$_{\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\rm FG}/N_{\rm tot}$, and $\log M/M_{\rm \odot}$ domains. Our result indicates that the environment of the host galaxy did not play a major role in the formation and evolution of GC MPs.

          ALMA Observations of Peculiar Embedded Icy Objects

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of planetary nebulae (PNe) offers the opportunity of evaluating the efficiency of the dust production mechanism during the very late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. We study the relationship between the properties of PNe, particularly the gas and dust content, with the mass and metallicity of the progenitor stars, to understand how dust production works in the late AGB phases, and to shed new light on the physical processes occurring to the stars and the material in their surroundings since the departure from the AGB until the PN phase. We consider a sample of 9 PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 7 out of which characterized by the presence of carbonaceous dust, the remaining 2 with silicates. For these stars the masses and the metallicity of the progenitor stars were estimated. We combine results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling with those coming from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution, to find the relation between the dust and gas mass of the PNe considered and the The physical properties of carbon-rich PNe are influenced by the mass of the progenitor star. Specifically, the dust-to-gas ratio in the nebula increases from 5x10^{-4}to 6x10^{-3} as the progenitor star's mass increases from approximately 0.9Msun to 2Msun. This change is partly influenced by the effective temperature of the PNe, and it occurs because higher-mass carbon stars are more efficient at producing dust. Consequently, as the progenitor's mass increases, the gas mass of the PNe decreases, since the larger amounts of dust lead to greater effects from radiation pressure, which pushes the gas outwards. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn by the study of the PNe with silicate-type dust, because the sub-sample is made up of 2 PNe only, one of which is almost dust-free.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Sapphire++, an open-source code designed to numerically solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for astrophysical applications. Sapphire++ employs a numerical algorithm based on a spherical harmonic expansion of the distribution function, expressing the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as a system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of the expansion coefficients. The code utilises the discontinuous Galerkin method in conjunction with implicit and explicit time stepping methods to compute these coefficients, providing significant flexibility in its choice of spatial and temporal accuracy. We showcase the code's validity using examples. In particular, we simulate the acceleration of test particles at a parallel shock and compare the results to analytical predictions. The Sapphire++ code (this https URL) is available as a free and open-source tool for the community.

          The ESO SupJup Survey V: Exploring Atmospheric Variability and Orbit of the Super-Jupiter AB Pictoris b with CRIRES+

 - **Abstract**
 A growing number of directly-imaged companions have been recently characterised, with robust constraints on carbon-to-oxygen ratios and even isotopic ratios. Many companions and isolated targets have also shown spectral variability. In this work we observed the super-Jupiter AB~Pictoris~b across four consecutive nights using VLT/CRIRES+ as part of the ESO SupJup survey, exploring how the constraints on chemical composition and temperature profile change over time using spectral line shape variations between nights. We performed atmospheric retrievals of the high-resolution observations and found broadly consistent results across all four nights, but there were differences for some parameters. We clearly detect H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO in each night, but abundances varied by $\sim2\sigma$, which was correlated to the deep atmosphere temperature profiles. We also found differences in the $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C ratios in each night by up to $\sim3\sigma$, which seemed to be correlated with the cloud deck pressure. Our combined retrieval simultaneously analysing all nights together constrained broadly the average of each night individually, with the C/O$=0.59\pm0.01$, consistent with solar composition, and $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C~$ = 102\pm8$, slightly higher than the ISM and Solar System values. We also find a low projected rotational velocity, suggesting that AB~Pictoris~b is either intrinsically a slow rotator due to its young age or that the spin axis is observed pole-on with a $\sim90^\circ$ misalignment with its orbit inclination. Future observations will be able to further explore the variability and orbit of AB~Pictoris~b as well as for other companions.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a technique for resolving intermediate-separation binaries stars with medium-sized telescopes (i.e. diameter less than or equal to 2.5 m) at wavelengths around 825 nm in the super-resolution range (i.e. below the limit defined by the Rayleigh criterion). We combined two well-known algorithms that have been applied to reduce the halo in lucky imaging observations: COvariancE of Lucky Images (COELI) and the Lucky Imaging Speckle Suppression Algorithm (LISSA). We reviewed the fundamentals of both algorithms and describe a new technique called Lucky Imaging Super resolution Technique (LIST), which is optimized for peak highlighting within the first ring of the Airy pattern. To validate the technique, we carried out several observing campaigns of well-known binary stars with FastCam on the 1.52 m TCS and 2.56 m NOT. The projected angular separation between objects was resolved by applying LIST with a result below 0.15". It can go down to approximately 0.05", given the limitations of the detector plate scale. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that binary companions with such small angular separations have been detected using only lucky imaging at optical wavelengths. The average accuracy achieved for the angular separation measurement is 16 mas with NOT and is 20 mas with TCS. The average accuracy obtained for the position angle measurement is $9.5^o$ for NOT and $11^o$ for TCS. We also made an attempt to measure the relative brightnesses of the binary components, obtaining results that are compatible with literature measurements. Lucky imaging, in combination with speckle suppression and a covariance analysis, can allow the resolution of multiple point sources below the diffraction limit of 2-m class telescopes. However, it should be noted that measurements in the super-resolution regime are less sensitive than those above the first Airy ring.

          Vertical Kinematics of the Young Galactic Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The young disc vertical phase is paramount in our understanding of Galaxy evolution. Analysing the vertical kinematics at different galactic regions provides important information about the space-time variations of the Galactic potential. The vertical phase snail-shell structure found after Gaia DR2 release encompasses a wide range of ages. %\citep{2018Natur.561..360A, Antoja23}. However, the structure of the $V_Z\, vs \, Z$ diagram appears linear when the analysis is limited to studying objects younger than 30 Ma. Based on the vertical velocity and height-over-disc maps obtained for a sample of young open clusters, this method also allows the matter density in the Solar neighbourhood to be estimated using a completely different approach than previously found in the literature. We use two different catalogues of star clusters to confirm the previous result and study new age ranges. The linear pattern between $V_Z$ and $Z$ shows different slopes, $\partial V_Z/\partial Z$, for various age groups. The results fit a simple model (harmonic oscillator) of in-plane decoupled vertical dynamics up to a certain age limit, corresponding to $\sim$ 30 Ma. This work also analyses the relationship between the local volumetric density of matter ($\rho_0$) and the disc vertical kinematics for different age ranges, all below 50 Ma. The best estimates of the effective volumetric mass density in the Solar neighbourhood, 0.09-0.15 M$_\odot$ pc${}^{-3}$, agree with those given by other authors, assessing the reliability of the proposed dynamical model. These values are a minorant of the actual matter density in the region.

          Periods of outbursts and standstills and parameters variations in two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc

 - **Abstract**
 We present our results on two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc. We apply observational data for the periods that cover the states of outbursts and standstills, which are typical for this type of objects. We report an appearance of periodic oscillations in brightness during the standstill in AT Cnc, with small amplitude variations of 0.03 - 0.04 mag and periodicity of $\approx 20-30$ min. Based on the estimated derredened color index (B - V )0, we calculate the color temperature for both states of the two objects. During the transition from the outbursts to the standstill's state Z Cam varies from bluer to redder, while AT Cnc stays redder in both states. We calculate some of the stars' parameters as: the radii of the primary and secondary components, and the orbital separation for both objects. We construct the profiles of the effective temperature in the discs of the two objects. Comparing the parameters of both systems, we see that Z Cam is definitely the hotter object and we conclude it has a more active accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the 32 $H(z)$ data from cosmic chronometers have overestimated uncertainties and make use of a Bayesian method to correct and reduce it. We then use the corrected data to constrain flat $\Lambda$CDM and O$\Lambda$CDM parameters. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we got as result $H_{0} = 67.1\pm 4.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega _{m} = 0.333 ^{+0.041}_{-0.057}$. While for the O$\Lambda$CDM model, we found $H_{0} = 67.2\pm 4.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega _{m} = 0.36\pm 0.16$ and $\Omega _{\Lambda} =0.71 ^{+0.36}_{-0.28}$. These results goes from $22\%$ up to $28\%$ uncertainty reduction when compared to the constraints of the both uncorrected models.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J2030+4415 is a gamma-ray pulsar with an X-ray pulsar wind nebula elongated along the north-south direction. The system shows a prominent X-ray filament oriented at an angle of 130° to the nebula axis. To improve our understanding of the non-thermal processes occurring in the pulsar wind nebula, we attempted to determine the possible existence of a radio counterpart, study its morphology, and obtain restrictive upper limits of the pulsar and filament emission at radio wavelengths. We performed observations of the pulsar PSR J2030+4415 and its surroundings with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at two frequency bands, and put the results in context with findings at other wavelengths. We obtained radio images at 736 and 1274 MHz that reveal a structure trailing the pulsar, with a morphology overlapping the X-ray nebula. This radio structure is the radio counterpart of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula. The derived spectral index along this structure shows spatial variation. There are no hints of the pulsar and the filament at any of the explored radio frequencies, but we obtained restrictive upper limits. A physical scenario that combines the radio and the X-ray observations, and consistent with IR data, of the nebula and the filament is presented. We propose that particle acceleration occurs in the nebula tail due to the presence of a re-collimation shock, and the highest energy particles gradually escape from it through energy-dependent diffusion. We also find a lower limit in the energy of the particles escaping along the X-ray filament of ~GeV.

 Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying exoplanet atmospheres is essential for assessing their potential to host liquid water and their capacity to support life (their habitability). Each atmosphere uniquely influences the likelihood of surface liquid water, defining the habitable zone (HZ), the region around a star where liquid water can exist. However, being within the HZ does not guarantee habitability, as life requires more than just liquid water. In this study, we adopted a two-pronged approach. First, we estimated the surface conditions of planets near the HZ's inner edge under various atmospheric compositions. By utilizing a 3D climate model, we refined the inner boundaries of the HZ for planets with atmospheres dominated by H2 and CO2 for the first time. Second, we investigated microbial survival in these environments, conducting laboratory experiments on the growth and survival of E. coli K-12, focusing on the impact of different gas compositions. This innovative combination of climate modeling and biological experiments bridges theoretical climate predictions with biological outcomes. Our findings indicate that atmospheric composition significantly affects bacterial growth patterns, highlighting the importance of considering diverse atmospheres in evaluating exoplanet habitability and advancing the search for life beyond Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong lensing time delay measurement is a promising method to address the Hubble tension, offering a completely independent approach compared to both the cosmic microwave background analysis and the local distance ladder. As a third-party examination of the Hubble tension, this method provides a unique perspective. Strongly lensed quasar (glQSO) systems have demonstrated significant potential in tackling this issue, achieving an impressive \(2\%\) accuracy level. However, advancing to \(1\%\) or sub-percent accuracy is challenging due to several intrinsic limitations of glQSOs. Fortunately, strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) offer a more robust solution, thanks to their characteristic light curve, significant brightness variations, and additional advantages. The Muztagh-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope (MOST) is an exceptional instrument for monitoring strong lensing time delays. In this study, we simulate the follow-up multi-band light curve monitoring for glSNe Ia systems, which are expected to be firstly discovered by the Chinese Survey Space Telescope (CSST). Our results show that with \(300s \times 9\) exposures in each epoch, MOST can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately 50 for the brightest images of glSNe Ia, while even the faintest images maintain an SNR of at least 7. Using a standard SNe Ia light curve template for fitting, we measured the time delays. With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a time delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below one hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance the precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward resolving the Hubble tension.

          The CO-Fuelled Time Machine: Tracing Birth Conditions and Terrestrial Planet Formation Outcomes in HD 163296 through Pebble Drift-induced CO Enhancements

 - **Abstract**
 The architecture and composition of planetary systems are thought to be strongly influenced by the transport and delivery of dust and volatiles via ices on pebbles during the planet formation phase in protoplanetary discs. Understanding these transport mechanisms is crucial in building a comprehensive picture of planet formation, including material and chemical budget; constraining the birth properties of these discs is a key step in this process. We present a novel method of retrieving such properties by studying the transport of icy pebbles in the context of an observed gas-phase CO enhancement within the CO snowline in the protoplanetary disc around HD 163296. We combine Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a fast model of radial drift to determine the birth gas mass and characteristic radius of the disc, and compare our results against observations and models in the literature; we find the birth-condition disc gas mass to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm{disc}}/M_{\odot})=-0.64^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ and the characteristic radius to be $\log_{10}(r_{\rm{c}}/\rm{AU})=2.30^{+0.45}_{-0.46}$. We additionally determine that dust grains must be `fragile' ($v_{f}=100~\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$) to retain enough dust to match current dust mass observations, with our lowest fragmentation velocity model providing a current-age dust mass of $\rm{M_{dust}}=662^{+518}_{-278} \rm{M_{\oplus}}$ based on the retrieved birth conditions. Using our retrieved birth conditions, we extend our simulations to mass of material reaching the water snowline in the inner disc, where terrestrial and super-Earth planets may be forming, and speculate on the nature of these exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of atmospheric disturbances at Jezero Crater, Mars, using ground-based measurements of surface pressure by the Perseverance rover in combination with orbital images from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. The study starts at Ls $\sim$ 13.3° in MY36 (March 6th, 2021) and extends up to Ls $\sim$ 30.3° in MY37 (February 28th, 2023). We focus on the characterization of the major atmospheric phenomena at synoptic and planetary-scales. These are the thermal tides (measured up to the sixth component), long-period pressure oscillations (periods > 1 sol), the Aphelion Cloud Belt, and the occasional development of regional dust storms over Jezero. We present the seasonal evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the thermal tides and their relation with the atmospheric dust content (optical depth). Three regional dust storms and one polar storm extending over Jezero produced an increase in the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes but resulted in inverse responses in their phases. We show that the primary regular wave activity is due to baroclinic disturbances with periods of 2-4 sols and amplitudes $\sim$ 1-15 Pa increasing with dust content, in good agreement with theoretical predictions by model calculations. The spacecraft images show a number of arc-shaped, spiral and irregular cyclonic vortices, traced by dust and clouds at the edge of the North Polar Cap, that could be behind some of the pressure oscillations measured at Jezero.

 We highlight the potential benefits of a synergistic use of SKAO and ESO facilities for galaxy evolution studies, focusing on the role that ESO spectroscopic surveys can play in supporting next-generation radio continuum and atomic hydrogen (HI) surveys. More specifically we illustrate the role that currently available or soon to be operational ESO multiplex spectrographs can play for three classes of projects: large/deep redshift survey campaigns, integral field unit/Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (IFU/ALMA) surveys of selected regions of sky, and IFU/ALMA follow-ups of selected samples. We conclude with some general recommendations for an efficient joint exploitation of ESO-SKAO surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" effect. In the "quantum-well" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab, a transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright ($V=10.16$) K-dwarf (TIC 466376085) with a period of 1.27 days. Observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveal variable transit depths and asymmetric transit profiles that are characteristic of comet-like tails formed by dusty effluents emanating from a disintegrating planet. Unique to BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab is the presence of prominent dust tails in both the trailing and leading directions that contribute to the extinction of starlight from the host star. By fitting the observed transit profile and analytically modeling the drift of dust grains within both dust tails, we infer large grain sizes ($\sim1-10\,\mu$m) and a mass loss rate of $10\,M_{\rm \oplus}\,$Gyr$^{-1}$, suggestive of a lunar-mass object with a disintegration timescale of only several Myr. The host star is probably older than the Sun and is accompanied by an M-dwarf companion at a projected physical separation of 130 AU. The brightness of the host star, combined with the planet's relatively deep transits ($0.8-2.0\%$), presents BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab as a prime target for compositional studies of rocky exoplanets and investigations into the nature of catastrophically evaporating planets.
