 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, driven by advancements in ground-based detectors. While detecting compact binary coalescences (CBCs) has become routine, searching for more complex ones, such as mergers involving eccentric and precessing binaries and sub-solar mass binaries, has presented persistent challenges. These challenges arise from using the standard matched filtering algorithm, whose computational cost increases with the dimensionality and size of the template bank. This urges the pressing need for faster search pipelines to efficiently identify GW signals, leading to the emergence of the hierarchical search strategy. This method looks for potential candidate events using a sparse template bank in the first stage, followed by dense templates around potential events in the second stage. Although the hierarchical search speeds up the standard PyCBC analysis by more than a factor of 20, as demonstrated in a previous work~\cite{kanchan_hierarchical}, assigning statistical significance to detected signals was done in a heuristic way. In this article, we present a robust approach for background estimation in a two-stage hierarchical search. Our method models background triggers from time-shifted triggers in a two-detector network, extrapolating to higher statistic values. Through an extensive injection campaign for a population of simulated signals on real data, we test the effectiveness of our background estimation approach. The results show our method achieves a sensitive volume-time product comparable to the standard two-detector PyCBC search. This equivalence holds for an inverse false alarm rate of 10 years and chirp mass $1.4-10~\text{M}_\odot$, substantially reducing computational cost with a remarkable speed-up of nearly 13 times compared to PyCBC analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon monoxide was recently reported in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-39b using the NIRSpec PRISM transit observation of this planet, collected as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (JTEC ERS) Program. This detection, however, could not be confidently confirmed in the initial analysis of the higher resolution observations with NIRSpec G395H disperser. Here we confirm the detection of CO in the atmosphere of WASP-39b using the NIRSpec G395H data and cross-correlation techniques. We do this by searching for the CO signal in the unbinned transmission spectrum of the planet between 4.6 and 5.0 $\mu$m, where the contribution of CO is expected to be higher than that of other anticipated molecules in the planet's atmosphere. Our search results in a detection of CO with a cross-correlation function (CCF) significance of $6.6 \sigma$ when using a template with only ${\rm ^{12}C^{16}O}$ lines. The CCF significance of the CO signal increases to $7.5 \sigma$ when including in the template lines from additional CO isotopologues, with the largest contribution being from ${\rm ^{13}C^{16}O}$. Our results highlight how cross-correlation techniques can be a powerful tool for unveiling the chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres from medium-resolution transmission spectra, including the detection of isotopologues.

 - **Abstract**
 Our position inside the Galactic disc had prevented us from establishing an accurate rotation curve, until the advent of Gaia, whose third data release (Gaia DR3) made it possible to specify it up to twice the optical radius. We aim to establish a new rotation curve of the Galaxy from the Gaia DR3, by drastically reducing uncertainties and systematics, and with the goal to provide a new estimate of the mass of the Galaxy. We have compared different estimates, established a robust assessment of the systematic uncertainties, and addressed differences in methodologies, particularly regarding distance estimates. This results in a sharply decreasing rotation curve for the Milky Way, the decrease in velocity between 19.5 and 26.5 kpc is approximately 30 km s$^{-1}$. We have identified, for the first time, a Keplerian decline of the rotation curve, starting at $\sim$ 19 kpc and up to $\sim$ 26.5 kpc from the Galaxy center, while a flat rotation curve is rejected with a significance of 3$\sigma$. The total mass is revised downwards to $2.06^{+0.24}_{-0.13}\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$, in agreement with an absence of significant mass increase at radii larger than 19 kpc. The upper limit of the total mass was evaluated by considering the upper values of velocity measurements, which leads to a strict, unsurpassable, limit of $5.4\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$.
#### The first comprehensive study of a giant nebula around a radio-quiet  quasar in the $z < 1$ Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive study of a giant, $\approx \! \! 70$ kpc-scale nebula around a radio-quiet quasar at $z<1$. The analysis is based on deep integral field spectroscopy with MUSE of the field of HE$\,$0238$-$1904, a luminous quasar at $z=0.6282$. The nebula emits strongly in $\mathrm{[O \, II]}$, $\rm H \beta$, and $\mathrm{[O \, III]}$, and the quasar resides in an unusually overdense environment for a radio-quiet system. The environment likely consists of two groups which may be merging, and in total have an estimated dynamical mass of $M_{\rm dyn}\approx 4\times 10^{13}$ to $10^{14}\ {\rm M_\odot}$. The nebula exhibits largely quiescent kinematics and irregular morphology. The nebula may arise primarily through interaction-related stripping of circumgalactic and interstellar medium (CGM/ISM) of group members, with some potential contributions from quasar outflows. The simultaneous presence of the giant nebula and a radio-quiet quasar in a rich environment suggests a correlation between such circum-quasar nebulae and environmental effects. This possibility can be tested with larger samples. The upper limits on the electron number density implied by the [O\,II] doublet ratio range from $\log(n_{\rm e, [O \, II]} / \mathrm{cm^{-3}}) < 1.2$ to $2.8$. However, assuming a constant quasar luminosity and negligible projection effects, the densities implied from the measured line ratios between different ions (e.g., [O\,II], [O\,III], and [Ne V]) and photoionization simulations are often 10$-$400 times larger. This large discrepancy can be explained by quasar variability on a timescale of $\approx 10^4{-}10^5$ years.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to being spectacular objects, Very Massive Stars (VMS) are suspected to have a tremendous impact on their environment and on the whole cosmic evolution. The nucleosynthesis both during their advanced stages and their final explosion may contribute greatly to the overall enrichment of the Universe. Their resulting supernovae are candidates for the most superluminous events and their extreme conditions also lead to very important radiative and mechanical feedback effects, from local to cosmic scale. We explore the impact of rotation and metallicity on the evolution of very massive stars across cosmic times. With the recent implementation of an equation of state in the GENEC stellar evolution code, appropriate for describing the conditions in the central regions of very massive stars in the advanced phases, we present new results on VMS evolution from Population III to solar metallicity. Low metallicity VMS models are highly sensitive to rotation, while the evolution of higher metallicity models is dominated by mass loss effects. The mass loss affects strongly their surface velocity evolution, breaking quickly at high metallicity while reaching the critical velocity for low metallicity models. The comparison to observed VMS in the LMC shows that the mass loss prescriptions used for these models are compatible with observed mass loss rates. In our framework for modelling rotation, our models of VMS need a high initial velocity to reproduce the observed surface velocities. The surface enrichment of these VMS is difficult to explain with only one initial composition, and could suggest multiple populations in the R136 cluster. At a metallicity typical of R136, only our non- or slowly rotating VMS models may produce Pair Instability supernovae. The most massive black holes that can be formed are less massive than about 60 M$_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the complete nature of Galactic sources that accelerate cosmic rays up to $10^{15}$ eV energy (Galactic PeVatrons) is still an unsolved problem in high-energy astrophysics. Although supernova remnants have long been considered as the best candidates for Galactic PeVatrons, a clear association of SNRs with PeVatrons needs further exploration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration published its first catalog of 90 very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources, and a few of them have no obvious counterparts at other wavelengths. Here, we will present morphology and spectral analysis of one such unassociated source LHAASO J2108+5157 using VERITAS and HAWC data.
#### Impact of neutron star spin on Poynting-Robertson drag during a Type I  X-ray burst

 - **Abstract**
 External irradiation of a neutron star (NS) accretion disc induces Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag, removing angular momentum and increasing the mass accretion rate. Recent simulations show PR drag significantly enhancing the mass accretion rate during Type I X-ray bursts, which could explain X-ray spectral features such as an increase in the persistent emission and a soft excess. However, prograde spin of the NS is expected to weaken PR drag, challenging its importance during bursts. Here, we study the effect of spin on PR drag during X-ray bursts. We run four simulations, with two assuming a non-spinning NS and two using a spin parameter of $a_*=0.2$, corresponding to a rotation frequency of 500 Hz. For each scenario, we simulate the disc evolution subject to an X-ray burst and compare it to the evolution found with no burst. PR drag drains the inner disc region during a burst, moving the inner disc radius outward by $\approx1.6$ km in the $a_*=0$ and by $\approx2.2$ km in the $a_*=0.2$ simulation. The burst enhances the mass accretion rate across the innermost stable circular orbit $\approx7.9$ times when the NS is not spinning and $\approx11.2$ times when it is spinning. The explanation for this seemingly contradictory result is that the disc is closer to the NS when $a_*=0.2$, and the resulting stronger irradiating flux offsets the weakening effect of spin on the PR drag. Hence, PR drag remains a viable explanation for the increased persistent emission and soft excess observed during X-ray bursts in spinning NS systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The precessing jet-nozzle scenario previously proposed was applied to model-fit the kinematics of five superluminal components (C19,C20,C21,B5 and B7) of jet-B in blazar 3C345. Based on a specific pattern for the the precessing common trajectory of jet-B, the kinematic properties (including trajectory,coordinates, core separation and apparent velocity) were model-fitted and their flux evolution could be studied. Through model-simulation of their kinematic behavior, the bulk Lorentz factor, viewing angle and Doppler factor were derived as continuous functions of time and the association of their flux evolution with their Doppler-boosting effect was investigated. The 43GHz light-curves of the five superluminal components can be well interpreted in terms of their Doppler effect. The close association of their flux evolution with the Doppler-boosting effect firmly validates our precessing nozzle scenario and supports the traditional point-view that superluminal components are physical entities (traveling shocks or plasmoids) participating relativistic motion toward us at small angles. The model-simulation of kinematic behavior of superluminal components by using our precessing nozzle scenario with specific patterns (helical or ballistic) assumed for the precessing common trajectories yields the model-derived bulk Lorentz factor, apparent velocity, viewing angle and Doppler factor as continuous functions of time, which are most applicable to study the connection of flux evolution with Doppler boosting effect for the superluminal components.

 - **Abstract**
 The evidence of the stochastic gravitational-wave background around the nano-hertz frequency range was recently found by worldwide pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. One of the cosmological explanations is the gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations, but the issue of primordial black hole (PBH) overproduction in this scenario was pointed out in the literature. Motivated by this issue and the $\Omega_\text{GW} \sim f^2$ scaling suggested by the data, we study the gravitational waves induced in a cosmological epoch dominated by a stiff fluid ($w=1$) and find that they can safely explain the PTA data well without PBH overproduction.
#### A HST COS ultra-violet spectroscopic survey of 311 DA white dwarfs.I.  Fundamental parameters and comparative studies

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf studies carry significant implications across multiple fields of astrophysics, including exoplanets, supernova explosions, and cosmological investigations. Thus, accurate determinations of their fundamental parameters (Teff and log g) are of utmost importance. While optical surveys have provided measurements for many white dwarfs, there is a lack of studies utilising ultraviolet (UV) data, particularly focusing on the warmer ones that predominantly emit in the UV range. Here, we present the medium-resolution far-UV spectroscopic survey of 311 hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs obtained with Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard Hubble Space Telescope confirming 49 photometric Gaia candidates. We used 3D extinction maps, parallaxes, and atmospheric models to fit the spectra of the stars that lie in the range 12 000 < Teff < 33 000 K, and 7 <= log g < 9.2. To assess the impact of input physics, we employed two mass-radius relations in the fitting and compared the results with previous studies. The comparisons suggest the COS Teff are systematically lower by 3 per cent on average than Balmer line fits while they differ by only 1.5 per cent from optical photometric studies. The mass distributions indicate that the COS masses are smaller by approximately 0.05 Msol and 0.02 Msol than Balmer lines and photometric masses, respectively. Performing several tests, we find that the discrepancies are either arising due to issues with the COS calibration, broadening theories for hydrogen lines, or interstellar reddening which needs further examination. Based on comparative analysis, we identify 30 binary candidates drawing attention for follow-up studies to confirm their nature.

 - **Abstract**
 "Hot atoms", which are atoms in their excited states, transfer their energy to the surrounding atmosphere through collisions. This process of energy transfer is known as thermalization, and it plays a crucial role in various astrophysical and atmospheric processes. Thermalization of hot atoms is mainly governed by the amount of species present in the surrounding atmosphere and the collision cross-section between the hot atoms and surrounding species. In this work, we investigated the elastic and inelastic collisions between hot oxygen atoms and neutral N$_2$ molecules, relevant to oxygen gas escape from the martian atmosphere and for characterizing the chemical reactions in hypersonic flows. We conducted a series of quantum scattering calculations between various isotopes of O($^3P$) atoms and N$_2$ molecules across a range of collision energies (0.3 to 4 eV), and computed both their differential and collision cross-sections using quantum time$-$independent coupled-channel approach. Our differential cross-section results indicate a strong preference for forward scattering over sideways or backward scattering, and this anisotropy in scattering is further pronounced at higher collision energies. By comparing the cross-sections of three oxygen isotopes, we find that the heavier isotopes consistently have larger collision cross-sections than the lighter isotopes over the entire collision energy range examined. However, for all the isotopes, the variation of collision cross-section with respect to collision energy is the same. As a whole, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the energy distribution and thermalization processes of hot atoms within atmospheric environments. Specifically, the cross$-$sectional data presented in this work is directly useful in improving the accuracy of energy relaxation modeling of O and N$_2$ collisions over Mars and Venus atmospheres.
#### A quantitative explanation of the radio--X-ray correlation in black-hole  X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The observed correlation between the radio and X-ray fluxes in the hard state of black-hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) has been around for more than two decades. It is currently accepted that the hard X-rays in BHXRBs come from Comptonization in the corona and the radio emission from the relativistic jet (Lorentz $\gamma >> 1$), which is a narrow structure of a few $R_g=GM/c^2$ at its base. The relativistic jet and the corona, however, are separate entities with hardly any communication between them, apart from the fact that both are fed from the accreting matter. It is also widely accepted that the accretion flow around black holes in BHXRBs consists of an outer thin disk and an inner hot flow. From this hot inner flow, an outflow emanates in the hard and hard-intermediate states of the source. By considering Compton up-scattering of soft disk photons in the outflow (i.e., in the outflowing corona, which is a wider structure, tens to hundreds of $R_g$ at its base, with low Lorentz gamma) as the mechanism that produces the hard X-ray spectrum, we have been able to explain quantitatively a number of observed correlations. Here, we demonstrate that this outflowing corona can also explain quantitatively the observed radio - X-ray correlation. In addition, we make the following theoretical predictions for GX 339-4: 1) the radio flux in the hard and hard-intermediate states should be a bell-shaped curve as a function of the photon-number spectral index Gamma, 2) the radio - X-ray correlation should break down when the source moves from the hard to the hard-intermediate state and instead the radio flux should first increase sharply in the hard-intermediate state and then decrease also sharply, in a very narrow range of the X-ray flux, and 3) the X-ray polarization will be parallel to the outflow in the hard state and perpendicular to it in the hard-intermediate one.
#### Combining chirp mass, luminosity distance and sky localisation from  gravitational wave events to detect the cosmic dipole

 - **Abstract**
 A key test of the isotropy of the Universe on large scales consists in comparing the dipole in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature with the dipole in the distribution of sources at low redshift. Current analyses find a dipole in the number counts of quasars and radio sources that is 2-5 times larger than expected from the CMB, leading to a tension reaching 5$\sigma$. In this paper, we derive a consistent framework to measure the dipole independently from gravitational wave (GW) detections. We exploit the fact that the observer velocity does not only change the distribution of events in the sky, but also the luminosity distance and redshifted chirp mass, that can be extracted from the GW waveform. We show that the estimator with higher signal-to-noise ratio is the dipole in the chirp mass measured from a population of binary neutron stars. Combining all estimators (accounting for their covariance) improves the detectability of the dipole by 30-50 percent compared to number counting of binary black holes alone. We find that a few $10^6$ events are necessary to detect a dipole consistent with the CMB one, whereas if the dipole is as large as predicted by radio sources, it will already be detectable with $10^5$ events, which would correspond to a single year of observation with next generation GW detectors. GW sources provide therefore a robust and independent way of testing the isotropy of the Universe.
#### Early Dark Energy beyond slow-roll: implications for cosmic tensions

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the possibility that Early Dark Energy (EDE) is dynamical in nature and study its effect on cosmological observables. We introduce a parameterization of the equation of state allowing for an equation of state $w$ differing considerably from cosmological constant (cc, $w={-1}$) and vary both the initial $w_i$ as well final $w_f$ equation of state of the EDE fluid. This idea is motivated by the fact that in many models of EDE, the scalar field may have some kinetic energy when it starts to behave like EDE before the CMB decoupling. We find that the present data have a mild preference for non-cc early dark energy $( w_i= -0.78)$ using Planck+BAO+Pantheon+S$H_0$ES data sets, leading to $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}$ improvement of -2.5 at the expense of one more parameter. However, $w_i$ is only weakly constrained, with $w_i < -0.56$ at $1\sigma$. We argue that allowing for $w_i\neq -1$ can play a role in decreasing the $\sigma_8$ parameter. Yet, in practice the decrease is only $\sim0.4\sigma$ and $\sigma_8$ is still larger than weak lensing measurements. We conclude that while promising, a dynamical EDE cannot resolve both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars exhibit relentless variability across diverse spatial and temporal frequencies. The study of long- and short-term variability properties observed in the X-ray band provides insights into the inner workings of the central engine. In this work, we present timing and spectral analyses of the blazar 3C 273 using the X-ray observations from the $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ telescope covering the period from 2000 to 2020. The methods of timing analyses include estimation of fractional variability, long- and short-term flux distribution, rms-flux relation, and power spectral density analysis. The spectral analysis include estimating a model independent flux hardness ratio and fitting the observations with multiplicative and additive spectral models such as \textit{power-law}, \textit{log-parabola}, \textit{broken power-law}, and \textit{black body}. The \textit{black body} represents the thermal emission from the accretion disk, while the other models represent the possible energy distributions of the particles emitting synchrotron radiation in the jet. During the past two decades, the source flux changed by of a factor of three, with a considerable fractional variability of 27\%. However, the intraday variation was found to be moderate. Flux distributions of the individual observations were consistent with a normal or log-normal distribution, while the overall flux distribution including entire observations appear to be rather multi-modal and of a complex shape. The spectral analyses indicate that \textit{log-parabola} added with a \textit{black body} gives the best fit for most of the observations. The results indicate a complex scenario in which the variability can be attributed to the intricate interaction between the disk/corona system and the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 (99942) Apophis is a potentially hazardous asteroid that will closely approach the Earth on April 13, 2029. Although the likelihood of an impact has been ruled out, this close encounter represents a unique opportunity for planetary science and defense. By investigating the physical and dynamical changes induced by this interaction, valuable insights into asteroid cohesion, strength, and internal structure can be obtained. In light of these circumstances, a fast mission to Apophis holds great scientific importance and potential for understanding potentially hazardous asteroids. To this aim, ESA proposed the mission RAMSES (Rapid Apophis Mission for SEcurity and Safety) to reach Apophis before its close encounter. In this context, the paper focuses on the reachability analysis of (99942) Apophis, examining thousands of trajectories departing from Earth and reaching the asteroid before the fly-by, using a low-thrust spacecraft. A two-layer approach combining direct sequential convex programming and an indirect method is employed for fast and reliable trajectory optimization. The results reveal multiple feasible launch windows and provide essential information for mission planning and system design.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations of the Class 0 protostar RCrA IRS5N as part of the Atacama Large Milimeter/submilimeter Array (ALMA) large program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals a flattened continuum structure around IRS5N, consistent with a protostellar disk in the early phases of evolution. The continuum emission appears smooth and shows no substructures. However, a brightness asymmetry is observed along the minor axis of the disk, suggesting the disk is optically and geometrically thick. We estimate the disk mass to be between 0.007 and 0.02 M$_{\odot}$. Furthermore, molecular emission has been detected from various species, including C$^{18}$O (2$-$1), $^{12}$CO (2$-$1), $^{13}$CO (2$-$1), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}-2_{0,2}$, 3$_{2,1}-2_{2,0}$, and 3$_{2,2}-2_{2,1}$). By conducting a position-velocity analysis of the C$^{18}$O (2$-$1) emission, we find that the disk of IRS5N exhibits characteristics consistent with Keplerian rotation around a central protostar with a mass of approximately 0.3 M$_{\odot}$. Additionally, we observe dust continuum emission from the nearby binary source, IRS5a/b. The emission in $^{12}$CO toward IRS5a/b seems to emanate from IRS5b and flow into IRS5a, suggesting material transport between their mutual orbits. The lack of a detected outflow and large-scale negatives in \tlvco~observed toward IRS5N suggests that much of the flux from IRS5N is being resolved out. Due to this substantial surrounding envelope, the central IRS5N protostar is expected to be significantly more massive in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The main goal of this work is to evaluate the correlation between Li abundance, age, and mass. Using high-quality ESO/HARPS data (R $\simeq$ 115 000; 270 $\leq$ SNR $\leq$ 1000), we measured Li abundances via spectral synthesis of the 6707.8 \r{A} $^7$Li line in 74 solar twins and analogs. Our joint analysis of 151 Sun-like stars (72 from our sample plus 79 solar twins from a previous study) confirms the strong Li abundance-age correlation reported by other works. Mass and convective envelope size also seem to be connected with Li abundance but with lower significance. We have found a link between the presence of planets and low Li abundances in a sample of 192 stars with a high significance. Our results agree qualitatively with non-standard models, and indicate that several extra transport mechanisms must be taken into account to explain the behaviour of Li abundance for stars with different masses and ages.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimates of the size of the feeding zone of the planet Proxima Centauri c have been made at initial orbital eccentricities of planetesimals equal to 0.02 or 0.15. The research is based on the results of modeling of the evolution of planetesimals' orbits under the influence of the star and planets Proxima Centauri c and b. The considered time interval reached a billion years. It was found that after the accumulation of the planet Proxima Centauri c some planetesimals may have continues to move in stable elliptical orbits within its feeding zone, largely cleared of planetesimals. Usually such planetesimals can move in some resonances with the planet (Proxima Centauri c), for example, in the resonance 1:1 (as Jupiter Trojans), 5:4 and 3:4 and usually have small eccentricities. Some planetesimals that moved for a long time (1-2 million years) along chaotic orbits fell into the resonances 5:2 and 3:10 with the planet Proxima Centauri c and moved in them at least tens of millions of years.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Deuterium in H-bearing species is enhanced during the early stages of star formation, however, only a small number of high spatial resolution deuteration studies exist towards protostellar objects, leaving the small-scale structures unrevealed and understudied. Aims. We aim to constrain the deuterium fractionation ratios in a Class 0/I protostellar object in formaldehyde (H2CO), which has abundant deuterated isotopologues in this environment. Methods. We observed the Class 0/I protobinary system [BHB2007] 11, whose emission components are embedded in circumstellar disks that have radii of 2-3 au, using ALMA within the context of the Large Program FAUST. The system is surrounded by a complex filamentary structure connecting to the larger circumbinary disk. In this work we present the first study of formaldehyde D-fractionation towards this source with detections of H2CO 3(0,3)-2(0,2), combined with HDCO 4(2,2)-3(2,1), HDCO 4(1,4)-3(1,3) and D2CO 4(0,4)-3(0,3). These observations enable multiple velocity components associated with the methanol hotspots also uncovered by FAUST data, as well as the external envelope, to be resolved. In addition, based on the kinematics seen in the observations of the H2CO emission, we propose the presence of a second large scale outflow. Results. HDCO and D2CO are only found in the central regions of the core while H2CO is found more ubiquitously. From radiative transfer modelling, the column densities ranges found for H2CO, HDCO and D2CO are (3-8)x10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, (0.8-2.9)x10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (2.6-4.3)x10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, yielding an average D/H ratio of 0.01-0.04. Following the results of kinematic modelling, the second large scale feature is inconsistent with a streamer-like nature and we thus tentatively conclude that the feature is an asymmetric molecular outflow launched by a wide-angle disk wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts are among the most powerful events in the Universe. Despite half a century of observations of these transient sources, many open questions remain about their nature. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt emission have long been theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. With the aim of characterizing the polarization of these prompt emissions, a compact Compton polarimeter, called POLAR, has been launched to space in September 2016. Time integrated polarization analysis of the POLAR GRB catalog have shown that the prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. However, time resolved analysis depicted strong hints of an evolving polarization angle within single pulses, washing out the polarization degree in time integrated analyses. Here we will for the first time present energy resolved polarization measurements with the POLAR data. The novel analysis, performed on several GRBs, will provide new insights and alter our understanding of GRB polarization. The analysis was performed using the 3ML framework to fit polarization parameters versus energy in parallel to the spectral parameters. Although limited by statistics, the results could provide a very relevant input to disentangle between existing theoretical models. In order to gather more statistics per GRB and perform joint time and energy resolved analysis, a successor instrument, called POLAR-2, is under development with a launch window early 2025 to the CSS. After presenting the first energy resolved polarization results of the POLAR mission, we will present the prospects for such measurements with the upcoming POLAR-2 mission.
#### Enriching inner discs and giant planets with heavy elements

 - **Abstract**
 Giant exoplanets seem to have on average a much larger heavy element content than the solar system giants. Past attempts to explain these heavy element contents include collisions between planets, accretion of volatile rich gas and accretion of gas enriched in micro-metre sized solids. However, these different theories individually could not explain the heavy element content of giants and the volatile to refractory ratios in atmospheres of giant planets at the same time. Here we combine the approaches of gas accretion enhanced with vapor and small micro-meter sized dust grains. As pebbles drift inwards, the volatile component evaporates and enriches the disc, while the smaller silicate core of the pebble continues to move inwards. The smaller silicate pebbles drift slower, leading to a pile-up of material interior to the water ice line, increasing the dust-to-gas ratio interior to the ice line. Under the assumption that these small dust grains follow the motion of the gas, gas accreting giants accrete large fractions of small solids in addition to the volatile vapor. The effectiveness of the solid enrichment requires a large disc radius to maintain the pebble flux for a long time and a large viscosity that reduces the size and inward drift of the small dust grains. However, this process depends crucially on the debated size difference of the pebbles interior and exterior of the water ice line. On the other hand, the volatile component released by the inward drifting pebbles can lead to a large enrichment with heavy element vapor, independently of a size difference of pebbles interior and exterior to the water ice line. Our model stresses the importance of the disc's radius and viscosity on the enrichment of dust and vapor. Consequently we show how our model could explain the heavy element content of the majority of giant planets by using combined estimates of dust and vapor enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 The point-spread function (PSF) is a fundamental property of any astronomical instrument. In interferometers, differing array configurations combined with their $uv$ coverage, and various weighting schemes can produce an irregular but deterministic PSF. As a result, the PSF is often deconvolved using CLEAN-style algorithms to improve image fidelity. In this paper, we revisit a significant effect that causes the flux densities measured with any interferometer to be systematically offset from the true values. Using a suite of carefully controlled simulations, we show that the systematic offset originates from a mismatch in the units of the image produced by these CLEAN-style algorithms. We illustrate that this systematic error can be significant, ranging from a few to tens of per cent. Accounting for this effect is important for current and future interferometric arrays, such as MeerKAT, LOFAR and the SKA, whose core-dominated configuration naturally causes an irregular PSF. We show that this offset is independent of other systematics, and can worsen due to some factors such as the goodness of the fit to the PSF, the deconvolution depth, and the signal-to-noise of the source. Finally, we present several methods that can reduce this effect to just a few per cent.
#### Do Type Ia Supernovae Explode Inside Planetary Nebulae?

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) explosions remains an open issue, with several contending progenitor scenarios actively being considered. One such scenario involves a SN Ia explosion inside a planetary nebula (PN) in the aftermath of a stellar merger triggered by a common envelope (CE) episode. We examine this scenario using hydrodynamic and non-equilibrium ionization simulations of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the PN cocoon into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, focusing on the impact of the delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion. We compare the bulk dynamics and X-ray spectra of our simulated SNRs to the observed properties of known Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude that models where the SN explosion happens in the immediate aftermath of the CE episode (with a delay $\lesssim$1,000 yr) are hard to reconcile with the observations, because the interaction with the dense PN cocoon results in ionization timescales much higher than those found in any known Type Ia SNR. Models with a longer delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion ($\sim$10,000 yr) are closer to the observations, and may be able to explain the bulk properties of some Type Ia SNRs.
#### Photodissociation and induced chemical asymmetries on ultra-hot gas  giants. A case study of HCN on WASP-76 b

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have resulted in the detection of chemical gradients on ultra-hot gas giants. Notwithstanding their high temperature, chemical reactions in ultra-hot atmospheres may occur in disequilibrium, due to vigorous day-night circulation and intense UV radiation from their stellar hosts. The goal of this work is to explore whether photochemistry is affecting the composition of ultra-hot giant planets, and if it can introduce horizontal chemical gradients. In particular, we focus on hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on WASP-76 b, as it is a photochemically active molecule with a reported detection on only one side of this planet. We use a pseudo-2D chemical kinetics code to model the chemical composition of WASP-76 b along its equator. Our approach improves on chemical equilibrium models by computing vertical mixing, horizontal advection, and photochemistry. We find that production of HCN is initiated through thermal and photochemical dissociation of CO and N2 on the day side of WASP-76 b, which are subsequently transported to the night side via the equatorial jet stream. This process results in an HCN gradient with a maximal abundance on the planet's morning limb. We verified that photochemical dissociation is a necessary condition for this mechanism, as thermal dissociation alone proves insufficient. Other species produced via night-side disequilibrium chemistry are SO2 and S2. Our model acts as a proof of concept for chemical gradients on ultra-hot exoplanets. We demonstrate that even ultra-hot planets can exhibit disequilibrium chemistry and recommend that future studies do not neglect photochemistry in their analyses of ultra-hot planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The new generation of galaxy surveys will provide unprecedented data allowing us to test gravity at cosmological scales. A robust cosmological analysis of the large-scale structure demands exploiting the nonlinear information encoded in the cosmic web. Machine Learning techniques provide such tools, however, do not provide a priori assessment of uncertainties. This study aims at extracting cosmological parameters from modified gravity (MG) simulations through deep neural networks endowed with uncertainty estimations. We implement Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with an enriched approximate posterior distribution considering two cases: one with a single Bayesian last layer (BLL), and another one with Bayesian layers at all levels (FullB). We train both BNNs with real-space density fields and power-spectra from a suite of 2000 dark matter only particle mesh $N$-body simulations including modified gravity models relying on MG-PICOLA covering 256 $h^{-1}$ Mpc side cubical volumes with 128$^3$ particles. BNNs excel in accurately predicting parameters for $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ and their respective correlation with the MG parameter. We find out that BNNs yield well-calibrated uncertainty estimates overcoming the over- and under-estimation issues in traditional neural networks. We observe that the presence of MG parameter leads to a significant degeneracy with $\sigma_8$ being one of the possible explanations of the poor MG predictions. Ignoring MG, we obtain a deviation of the relative errors in $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ by at least $30\%$. Moreover, we report consistent results from the density field and power spectra analysis, and comparable results between BLL and FullB experiments which permits us to save computing time by a factor of two. This work contributes in setting the path to extract cosmological parameters from complete small cosmic volumes towards the highly nonlinear regime.
