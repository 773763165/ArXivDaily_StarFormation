 - **Abstract**
 In the past years, the results obtained by the WISSH quasar project provided a novel general picture on the distinctive multi-band properties of hyper-luminous ($L_{bol}>10^{47}$ erg/s) quasars at high redshift (z$\sim$2-4), unveiling interesting relations among active galactic nuclei, winds and interstellar medium, in these powerful sources at cosmic noon. Since 2022, we are performing a systematic and statistically-significant VLA study of the radio properties of WISSH. We carried out high-resolution VLA observations aiming at: 1) identifying young radio source from the broad-band spectral shape of these objects; 2) sample an unexplored high redshift/high luminosity regime, tracking possible evolutionary effects on the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy; 3) quantifying orientation effects on the observed winds/outflows properties.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we revisit metal-enriched pair instability supernovae (PISNe) models which undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By calculating multiple models, we intend to clarify mass ranges for the PISNe, $^{56}$Ni masses from the PISNe, and mass loss histories of CHE-PISNe models for metallicities consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We show that for an initial velocity of $v_{\rm i}/ v_{\rm k}$ = 0.1, these models undergo CHE and He-rich (Type Ib) PISNe occur in a lower mass range ($M_{\rm i} \sim 110-170 M_\odot$) than for more slowly rotating models. Interestingly, bright PISNe which have $^{56}$Ni masses larger than 10 $M_\odot$ occur in a relatively small mass range, $M_{\rm i} \sim 140-170 M_\odot$. Another notable characteristic of CHE-PISNe is the large late time mass loss rates; consequently, CSM interaction may be observable in their light curves. We also show some examples of O-rich (Type Ic) CHE-PISNe produced by $v_{\rm i}/ v_{\rm k}$ = 0.2 models. We expect these models to exhibit interaction with O-rich CSM, behavior which is consistent with the observed properties of the recently discovered PISN candidate, SN2018ibb. Finally, we present a collapsing $v_{\rm i}/ v_{\rm k}$ = 0.2 model which has sufficient angular momentum to be regarded as a candidate for a Super-Kilonova.

 - **Abstract**
 The partcle-induced hadronic de-excitation of the Hoyle state in $^{12}$C induced by inelastic scattering in a hot and dense plasma can enhance the triple-alpha reaction rate. This prevents the production of heavy nuclei within the neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae and raises a question as to the contribution of proton-rich neutrino-driven winds as the origin of $p$-nuclei in the solar system abundances. Here we study $\nu p$-process nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds relevant to the production of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ by considering such particle-induced de-excitation. We show that the enhancement of the triple-alpha reaction rate induced by neutron inelastic scattering hardly affects the $\nu p$-process, while the proton scattering contributes to the nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds at low temperature. The associated enhanced triple-alpha reaction rate decreases the production of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ in a wind model of ordinary core-collapse supernovae. On the other hand, the abundances of these $p$-nuclei increase in an energetic hypernova wind model. Hence, we calculate the galactic chemical evolution of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ by taking account of both contributions from core-collapse supernovae and hypernovae. We show that the hypernova $\nu p$-process can enhance the calculated solar isotopic fractions of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ and make a significant impact on the GCE of $p$-nuclei regardless of the particle-induced Hoyle state de-excitation.
#### Revealing the structure of the lensed quasar Q 0957+561 III. Constraints  on the size of the broad-line region

 - **Abstract**
 Our aim is to examine the size, kinematics, and geometry of the broad-line region (BLR) in the double-lensed quasar Q 0957+561 by analyzing the impact of microlensing on various rest-frame ultraviolet broad-emission lines (BELs). We explore the influence of intrinsic variability and microlensing on the C IV, C III], and Mg II emission lines through multiple spectroscopic observations taken between April 1999 and January 2017. By utilizing the line cores as a reference for no microlensing and correcting for the long time delay between the images, we estimate the sizes of the regions emitting the broad-line wings using a Bayesian approach. Our study of the microlensing amplitudes between the lensed images of the quasar Q 0957+561 reveals differing sizes of the regions emitting the three prominent BELs C IV, C III], and Mg II. The strength of the differential microlensing indicates that the high-ionization line C IV arises from a compact inner region of the BLR with a half-light radius of $R_{1/2} \gtrsim 16.0$ lt-days, which represents a lower limit on the overall size of the BLR and is comparable to the size of the region emitting the r-band continuum in this system. A somewhat larger size of $R_{1/2}\gtrsim 44$ lt-days is obtained for the semi-forbidden line C III]. Microlensing has a weak impact on the lower-ionization line Mg II, which is emitted from a region with a half-light radius of $R_{1/2} \gtrsim 50$ lt-days. These findings suggest that the BEL regions may have distinct geometries and kinematics, with the more extended ones being spherically symmetric, and the most compact ones being nonspherical, with motions likely confined to a plane.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio detection technique of cosmic ray air showers has gained renewed interest in the last two decades. While the radio experiments are very cost-effective to deploy, the Monte-Carlo simulations required to analyse the data are computationally expensive. Here we present a novel way to synthesise the radio emission from extensive air showers in simulations. It is a hybrid approach which uses a single microscopic Monte-Carlo simulation, called the origin shower, to generate the radio emission from a target shower with a different longitudinal evolution, primary particle type and energy. The method employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the shower parameters to transform the radio signals in the simulated antennas. We apply this method to vertical air showers with energies ranging from $10^{17} \; \text{eV}$ to $10^{19} \; \text{eV}$ and compare the results with CoREAS simulations in two frequency bands, namely the broad [20, 500] MHz band and a more narrow one at [30, 80] MHz . We gauge the synthesis quality using the maximal amplitude and energy fluence contained in the signal. We observe that the quality depends primarily on the difference in \textXmax\ between the origin and target shower. After applying a linear bias correction, we find template synthesis to have an accuracy of better than 10% on the broad frequency range. On the restricted [30, 80] MHz range the accuracy is better than 5%. We surmise the template synthesis approach to be limited by intrinsic shower fluctuations which were not accounted for.
#### Tidal debris from Omega Centauri discovered with unsupervised machine  learning

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational interactions between the Milky Way and in-falling satellites offer a wealth of information about the formation and evolution of our Galaxy. In this paper, we explore the high-dimensionality of the GALAH DR3 plus Gaia eDR3 data set to identify new tidally stripped candidate stars of the nearby star cluster Omega Centauri ($\omega\,\mathrm{Cen}$). We investigate both the chemical and dynamical parameter space simultaneously, and identify cluster candidates that are spatially separated from the main cluster body, in regions where contamination by halo field stars is high. Most notably, we find candidates for $\omega\,\mathrm{Cen}$ scattered in the halo extending to more than $50^{\circ}$ away from the main body of the cluster. Using a grid of simulated stellar streams generated with $\omega\,\mathrm{Cen}$ like orbital properties, we then compare the on sky distribution of these candidates to the models. The results suggest that if $\omega\,\mathrm{Cen}$ had a similar initial mass as its present day mass, then we can place a lower limit on its time of accretion at t$_{\mathrm{acc}} > 7$ Gyr ago. Alternatively, if the initial stellar mass was significantly larger, as would be expected if $\omega\,\mathrm{Cen}$ is the remnant core of a dwarf Galaxy, then we can constrain the accretion time to t$_{\mathrm{acc}} > 4$ Gyr ago. Taken together, these results are consistent with the scenario that $\omega\,\mathrm{Cen}$ is the remnant core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.
#### From Discovery to the First Month of the Type II Supernova 2023ixf: High  and Variable Mass Loss in the Final Year Before Explosion

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, among the closest core-collapse SNe in the last several decades, and follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations in the first month of its evolution. The light curve is characterized by a rapid rise ($\approx5$ days) to a luminous peak ($M_V\approx-18$ mag) and plateau ($M_V\approx-17.6$ mag) extending to $30$ days with a smooth decline rate of $\approx0.03$ mag day$^{-1}$. During the rising phase, $U-V$ color shows blueward evolution, followed by redward evolution in the plateau phase. Prominent flash features of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and nitrogen dominate the spectra up to $\approx5$ days after first light, with a transition to a higher ionization state in the first $\approx2$ days. Both the $U-V$ color and flash ionization states suggest a rise in the temperature, indicative of a delayed shock-breakout inside dense circumstellar material (CSM). From the timescales of CSM interaction, we estimate its compact radial extent of $\sim(3-7)\times10^{14}$ cm. We then construct numerical light-curve models based on both continuous and eruptive mass-loss scenarios shortly before explosion. For the continuous mass-loss scenario, we infer a range of mass-loss history with $0.1-1.0$ $M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in the final $2-1$ years before explosion, with a potentially decreasing mass loss of $0.01-0.1$ $M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in $\sim0.7-0.4$ years towards the explosion. For the eruptive mass-loss scenario, we favor eruptions releasing $0.3-1$ $M_\odot$ of the envelope at about a year before explosion, which result in CSM with mass and extent similar to the continuous scenario. We discuss the implications of the available multi-wavelength constraints obtained thus far on the progenitor candidate and SN 2023ixf to our variable CSM models.
