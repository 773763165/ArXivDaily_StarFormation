 - **Abstract**
 We provide a detailed study of natural inflation with a periodic non-minimal coupling, which is a well-motivated inflationary model that admits an explicit UV completion. We demonstrate that this construction can satisfy the most recent observational constraints from Planck and the BICEP/Keck collaborations. We also compute the corresponding relic gravitational wave background due to tensor perturbations and show that future space-borne interferometers, such as DECIGO, BBO and ALIA, may be able to detect it. Next, we extend this analysis and establish the validity of these results in a multi-field model featuring an additional $R^2$ term in the action, which allows us to interpolate between natural and scalaron (a.k.a.~Starobinsky) inflation. We investigate the conditions under which the aforementioned future interferometers will have the capability to differentiate between pure natural inflation and natural-scalaron inflation. The latter analysis could open the door to distinguishing between single-field and multi-field inflation through gravitational wave observations in more general contexts.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing is one of the strongest observational techniques to observe non-luminous astrophysical bodies. Existing microlensing observations provide tantalizing evidence of a population of low-mass objects whose origin is unknown. These events may be caused by terrestrial-mass free-floating planets or by exotic objects such as primordial black holes. However, the nature of these objects cannot be resolved on an event-by-event basis, as the induced light curve is degenerate for lensing bodies of identical mass. One must instead statistically compare \textit{distributions} of lensing events to determine the nature of the lensing population. While existing surveys lack the statistics required to identify multiple subpopulations of lenses, this will change with the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Roman's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to observe hundreds of low-mass microlensing events, enabling a robust statistical characterization of this population. In this paper, we show that by exploiting features in the distribution of lensing event durations, Roman will be sensitive to a subpopulation of primordial black holes hidden amongst a background of free-floating planets. Roman's reach will extend to primordial black hole dark matter fractions as low as $f_\text{PBH} = 10^{-4}$ at peak sensitivity, and will be able to conclusively determine the origin of existing ultrashort-timescale microlensing events. A positive detection would provide evidence that a significant fraction of the cosmological dark matter consists of macroscopic, non-luminous objects.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand high precision observations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, we need detailed and complex general circulation models (GCMs) that incorporate hydrodynamics, chemistry, and radiation. In this study, we specifically examine the coupling between chemistry and radiation in GCMs and compare different methods for mixing opacities of different chemical species in the correlated-k assumption, when equilibrium chemistry cannot be assumed. We propose a fast machine learning method based on DeepSets (DS), which effectively combines individual correlated-k opacities (k-tables). We evaluate the DS method alongside other published methods like adaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) and random overlap with rebinning and resorting (RORR). We integrate these mixing methods into our GCM (expeRT/MITgcm) and assess their accuracy and performance for the example of the hot Jupiter HD~209458 b. Our findings indicate that the DS method is both accurate and efficient for GCM usage, whereas RORR is too slow. Additionally, we observe that the accuracy of AEE depends on its specific implementation and may introduce numerical issues in achieving radiative transfer solution convergence. We then apply the DS mixing method in a simplified chemical disequilibrium situation, where we model the rainout of TiO and VO, and confirm that the rainout of TiO and VO would hinder the formation of a stratosphere. To further expedite the development of consistent disequilibrium chemistry calculations in GCMs, we provide documentation and code for coupling the DS mixing method with correlated-k radiative transfer solvers. The DS method has been extensively tested to be accurate enough for GCMs, however, other methods might be needed for accelerating atmospheric retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the characterization and optimization of six Skipper CCDs for use in a prototype focal plane for the SOAR Integral Field Spectrograph (SIFS). We tested eight Skipper CCDs and selected six for SIFS based on performance results. The Skipper CCDs are 6k $\times$ 1k, 15 $\mu$m pixels, thick, fully-depleted, $p$-channel devices that have been thinned to $\sim 250 \mu$m, backside processed, and treated with an antireflective coating. We optimize readout time to achieve $<4.3$ e$^-$ rms/pixel in a single non-destructive readout and $0.5$ e$^-$ rms/pixel in $5 \%$ of the detector. We demonstrate single-photon counting with $N_{\rm samp}$ = 400 ($\sigma_{\rm 0e^-} \sim$ 0.18 e$^-$ rms/pixel) for all 24 amplifiers (four amplifiers per detector). We also perform conventional CCD characterization measurements such as cosmetic defects ($ <0.45 \%$ ``bad" pixels), dark current ($\sim 2 \times 10^{-4}$ e$^-$/pixel/sec.), charge transfer inefficiency ($3.44 \times 10^{-7}$ on average), and charge diffusion (PSF $< 7.5 \mu$m). We report on characterization and optimization measurements that are only enabled by photon-counting. Such results include voltage optimization to achieve full-well capacities $\sim 40,000-63,000$ e$^-$ while maintaining photon-counting capabilities, clock induced charge optimization, non-linearity measurements at low signals (few tens of electrons). Furthermore, we perform measurements of the brighter-fatter effect and absolute quantum efficiency ($\gtrsim\, 80 \%$ between 450 nm and 980 nm; $\gtrsim\,90 \%$ between 600 nm and 900 nm) using Skipper CCDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Future far-infrared astrophysics observatories will require focal plane arrays containing thousands of ultra-sensitive, superconducting detectors, each of which needs to be optically coupled to the telescope. At longer wavelengths, many approaches have been developed including feedhorn arrays and macroscopic arrays of lenslets. However, with wavelengths as short as 25 microns, optical coupling in the far-infrared remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fabricating far-infrared monolithic silicon microlens arrays using grayscale lithography and deep reactive ion etching. The design, fabrication, and characterization of the microlens arrays are discussed. We compare the designed and fabricated lens profile, and calculate that the fabricated lenses will achieve 84% encircled power for the designed detector, which is only 3% less than the designed performance. We also present methods developed for anti-reflection coating microlens arrays and for a silicon-to-silicon die bonding process to hybridize microlens arrays with detector arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a measurement of the deficit in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Compton-$y$ signal towards cosmic voids, by stacking a catalogue of 97,090 voids constructed with BOSS-DR12 data, on the $y$ maps built on data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR4 and the Planck satellite. We detect the void signal with a significance of $7.3\,\sigma$ with ACT and $9.7\,\sigma$ with Planck, obtaining agreements in the associated void radial $y$ profiles extracted from both maps. The inner-void profile (for angular separations within the void angular radius) is reconstructed with significances of $4.7\sigma$ and $6.1\sigma$ with ACT and Planck, respectively; we model such profile using a simple model that assumes uniform gas (under)density and temperature, which enables us to place constraints on the product $(-\delta_{\rm v}T_{\rm e})$ of the void density contrast (negative) and the electron temperature. The best-fit values from the two data sets are $(-\delta_{\rm v}T_{\rm e})=(6.5\pm 2.3)\times 10^{5}\,\text{K}$ for ACT and $(8.6 \pm 2.1)\times 10^{5}\,\text{K}$ for Planck ($68\%$ C.L.), which are in good agreement under uncertainty. The data allow us to place lower limits on the expected void electron temperature at $2.7\times10^5\,\text{K}$ with ACT and $5.1\times10^5\,\text{K}$ with Planck ($95\%$ C.L.); these results can transform into upper limits for the ratio between the void electron density and the cosmic mean as $n^{\rm v}_{\rm e}/\bar{n}_{\rm e}\leqslant 0.73$ and $0.49$ ($95\%$ C.L.), respectively. Our findings prove the feasibility of using tSZ observations to constrain the gas properties inside cosmic voids, and confirm that voids are under-pressured regions compared to their surroundings.
#### HIDM: Emulating Large Scale HI Maps using Score-based Diffusion Models

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00833
 - **Abstract**
 Efficiently analyzing maps from upcoming large-scale surveys requires gaining direct access to a high-dimensional likelihood and generating large-scale fields with high fidelity, which both represent major challenges. Using CAMELS simulations, we employ the state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models to simultaneously achieve both tasks. We show that our model, HIDM, is able to efficiently generate high fidelity large scale HI maps that are in a good agreement with the CAMELS's power spectrum, probability distribution, and likelihood up to second moments. HIDM represents a step forward towards maximizing the scientific return of future large scale surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2020, the HAWC Collaboration presented the first catalog of gamma-ray sources emitting above 56 TeV and 100 TeV. With nine sources detected, this was the highest-energy source catalog to date. Here, we present the results of re-analysis of the old data, along with additional data acquired since then. We use a new version of the reconstruction software with better pointing accuracy and improved gamma/hadron separation. We now see more than 25 sources above 56 TeV, with most sources being located in the Galactic plane. The vast majority of these seem to be leptonic pulsar wind nebulae, but some have been shown to have hadronic emission. We will show spectra and discuss possible emission mechanisms of some of the most interesting sources, including the ones the HAWC Collaboration considers PeVatron candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping is a promising probe of the universe's large-scale structure. We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen's 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument's sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z=0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03-31.32 h/Mpc with 0.1 h/Mpc resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Blazar AO 0235+164, located at redshift z = 0.94, has undergone several sharp multi-spectral-range flaring episodes during the last decades. In particular, the episodes peaking in 2008 and 2015, that received extensive multi-wavelength coverage, exhibited interesting behavior. Aims. We study the actual origin of these two observed flares by constraining the properties of the observed photo-polarimetric variability, those of the broad-band spectral energy-distribution and the observed time-evolution behavior of the source as seen by ultra-high resolution total-flux and polarimetric Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging. Methods. The analysis of VLBI images allows us to constrain kinematic and geometrical parameters of the 7 mm jet. We use the Discrete Correlation Function to compute the statistical correlation and the delays between emission at different spectral ranges. Multi-epoch modeling of the spectral energy distributions allows us to propose specific models of emission; in particular for the unusual spectral features observed in this source in the X-ray region of the spectrum during strong multi spectral-range flares. Results. We find that these X-ray spectral features can be explained by an emission component originating in a separate particle distribution than the one responsible for the two standard blazar bumps. This is in agreement with the results of our correlation analysis that do not find a strong correlation between the X-rays and the remaining spectral ranges. We find that both external Compton dominated and synchrotron self-Compton dominated models can explain the observed spectral energy distributions. However, synchrotron self-Compton models are strongly favored by the delays and geometrical parameters inferred from the observations.
#### PDRs4All VI: Probing the Photochemical Evolution of PAHs in the Orion  Bar Using Machine Learning Techniques

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] JWST observations of the Orion Bar have shown the incredible richness of PAH bands and their variation on small scales. We aim to probe the photochemical evolution of PAHs across the key zones of the photodissociation region (PDR) that is the Orion Bar using unsupervised machine learning. We use NIRSpec and MIRI IFU data from the JWST ERS Program PDRs4All. We lever bisecting k-means clustering to generate detailed spatial maps of the spectral variability in several wavelength regions. We discuss the variations in the cluster profiles and connect them to the local physical conditions. We interpret these variations with respect to the key zones: the HII region, the atomic PDR zone, and the three dissociation fronts. The PAH emission exhibits spectral variation that depends strongly on spatial position in the PDR. We find the 8.6um band to behave differently than all other bands which vary systematically with one another. We find uniform variation in the 3.4-3.6um bands and 3.4/3.3 intensity ratio. We attribute the carrier of the 3.4-3.6um bands to a single side group attached to very similarly sized PAHs. Cluster profiles reveal a transition between characteristic profiles classes of the 11.2um feature from the atomic to the molecular PDR zone. We find the carriers of each of the profile classes to be independent, and reason the latter to be PAH clusters existing solely deep in the molecular PDR. Clustering also reveals a connection between the 11.2 and 6.2um bands; and that clusters generated from variation in the 10.9-11.63um region can be used to recover those in the 5.95-6.6um region. Clustering is a powerful tool for characterizing PAH variability on both spatial and spectral scales. For individual bands as well as global spectral behaviours, we find UV-processing to be the most important driver of the evolution of PAHs and their spectral signatures in the Orion Bar.
#### Synthesis of urea on the surface of interstellar water ice clusters. A  quantum chemical study

 - **Abstract**
 Urea is a prebiotic molecule that has been detected in few sources of the interstellar medium (ISM) and in Murchison meteorite. Being stable against ultraviolet radiation and high-energy electron bombardment, urea is expected to be present in interstellar ices. Theoretical and experimental studies suggest that isocyanic acid (HNCO) and formamide (NH$_2$CHO) are possible precursors of urea. However, uncertainties still exist regarding its formation routes. Previous computational works characterised urea formation in the gas phase or in presence of few water molecules by reaction of formamide with nitrogen-bearing species. In this work, we investigated the reaction of HNCO + NH$_3$ on an 18 water molecules ice cluster model mimicking interstellar ice mantles by means of quantum chemical computations. We characterised different mechanisms involving both closed-shell and open-shell species at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/ma-def2-TZVP level of theory, in which the radical-radical H$_2$NCO + NH$_2$ coupling has been found to be the most favourable one due to being almost barrierless. In this path, the presence of the icy surfaces is crucial for acting as reactant concentrators/suppliers, as well as third bodies able to dissipate the energy liberated during the urea formation.
#### Studying the variability of fluorescence emission and the presence of  clumpy wind in HMXB GX 301$-$2 using XMM-Newton

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an analysis of data from an \textit{XMM-Newton} observation of the accreting high mass X-ray binary pulsar GX 301$-$2. Spectral analysis in the non-flaring segment of the observation revealed that the equivalent width of the iron fluorescence emission is correlated with the observed absorption column density and the ratio of the iron K$\beta$ and K$\alpha$ line strength varied with the flux of the source. Coherent pulsations were detected with the spin period of the pulsar of 687.9$\pm$0.1 s, and a secondary pulsation was also detected with a period of 671.8$\pm$0.2 s, most prominent in the energy band of the iron line. At the spin period of the neutron star, the pulsation of the iron line has a low amplitude and the profile is different from the continuum. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy also revealed pulsations of the iron emission line during the non-flaring segment of the light curve. At the secondary period, both the iron line and the continuum have nearly identical pulse fraction and pulse profile. The additional periodicity can be attributed to the beat frequency between the spin of the neutron star and the Keplerian frequency of a stellar wind clump in retrograde motion around the neutron star. Reprocessed X-ray emissions originating from the clump can produce the observed secondary pulsations both in the continuum and the iron fluorescence line. The clump rotating around the neutron star is estimated to be approximately five lt-s away from the neutron star.
#### Potential Melting of Extrasolar Planets by Tidal Dissipation

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the $\textit{Voyager}$ spacecrafts. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, $\mu$, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e. $\mu/ (\rho g R_{\rm P})\gtrsim0.1$ for a body with density $\rho$, surface gravitational acceleration $g$, and radius $R_{\rm P}$, (ii) the surface is not molten, (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy, and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of $\mu/ (\rho g R_{\rm P})$, and find that more than $90\%$ of the core will melt due to this runaway for $\mu/ (\rho g R_{\rm P})\gtrsim1$. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5, 50, and $98\%$ SO$_2$ component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ preference for a model with SO$_2$ with 5-10 transits with $\textit{JWST}$ for L98-59bcd.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we focus on the period-luminosity relation (PLR) of $\delta$ Sct stars, in which mode excitation and selection mechanisms are still poorly constrained, and whose structure and oscillations are affected by rotation. We review the PLRs in the recent literature, and add a new inference from a large sample of $\delta$ Sct. We highlight the difficulty in identifying the fundamental mode and show that rotation-induced surface effects can impact the measured luminosities, explaining the broadening of the PLR. We derive a tight relation between the low-order large separation and the fundamental radial mode frequency (F0) that holds for rotating stars, thus paving the way towards mode identification. We show that the PLRs we obtain for different samples are compatible with each other and with the recent literature, and with most observed $\delta$ Sct stars when taking rotation effects into account. We also find that the highest-amplitude peak in the frequency spectrum corresponds to the fundamental mode in most $\delta$ Sct, thus shedding some light on their elusive mode selection mechanism.
#### TIC 378898110: A Bright, Short-Period AM CVn Binary in TESS

 - **Abstract**
 AM CVn-type systems are ultracompact, helium-accreting binary systems which are evolutionarily linked to the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae and are expected to be strong Galactic sources of gravitational waves detectable to upcoming space-based interferometers. AM CVn binaries with orbital periods $\lesssim$ 20--23 min exist in a constant high state with a permanently ionised accretion disc. We present the discovery of TIC 378898110, a bright ($G=14.3$ mag), nearby ($309.3 \pm 1.8$ pc), high-state AM CVn binary discovered in TESS two-minute-cadence photometry. At optical wavelengths this is the third-brightest AM CVn binary known. The photometry of the system shows a 23.07172(6) min periodicity, which is likely to be the `superhump' period and implies an orbital period in the range 22--23 min. There is no detectable spectroscopic variability. The system underwent an unusual, year-long brightening event during which the dominant photometric period changed to a shorter period (constrained to $20.5 \pm 2.0$ min), which we suggest may be evidence for the onset of disc-edge eclipses. The estimated mass transfer rate, $\log (\dot{M} / \mathrm{M_\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}) = -6.8 \pm 1.0$, is unusually high and may suggest a high-mass or thermally inflated donor. The binary is detected as an X-ray source, with a flux of $9.2 ^{+4.2}_{-1.8} \times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--10 keV range. TIC 378898110 is the shortest-period binary system discovered with TESS, and its large predicted gravitational-wave amplitude makes it a compelling verification binary for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide global models of line-driven winds of B supergiants for metallicities corresponding to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The velocity and density structure of the models is determined consistently from hydrodynamical equations with radiative force derived in the comoving frame and level populations computed from kinetic equilibrium equations. We provide a formula expressing the predicted mass-loss rates in terms of stellar luminosity, effective temperature, and metallicity. Predicted wind mass-loss rates decrease with decreasing metallicity as $\dot M\sim Z^{0.60}$ and are proportional to the stellar luminosity. The mass-loss rates increase below the region of the bistability jump at about 20\,kK because of iron recombination. In agreement with previous theoretical and observational studies, we find a smooth change of wind properties in the region of the bistability jump. With decreasing metallicity, the bistability jump becomes weaker and shifts to lower effective temperatures. At lower metallicities above the bistability jump, our predictions provide similar rates to those used in current evolutionary models, but our rates are significantly lower than older predictions below the bistability jump. Our predicted mass-loss rates agree with observational estimates derived from H$\alpha$ line assuming that observations of stellar winds from Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds are uniformly affected by clumping. The models nicely reproduce the dependence of terminal velocities on temperature derived from ultraviolet spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the design of a 5.5:1 bandwidth feed antenna and reflector system, intended for use in hydrogen intensity mapping experiments. The system is optimized to reduce systematic effects that can arise in these experiments from scattering within the feed/reflector and cross-coupling between antennas. The proposed feed is an ultra wideband Vivaldi style design and was optimized to have a smooth frequency response, high gain, and minimal shadowing of the reflector dish. This feed can optionally include absorptive elements which reduce systematics but degrade sensitivity. The proposed reflector is a deep parabolic dish with $f/d = 0.216$ along with an elliptical collar to provide additional shielding. The procedure for optimizing these design choices is described.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a technique called NKL, which cleans both polarized and unpolarized foregrounds from HI intensity maps by applying a Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform on the needlet coefficients. In NKL, one takes advantage of correlations not only along the line of sight, but also between different angular regions, referred to as ``chunks". This provides a distinct advantage over many of the standard techniques applied to map-space that one finds in the literature, which do not consider such spatial correlations. Moreover, the NKL technique does not require any priors on the nature of the foregrounds, which is important when considering polarized foregrounds. We also introduce a modified version of GNILC, referred to as MGNILC, which incorporates an approximation of the foregrounds to improve performance. The NKL and MGNILC techniques are tested on simulated maps which include polarized foregrounds. Their performance is compared to the GNILC, GMCA, ICA and PCA techniques. Two separate tests were performed. One at $1.84 < z < 2.55$ and the other at $0.31 < z < 0.45$. NKL was found to provide the best performance in both tests, providing a factor of 10 to 50 improvement over GNILC at $k < 0.1\,{\rm hMpc^{-1}}$ in the higher redshift case and $k < 0.03 \,{\rm hMpc^{-1}}$ in the lower redshift case. However, none of the methods were found to recover the power spectrum satisfactorily at all BAO scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric escape in exoplanets has traditionally been observed using hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ and H-$\alpha$ transmission spectroscopy, but more recent detections have utilised the metastable helium triplet at 1083$~$nm. Since this feature is accessible from the ground, it offers new possibilities for studying atmospheric escape. Our goal is to understand how the observability of escaping helium evolves during the lifetime of a highly irradiated gas giant. We extend our previous work on 1-D self-consistent hydrodynamic escape from hydrogen-only atmospheres as a function of planetary evolution to the first evolution-focused study of escaping hydrogen-helium atmospheres. Additionally, using these novel models we perform helium triplet transmission spectroscopy. We adapt our previous hydrodynamic escape model to now account for both hydrogen and helium heating and cooling processes and simultaneously solve for the population of helium in the triplet state. To account for the planetary evolution, we utilise evolving predictions of planetary radii for a close-in 0.3$~M_{\rm Jup}$ gas giant and its received stellar flux in X-ray, hard and soft EUV, and mid-UV wavelength bins assuming a K dwarf stellar host. We find that the helium triplet signature diminishes with evolution. Our models suggest that young ($\lesssim 150$~Myr), close-in gas giants ($\sim 1$ to $2~R_{\rm Jup}$) should produce helium 1083$~$nm transit absorptions of $\sim 4\%$ or $\sim 7\%$, for a slow or fast-rotating K dwarf, respectively, assuming a 2$\%$ helium abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 The reconstruction of the large scale velocity field from the grouped Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) database is presented. The lognormal bias of the inferred distances and velocities data is corrected by the Bias Gaussianization correction (BGc) scheme, and the linear density and velocity fields are reconstructed by means of the Wiener filter (WF) and constrained realizations (CRs) algorithm. These tools are tested against a suite of random and constrained Cosmicflows-3-like mock data. The CF4 data consists of 3 main subsamples - the 6dFGS and the SDSS data - and the `others'. The individual contributions of the subsamples have been studied. The quantitative analysis of the velocity field is done mostly by the mean overdensity ($\Delta_L(R)$) and the bulk velocity ($V_{\mathrm{bulk}}(R)$) profiles of the velocity field out to $300\, h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. The $V_{\mathrm{bulk}}(R)$ and $\Delta_{\mathrm L}(R)$ profiles of the CF4 data without its 6dFGS component are consistent with the cosmic variance to within $1\sigma$. The 6dFGS sample dominates the $V_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ ($\Delta_{\mathrm L}$) profile beyond $\sim120\, h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and drives it to roughly a $3.4\sigma$ ($-1.9\sigma$) excess (deficiency) relative to the cosmic variance at $R\sim250\ (190)\ \, h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. The excess in the amplitude of $V_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ is dominated by its Supergalactic X component, roughly in the direction of the Shapley Concentration. The amplitude and alignment of the inferred velocity field from the CF4 data is at $\sim(2\,-\,3)\,\sigma$ discrepancy with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Namely, it is somewhat atypical but yet there is no compelling tension with the model.

 - **Abstract**
 For the analysis of data taken by Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), a large number of air shower simulations are needed to derive the instrument response. The simulations are very complex, involving computational and memory-intensive calculations, and are usually performed repeatedly for different observation intervals to take into account the varying optical sensitivity of the instrument. The use of generative models based on deep neural networks offers the prospect for memory-efficient storing of huge simulation libraries and cost-effective generation of a large number of simulations in an extremely short time. In this work, we use Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks to generate photon showers for an IACT equipped with the FlashCam design, which has more than $1{,}500$ pixels. Using simulations of the H.E.S.S. experiment, we demonstrate the successful generation of high-quality IACT images. The analysis includes a comprehensive study of the generated image quality based on low-level observables and the well-known Hillas parameters that describe the shower shape. We demonstrate for the first time that the generated images have high fidelity with respect to low-level observables, the Hillas parameters, their physical properties, as well as their correlations. The found increase in generation speed in the order of $10^5$ yields promising prospects for fast and memory-efficient simulations of air showers for IACTs.
#### Search for the wide-orbit massive companion of XO-7b in the follow-up  radial-velocity and transit-timing data: no significant clues

 - **Abstract**
 XO-7b is a hot Jupiter transiting a $V = 10.52$ mag G0V-type star. The planetary system is interesting because the linear slope in the discovery radial-velocity (RV) data indicated a wide-orbit massive companion. In 2020 we started an RV campaign for the system with the main scientific goal to follow-up this linear slope, and to put constraints on the orbital period of the companion. Furthermore, we aimed at refining the system parameters and we wanted to probe transit timing variations (TTVs) of XO-7b in order to search for long-term dynamical signs of the companion of XO-7b in the observed-minus-calculated (O-C) data of mid-transit times. Apart from the discovery RVs, we obtained and analyzed 20 follow-up RV observations and TESS photometric data. The previously observed significant linear RV slope was not confirmed with the follow-up RV data, where we detected only a marginal linear slope with the opposite trend. If the announced companion really exists, the most convincing explanation is that both RV datasets were collected near its quadrature position. Based on the RVs we estimated the minimum orbital period, which is $P_\mathrm{orb,min,3} \gtrsim 7900 \pm 1660$ d, and the 'minimum' minimum mass of the companion, which is $(M_3 \sin i)_\mathrm{min} = 16.7 \pm 3.5~\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$. We did not find significant evidence of the companion of XO-7b in the O-C dataset of mid-transit times. We can again conclude that if the announced companion really exists, this is in agreement with previous results that distant companions of exoplanets are only known by RV solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Next generation high contrast imaging instruments face a challenging trade off: they will be required to deliver data with high spectral resolution at a relatively fast cadence (minutes) and across a wide field of view (arcseconds). For instruments that employ focal plane wavefront sensing and therefore require super-Nyquist sampling, these requirements cannot simultaneously be met with a traditional lenslet integral field spectrograph (IFU). For the SPIDERS pathfinder instrument, we are demonstrating an imaging Fourier transform spectrograph (IFTS) that offers a different set of tradeoffs than a lenslet IFU, delivering up to R20,000 spectral resolution across a dark hole. We present preliminary results from the SPIDERS IFTS including a chromaticity analysis of its dark hole and demonstrate a spectral differential imaging (SDI) improvement of up to 40 $\times$, and a first application of spectro-coherent differential imaging, combining both coherent differential imaging (CDI) and SDI.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of 21\,cm line from neutral hydrogen promise to be an exciting new probe of astrophysics and cosmology during the Cosmic Dawn and through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) to when dark energy accelerates the expansion of the Universe. At each of these epochs, separating bright foregrounds from the cosmological signal is a primary challenge that requires exquisite calibration. In this paper, we present a new calibration method called \textsc{nucal} that extends redundant-baseline calibration, allowing spectral variation in antenna responses to be solved for by using correlations between visibilities measuring the same angular Fourier modes at different frequencies. By modeling the chromaticity of the beam-weighted sky with a tunable set of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), we develop a calibration loop that optimizes for spectrally smooth calibrated visibilities. Crucially, this technique does not require explicit models of the sky or the primary beam. With simulations that incorporate realistic source and beam chromaticity, we show that this method solves for unsmooth bandpass features, exposes narrowband interference systematics, and suppresses smooth-spectrum foregrounds below the level of 21\,cm reionization models, even within much of the so-called "wedge" region where current foreground mitigation techniques struggle. We show that this foreground subtraction can be performed with minimal cosmological signal loss for certain well-sampled angular Fourier modes, making spectral-redundant calibration a promising technique for current and next-generation 21\,cm intensity mapping experiments.
#### Developing a Drift Rate Distribution for Technosignature Searches of  Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 A stable-frequency transmitter with relative radial acceleration to a receiver will show a change in received frequency over time, known as a "drift rate''. For a transmission from an exoplanet, we must account for multiple components of drift rate: the exoplanet's orbit and rotation, the Earth's orbit and rotation, and other contributions. Understanding the drift rate distribution produced by exoplanets relative to Earth, can a) help us constrain the range of drift rates to check in a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project to detect radio technosignatures and b) help us decide validity of signals-of-interest, as we can compare drifting signals with expected drift rates from the target star. In this paper, we modeled the drift rate distribution for $\sim$5300 confirmed exoplanets, using parameters from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA). We find that confirmed exoplanets have drift rates such that 99\% of them fall within the $\pm$53 nHz range. This implies a distribution-informed maximum drift rate $\sim$4 times lower than previous work. To mitigate the observational biases inherent in the NEA, we also simulated an exoplanet population built to reduce these biases. The results suggest that, for a Kepler-like target star without known exoplanets, $\pm$0.44 nHz would be sufficient to account for 99\% of signals. This reduction in recommended maximum drift rate is partially due to inclination effects and bias towards short orbital periods in the NEA. These narrowed drift rate maxima will increase the efficiency of searches and save significant computational effort in future radio technosignature searches.
#### Cosmological foundations revisited with Pantheon+

 - **Abstract**
 We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the "timescape cosmology", with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we consider the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue, which is the largest available Type Ia supernova dataset for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. Within this framework, which goes far beyond most other definitions of "model independence", we introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SneIa) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables a refined analysis of the distribution biases of SneIa light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x_1$. For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model. "Dark energy" is generally invoked as a place-holder for "new physics". Our from-first-principles reanalysis of the Pantheon+ catalogue supports future deeper studies of the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry, in a data-driven setting. For the first time in 25 years, we find evidence that the Pantheon+ catalogue already contains such a wealth of data that with further reanalysis, a genuine "paradigm shift" may soon emerge.
