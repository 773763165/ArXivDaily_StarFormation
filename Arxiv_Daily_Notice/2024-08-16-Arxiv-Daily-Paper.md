          Investing in the Unrivaled Potential of Wide-Separation Sub-Jupiter Exoplanet Detection and Characterisation with JWST -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper

 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for a large scale imaging survey of nearby young moving groups and star-forming regions to directly detect exoplanets over an unexplored range of masses, ages and orbits. Discovered objects will be identified early enough in JWST's lifetime to leverage its unparalleled capabilities for long-term atmospheric characterisation, and will uniquely complement the known population of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Furthermore, this survey will constrain the occurrence of the novel wide sub-Jovian exoplanet population, informing multiple theories of planetary formation and evolution. Observations with NIRCam F200W+F444W dual-band coronagraphy will readily provide sub-Jupiter mass sensitivities beyond ~0.4" (F444W) and can also be used to rule out some contaminating background sources (F200W). At this large scale, targets can be sequenced by spectral type to enable robust self-referencing for PSF subtraction. This eliminates the need for dedicated reference observations required by GO programs and dramatically increases the overall science observing efficiency. With an exposure of ~30 minutes per target, the sub-Jupiter regime can be explored across 250 targets for ~400 hours of exposure time including overheads. An additional, pre-allocated, ~100 hours of observing time would enable rapid multi-epoch vetting of the lowest mass detections (which are undetectable in F200W). The total time required for a survey such as this is not fixed, and could be scaled in conjunction with the minimum number of detected exoplanet companions.
#### Title:
          The Unrealised Interdisciplinary Advantage of Observing High Mass Transiting Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper

 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for further prioritisation of atmospheric characterisation observations of high mass transiting exoplanets and brown dwarfs. This population acts as a unique comparative sample to the directly imaged exoplanet and brown dwarf populations, of which a range of JWST characterisation observations are planned. In contrast, only two observations of transiting exoplanets in this mass regime were performed in Cycle 1, and none are planned for Cycle 2. Such observations will: improve our understanding of how irradiation influences high gravity atmospheres, provide insights towards planetary formation and evolution across this mass regime, and exploit JWST's unique potential to characterise exoplanets across the known population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the serendipitous discovery of a new radio-continuum ring-like object nicknamed Kyklos (J1802-3353), with MeerKAT UHF and L-band observations. The radio ring, which resembles the recently discovered odd radio circles (ORCs), has a diameter of 80 arcsec and is located just 6 deg from the Galactic plane. However, Kyklos exhibits an atypical thermal radio-continuum spectrum ({\alpha} = -0.1 +/- 0.3), which led us to explore different possible formation scenarios. We concluded that a circumstellar shell around an evolved massive star, possibly a Wolf-Rayet, is the most convincing explanation with the present data.

 - **Abstract**
 In ground-based astronomy, the ability to couple light into single-mode fibers (SMFs) is limited by atmospheric turbulence, which prohibits the use of many astrophotonic instruments. We propose a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip capable of coherently coupling the out-of-phase beamlets from the subapertures of a telescope pupil into an SMF. The photonic integrated circuit (PIC) consists of an array of grating couplers that are used to inject light from free space into single-mode waveguides on the chip. Metallic heaters modulate the refractive index of a coiled section of the waveguides, facilitating the co-phasing of the propagating modes. The phased beamlets can then be coherently combined to efficiently deliver the light to an output SMF. In an adaptive optics (AO) system, the phase corrector acts as a deformable mirror (DM) commanded by a controller that takes phase measurements from a wavefront sensor (WFS). We present experimental results for the PIC tested on an AO testbed and compare the performance to simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) by measuring the perturbations that this background induces in the time-of-arrivals of pulsar signals. These perturbations are expected to be correlated across different pulsars and, for isotropic GWBs, the expected values of these correlations (obtained by averaging over different GWB realizations) are a simple function of the pulsars' angular separations, known as the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation function. On the other hand, anisotropic GWBs would induce deviations from these HD correlations in a way that can be used to search for anisotropic distributions of the GWB power. However, even for isotropic GWBs, interference between GW sources radiating at overlapping frequencies induces deviations from the HD correlation pattern, an effect known in the literature as "cosmic variance". In this work, we study the impact of cosmic variance on PTA anisotropy searches. We find that the fluctuations in cross-correlations related to cosmic variance can lead to the miss-classification of isotropic GWBs as anisotropic, leading to a false detection rate of $\sim 50\%$ for frequentist anisotropy searches. We also observe that cosmic variance complicates the reconstruction of the GWB sky map, making it more challenging to resolve bright GW hotspots, like the ones expected to be produced from a Supermassive Black Hole Binaries population. These findings highlight the need to refine anisotropy search techniques to improve our ability to reconstruct the GWB sky map and accurately assess the significance of any isotropy deviations we might find in it.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to understand the nature of super-Eddington accretion we must explore both the emission emerging directly from the inflow and its impact on the surroundings. In this paper we test whether we can use the optical line emission of spatially resolved, ionized nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as a proxy for their X-ray luminosity. We choose the ULX NGC 6946 X-1 and its nebula, MF16, as a test case. By studying how the nebular optical line emission responds to assumed irradiation, we can infer the degree to which we require the UV or X-ray emission from the inflow to be collimated by optically thick winds seemingly ubiquitously associated with ULXs. We find that the nebula is highly sensitive to compact UV emission but mostly insensitive to hard X-rays. Our attempts to quantify the beaming of the soft and hard X-rays therefore strongly depends on the UV luminosity of the ULX in the center of the nebula. We find that it is not possible to conclude a lack of geometrical beaming of hard X-rays from such sources via nebula feedback.

          The effects of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio on the condensate compositions around Solar-like stars

 - **Abstract**
 The initial stellar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio can have a large impact on the resulting condensed species present in the protoplanetary disk and, hence, the composition of the bodies and planets that form. The observed C/O ratios of stars can vary from 0.1-2. We use a sequential dust condensation model to examine the impact of the C/O ratio on the composition of solids around a Solar-like star. We utilize this model in a focused examination of the impact of varying the initial stellar C/O ratio to isolate the effects of the C/O ratio in the context of Solar-like stars. We describe three different system types in our findings. The Solar system falls into the silicate-dominant, low C/O ratio systems which end at a stellar C/O ratio somewhere between 0.52 and 0.6. At C/O ratios between about 0.6 and 0.9, we have intermediate systems. Intermediate systems show a decrease in silicates while carbides begin to become significant. Carbide-dominant systems begin around a C/O ratio of 0.9. Carbide-dominant systems exhibit high carbide surface densities at inner radii with comparable levels of carbides and silicates at outer radii. Our models show that changes between C/O=0.8 and C/O=1 are more significant than previous studies, that carbon can exceed 80% of the condensed mass, and that carbon condensation can be significant at radii up to 6 AU.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the motion of test particles and the properties of accretion disks around rotating, accelerating black hole spacetimes with non-zero cosmological constants. To do so, we explore the impact of both rotation and acceleration on massive particle dynamics in motion around these configurations. In this respect, we derive the geodesic equations in the Pleba{ń}ski-Demia{ń}ski spacetime and analyse the characteristics of circular orbits, including the innermost and outermost stable circular orbits. Accordingly, we find that the acceleration parameter significantly influences the radii and angular momenta of these orbits. Further, we examine the precession of non-circular orbits and find that the precession is in the same direction as the black hole rotation regardless of the direction of the black hole spin. We also investigate the thermal spectra of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks described by the Novikov-Thorne model. We consider both co-rotating and counter-rotating disks and show that the radiative flux and luminosity are significantly larger for co-rotating disks. We compare the spectral features and luminosity of accretion disks around accelerating black holes with those around non-accelerating Kerr black holes, revealing that acceleration generally reduces the luminosity and flux of emitted light. Our results provide insights into the complex interplay between black hole acceleration, rotation, and the surrounding accretion disk dynamics.

          Probing non-minimal coupling through super-horizon instability and secondary gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre > 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Particularly for $\xi >1$ such instability causes substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in an intermediate-frequency range that is strong enough to be detected by future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong upper bound on the value of $\xi$ depending upon the value of $\wre$ and reheating temperature $\Tre$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \lesssim 4.0$ for any value of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, reheating equation of state within $ 1/2 \leq\wre \leq 1$, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. However, for $\wre < 1/3$, $\xi$ is found to be unconstrained by any known observation. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.

          The $\sim$50-Myr-Old TOI-942c is Likely on an Aligned, Coplanar Orbit and Losing Mass

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observation of the transiting planet TOI-942c, a Neptunian planet orbiting a young K-type star approximately 50 Myr years old. Using Keck/HIRES, we observed a partial transit of the planet and detected an associated radial velocity anomaly. By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we derived a sky-projected obliquity of $\left|\lambda\right|=24^{+14}_{-14}$ degrees, indicating TOI-942c is in a prograde and likely aligned orbit. Upon incorporation of the star's inclination and the planet's orbital inclination, we determined a true obliquity for TOI-942c of $\psi< 43$ degrees at 84\% confidence, while dynamic analysis strongly suggests TOI-942c is aligned with stellar spin and coplanar with the inner planet. Furthermore, TOI-942c is also a suitable target for studying atmospheric loss of young Neptunian planets that are likely still contracting from the heat of formation. We observed a blueshifted excess absorption in the H-alpha line at 6564.7 Å, potentially indicating atmospheric loss due to photoevaporation. However, due to the lack of pre-ingress data, additional observations are needed to confirm this measurement.

 - **Abstract**
 We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to one year after explosion. We find that, when compared to two pre-existing model grids, the pseudo-bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of ${\tt MESA+STELLA}$ single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\rm exp}\approx7\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor ($\gtrsim 17\ M_{\odot}$) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\lesssim 3\ M_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\gtrsim 950\ R_{\odot}$ and a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.07\ M_{\odot}$. We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C.~Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio observations toward N49, one of the brightest extragalactic Supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our new and archival ATCA radio observations were analysed along with $Chandra$ X-ray data. These observations show a prominent `bullet' shaped feature beyond the southwestern boundary of the SNR. Both X-ray morphology and radio polarisation analysis support a physical connection of this feature to the SNR. The 'bullet' feature's apparent velocity is estimated at $\sim$1300 km s$^{-1}$, based on its distance ($\sim$10 pc) from the remnant's geometric centre and estimated age ($\sim$7600 yrs). we estimated the radio spectral index, $\alpha= -0.55 \pm 0.03$ which is typical of middle-age SNRs. Polarisation maps created for N49 show low to moderate levels of mean fractional polarisation estimated at 7$\pm$1% and 10$\pm$1% for 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. These values are noticeably larger than found in previous studies. Moreover, the mean value for the Faraday rotation of SNR N49 from combining CABB data is 212$\pm$65 rad m$^{-2}$ and the maximum value of RM is 591$\pm$103 rad m$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The performance of fiber-fed astronomical spectrographs is highly influenced by the properties of fibers. The near-field and far-field scrambling characteristics have a profound impact on the line spread function (LSF) of the spectra. Focal ratio degradation (FRD) influences the output beam size, thereby affecting the throughput, as well as the size of the collimator and dispersion elements. While previous research has indicated that these properties depend on the shape of the fiber core and showed that non-circular core fibers can yield uniform near-field scrambling, the result remains inconclusive for far-field. In this study, we investigate the near-field and far-field scrambling properties, along with the FRD, of 50-micron core fibers with different core geometries. We find that in addition to excellent near-field scrambling, octagonal-core fibers can also produce more uniform far-field output when compared to circular-core fibers. They also have less FRD effect when being fed with a f/3 beam.

          IC 10 X-1: A Double Black Hole Progenitor Probably Formed through Stable Mass Transfer

 - **Abstract**
 IC 10 X-1 is one of close X-ray binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet donor, which can provide an evolutionary link between high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. It is still unclear about the precise nature of the accreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole than a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method to simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1 like binaries by assuming different common-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward over previous studies since we adopt new criteria of mass-transfer stability. These criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1 like systems without experiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose that the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a black hole with mass of $\sim 10-30M_\odot$ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just experienced stable mass transfer.

          Constraining Ultralight ALP Dark Matter in Light of Cosmic Birefringence

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic birefringence, the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), serves as a compelling probe for parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. This study explores the potential of ultralight axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter to explain the observed cosmic birefringence in the CMB. We focus on the previously understudied mass range of $10^{-25}$ eV to $10^{-23}$ eV, where ALPs start to undergo nonlinear clustering in the late universe. Our analysis incorporates recent cosmological constraints and considers the washout effect on CMB polarization. We find that for models with ALP masses $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV and birefringence arising from late ALP clustering, the upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling constant, imposed by the washout effect, is stringently lower than the coupling required to account for the observed static cosmic birefringence signal. This discrepancy persists regardless of the ALP fraction in dark matter. Furthermore, considering ALPs with masses $m_\phi\gtrsim$ $10^{-23}$ eV cannot explain static birefringence due to their rapid field oscillations, our results indicate that, all ALP dark matter candidates capable of nonlinear clustering in the late universe and thus contributing mainly to the rotation angle of polarized photons, are incompatible with explaining the static cosmic birefringence signal observed in Planck and WMAP data.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of ionic, atomic, or molecular lines are performed to improve our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the potential of a line to constrain the physical conditions of the ISM is difficult to assess quantitatively, because of the complexity of the ISM physics. The situation is even more complex when trying to assess which combinations of lines are the most useful. Therefore, observation campaigns usually try to observe as many lines as possible for as much time as possible. We search for a quantitative statistical criterion to evaluate the constraining power of a (or combination of) tracer(s) with respect to physical conditions in order to improve our understanding of the statistical relationships between ISM tracers and physical conditions and helps observers to motivate their observation proposals. The best tracers are obtained by comparing the mutual information between a physical parameter and different sets of lines. We apply this method to simulations of radio molecular lines emitted by a photodissociation region similar to the Horsehead Nebula that would be observed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We search for the best lines to constrain the visual extinction $A_v^{tot}$ or the far UV illumination $G_0$. The most informative lines change with the physical regime (e.g., cloud extinction). Short integration time of the CO isotopologue $J=1-0$ lines already yields much information on the total column density most regimes. The best set of lines to constrain the visual extinction does not necessarily combine the most informative individual lines. Precise constraints on $G_0$ are more difficult to achieve with molecular lines. They require spectral lines emitted at the cloud surface (e.g., [CII] and [CI] lines). This approach allows one to better explore the knowledge provided by ISM codes, and to guide future observation campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 Significant progress has been made toward understanding the formation of massive ($M > 8~$M$_{\odot}$) binaries in close orbits. For example, the detection of a very low velocity dispersion among the massive stars in the young region M17 and the measurement of a positive trend of velocity dispersion with age in Galactic clusters. The velocity dispersion observed in M17 could be explained either by the lack of binaries among the stars in this region or by larger binary separations than typically observed, but with a binary fraction similar to other young Galactic clusters. The latter implies that over time, the binary components migrate toward each other. We aim to determine the origin of the strikingly low velocity dispersion by determining the observed and intrinsic binary fraction of massive stars in M17 through multi-epoch spectroscopy. We performed a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey consisting of three epochs separated by days and months. We determine the radial velocity of each star at each epoch by fitting the stellar absorption profiles. We determine an observed binary fraction of 27% and an intrinsic binary fraction of 87%, consistent with that of other Galactic clusters. We conclude that the low velocity dispersion is due to a large separation among the young massive binaries in M17. Our result is in agreement with a migration scenario in which massive stars are born in binaries or higher order systems at large separation and harden within the first million years of evolution. Such an inward migration may either be driven by interaction with a remnant accretion disk, with other young stellar objects present in the system or by dynamical interactions within the cluster. Our results imply that possibly both dynamical interactions and binary evolution are key processes in the formation of gravitational wave sources.

 - **Abstract**
 HCN molecules serve as an important tracer for chemical evolution of elemental nitrogen in the regions of star and planet formation. This is largely explained by the fact that N atoms and N$_2$ molecules are poorly accessible for the observation in the radio and infrared ranges. In turn, gas-phase HCN can be observed at various stages of star formation including disks arounds young stars, cometary comas and atmospheres of the planetary satellites. Despite the large geography of gas-phase observations, an identification of interstellar HCN ice is still lacking. In this work we present a series of infrared spectroscopic measurements performed at the new ultra-high vacuum cryogenic apparatus aiming to facilitate the search for interstellar HCN ice. A series of high resolution laboratory infrared spectra of HCN molecules embedded in the H$_2$O, H$_2$O:NH$_3$, CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH ices at 10~K temperature is obtained. These interstellar ice analogues aim to simulate the surroundings of HCN molecules by the main constituents of the icy mantles on the surface of the interstellar grains. In addition, the spectra of HCN molecules embedded in the solid C$_6$H$_6$, C$_5$H$_5$N and C$_6$H$_5$NH$_2$ are obtained to somehow simulate the interaction of HCN molecules with carbonaceous material of the grains rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The acquired laboratory spectroscopic data are compared with the publicly available results of NIRSpec James Webb Space Telescope observations towards quiescent molecular clouds performed by the ICEAge team.

 - **Abstract**
 Intensity interferometry is a reemerging astronomical technique for performing high angular resolution studies at visible wavelengths, benefiting immensely from the recent improvements in (single) photon detection instrumentation. Contrary to direct imaging or amplitude interferometry, intensity interferometry correlates light intensities rather than light amplitudes, circumventing atmospheric seeing limitations at the cost of reduced sensitivity. In this paper we present measurements with the 1.04 m Omicron telescope of C2PU (Centre Pédagogique Planète Univers) at the Calern Observatory in the south of France featuring hybrid single photon counting detectors (HPDs). We successfully measured photon bunching from temporal correlations of three different A-type stars - Vega, Altair and Deneb - in the blue at 405 nm. In all cases the observed coherence time fits well to both the pre-calculated expectations as well as the values measured in preceding laboratory tests. The best signal to noise ratio (SNR), with a value of 12, is obtained for Vega for an observation time of 12.1 h. The combination of HPDs and time to digital converter (TDC) results in a timing jitter of the detection system < 50 ps. Our setup demonstrates stable and efficient detection of the starlight owed to the large active area of the HPDs. Utilizing a new class of large area single photon detectors based on multichannel plate amplification, high resolution spatial intensity interferometry experiments are within reach at 1 m diameter class telescopes within one night of observation time for bright stars.

 Until now it has not been possible to obtain the proper motions of PSR B1849+00 with timing techniques or VLBI imaging given the enhanced interstellar scattering along its line of sight. We present an analysis of archive Very Large Array observations at epochs from 2012 to 2022 that indicates a total proper motion of 23.9$\pm$5.5 mas yr$^{-1}$ toward the southwest. After correction for the proper motions produced by galactic rotation, we find a peculiar transverse velocity of $\simeq$740 km s$^{-1}$. We searched unsuccessfully along the past trajectory of the pulsar for an associated supernova remnant. In particular, W44 is in this trajectory but its distance is different to that of PSR B1849+00.

          Absence of one-loop effects on large scales from small scales in non-slow-roll dynamics II: Quartic interactions and consistency relations

 - **Abstract**
 We prove explicitly the absence of one-loop corrections to large scales from small scales in transient non-slow-roll dynamics. Specifically, we address loop corrections to the primordial power spectrum, relative to tree-level, that are independent of the ratio between the two scales. We review all the necessary components, adapted to our context, to express one-loop diagrams as three-point functions, emphasizing the crucial role played by quartic interactions. Notably, we include the quartic Hamiltonian induced by the cubic Lagrangian and quartic interactions that are ensured by diffeomorphism invariance. We then explicitly prove consistency relations for an arbitrary transient non-slow-roll phase involving operators with (time) derivatives. Finally, we calculate one-loop corrections by including contributions from the relevant cubic and quartic interactions, and express the final result as a total derivative term over comoving momenta, utilizing the consistency relations we established. This leads us to conclude that one-loop corrections to long-wavelength modes are unaffected by the physics of short and enhanced modes in non-slow-roll dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We use data from the ALMA Evolutionary Study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey to study 100 ALMAGAL regions at $\sim$ 1\arcsec~ resolution located between $\sim$ 2 and 6~kpc distance. Using ALMAGAL $\sim$ 1.3mm line and continuum data we estimate flow rates onto individual cores. We focus specifically on flow rates along filamentary structures associated with these cores. Our primary analysis is centered around position velocity cuts in H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$ - 2$_{0,2}$) which allow us to measure the velocity fields, surrounding these cores. Combining this work with column density estimates we derive the flow rates along the extended filamentary structures associated with cores in these regions. We select a sample of 100 ALMAGAL regions covering four evolutionary stages from quiescent to protostellar, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), and \HII~regions (25 each). Using dendrogram and line analysis, we identify a final sample of 182 cores in 87 regions. In this paper, we present 728 flow rates for our sample (4 per core), analysed in the context of evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass. On average, for the whole sample, we derive flow rates on the order of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ with estimated uncertainties of $\pm$50\%. We see increasing differences in the values among evolutionary stages, most notably between the less evolved (quiescent/protostellar) and more evolved (YSO/\HII~region) sources. We also see an increasing trend as we move further away from the centre of these cores. We also find a clear relationship between the flow rates and core masses $\sim$M$^{2/3}$ which is in line with the result expected from the tidal-lobe accretion mechanism. Overall, we see increasing trends in the relationships between the flow rate and the three investigated parameters; evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass.

 - **Abstract**
 As a part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we investigate indirect evidence of gas inflow into the disk of the galaxy NGC 99. We combine optical spectra from the Binospec spectrograph on the MMT telescope with optical imaging data from the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, radio HI 21 cm emission images from the NSF Karl G. Jansky's Very Large Array, and UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O III]$\lambda5007$, [N II]$\lambda6583$, and [S II]$\lambda6717,31$) in 26 H II regions scattered about the galaxy and estimate a radial metallicity gradient of $-0.017$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the N2 metallicity indicator. Two regions in the sample exhibit an anomalously low metallicity (ALM) of 12+log(O/H) = 8.36 dex, which is $\sim$0.16 dex lower than other regions at that galactocentric radius. They also show a high difference between their HI and H$\alpha$ line of sight velocities on the order of 35 km s$^{-1}$. Chemical evolution modeling indicates gas accretion as the cause of the ALM regions. We find evidence for corotation between the interstellar medium of NGC 99 and Ly$\alpha$ clouds in its circumgalactic medium, which suggests a possible pathway for low metallicity gas accretion. We also calculate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR) on sub-kpc scales using localized gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star-formation rate surface density. The rFMR shows a similar trend as that found by previous localized and global FMR relations.
