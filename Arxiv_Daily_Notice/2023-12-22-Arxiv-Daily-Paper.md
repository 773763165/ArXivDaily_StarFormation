 - **Abstract**
 We identify a horseshoe-shaped ring (HSR) of diffuse emission in J1407+0453 from the Faint Images of Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey using the Very Large Array telescope. An optical galaxy SDSSJ140709.01+045302.1 is present near the limb of the HSR of J1407+0453, with a spectroscopic redshift of $z=0.13360$. The total extent of the source, including the diffuse emission of J1407+0453, is 65 arcsec (with a physical extent of 160 kpc), whereas the diameter of the HSR is approximately 10 arcsec (25 kpc). The flux density of HSR is $\sim$47 mJy at 1400 MHz whereas the flux densities of whole diffuse emission of J1407+0453 at 1400 MHz and 150 MHz are 172 mJy and 763 mJy, respectively. We measure the radio luminosity of HSR J1407+0453 as 1.94 $\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ with a spectral index $\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.67$. The black hole mass of J1407+0453 is 5.8$\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. We compare the HSR of diffuse emission of J1407+0453 with other discovered diffused circular sources. The possible formation scenarios for J1407+0453 are discussed to understand the nature of the source. We present a spectral index map of 147+0453 to study the spectral properties of the source.

 - **Abstract**
 Perturbations to stellar systems can reflect the gravitational influence of dark matter substructures. Whereas perturbations to cold stellar systems are the most commonly studied, the sources of perturbations to dynamically hot systems are less ambiguous because such systems cannot support persistent inhomogeneity on small scales. We point out a simple algebraic relationship between the two-point statistics of a hot stellar system and those of the perturbing matter. The density and velocity power spectra of the stars are proportional to the density power spectrum of the perturbers, scaled by $k^{-4}$. This relationship allows easy evaluation of the suitability of a stellar system for detecting dark substructure. As examples, we show that the Galactic stellar halo is expected to be sensitive to cold dark matter substructure at wave numbers $k\lesssim 0.4$ kpc$^{-1}$, and the Galactic disk might be sensitive to substructure at wave numbers $k\sim 4$ kpc$^{-1}$. These systems could provide direct measurements of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at these wave numbers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the AM$^3$ (``Astrophysical Multi-Messenger Modeling'') software, which has been successfully used in the past to simulate the multi-messenger emission, including neutrinos, from active galactic nuclei, including the blazar sub-class, gamma-ray bursts, and tidal disruption events. AM$^3$ is a documented state-of-the-art open source software that efficiently solves the coupled integro-differential equations for the spectral and temporal evolution of the relevant particle densities (photons, electrons, positrons, protons, neutrons, pions, muons, and neutrinos). AM$^3$ includes all relevant non-thermal processes (synchrotron, inverse Compton scattering, photon-photon annihilation, proton-proton and proton-photon pion production, and photo-pair production). The software self-consistently calculates the full cascade of primary and secondary particles, outperforming simple test-particle approaches, and allows for non-linear feedback and predictions in the time domain. It also allows to track separately the contributions of different radiative processes to the overall photon and neutrino spectra, including the different hadronic interaction channels. With its efficient hybrid solver combining analytical and numerical techniques, AM$^3$ combines efficiency and accuracy at a user-adjustable level. We describe the technical details of the numerical framework and present examples of applications to various astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has led to a deeper understanding of binaries of ordinary astrophysical objects, including neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we point out that binary systems may also exist in a dark sector with astrophysical-mass macroscopic dark matter. These "dark binaries," when coupled to an additional attractive long-range dark force, may generate a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with a characteristic spectrum different from ordinary binaries. We find that the SGWB from planet-mass dark binaries is detectable by space- and ground-based GW observatories. The contribution to the SGWB today is smaller from binaries that merge before recombination than after, avoiding constraints on extra radiation degrees of freedom while potentially leaving a detectable GW signal at high frequencies up to tens of GHz.

 - **Abstract**
 The direct imaging of an Earth-like exoplanet will require sub-nanometric wavefront control across large light-collecting apertures, to reject host starlight and detect the faint planetary signal. Current adaptive optics (AO) systems, which use wavefront sensors that reimage the telescope pupil, face two challenges that prevent this level of control: non-common-path aberrations (NCPAs), caused by differences between the sensing and science arms of the instrument; and petaling modes: discontinuous phase aberrations caused by pupil fragmentation, especially relevant for the upcoming 30-m class telescopes. Such aberrations drastically impact the capabilities of high-contrast instruments. To address these issues, we can add a second-stage wavefront sensor to the science focal plane. One promising architecture uses the photonic lantern (PL): a waveguide that efficiently couples aberrated light into single-mode fibers (SMFs). In turn, SMF-confined light can be stably injected into high-resolution spectrographs, enabling direct exoplanet characterization and precision radial velocity measurements; simultaneously, the PL can be used for focal-plane wavefront sensing. We present a real-time experimental demonstration of the PL wavefront sensor on the Subaru/SCExAO testbed. Our system is stable out to around ~400 nm of low-order Zernike wavefront error, and can correct petaling modes. When injecting ~30 nm RMS of low order time-varying error, we achieve ~10x rejection at 1 s timescales; further refinements to the control law and lantern fabrication process should make sub-nanometric wavefront control possible. In the future, novel sensors like the PLWFS may prove to be critical in resolving the wavefront control challenges posed by exoplanet direct imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 Using high-resolution simulations of black hole formation from the direct collapse of massive stars undergoing pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN), we find a new phenomenon which significantly affects the explosion and leads to two peaks in the resulting black hole mass function (BHMF). Lighter stars experiencing the pair-instability can form a narrow shell in which alpha ladder reactions take place, exacerbating the effect of the PPISN. The shell temperature in higher mass stars ($>62 {\rm M}_\odot $ at the onset of helium burning for population-III stars with metallicity $Z=10^{-5}$) is too low for this to occur. As a result, the spectrum of black holes $M_{\rm BH} (M_i)$ exhibits a shoulder feature whereby a large range of initial masses result in near-identical black hole masses. PPISN therefore predict two peaks in the mass function of astrophysical black holes -- one corresponding to the location of the upper black hole mass gap and a second corresponding to the location of the shoulder. This shoulder effect may explain the peak at $35_{-2.9}^{+1.7}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog of merging binary black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We tested a new model of CMOS detector manufactured by the Gpixel Inc, for potential space astronomical application. In laboratory, we obtain some bias images under the typical application environment. In these bias images, clear random row noise pattern is observed. The row noise also contains some characteristic spatial frequencies. We quantitatively estimated the impact of this feature to photometric measurements, by making simulated images. We compared different bias noise types under strict parameter control. The result shows the row noise will significantly deteriorate the photometric accuracy. It effectively increases the readout noise by a factor of 2 to 10. However, if it is properly removed, the image quality and photometric accuracy will be significantly improved.

 - **Abstract**
 This molecular orbital analysis predicts that pure carbon graphene molecules would play an important role on astronomically observed Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIB), rather than fullerene. Laboratory experiments precisely coincided with observed DIB bands as studied by E. Cambell et al., which were considered to originate from mono-cation fullerene-(C$_{60}$)$^{1+}$. To check theoretically a molecular orbital excitation of (C$_{60}$)$^{1+}$ was calculated by the Time-Dependent DFT. Calculated two bands were close to observed DIBs, but there were two problems, that the oscillator strength was zero, and that other three DIBs could not be reproduced. Laboratory experiments was the mass spectroscopic one filtering m/e=724, to suggest fullerene-(C$_{60}$)$^{1+}$ combined with He. However, there were other capabilities, as like He-atom intercalated 3D-graphite, [graphene(C$_{53}$)$^{1+}$--He--(C$_7$)], [graphene(C$_{51}$)$^{1+}$--He--(C$_9$)] and so on. A family of graphene (C$_{53}$), (C$_{52}$) and (C$_{51}$) was calculated. Results show that an astronomically observed 957.74nm band was reproduced well by calculated 957.74nm, also confirmed by laboratory experiment of 957.75nm. Other observed 963.26, 936.57 and 934.85nm bands were calculated to be 963.08, 935.89 and 933.72nm. Moreover, experimental 922.27nm band was calculated to be 922.02nm, which is not yet astronomically observed. Similarly, experimental 925.96, 912.80, 909.71 and 908.40nm bands were calculated to 926.01, 912.52, 910.32 and 908.55nm. It should be emphasized that graphene molecules may be ubiquitously floating in interstellar space.

 - **Abstract**
 We report new measurements of the position angle and separation of the double star WDS 03245+5938 STI 450, based on our observations, Gaia EDR3, and historical data. We find that the position angle and separation are 209.7{\deg} and 7.68", respectively, showing slight changes from the previous values of 210{\deg} and 7.742". We also find that the distances between the two stars are far apart, suggesting that the system is an optical double, and therefore not gravitationally bound together. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of proper motion (rPM) metric of the system is distinct, indicating that the system is a chance alignment of two unrelated stars that are at different distances.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical characterization of circumstellar disk orientations toward 12 protostellar multiple systems in the Perseus molecular cloud using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at Band 6 (1.3 mm) with a resolution of 25 mas (8 au). This exquisite resolution enabled us to resolve the compact inner disk structures surrounding the components of each multiple system and to determine the projected 3-D orientation of the disks (position angle and inclination) to high precision. We performed a statistical analysis on the relative alignment of disk pairs to determine whether the disks are preferentially aligned or randomly distributed. We considered three subsamples of the observations selected by the companion separations, a <100 au, a >500 au, and a < 10,000 au. We found for the compact (< 100 au) subsample, the distribution of orientation angles is best described by an underlying distribution of preferentially aligned sources (within 30deg) but does not rule out distributions with 40% misaligned sources. The wide companion (>500 au) subsample appears to be consistent with a distribution of 40%-80% preferentially aligned sources. Similarly, the full sample of systems with companions (a< 10, 000 au) is most consistent with a fractional ratio of at most 80% preferentially aligned source and rules out purely randomly aligned distributions. Thus our results imply the compact sources (<100 au) and the wide companions (>500 au) are statistically different.

 - **Abstract**
 FRIPON is an efficient ground-based network for the detection and characterization of fireballs, which was initiated in France in 2016 with over one hundred cameras and which has been very successfully extended to Europe and Canada with one hundred more stations. After seven successful years of operation in the northern hemisphere, it seems necessary to extend this network towards the southern hemisphere - where the lack of detection is evident - to obtain an exhaustive view of fireball activity. The task of extending the network to any region outside the northern hemisphere presents the challenge of a new installation process, where the recommended and tested version of the several sub-systems that compose a station had to be replaced due to regional availability and compatibility considerations, as well as due to constant software and hardware obsolescence and updates. In Chile, we have a unique geography, with a vast extension in latitude, as well as desert regions, which have generated the need to evaluate the scientific and technical performance of the network under special conditions, prioritizing the optimization of a set of factors related to the deployment process, as well as the feasible and achievable versions of the required components, the geographical location of the stations, and their respective operational, maintenance, safety, and communication conditions. In this talk, we will present the current status of this effort, including a brief report on the obstacles and difficulties encountered and how we have solved them, the current operational status of the network in Northern Chile, as well as the challenges and prospects for the densification of the network over South America.
#### UOCS-XII. A study of open cluster NGC 6940 using UVIT/AstroSat: cluster  properties and exotic populations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13605
 - **Abstract**
 We study an open cluster NGC 6940 using \textit{AstroSat}/UVIT data and other archival data. This is an intermediate age cluster ($\sim$ 1 Gyr), located at about 770 pc distance, harboring several exotic populations apart from normal single and binary stars. We identify members of this cluster using a machine learning algorithm, ML-MOC and identify 492 members, including 1 blue straggler star (BSS), 2 yellow straggler stars (YSS), 11 blue lurker (BL) candidates, and 2 red clump (RC) stars. The cluster shows the effect of mass segregation, with massive stars segregated the most into the cluster, followed by the equal-mass binary members and the single low mass stars. We report the presence of an extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) feature in this cluster and suggest that the age spread may be a contributing factor behind it. However, the effect of stellar rotation, and the dust absorption needs to be examined more comprehensively with a larger fraction of MSTO stars. All the sixteen sources mentioned above have a counterpart in the UVIT/F169M filter. In order to characterize them, we construct multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 14 of these objects having no nearby sources within 3". The BSS is successfully fitted with a single-component SED. We find that three BLs, two YSS, and one RC star have UV excess greater than 50$\%$ and successfully fit two-component SEDs having hot companions. The parameters derived from the SEDs imply that the hot companions of BLs and the RC star are low-mass and normal-mass white dwarfs, whereas the hot companions of YSS are likely to be subdwarf B (sdB) stars. We suggest that at least 6 out of 14 stars ($\sim$42 $\%$) are formed via mass transfer and/or merger pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary evolution theory predicts that the second common envelope (CE) ejection can produce low-mass (0.32-0.36 Msun) subdwarf B (sdB) stars inside ultrashort-orbital-period binary systems, as their helium cores are ignited under nondegenerate conditions. With the orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, the minimum orbital periods of detached sdB binaries could be as short as ~20 minutes. However, only four sdB binaries with orbital periods below an hour have been reported so far, while none of them has an orbital period approaching the above theoretical limit. Here we report the discovery of a 20.5-minute-orbital-period ellipsoidal binary, TMTS J052610.43+593445.1, in which the visible star is being tidally deformed by an invisible carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) companion. The visible component is inferred to be an sdB star with a mass of ~0.33 Msun, approaching that of helium-ignition limit, although a He-core WD cannot be completely ruled out. In particular, the radius of this low-mass sdB star is only 0.066 Rsun, about seven Earth radii, possibly representing the most compact nondegenerate star ever known. Such a system provides a key clue to map the binary evolution scheme from the second CE ejection to the formation of AM CVn stars having a helium-star donor, and it will also serve as a crucial verification binary of space-borne GW detectors in the future.
#### Absolute Properties of the Oscillating Eclipsing Algol XZ Ursae Majoris

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13642
 - **Abstract**
 It is known from archival TESS data that the semi-detached Algol system XZ UMa is one of the candidate binary stars exhibiting short-period oscillations. We secured new high-resolution spectroscopic observations for the program target to better understand its binary and pulsation properties. From the echelle spectra, the radial velocities (RVs) of the eclipsing pair were derived, and the atmosphere parameters of the primary component were measured to be $v_{\rm A}\sin$$i = 80\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$, $T_{\rm eff,A}$ = $7940\pm120$ K, and [M/H] = $-0.15\pm0.20$. The combined solution of our double-lined RVs and the TESS data provides robust physical parameters for XZ UMa with mass and radius measurement precision of better than 2 \%. The outside-eclipse residuals from a mean light curve in the 0.002 phase bin were used for multifrequency analyses, and we extracted 32 significant frequencies (22 in $<$ 5.0 day$^{-1}$ and 10 in 39$-$52 day$^{-1}$). The low frequencies may be mostly aliasing sidelobes, while six of the high frequencies may be pulsation signals arising from the detached primary located inside the $\delta$ Sct domain. Their periods, pulsation constants, and pulsational-orbital-period ratios indicate that the mass-accretion primary star is a $\delta$ Sct pulsator and, hence, XZ UMa is an oscillating eclipsing Algol.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based and ground-based telescopes have extensively documented the impact of satellites on astronomical observations. With the proliferation of satellite mega-constellation programs, their influence on astronomical observations has become undeniable. It is crucial to quantify the impact of satellites on telescopes. To address this need, we have enhanced the circular orbit model for satellites and introduced a methodology based on two-line element (TLE) orbit data. This involves constructing a satellite probability distribution model to evaluate the impact of satellites on telescopes. Using our method, we assessed the satellite impact on global observatories. The results indicate that the regions most severely affected by satellite interference currently are those near the equator, with latitudes around 50 and 80 degrees experiencing the most significant impact from low Earth orbit satellites. Furthermore, we validated the reliability of our method using imaging data obtained from the focal surface acquisition camera of the LAMOST telescope.
#### The merger rate of primordial black hole binaries as a probe of Hubble  parameter

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be a probe of Hubble parameter by constraining PBH mass function in the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries. In next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, the GWs from PBH binaries would be detected at high redshifts, which gives their redshifted mass and luminosity distances. From a number of detected events, the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries can be statistically obtained, and it depends on PBH mass function and redshift distribution of detected PBH binaries. The PBH mass function can be inversely solved by applying the gradient descent method in the relation between redshifted mass distribution and redshift distribution. However, the construction of redshift distribution requires an assumed Hubble parameter in a background cosmology to extract redshift from luminosity distances, which causes solved PBH mass function also depends on assumed Hubble parameter. To determine the Hubble parameter, the merger rate of PBH binaries constrains on this Hubble parameter-dependent PBH mass function by comparing calculated merger rate distribution with observed one, and the best-fit result produces an approximate mass distribution of the physical PBH mass function and pins down the Hubble parameter.
#### Multi-wavelength analysis of the SN-associated low-luminosity GRB  171205A

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength properties of the nearby Supernova(SN)-associated low-luminosity GRB 171205A are investigated in depth to constrain its physicalan origin synthetically. The pulse width is found to be correlated with energy with a power-law index of $-0.24\pm0.07 $, which is consistent with the indices of other SN/GRBs but larger than those of long GRBs. By analyzing the overall light curve of its prompt gamma-rays and X-ray plateaus simultaneously, we infer that the early X-rays together with the gamma-rays should reflect the activities of central engine while the late X-rays may be dominated by the interaction of external shocks with circumburst material. In addition, we find that the host radio flux and offset of GRB 171205A are similar to those of other nearby low-luminosity GRBs. We adopt 9 SN/GRBs with measured offset to build a relation between peak luminosity ($L_{\gamma,p}$) and spectral lag ($\tau$) as $L_{\gamma,p}\propto\tau^{-1.91\pm0.33}$. The peak luminosity and the projected physical offset of both 12 SN/GRBs and 10 KN/GRBs are found to be moderately correlated, suggesting their different progenitors. The multi-wavelength afterglow fitted with a top-hat jet model indicates that the jet half-opening angle and the viewing angle of GRB 171205A are $\thicksim$ 34.4 and 41.8 degrees, respectively, which implies that the off-axis emissions are dominated by the peripheral cocoon rather than the jet core.
#### The Cosmological Constant Potential: a resolution to the Hubble tension  via the cosmological sound horizon

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13886
 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological constant term can be seen as a constant potential for a (scalar) field. In this viewpoint, at late times, the field is stopped rolling and behaves as a cosmological constant ($w=-1$). While at the early universe, its kinetic term can be dominant and behaves as a stiff fluid ($w=+1$). This new phase lowers the cosmological sound horizon by increasing the Hubble parameter for very high redshifts. Consequently, the lower cosmological sound horizon results in the higher Hubble constant at the present time. This early phase ends before the photon decoupling, so we do not expect any new physics after the last scattering surface. We checked this model in the presence of (reduced) CMB, BAO's and $H_0$ datasets and could show the Hubble tension is fully relieved.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we demonstrate that Dark Matter (DM) evaporation severely hinders the effectiveness of exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs as sub-GeV DM probes. Moreover, we find useful analytic closed form approximations for DM capture rates for arbitrary astrophysical objects, valid in four disticnt regions in the $\sigma-m_X$ parameter space. As expected, in one of those regions the Dark Matter capture saturates to its geometric limit, i.e. the entire flux crossing an object. As a consequence of this region, which for many objects falls within the parameter space not excluded by direct detection experiments, we point out the existence of a DM parameter dependent critical temperature ($T_{crit}$), above which astrophysical objects lose any sensitivity as Dark Matter probes. For instance, Jupiters at the Galactic Center have a $T_{crit}$ ranging from $700$ K (for a $3 M_J$ Jupiter) to $950$ K (for $14 M_J$). This limitation is rarely (if ever) considered in the previous literature of indirect Dark Matter detection based on observable signatures of captured Dark Matter inside celestial bodies.

 Abridged. Eclipsing spectroscopic double-lined binaries are the prime source of precise and accurate measurements of masses and radii of stars. These measurements provide a stringent test of models of stellar evolution that are persistently reported to contain major shortcomings. The mass discrepancy observed for the eclipsing spectroscopic double-lined binaries is one of the manifestations of shortcomings in stellar evolution models. Our ultimate goal is to provide an observational mapping of the mass discrepancy and propose a recipe for its solution. We initiate a spectroscopic monitoring campaign of 573 candidate eclipsing binaries of which 83 are analysed in this work with the methods of least-squares deconvolution and spectral disentangling. TESS light curves are used to provide photometric classification of the systems according to the type of their intrinsic variability. We confirm 69 systems as either spectroscopic binaries or higher-order multiple systems. Twelve stars are classified as single and two more objects are found at the interface of their line profile variability being interpreted as due to binarity and intrinsic variability of the star. Moreover, 20 eclipsing binaries are found to contain at least one component that exhibits stellar oscillations. The sample presented in this work contains both detached and semi-detached systems and covers a range in the effective temperature and mass of the star of Teff = [7000,30000] K and M = [1.5,15] M_Sun, respectively. We conclude an appreciable capability of the spectral disentangling method to deliver precise and accurate spectroscopic orbital elements from as few as 6-8 orbital phase-resolved spectroscopic observations. Orbital solutions obtained this way are accurate enough to deliver age estimates with accuracy of 10% or better, an important resource for calibration of stellar evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the influence of solar UV anisotropy on the heliospheric backscatter helioglow generated by resonant scattering of solar Lyman-alpha photons on interstellar hydrogen atoms around the Sun. Simulations based on the WawHelioGlow model suggest that the response of the helioglow pole-to-ecliptic ratio to the anisotropy is linear, but 15% of the anisotropy (polar darkening) generates 30-40% change in the ratio in the solar minimum and 15-20% in the solar maximum. We attribute this difference to an interplay between the solar UV anisotropy and the latitudinal structure of the solar wind in solar minima. The solar UV anisotropy also increases the helioglow intensity from the downwind direction by 5-10%, due to the influence of the anisotropy on the ionization losses and trajectories of atoms passing by the Sun in polar regions. Consequently, mid-latitude regions (in the heliographic and ecliptic coordinates) are least affected by the UV anisotropy. By comparison of the simulation results with observations of the SOHO/SWAN satellite instrument, we derive the day-by-day time evolution of the solar Lyman-alpha anisotropy for the north and south poles over two solar cycles from 1996 to 2022. The inferred anisotropy is ~5-10% in solar minima and ~15-25% in solar maxima, the northern anisotropy being stronger than the southern. Our study suggests that in solar minima a highly structured solar wind is associated with relatively small solar UV anisotropy, while in solar maxima the solar wind is more isotropic but a substantial solar UV anisotropy appears.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based high-contrast instruments have yielded reflected light images of protoplanetary disks. Quantitative measurements of the reflected radiation provide strong constraints on the scattering dust which can clarify the dust particle evolution in these disks and the composition of the forming planets. This study aimed to derive the wavelength dependence of polarized reflectivity $(\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_\star)_\lambda$ for 11 disks, constraining dust properties and identifying systematic differences. Using ESO archive data from SPHERE/ZIMPOL and SPHERE/IRDIS instruments, we obtained accurate intrinsic polarized reflectivity $\hat{Q}_\varphi/I_\star$ values at wavelengths from 0.62$\mu$m to 2.2$\mu$m. Polarized reflectivities ranged from $Q_\varphi/I_\star\approx 0.1\%$ to 1.0$\%$, with PSF-corrected values averaging 1.6 times higher than observed. Accurate PSF calibrations reduced systematic errors to $\Delta\hat{Q}_\varphi/\hat{Q}_\varphi\approx 10\%$ or less. For each disk, we derived a polarized reflectivity color $\eta_{V/IR}$ between a visible band $\lambda<1~\mu$m and a near-IR band $\lambda>1~\mu$m and other wavelength combinations. Wavelength gradients $\eta$ varied significantly among objects. Disks around Herbig stars (HD 169142, HD 135334B, HD 100453, MWC 758, and HD 142527) showed a red color $\eta_{\rm V/IR}>0.5$, suggesting rather compact dust grains. T-Tauri star disks (PDS 70, TW Hya, RX J1615, and PDS 66) were predominantly gray $-0.5<\eta_{\rm V/IR}<0.5$, with an absence of blue colors incompatible with porous aggregates. Exceptional red colors for LkCa15 and MWC758 were attributed to potential extra reddening from hot dust near the star. Future studies incorporating parameters like fractional polarization $\langle p_\varphi \rangle$ hold promise for advancing our understanding of dust properties within protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by the hot and massive remnant of a binary neutron star merger will provide new probes of the dense-matter equation of state (EoS). We show that current uncertainties in the thermal physics can cause the emergent GW spectum to differ by a degree comparable to changing the cold EoS by $\pm\sim120$ m in the characteristic radius of a neutron star. Unless a very close binary neutron star merger takes place, these effects are unlikely to be measurable with current GW detectors. However, with proposed next-generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, the effects can be measured for events at distances of up to ~80-200 Mpc, if the cold EoS is sufficiently well constrained.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is a key ingredient for the emergence of life as we know it. Yet, its destruction and reformation in space remains unprobed in warm gas. Here, we detect the hydroxyl radical (OH) emission from a planet-forming disk exposed to external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation with the James Webb Space Telescope. The observations are confronted with the results of quantum dynamical calculations. The highly excited OH infrared rotational lines are the tell-tale signs of H2O destruction by FUV. The OH infrared ro-vibrational lines are attributed to chemical excitation via the key reaction O+H=OH+H which seeds the formation of water in the gas-phase. We infer that the equivalent of the Earth ocean's worth of water is destroyed per month and replenished. These results show that under warm and irradiated conditions water is destroyed and efficiently reformed via gas-phase reactions. This process, assisted by diffusive transport, could reduce the HDO/H2O ratio in the warm regions of planet-forming disks.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the linear axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings with typical values of the dynamical optical depth $\tau\gtrsim 0.5$. We develop a granular flow model which accounts for the particulate nature of a planetary ring subjected to dissipative particle collisions. The model captures the dynamical evolution of the disc's vertical thickness, temperature, and effects related to a finite volume filling factor of the ring fluid. We compute equilibrium states of self-gravitating and non-self-gravitating rings, which compare well with existing results from kinetic models and N-Body simulations. Subsequently, we conduct a linear stability analysis of our model. We briefly discuss the different linear eigenmodes of the system and compare with existing literature by applying corresponding limiting approximations. We then focus on the viscous overstability, analysing the effect of temperature variations, radial and vertical self-gravity, and for the first time the effects of vertical motions on the instability. In addition, we perform local N-body simulations incorporating radial and vertical self-gravity. Critical values for the optical depth and the filling factor for the onset of instability resulting from our N-body simulations compare well with our model predictions under the neglect of radial self-gravity. When radial self-gravity is included, agreement with N-body simulations can be achieved by adopting enhanced values of the bulk viscous stress.

 - **Abstract**
 The large number of exoplanets discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) means that any observational biases from TESS could influence the derived stellar multiplicity statistics of exoplanet host stars. To investigate this problem, we obtained speckle interferometry of 207 control stars whose properties in the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) closely match those of an exoplanetary host star in the TESS Object of Interest (TOI) catalog, with the objective of measuring the fraction of these stars that have companions within $\sim1.2"$. Our main result is the identification of a bias in the creation of the control sample that prevents the selection of binaries with $0.1" \lesssim \rho \lesssim 1.2"$ and $\Delta$mag $\lesssim3$. This bias is the result of large astrometric residuals that cause binaries with these parameters to fail the quality checks used to create the TIC, which in turn causes them to have incomplete stellar parameters (and uncertainties) in the TIC. Any stellar multiplicity study that relies exclusively upon TIC stellar parameters to identify its targets will struggle to select unresolved binaries in this parameter space. Left uncorrected, this selection bias disproportionately excludes high-mass-ratio binaries, causing the mass-ratio distribution of the companions to deviate significantly from the uniform distribution expected of FGK-type field binaries. After accounting for this bias, the companion rate of the FGK control stars is consistent with the canonical $46\pm2\%$ rate from Raghavan et al. 2010, and the mass-ratio distribution agrees with that of binary TOI host stars. There is marginal evidence that the control-star companions have smaller projected orbital separations than TOI host stars from previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Throughout the cosmic history, PBHs may experience an efficient phase of baryonic mass accretion from the surrounding medium. Its main consequences on their cosmological evolution are characteristic growths of the PBH masses and spins, as well as the emission of radiation, which is ultimately responsible for feedback effects that could weaken the efficiency of the process. In this chapter we review the basic formalism to describe the accretion rate, luminosity function and feedback effects, in order to provide distinctive predictions for the evolution of the PBH mass and spin parameters.

 The large-scale structure of the universe is distributed in a cosmic web. Studying the distribution and clustering of dark matter particles and halos may open up a new horizon for studying the physics of the dark universe. In this work, we investigate the nearest neighbour statistics and spherical contact function in cosmological models with massive neutrinos. For this task, we use the relativistic N-body code, gevolution and study particle snapshots at three different redshifts. In each snapshot, we find the halos and evaluate the letter functions for them. We show that a generic behaviour can be found in the nearest neighbour, $G(r)$, and spherical contact functions, $F(r)$, which makes these statistics promising tools to constrain the total neutrino mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse three interacting vacuum dark energy models with the aim of exploring whether the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions can be simultaneously resolved in such models. We present the first ever derivation of the covariant gauge-invariant perturbation formalism for the interacting vacuum scenario, and, for the sub-class of geodesic cold dark matter models, connect the evolution of perturbation variables in this approach to the familiar cosmological observables. We show how $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ evolve in three interacting vacuum models: firstly, a simple linear coupling between the vacuum and cold dark matter; secondly, a coupling which mimics the behaviour of a Chaplygin gas; and finally a coupling which mimics the Shan--Chen fluid dark energy model. We identify, if any, the regions of parameter space which would correspond to a simultaneous resolution of both tensions in these models. When constraints from observational data are added, we show how all the models described are constrained to be close to their $\Lambda$CDM limits.
