#### Retrograde discs around one component of a binary are unstable to  tilting

 - **Abstract**
 With hydrodynamic simulations we show that a coplanar disc around one component of a binary can be unstable to global tilting when the disc orbits in a retrograde direction relative to the binary. The disc experiences the largest inclination growth relative to the binary orbit in the outermost radii of the disc, closest to the companion. This tilt instability also occurs for test particles. A retrograde disc is much larger than a prograde disc since it is not tidally truncated and instead spreads outwards to the orbit of the companion. The coplanar retrograde disc remains circular while a coplanar prograde disc can become eccentric. We suggest that the inclination instability is due to a disc resonance caused by the interaction of the tilt with the tidal field of the binary. This model is applicable to Be/X-ray binaries in which the Be star disc may be retrograde relative to the binary orbit if there was a sufficiently strong kick from the supernova that formed the neutron star companion. The accretion on to the neutron star and the resulting X-ray outbursts are weaker in the retrograde case compared to the prograde case.
#### Mass ratio estimates for overcontact binaries using the derivatives of  light curves

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric mass ratios of eclipsing binaries are usually estimated by light-curve modeling with an iterative method. We propose a new method for estimating the photometric mass ratio of an overcontact binary using the derivatives of a light curve, which provides a reasonable uncertainty value. The method mainly requires only the time interval value between two local extrema found in the third derivative of a light curve, with no need of an iterative procedure. We applied the method to a sample of real overcontact binary data and compared the estimated mass ratios with their spectroscopically determined values. The comparison showed that our estimated mass ratios for $\sim $67% of the samples agreed with their spectroscopic mass ratios within the estimated uncertainties, and the errors for 95% of them are within $\pm 0.1$. Our method should be useful for estimating mass ratios for numerous overcontact eclipsing binaries found with existing and future surveys, as well as for the light-curve analysis of each system.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting the cosmic 21 cm signal from Epoch of Reionization (EoR) has always been a difficult task. Although the Galactic foreground can be regarded as a smooth power-law spectrum, due to the chromaticity of the antenna, additional structure will be introduced into the global spectrum, making the polynomial fitting algorithm perform poorly. In this paper, we introduce an improved polynomial fitting algorithm - the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) fitting and use it to fit the simulation data. This algorithm is developed for the upcoming Low-frequency Anechoic Chamber Experiment (LACE), yet it is a general method suitable for application in any single antenna-based global 21 cm signal experiment. VZOP defines a 24-hour averaged beam model that brings information about the antenna beam into the polynomial model. Assuming that the beam can be measured, VZOP can successfully recover the 21 cm absorption feature, even if the beam is extremely frequency-dependent. In real observations, due to various systematics, the corrected measured beam contains residual errors that are not completely random. Assuming the errors are frequency-dependent, VZOP is capable of recovering the 21 cm absorption feature even when the error reaches 10%. Even in the most extreme scenario where the errors are completely random, VZOP can at least give a fitting result that is not worse than the common polynomial fitting. In conclusion, the fitting effect of VZOP depends on the structure of the error and the accuracy of the beam measurement.

 - **Abstract**
 Spacecraft formation flying serves as a method of astronomical instrumentation that enables the construction of large virtual structures in space. The formation-flying interferometry generally requires very-high control accuracy, and beyond-Earth orbits are typically selected. By contrast, this study proposes the use of geocentric orbits for formation-flying interferometry. A geocentric orbit is beneficial because of its economic accessibility and the availability of flight-proven technologies for formation-flying autonomy, safety, and management. Its feasibility depends on the existence of specific orbits that satisfy a small-disturbance environment with favorable observation conditions. This theory, developed based on celestial mechanics, indicates that small-perturbation regions tend to appear in higher-altitude and shorter-separation regions. Candidate orbits are identified in high Earth orbit for the triangular laser-interferometric gravitational-wave telescope, which is 100 km in size, and in middle Earth orbit for the linear astronomical interferometer, which is 0.5 km in size. A low Earth orbit with a separation of approximately 0.1 km may be suitable for experimental purposes. As shown in these examples, geocentric orbits are potentially applicable for various types of formation-flying interferometry.
#### Density profile of a self-gravitating polytropic turbulent fluid in a  rotating disk near to the cloud core

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain two equations (following from two different approaches) for the density profile in a self-gravitating polytropic cylindrically symmetric and rotating turbulent gas disk. The adopted physical picture is appropriate to describe the conditions near to the cloud core where the equation of state of the gas changes from isothermal (in the outer cloud layers) to one of "hard polytrope", and the symmetry changes from spherical to cylindrical. On the assumption of steady state, as the accreting matter passes through all spatial scales, we show that the total energy per unit mass is an invariant with respect to the fluid flow. The obtained equation describes the balance of the kinetic, thermal and gravitational energy of a fluid element. We also introduce a method for approximating density profile solutions (in a power-law form), leading to the emergence of three different regimes. We apply, as well, dynamical analysis of the motion of a fluid element. Only one of the regimes is in accordance with the two approaches (energy and force balance). It corresponds to a density profile of a slope -2, polytropic exponent 3/2, and sub-Keplerian rotation of the disk, when the gravity is balanced by the thermal pressure. It also matches with some observations and numerical works and, in particular, leads to a second power-law tail (of a slope approx. -1) of the density distribution function in dense, self-gravitating cloud regions.
#### Development of MKIDs in the Optical and Near-infrared Bands for SPIAKID

 - **Abstract**
 SpectroPhotometric Imaging in Astronomy with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (SPIAKID) aims at designing, building, and deploying on the sky a spectrophotometric imager based on microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) in the optical and near-infrared bands. MKIDs show a fast response and the ability to resolve photon energy compared to the conventional Charge-coupled Devices (CCDs). In this paper, we present the design and simulation of the MKID arrays for SPIAKID. The detectors consist of four arrays with each array of 20,000 lumped-element pixels, and each array will be read with 10 readout lines. %The array is designed to have resonances between 4-8GHz with a frequency spacing of 2 MHz and a coupling quality factor (Qc) of about 50000. The meander material of the resonators is trilayer TiN/Ti/TiN to have better uniformity of the critical temperature across the array. We also present the measurement result for a test array with $30\times30$ pixels which is a subset of the designed 2000-pixel array to verify the design and fabrication. The current measured best energy resolving power $R = E/\Delta E$ is 2.4 at $\lambda = 405~$nm and the current medium R is around 1.7. We have also observed the response of the TiN/Ti/TiN is much smaller than expected.

 - **Abstract**
 Zircons are found in extraterrestrial rocks from the Moon, Mars, and some differentiated meteorite parent-bodies. These zircons are rare, often of small size, and have been affected by neutron capture induced by cosmic ray exposure. The application of the 176Lu-176Hf decay system to zircons from planetary bodies such as the Moon can help establish the chronology of large-scale differentiation processes, like the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean. Here, we present methods to measure the isotopic composition of Hf of extraterrestrial zircons dated using ID-TIMS U-Pb after chemical abrasion. We introduce a 2-stage elution scheme to separate Hf from Zr while preserving the unused Zr fraction for future isotopic analysis. The effect of neutron capture is also re-examined using the latest thermal neutron capture cross sections and epithermal resonance integrals. Our tests show that the precision of Hf isotopic analyses is close to what is theoretically attainable. We have tested this method to a limited set of zircon grains from lunar rocks returned by the Apollo missions (lunar soil 14163, fragmental polymict breccia 72275, and clast-rich breccia 14321). The model ages align with previously reported values, but further work is needed to assess the chronology of lunar magma ocean crystallization as only a handful of small zircons (5 zircons from 3 samples) were analyzed, and the precision of the analyses can be improved by measuring more and larger lunar zircon grains.
#### Cliff collapse on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - I. Aswan

 - **Abstract**
 The Aswan cliff on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko collapsed on 2015 July 10. Thereby, relatively pristine comet material from a depth of ~12 m was exposed at the surface. Observations of the collapse site by the microwave instrument Rosetta/MIRO have been retrieved from 8 months prior to collapse, as well as from 5, 7, and 11 months post-collapse. The MIRO data are analysed with thermophysical and radiative transfer models. The pre-collapse observations are consistent with a 30 MKS thermal inertia dust mantle with a thickness of at least 3 cm. The post-collapse data are consistent with: 1) a dust/water-ice mass ratio of 0.9$\pm$0.5 and a molar $\mathrm{CO_2}$ abundance of ~30 per cent relative to water; 2) formation of a dust mantle after ~7 months, having a thickness of a few millimetres or a fraction thereof; 3) a $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice sublimation front at 0.4 cm that withdrew to 2.0 cm and later to 20$\pm$6 cm; 4) a thermal inertia ranging 10-45 MKS; 5) a gas diffusivity that decreased from $0.1\,\mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$ to $0.001\,\mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$; 6) presence of a solid-state greenhouse effect parts of the time. The data and the analysis provide a first empirical glimpse of how ice-rich cometary material ages and evolves when exposed to solar heating.
#### On the Interpretation of XSPEC Abundances and Emission Measures

 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this work is to describe the assumptions built into the X-ray spectrum fitting software XSPEC for the calculation of element abundances and emission measure of a plasma and to describe the effects when those assumptions are not accurate. The ratio of electron density to hydrogen density in XSPEC is fixed at a constant. The correct ratio can be calculated from the ionization states of the elements. We show the constant value used in XSPEC is valid to within 3.5% for a solar abundance plasma. For a plasma that deviates from solar abundance, such as hydrogen-poor or heavy element rich plasmas as found in the ejecta of supernova remnants, this ratio can smaller by factors of 0.1 to 0.001. The hydrogen emission measure, defined by integral of electron density times hydrogen density over plasma volume, is derived from the norm in XSPEC, but one needs to include the hydrogen abundance factor. For other elements, the emission measures are the XSPEC values multiplied by the element abundance factors. Using the correct electron-to-hydrogen ratio and emission measures, we show the correct electron density is smaller by the square root of the correct electron density ratio divided by the XSPEC value. Element densities and total masses (for given distance and volume) are larger by the abundance factors divided by the above square root. Because hydrogen-poor plasmas occur in the ejecta of Type Ia supernova remnants, previously estimated element masses from X-ray spectra are likely significantly underestimated.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanometre- to micrometre-sized solid dust particles play a vital role in star and planet formations. Despite of their importance, however, our understanding of physical and chemical properties of dust particles is still provisional. We have conducted a condensation experiment of the vapour generated from a solid starting material having nearly cosmic proportions in elements. A laser flash heating and subsequent cooling has produced a diverse type of nanoparticles simultaneously. Here we introduce four types of nanoparticles as potential dust particles in space: amorphous silicate nanoparticles (type S); core/mantle nanoparticles with iron or hydrogenised-iron core and amorphous silicate mantle (type IS); silicon oxycarbide nanoparticles and hydrogenised silicon oxycarbide nanoparticles (type SiOC); and carbon nanoparticles (type C), all produced in a single heating-cooling event. Type IS and SiOC nanoparticles are new for potential astrophysical dust. The nanoparticles are aggregated to a wide variety of structures, from compact, fluffy, and networked. A simultaneous formation of nanoparticles, which are diverse in chemistry, shape, and structure, prompts a re-evaluation of astrophysical dust particles
#### Cosmic-Enu: An emulator for the non-linear neutrino power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology is poised to measure the neutrino mass sum $M_\nu$ and has identified several smaller-scale observables sensitive to neutrinos, necessitating accurate predictions of neutrino clustering over a wide range of length scales. The FlowsForTheMasses non-linear perturbation theory for the massive neutrino power spectrum, $\Delta^2_\nu(k)$, agrees with its companion N-body simulation at the $10\%-15\%$ level for $k \leq 1~h/$Mpc. Building upon the Mira-Titan IV emulator for the cold matter, we use FlowsForTheMasses to construct an emulator for $\Delta^2_\nu(k)$ covering a large range of cosmological parameters and neutrino fractions $\Omega_{\nu,0} h^2 \leq 0.01$, which corresponds to $M_\nu \leq 0.93$~eV. Consistent with FlowsForTheMasses at the $3.5\%$ level, it returns a power spectrum in milliseconds. Ranking the neutrinos by initial momenta, we also emulate the power spectra of momentum deciles, providing information about their perturbed distribution function. Comparing a $M_\nu=0.15$~eV model to a wide range of N-body simulation methods, we find agreement to $3\%$ for $k \leq 3 k_\mathrm{FS} = 0.17~h/$Mpc and to $19\%$ for $k \leq 0.4~h/$Mpc. We find that the enhancement factor, the ratio of $\Delta^2_\nu(k)$ to its linear-response equivalent, is most strongly correlated with $\Omega_{\nu,0} h^2$, and also with the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$. Furthermore, non-linearities enhance the free-streaming-limit scaling $\partial \log(\Delta^2_\nu / \Delta^2_{\rm m}) / \partial \log(M_\nu)$ beyond its linear value of 4, increasing the $M_\nu$-sensitivity of the small-scale neutrino density.
#### Collisional and Fast Neutrino Flavor Instabilities in Two-dimensional  Core-collapse Supernova Simulation with Boltzmann Neutrino Transport

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study on the occurrences of the collisional flavor instability (CFI) and the fast flavor instability (FFI) of neutrinos based on a two-dimensional (2D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulation performed with a Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics code. We find that CFI occurs in a region with the baryon-mass density of $10^{10}\lesssim \rho \lesssim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, which is similar to the previous results in one-dimensional (1D) CCSN models. In contrast to 1D, however, the CFI region varies with time vigorously in the 2D model, whereas it had a quiescent structure in 1D. This is attributed to the fact that the turbulent flows advected from a gain region account for the temporal variations. Another noticeable difference from the 1D models is the appearance of resonance-like CFI where number densities of $\nu_e$, $\bar\nu_e$ nearly coincide each other. The CFI growth rate there is enhanced and can reach $\sim10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. As for FFI, on the other hand, it appears in three different regions; (1) the region overlapped with the resonance-like CFI, (2) neutrino decoupling regions where $\bar{\nu}_e$'s are strongly emitted, and (3) optically thin regions where neutral-current scatterings dominate over charged-current reactions. Although overall properties for FFI are consistent with previous studies, we find that the number of electron-neutrinos lepton number crossing (ELN crossing) temporary becomes multiple, which can be assessed accurately only by multi-angle treatments in neutrino transport. We find that the growth rate of FFI is always higher than CFI if both of them occur, which suggests that the former is dominant for the linear evolution.
#### G213.0$-$0.6, a true supernova remnant or just an HII region?

 - **Abstract**
 G213.0$-$0.6 is a faint extended source situated in the anti-center region of the Galactic plane. It has been classified as a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) based on its shell-like morphology, steep radio continuum spectrum, and high ratio of [S II]/H$\alpha$. With new optical emission line data of H$\alpha$, [S II], and [N II] recently observed by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, the ratios of [S II]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ are re-assessed. The lower values than those previously reported put G213.0$-$0.6 around the borderline of SNR-HII region classification. We decompose the steep-spectrum synchrotron and the flat-spectrum thermal free-free emission in the area of G213.0$-$0.6 with multi-frequency radio continuum data. G213.0$-$0.6 is found to show a flat spectrum, in conflict with the properties of a shell-type SNR. Such a result is further confirmed by TT-plots made between the 863-MHz, 1.4-GHz, and 4.8-GHz data. Combining the evidence extracted in both optical and radio continuum, we argue that G213.0$-$0.6 is possibly not an SNR, but an HII region instead. The $V_{LSR}$ pertaining to the H$\alpha$ filaments places G213.0$-$0.6 approximately 1.9 kpc away in the Perseus Arm.
#### An efficient numerical approach to modeling the effects of particle  shape on rubble-pile dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We present an approach for the inclusion of non-spherical constituents in high-resolution N-body discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We use aggregates composed of bonded spheres to model non-spherical components. Though the method may be applied more generally, we detail our implementation in the existing N-body code pkdgrav. It has long been acknowledged that non-spherical grains confer additional shear strength and resistance to flow when compared with spheres. As a result, we expect that rubble-pile asteroids will also exhibit these properties and may behave differently than comparable rubble piles composed of idealized spheres. Since spherical particles avoid some significant technical challenges, most DEM gravity codes have used only spherical particles, or have been confined to relatively low resolutions. We also discuss the work that has gone into improving performance with non-spherical grains, building on pkdgrav's existing leading-edge computational efficiency among DEM gravity codes. This allows for the addition of non-spherical shapes while maintaining the efficiencies afforded by pkdgrav's tree implementation and parallelization. As a test, we simulated the gravitational collapse of 25,000 non-spherical bodies in parallel. In this case, the efficiency improvements allowed for an increase in speed by nearly a factor of three when compared with the naive implementation. Without these enhancements, large runs with non-spherical components would remain prohibitively expensive. Finally, we present the results of several small-scale tests: spinup due to the YORP effect, tidal encounters, and the Brazil-nut Effect. In all cases, we find that the inclusion of non-spherical constituents has a measurable impact on simulation outcomes.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme debris disks can show short term behaviour through the evolution and clearing of small grains produced in giant impacts, and potentially a longer period of variability caused by a planetesimal population formed from giant impact ejecta. In this paper, we present results of numerical simulations to explain how a planetesimal populated disk can supply an observed extreme debris disk with small grains. We simulated a sample of giant impacts from which we form a planetesimal population. We then use the $N$-body code {\sc Rebound} to evolve the planetesimals spatially and collisionally. We adopt a simplistic collision criteria in which we define destructive collisions to be between planetesimals with a mutual impact velocity that exceeds two times the catastrophic disruption threshold, $V^*$. We find that for some configurations, a planetesimal populated disk can produce a substantial amount of dust to sustain an observable disk. The semi-major axis at which the giant impact occurs changes the mass added to the observed disk substantially while the orientation of the impact has less of an effect. We determine how the collision rate at the collision point changes over time and show that changes in semi-major axis and orientation only change the initial collision rate of the disk. Collision rates across all disks evolve at a similar rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are as common as single stars. Binary stars are of immense importance to astrophysicists because that they allow us to determine the masses of the stars independent of their distances. They are the cornerstone of the understanding of stellar evolutionary theory and play an essential role in cosmic distance measurement, galactic evolution, nucleosynthesis and the formation of important objects such as cataclysmic variable stars, X-ray binaries, Type Ia supernovae, and gravitational wave-producing double compact objects. In this article, we review the significant theoretical and observational progresses in addressing binary stars in the new millennium. Increasing large survey projects have led to the discovery of enormous numbers of binary stars, which enables us to conduct statistical studies of binary populations, and therefore provide unprecedented insight into the stellar and binary evolution physics. Meanwhile, the rapid development of theoretical concepts and numerical approaches for binary evolution have made a substantial progress on the alleviation of some long-standing binary-related problems such as the stability of mass transfer and common envelope evolution. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to have a full understanding of fundamental problems of stellar and binary astrophysics. The upcoming massive survey projects and increasingly sophisticated computational methods will lead to future progress.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars can serve as effective probes to investigate the presence of Intermediate-mass Black Holes (IMBHs) within Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Based on the standard structure models for GCs, we conduct simulations to analyze the distributions of pulsar accelerations within the central region of NGC 6517. By comparing the measured accelerations of pulsars obtained from their period derivatives $\dot P$ to the simulated distribution profiles, we demonstrate that a central excess of dark mass is required to account for the measured accelerations. Our analysis, which relies on existing pulsar timing observations, is currently unable to differentiate between two possible scenarios: an IMBH precisely situated at the core of the cluster with mass $\gtrsim 9000^{+4000}_{-3000}~M_{\odot}$, or a central concentration of stellar mass dark remnants with a comparable total mass. However, with additional acceleration measurements from a few more pulsars in the cluster, it will be possible to differentiate the source of the nonluminous matter.
#### JWST near-infrared spectroscopy of the Lucy Jupiter Trojan flyby  targets: Evidence for OH absorption, aliphatic organics, and CO$_{2}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec observations of the five Jupiter Trojans that will be visited by the Lucy spacecraft -- the Patroclus--Menoetius binary, Eurybates, Orus, Leucus, and Polymele. The measured 1.7-5.3 $\mu$m reflectance spectra greatly supersede previous ground-based spectroscopy in spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and wavelength coverage and reveal several distinct absorption features. We robustly detect a broad OH band centered at 3 $\mu$m that is most prominent on the less-red objects Eurybates, Patroclus-Menoetius, and Polymele. An additional absorption at 3.3-3.6 $\mu$m, indicative of aliphatic organics, is systematically deeper on the red objects Orus and Leucus. The collisional fragment Eurybates is unique in displaying an absorption band at 4.25 $\mu$m that we attribute to bound or trapped CO$_2$ (e.g., clathrates). Comparisons with other solar system small bodies reveal broad similarities in the 2.7-3.6 $\mu$m bands on the Trojans with analogous features on Centaurs, Kuiper belt objects, and the active asteroid 238P. In the context of recent solar system evolution models, which posit that the Trojans initially formed in the outer Solar System, the significant attenuation of the 2.7-3.6 $\mu$m absorptions on Trojans relative to Kuiper belt objects may be the result of secondary thermal processing of the Trojans' surfaces at the higher temperatures of the Jupiter region. The CO$_2$ band manifested on the younger surface of Eurybates suggests that CO$_2$ may be a major constituent in the bulk composition of Trojans, but resides in the subsurface or deeper interior and is largely obscured by refractory material that formed from the thermophysical processes that were activated during their inward migration.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the relation between NH$_2$D and its physical environment, we mapped ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ at 85.9 GHz toward 24 Galactic late-stage massive star-forming regions with Institut de Radioastronomie Millim$ \'e$trique (IRAM) 30-m telescope. Ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ was detected in 18 of 24 sources. Comparing with the distribution of H$^{13}$CN 1-0 as a dense gas tracer and radio recombination line H42$\alpha$, ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ present complex and diverse spatial distribution in these targets. 11 of the 18 targets, present a different distribution between ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0, while no significant difference between these two lines can be found in the other 7 sources, mainly due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. Moreover, with H42$\alpha$ tracing massive young stellar objects, ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ seems to show a relatively weak emission near the massive young stellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 For several decades we have been performing photometric monitoring of some of the star formation regions. Significant place in our program take observations of objects of the type FU Orionis, EX Lupi, UX Orionis and other similar but unclassified objects. These three types of young variable objects show changes in brightness with large amplitudes and attract the attention of star formation researchers. But it is not always possible to distinguish them from each other without the presence of long-term multicolor photometric data. For this reason, we collect data from current CCD observations and supplement them with data from the photographic plates archives. In this paper, we show the latest data from optical photometric studies of four PMS objects (V2493 Cyg, V582 Aur, V733 Cep and V1180 Tau) made at the Rozhen Observatory. Our monitoring is carried out in $BVRI$ filters, which allows studying the variability in color indexes also. By analysis the historical light curves of these objects we are trying to obtain information about the processes associated with the early stages of stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Up to now, it seemed that the additional frequencies in the fundamental mode (RRab) and in the overtone mode pulsating (RRc and RRd) RR Lyrae stars have different nature. RRab stars show frequencies associated with periodic doubling, as well as frequencies at the first and second radial overtones, and linear combinations of these. RRc stars show frequencies with specific ratios ($f_1/f_x\sim$0.61, or $\sim$0.63) which are explained by non-radial modes and frequencies with $f_x/f_1\sim0.68$ ratio which have no currently accepted explanation. To search for similarities in spectral content, we compared the Fourier spectra of the recently published TESS and K2 data of RRc stars with the spectra of Kepler RRab stars that do not show the Blazhko effect but contain additional frequencies. The time series data have been analysed using standard Fourier methods, and the possibility of the excitation of the second radial overtone mode in RRab stars has also been tested using numerical hydrodynamical codes. We show that the additional frequencies appear in non-Blazhko RRab stars at the position of the second radial overtone mode, and the pattern they create, is very similar to that caused by the additional frequencies with the period ratio $\sim0.68$ in RRc stars. The former explanation of the additional frequencies of these RRab stars by a second radial overtone is unlikely.

 - **Abstract**
 The nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko exhibits a broad spectral reflectance feature around 3.2 $\mu$m, which is omnipresent in all spectra of the surface, and whose attribution has remained elusive since its discovery. Based on laboratory experiments, we have shown that most of this absorption feature is due to ammonium (NH4+) salts mixed with the dark surface material. The depth of the band is compatible with semi-volatile ammonium salts being a major reservoir of nitrogen in the comet, which could dominate over refractory organic matter and volatile species. These salts may thus represent the long-sought reservoir of nitrogen in comets, possibly bringing their nitrogen-to-carbon ratio in agreement with the solar value. Moreover, the reflectance spectra of several asteroids are compatible with the presence of NH4+ salts at their surfaces. The presence of such salts, and other NH4+-bearing compounds on asteroids, comets, and possibly in proto-stellar environments, suggests that NH4+ may be a tracer of the incorporation and transformation of nitrogen in ices, minerals and organics, at different phases of the formation of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 The presented paper is an attempt to investigate the dynamical states of an hydrodynamical isothermal turbulent self-gravitating system using some powerful tools of the classical thermodynamics. Our main assumption, inspired by the work of Keto et al. (2020), is that turbulent kinetic energy can be substituted for the macro-temperature of chaotic motion of fluid elements. As a proper sample for our system we use a model of turbulent self-gravitating isothermal molecular cloud which is at final stages of its life-cycle, when the dynamics is nearly in steady state. Starting from this point, we write down the internal energy for a physically small cloud's volume, and then using the first principle of thermodynamics obtain in explicit form the entropy, free energy, and Gibbs potential for this volume. Setting fiducial boundary conditions for the latter system (small volume) we explore its stability as a grand canonical ensemble. Searching for extrema of the Gibbs potential we obtain conditions for its minimum, which corresponds to a stable dynamical state of hydrodynamical system. This result demonstrates the ability of our novel approach.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the detection prospects for potential Primordial Black Hole Binary (PBHB) populations buried in the Stellar-Origin Black Hole Binary (SOBHB) population inferred by the LVK collaboration. We consider different PBHB population scenarios and several future Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors. To separate the PBHB component from the SOBHB one, we exploit the prediction that the PBHB merger rate does not decline as fast as the SOBHB one at high redshift. However, only a tiny fraction of PBHB events may be resolved individually, and the sub-threshold events may yield an undetectable Stochastic GW Background (SGWB). For this reason, we determine the statistical significance of the PBHB contributions in the number of resolvable events seen in future Earth-based detectors and the SGWB measured at LISA. We find that the synergy between these probes will consistently help assess whether or not a sizeable PBHB population is present.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we investigate dark matter structure formation in the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model using the PINOCCHIO algorithm. We first present 2nd order Lagrangian perturbation theory for the nDGP model, which shows that the 1st- and 2nd-order growth functions in nDGP are larger than those in {\Lambda}CDM. We then examine the dynamics of ellipsoidal collapse in nDGP, which is accelerated compared to {\Lambda}CDM due to enhanced gravitational interactions. Running the nDGP-PINOCCHIO code with a box size of 512 Mpc/h and 1024*1024*1024 particles, we analyze the statistical properties of the output halo catalogs, including the halo power spectrum and halo mass function. The calibrated PINOCCHIO halo power spectrum agrees with N-body simulations within 5% in the comoving wavenumber range k < 0.3 (h/Mpc) at redshift z = 0. The agreement is extended to smaller scales for higher redshifts. For the cumulative halo mass function, the agreement between N-body and PINOCCHIO is also within the simulation scatter.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Different theories have been developed to explain the origins and properties of close-in giant planets, but none of them alone can explain all of the properties of the warm Jupiters (WJs, Porb = 10 - 200 days). One of the most intriguing characteristics of WJs is that they have a wide range of orbital eccentricities, challenging our understanding of their formation and evolution. Aims. The investigation of these systems is crucial in order to put constraints on formation and evolution theories. TESS is providing a significant sample of transiting WJs around stars bright enough to allow spectroscopic follow-up studies. Methods. We carried out a radial velocity (RV) follow-up study of the TESS candidate TOI-4515 b with the high-resolution spectrograph HARPS-N in the context of the GAPS project, the aim of which is to characterize young giant planets, and the TRES and FEROS spectrographs. We then performed a joint analysis of the HARPS-N, TRES, FEROS, and TESS data in order to fully characterize this planetary system. Results. We find that TOI-4515 b orbits a 1.2 Gyr-old G-star, has an orbital period of Pb = 15.266446 +- 0.000013 days, a mass of Mb = 2.01 +- 0.05 MJ, and a radius of Rb = 1.09 +- 0.04 RJ. We also find an eccentricity of e = 0.46 +- 0.01, placing this planet among the WJs with highly eccentric orbits. As no additional companion has been detected, this high eccentricity might be the consequence of past violent scattering events.

 - **Abstract**
 Methods: Broad- and narrow-band imaging of AFGL 5180 was made in the NIR with the LBT, in both seeing-limited ($\sim0.5\arcsec$) and high angular resolution ($\sim0.09\arcsec$) Adaptive Optics (AO) modes, as well as with HST. Archival ALMA continuum data was also utilized. Results: At least 40 jet knots were identified via NIR emission from H$_2$ and [FeII] tracing shocked gas. Bright jet knots outflowing from the central most massive protostar, S4, are detected towards the east of the source and are resolved in fine detail with the AO imaging. Additional knots are distributed throughout the field, likely indicating the presence of multiple driving sources. Sub-millimeter sources detected by ALMA are shown to be grouped in two main complexes, AFGL 5180 M and a small cluster $\sim15\arcsec$ to the south, AFGL 5180 S. From our NIR continuum images we identify YSO candidates down to masses of $\sim 0.1\:M_\odot$. Combined with the sub-mm sources, this yields a surface number density of such YSOs of $N_* \sim 10^3 {\rm pc}^{-2}$ within a projected radius of about 0.1 pc. Such a value is similar to those predicted by models of both Core Accretion from a turbulent clump environment and Competitive Accretion. The radial profile of $N_*$ is relatively flat on scales out to 0.2~pc, with only modest enhancement around the massive protostar inside 0.05~pc. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of high-resolution NIR imaging, in particular with AO, for detecting outflow activity and YSOs in distant regions. The presented images reveal the complex morphology of outflow-shocked gas within the large-scale bipolar flow of a massive protostar, as well as clear evidence for several other outflow driving sources in the region. Finally, this work presents a novel approach to compare the observed YSO surface number density from our study against different models of massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The first orbits around Jupiter of the Juno spacecraft in 2016 revealed a symmetric structure of multiple cyclones that remained stable over the next five years. Trajectories of individual cyclones indicated a consistent westward circumpolar motion around both poles. In this paper, we propose an explanation for this tendency using the concept of beta-drift and a "center-of-mass" approach. We suggest that the motion of these cyclones as a group can be represented by an equivalent sole cyclone, which is continuously pushed by beta-drift poleward and westward, embodying the westward motion of the individual cyclones. We support our hypothesis with 2D model simulations and observational evidence, demonstrating this mechanism for the westward drift. This study joins consistently with previous studies that revealed how aspects of these cyclones result from vorticity-gradient forces, shedding light on the physical nature of Jupiter's polar cyclones.

 - **Abstract**
 Providing an accurate modeling of neutrino physics in dense astrophysical environments such as binary neutron star mergers presents a challenge for hydrodynamic simulations. Nevertheless, understanding how flavor transformation can occur and affect the dynamics, the mass ejection, and the nucleosynthesis will need to be achieved in the future. We introduce a study of fast flavor oscillations based on a linear stability analysis using the first angular moments of the neutrino distributions, which are the quantities frequently evolved in computationally expensive, large-scale simulations. Such a method requires generalizing the classical closure relations that appropriately truncate the hierarchy of moment equations to treat quantum flavor coherence. After showing the efficiency of this method on a well-understood test situation, we perform a systematic search of the occurrence of fast flavor instabilities in a neutron star merger simulation. We discuss the successes and shortcomings of moment linear stability analysis, as this framework provides a time-efficient way to design and study better closure prescriptions in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study multimessenger emissions from these pulsars, including gamma rays and particles. We simulated particle propagation throughout the Galaxy using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma ray emission. Furthermore, we used the Gammapy software to perform gamma ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. The results indicate that CTA may be able to observe these sources and demonstrate the significant influence of gamma rays produced by proton propagation on the high-energy gamma ray spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft with Dimorphos allows us to study asteroid collision physics, including momentum transfer, the ejecta properties, and the visibility of such events in the Solar System. We report observations of the DART impact in the ultraviolet (UV), visible light, and near-infrared (IR) wavelengths. The observations support the existence of at least two separate components of the ejecta: a fast and a slow component. The fast-ejecta component is composed of a gaseous phase, moving at about 1.6 km/s with a mass of <10^4 kg. The fast ejecta is detected in the UV and visible light, but not in the near-IR $z$-band observations. Fitting a simplified optical thickness model to these observations allows us to constrain some of the properties of the fast ejecta, including its scattering efficiency and the opacity of the gas. The slow ejecta component is moving at typical velocities of up to about 10 m/s. It is composed of micrometer-size particles, that have a scattering efficiency, at the direction of the observer, of the order of 10^-3 and a total mass of about 10^6 kg. The larger particles in the slow ejecta, whose size is bound to be in the range between ~1 mm to ~1 m, likely have a scattering efficiency larger than that of the pre-impact Didymos system.
