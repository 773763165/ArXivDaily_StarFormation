 - **Abstract**
 Despite the 30-year history of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) studies, issues like the majority of their physical natures (i.e., neutron stars, stellar-mass black holes, or intermediate black holes) as well as the accretion mechanisms are still under debate. Expanding the ULX sample size in the literature is clearly a way to help. To this end, we investigated the X-ray source population, ULXs in particular, in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1559 using a Chandra observation made in 2016. In this 45-ks exposure, 33 X-ray point sources were detected within the 2.'7 isophotal radius of the galaxy. Among them, 8 ULXs were identified with the criterion of the X-ray luminosity $L_x>10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.3-7~keV). Both X-ray light curves and spectra of all the sources were examined. Except for some low-count spectra that only provide ambiguous spectral fitting results, all the X-ray sources were basically spectrally hard and therefore likely have non-thermal origins. While no strong X-ray variability was present in most of the sources owing to the relatively short exposure of the observation, we found an intriguing ULX, named X-24, exhibiting a periodicity of $\sim$7500s with a detection significance of 2.7$\sigma$. We speculate that it is the orbital period of the system. Roche-lobe over flow and Roche limit are consistent with the speculation. Thus, we suggest that X-24 may be the one of the rare compact binary ULXs, and hence, a good candidate as a stellar-mass black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 Concentrated solar power is a promising technique enabling renewable energy production with large scale solar power plants in the near future. Estimating quantitatively the reflectivity of a solar concentrator is a major issue, since it has a significant impact on the flux distribution formed on the solar receiver. Moreover, it is desirable that the mirrors can be measured during operation in order to evaluate environmental factors such as day night thermal cycles or soiling and ageing effects at the reflective surfaces. For that purpose, we used a backward gazing method that was originally developed to measure mirror shape and misalignment errors. The method operates in quasi real-time without disturbing the heat production process. It was successfully tested at a solar tower power plant in France. Its basic principle consists in acquiring four simultaneous images of a Sun-tracking heliostat, captured from different observation points located near the thermal receiver. The images are then processed with a minimization algorithm allowing the determination of mirror slopes errors. In this communication, it is shown that the algorithm also allows one to get quantitative reflectivity maps at the surface of the heliostat. The measurement is fully remote and is used to evaluate surface reflectivity that depends on optical coatings quality and soiling. Preliminary results obtained with a Themis heliostat are presented. They show that reflectivity measurements can be carried out within repeatability about 10 percent Peak-to-Valley (PTV) and 1 percent RMS. Ways to improving these numbers are discussed in the paper

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of SN 2022joj, a peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). SN 2022joj exhibits an unusually red $g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color at early times and a rapid blueward evolution afterwards. Around maximum brightness, SN 2022joj shows a high luminosity ($M_{g_\mathrm{ZTF},\mathrm{max}}\simeq-19.7$ mag), a blue broadband color ($g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}\simeq-0.2$ mag), and shallow Si II absorption lines, consistent with those of overluminous, SN 1991T-like events. The maximum-light spectrum also shows prominent absorption around 4200 \r{A}, which resembles the Ti II features in subluminous, SN 1991bg-like events. Despite the blue optical-band colors, SN 2022joj exhibits extremely red ultraviolet $-$ optical colors at maximum luminosity ($u-v\simeq1.6$ mag and $uvw1 - v\simeq4.0$ mag), suggesting a suppression of flux between $\sim$2500--4000 \r{A}. Strong C II lines are also detected at peak. We show that these unusual spectroscopic properties are broadly consistent with the helium-shell double detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass ($M\simeq1\mathrm{M_\odot}$) carbon/oxygen (C/O) white dwarf (WD) from a relatively massive helium shell ($M_s\simeq0.04$--$0.1\mathrm{M_\odot}$), if observed along a line of sight roughly opposite to where the shell initially detonates. None of the existing models could quantitatively explain all the peculiarities observed in SN 2022joj. The low flux ratio of [Ni II] $\lambda$7378 to [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission in the late-time nebular spectra indicates a low yield of stable Ni isotopes, favoring a sub-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. The significant blueshift measured in the [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 line is also consistent with an asymmetric chemical distribution in the ejecta, as is predicted in double-detonation models.

 - **Abstract**
 In this project, we determined the constraints on the modified tidal quality factor, $Q_{pl}'$, of gas-giant planets orbiting close to their host stars. We allowed $Q_{pl}'$ to depend on tidal frequency, accounting for the multiple tidal waves with time-dependent frequencies simultaneously present on the planet. We performed our analysis on 78 single-star and single-planet systems, with giant planets and host stars with radiative cores and convective outer shells. We extracted constraints on the frequency-dependent $Q_{pl}'$ for each system separately and combined them to find general constraints on $Q_{pl}'$ required to explain the observed eccentricity envelope while simultaneously allowing the observed eccentricities of all systems to survive to the present day. Individual systems do not place tight constraints on $Q_{pl}'$. However, since similar planets must have similar tidal dissipation, we require that a consistent, possibly frequency-dependent, model must apply. Under that assumption, we find that the value of $\log_{10}Q_{pl}'$ for HJs is $5.0\pm0.5$ for the range of tidal period from 0.8 to 7 days. We did not see any clear sign of frequency dependence of $Q_{pl}'$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic data for SN 2022joj, a nearby peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with a fast decline rate ($\rm{\Delta m_{15,B}=1.4}$ mag). SN 2022joj shows exceedingly red colors, with a value of approximately ${B-V \approx 1.1}$ mag during its initial stages, beginning from $11$ days before maximum brightness. As it evolves the flux shifts towards the blue end of the spectrum, approaching ${B-V \approx 0}$ mag around maximum light. Furthermore, at maximum light and beyond, the photometry is consistent with that of typical SNe Ia. This unusual behavior extends to its spectral characteristics, which initially displayed a red spectrum and later evolved to exhibit greater consistency with typical SNe Ia. We consider two potential explanations for this behavior: double detonation from a helium shell on a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and Chandrasekhar-mass models with a shallow distribution of $\rm{^{56}Ni}$. The shallow nickel models could not reproduce the red colors in the early light curves. Spectroscopically, we find strong agreement between SN 2022joj and double-detonation models with white dwarf masses around 1 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and thin He-shell between 0.01 and 0.02 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. Moreover, the early red colors are explained by line-blanketing absorption from iron-peak elements created by the double detonation scenario in similar mass ranges. However, the nebular spectra composition in SN 2022joj deviates from expectations for double detonation, as we observe strong [Fe III] emission instead of [Ca II] lines as anticipated from double detonation models. More detailed modeling, e.g., including viewing angle effects, is required to test if double detonation models can explain the nebular spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the 2023 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. Since the previous major release, migrations of our online services motivated us to adopt git as our version control system. This change alone led us to adopt an annual release scheme, accompanied by a short release paper, the present being the inaugural. Significant changes to our atomic and molecular data have improved the accuracy of Cloudy predictions: we have upgraded our instance of the Chianti database from version 7 to 10; our H- and He-like collisional rates to improved theoretical values; our molecular data to the most recent LAMDA database, and several chemical reaction rates to their most recent UDfA and KiDA values. Finally, we describe our progress on upgrading Cloudy's capabilities to meet the requirements of the X-ray microcalorimeters aboard the upcoming XRISM and Athena missions, and outline future development that will make Cloudy of use to the X-ray community.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate an Early Coupled Quintessence model where a light scalar mediates a fifth force stronger than gravity among dark matter particles and leads to the growth of perturbations prior to matter-radiation equality. Using cosmological data from the $\textit{Planck}$ Cosmic Microwave Background power spectra, the Pantheon+ Type 1a Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we constrain the coupling strength $\beta$ and the redshift $z_{\rm OFF}$ at which the interaction becomes effectively inactive, finding a firm degeneracy between these two parameters which holds true regardless of when the scaling regime begins.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of the millimeter CH$_3$OH masers including a new detection of class I (11$_{0,11}$-10$_{1,10}$A) and class II (6$_{1,5}$-5$_{2,4}$E) maser transitions toward the high-mass protostar S255IR NIRS3 in post-burst phase. The CH$_3$OH emissions were detected as a mixture of maser and thermal characteristics. We examine the detected transitions using an excitation diagram and LTE model spectra and compare the observed properties with those of thermal lines. Class II CH$_3$OH maser transitions showed distinctive intensity and velocity distributions from those of thermal transitions. Bright distinct emission components in addition to the fragmented and arc-shaped emissions are only detected in class I CH$_3$OH maser transitions toward southern and western directions from the protostellar position, implying the presence of the slow outflow shocks.
#### Quantum mechanical modeling of the grain-surface formation of  acetaldehyde on H$_2$O:CO dirty ice surfaces

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06492
 - **Abstract**
 Acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) is one of the most detected interstellar Complex Organic Molecule (iCOM) in the interstellar medium (ISM). These species have a potential biological relevance, as they can be precursors of more complex species from which life could have emerged. The formation of iCOMs in the ISM is a challenge and a matter of debate, whether gas-phase, grain-surface chemistry or both are needed for their synthesis. In the gas-phase, CH$_3$CHO can be efficiently synthesized from ethanol and/or ethyl radical. On the grain-surfaces, radical-radical recombinations were traditionally invoked. However, several pitfalls have been recently identified, such as the presence of energy barriers and competitive side reactions (i.e., H abstractions). Here we investigate a new grain-surface reaction pathway for the formation of acetaldehyde, namely the reaction between CH$_3$ and a CO molecule of a dirty water/CO ice followed by hydrogenation of its product, CH$_3$CO. To this end, we carried out \textit{ab initio} computations of the reaction occurring on an ice composed by 75% water and 25% CO molecules. We found that the CH$_3$ + CO$_{(ice)}$ reaction exhibits barriers difficult to overcome in the ISM, either adopting a Langmuir-Hinshelwood or an Eley-Rideal mechanism. The subsequent hydrogenation step is found to be barrierless, provided that the two reacting species have the correct orientation. Therefore, this pathway seems unlikely to occur in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an update to the in-flight radiometric calibration of the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), revising and extending our previous studies. We analyze full-spectral EIS observations of quiet Sun and active regions from 2007 until 2022. Using CHIANTI version 10, we adjust the EIS relative effective areas for a selection of dates with emission measure analyses of off-limb quiet Sun. We find generally good agreement (within typically $\pm$ 15%) between measured and expected line intensities. We then consider selected intensity ratios for all the dates and apply an automatic fitting method to adjust the relative effective areas. To constrain the absolute values from 2010 we force agreement between EIS and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 193 Angstroms observations. The resulting calibration, with an uncertainty of about $\pm$ 20%, is then validated in various ways, including flare line ratios from Fe XXIV and Fe XVII, emission measure analyses of cool active region loops, and several density-dependent line ratios.
#### The Impact of Angular Momentum Loss on the Outcomes of Binary Mass  Transfer

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06666
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06666
 - **Abstract**
 We use the rapid binary population synthesis code COMPAS to investigate commonly used prescriptions for the determination of mass transfer stability in close binaries and the orbital separations after stable mass transfer. The degree of orbital tightening during non-conservative mass transfer episodes is governed by the poorly-constrained angular momentum carried away by the ejected material. Increased orbital tightening drives systems towards unstable mass transfer leading to a common envelope. We find that the fraction of interacting binaries that will undergo only stable mass transfer throughout their lives fluctuates between a few and $\sim 20\%$ due to uncertainty in the angular momentum loss alone. If mass transfer is significantly non-conservative, stability prescriptions that rely on the assumption of conservative mass transfer under-predict the number of systems which experience unstable mass transfer and stellar mergers. This may substantially impact predictions about the rates of various transients, including luminous red novae, stripped-envelope supernovae, X-ray binaries, and the progenitors of coalescing compact binaries.
#### Chance coincidences between black hole low-mass X-ray binaries and  supernova remnants

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06678
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06678
 - **Abstract**
 I argue that black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH LMXBs) are very unlikely to be physically associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). The timescales of BH LMXBs are so much longer than those of SNRs, that there is only a 0.2% chance of any BH LMXB being identified within its natal SNR. However, the probability of a BH LMXB being projected within a SNR is significant; I estimate that 2 BH LMXBs should be projected within SNRs from our perspective. I look more closely at the suggestion by Balakrishnan and collaborators of an association between the BH X-ray binary Swift J1728.9-3613 and the SNR G351.9-0.9, and show that this is most likely a chance coincidence.
#### Indirect dark matter search in the Galactic Centre with IceCube

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06729
 - **Abstract**
 It is assumed that dark matter can annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles which then can produce a neutrino flux detectable at IceCube. Such a signal can be emitted from the Galactic Center thanks to the high density of dark matter abundance being gravitationally captured. This analysis aims at searching for neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation and decay in the Galactic Center using $\sim$9 years of IceCube-DeepCore data with an optimized selection for low energy. In this contribution, we present the sensitivities on the thermally averaged dark matter self-annihilation cross-section for dark matter masses ranging from 5 GeV up to 8 TeV.
#### Toward more accurate RR Lyrae metallicities

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06790
 - **Abstract**
 By using a large sample of published spectroscopic iron abundances, we point out the importance of gravity correction in deriving more accurate metal abundances for RR Lyrae stars. For the 197 stars with multiple spectra we find overall [Fe/H] standard deviations of 0.167 (as published), 0.145 (shifted by data source zero points) and 0.121 (both zero point-shifted and gravity-corrected). These improvements are significant at the ~2 sigma level at each correction step, leading to a clearly significant improvement after both corrections applied. The higher quality of the gravity-corrected metallicities is strongly supported also by the tighter correlation with the metallicities predicted from the period and Fourier phase phi_31. This work underlines the need for using some external estimates of the temporal gravity in the chemical abundance analysis rather than relying on a full-fetched spectrum fit that leads to large correlated errors in the estimated parameters.
#### The BINGO Project IX: Search for Fast Radio Bursts -- A Forecast for the  BINGO Interferometry System

 - **Abstract**
 The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO) radio telescope will use the neutral Hydrogen emission line to map the Universe in the redshift range $0.127 \le z \le 0.449$, with the main goal of probing BAO. In addition, the instrument optical design and hardware configuration support the search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). In this work, we propose the use of a BINGO Interferometry System (BIS) including new auxiliary, smaller, radio telescopes (hereafter \emph{outriggers}). The interferometric approach makes it possible to pinpoint the FRB sources in the sky. We present here the results of several BIS configurations combining BINGO horns with and without mirrors ($4$ m, $5$ m, and $6$ m) and 5, 7, 9, or 10 for single horns. We developed a new {\tt Python} package, the {\tt FRBlip}, which generates synthetic FRB mock catalogs and computes, based on a telescope model, the observed signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) that we used to compute numerically the detection rates of the telescopes and how many interferometry pairs of telescopes (\emph{baselines}) can observe an FRB. FRBs observed by more than one baseline are the ones whose location can be determined. We thus evaluate the performance of BIS regarding FRB localization. We found that BIS will be able to localize 23 FRBs yearly with single horn outriggers in the best configuration (using 10 outriggers of 6 m mirrors), with redshift $z \leq 0.96$; the full localization capability depends on the number and the type of the outriggers. Wider beams are best to pinpoint FRB sources because potential candidates will be observed by more baselines, while narrow beams look deep in redshift. The BIS can be a powerful extension of the regular BINGO telescope, dedicated to observe hundreds of FRBs during Phase 1. Many of them will be well localized with a single horn + 6 m dish as outriggers.(Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a single-field model of inflation that achieves remarkable agreement with Planck and BICEP/Keck cosmological observations. The model, via the presence of an ultra-slow-roll phase, generates a sizable scalar-induced gravitational wave (GW) signal at nHz frequencies. We elucidate the distinctive features of this signal concerning its connection to the recent measurement of the low-frequency GW background reported by the NANOGrav collaboration.
#### A Model-independent Method to Determine $H_0$ using Time-Delay Lensing,  Quasars and Type Ia Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Future observations could provide strong lensing time delay distances with source redshifts up to $z\,\simeq\,4$, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. Quasars are also observed at high redshifts and can be potentially used as standard candles based on a linear relation between the log of the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray luminosities. In order to make full use of time delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine the Hubble constant. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances. We first generate mock datasets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of $H_0$ model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the $H_0$ results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enables the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of $H_0$ from $2.1\%$ to $1.3\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the beginning of robotic interplanetary exploration nearly six decades ago, successful atmospheric entry has been accomplished at Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Titan. More entry probe missions are planned to Venus, Titan, and Uranus in the next decade. Atmospheric entry subjects the vehicle to rapid deceleration and aerothermal loads which the vehicle must be designed for, to deliver the robotic instruments inside the atmosphere. The design of planetary probes and their mission architecture is complex, and involves various engineering constraints such as peak deceleration, heating rate, heating load, and communications which must be satisfied within the budget and schedule of cost constrained mission opportunities. Engineering design data from previous entry probe missions serve as a valuable reference for designing future missions. The present study compiles an augmented version of the blue book entry probe dataset, performs a comparative analysis of the entry conditions, and provides engineering rules of thumb for design of future missions. Using the dataset, the present study proposes a new empirical correlation which aims to more accurately predict the thermal protection system mass fraction for high heat load conditions during entry and aerocapture at Uranus and Neptune.
#### Constraints on primordial black holes in the mixed dark matter scenarios  using the ratio $\rm (^3{He}+D)/H$

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the upper limit on the dark matter (DM) fraction in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mixed DM scenarios. In this scenarios, a PBH can accrete weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) to form a ultracompact minihalo (UCMH) with a density profile of $\rho_{\rm DM}(r)\sim r^{-9/4}$. The energy released from UCMHs due to dark matter annihilation has influence on the photodissociation of $^{4}{\rm He}$, producing the $^{3}{\rm He}$ and the D. By requiring that the ratio $\rm (^3{He}+D)/H$ caused by UCMHs does not exceed the measured value, we derive the upper limit on the dark matter fraction in PBHs. For the canonical value of DM thermally averaged annihilation cross section $\left<\sigma v\right>=3\times 10^{-26}\rm cm^{3}s^{-1}$, we find that the upper limit is $f_{\rm PBH} < 0.35(0.75)$ for DM mass $m_{\chi}=1(10)~\rm GeV$. Compared with other limits obtained by different astronomical measurements, although our limit is not the strongest, we provide a different way of constraining the cosmological abundance of PBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries routinely exhibit Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in their Power density spectrum. Studies of QPOs have demonstrated immense ability to understand these dynamical systems although their unambiguous origin still remains a challenge. We investigate the energy-dependent properties of the Type-C QPOs detected for H 1743-322 as observed with AstroSat in its two X-ray outbursts of 2016 and 2017. The combined broadband LAXPC and SXT spectrum is well modelled with a soft thermal and a hard Comptonization component. The QPO exhibits soft/negative lags i.e. variation in soft band lags the variation in hard band, although the upper harmonic shows opposite behaviour i.e. hard/positive lags. Here, we model energy-dependent properties (fractional root mean square and time-lag variation with energy) of the QPO and its upper harmonic individually with a general scheme that fits these properties by utilizing the spectral information and consequently allows to identify the radiative component responsible for producing the variability. Considering the truncated disk picture of accretion flow, a simple model with variation in inner disk temperature, heating rate and fractional scattering with time delays is able to describe the fractional RMS and time-lag spectra. In this work, we show that this technique can successfully describe the energy-dependent features and identify the spectral parameters generating the variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of transient phenomena like Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares and explosions (novae and supernovae), combined with the detection of novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has revolutionized astrophysics over the last years. The discovery potential of both ulti-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations as well as serendipitous observations could be maximized with a novel tool which allows for quickly acquiring an overview over relevant information associated with each new detection. Here we present Astro-COLIBRI, a novel and comprehensive platform for this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI's architecture comprises a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system and a website as well as apps for iOS and Android as clients for users. Astro-COLIBRI evaluates incoming messages of astronomical observations from all available alert streams in real time, filters them by user specified criteria and puts them into their MWL and MM context. The clients provide a graphical representation with an easy to grasp summary of the relevant data to allow for the fast identification of interesting phenomena, provides an assessment of observing conditions at a large selection of observatories around the world, and much more. Here the key features of Astro-COLIBRI are presented. We outline the architecture, summarize the used data resources, and provide examples for applications and use cases. Focussing on the high-energy domain, we'll discuss the use of the platform in searches for high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the spherical collapse model to demonstrate that the observable average density of virialized clusters depends on the properties of dark energy along with the properties of gravity on cluster scales and can therefore be used as a probe of these properties. As an application of this approach we derive the predicted virialized densities and radii of cluster mass structures for a wide range of values of the cosmological constant (including negative values) as a function of the turnaround redshift. For the value of $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}=-0.7$ (with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.3$) preferred by $\Lambda$ sign-switching models ($\Lambda_s\text{CDM}$) proposed for the resolution of the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions, we find an amplification of the density of virialized clusters which can be as large as $80\%$ compared to \plcdm for a turnaround redshift $z_{\text{max}} \gtrsim 2$. Such an amplification may lead to more efficient early galaxy formation in this class of models in accordance with the recent findings of JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the kinetically coupled early dark energy (EDE) and scalar field dark matter to address cosmological tensions. The EDE model presents an intriguing theoretical approach to resolving the Hubble tension, but it introduces challenges such as the "why then" problem of why EDE was injected during the epoch of matter-radiation equality, and exacerbates existing large-scale structure tension. Therefore, we consider the interaction between dark matter and EDE, such that the dynamics of EDE are triggered by the dark matter, and the drag effect of dark energy on dark matter suppresses structure growth, which can alleviate large-scale structure tension. We replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter, which has the property of suppressing structure growth on small scales. We employed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the model parameters by utilising a variety of cosmological data, our new model reveals a non-zero coupling constant of $0.030 \pm 0.026$ at a 68\% confidence level. The coupled model yields a Hubble constant value of $72.38^{+0.71}_{-0.82}$ \,km\,/\,s\,/\,Mpc, which resolves the Hubble tension. However, similar to the EDE model, it also obtains a larger $S_8$ value compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, further exacerbating the large-scale structure tension. The best-fit $S_8$ value for the EDE model is $0.8316$, whereas our new model yields a smaller value of $0.8134$. Additionally, the coupled model exhibits a smaller $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ value compared to the EDE model and the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a better fit to the data.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are supposed to form through the gravitational collapse of regions with large density fluctuations. The formation of PBHs inevitably leads to the emission of scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals, offering a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis of PBHs as a constituent of dark matter (DM). Previous studies have calculated the energy spectrum of SIGWs in local-type non-Gaussian models, primarily considering the contributions from the $F_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order or the $G_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order while neglecting connected diagrams. In this study, we extend the previous work by (i) considering the full contribution of non-Gaussian diagrams up to the $G_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order; (ii) deriving the generic scaling of the SIGW energy spectrum in the infrared region. We derive semi-analytical results applicable to arbitrary primordial power spectra and numerically evaluate the energy spectrum of SIGWs for a log-normal power spectrum.
#### High-resolution emission spectroscopy retrievals of MASCARA-1b with  CRIRES+: Strong detections of CO, H$_2$O and Fe emission lines and a C$/$O  consistent with solar

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres has proven to be successful using high-resolution spectroscopy. Phase curve observations of hot/ultra-hot Jupiters can reveal their compositions and thermal structures, thereby allowing the detection of molecules and atoms in the planetary atmosphere using the cross-correlation technique. We present pre-eclipse observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter, MASCARA-1b, observed with the recently upgraded CRIRES+ high-resolution infrared spectrograph at the VLT. We report a detection of $\rm Fe$ ($\approx$8.3$\sigma$) in the K-band and confirm previous detections of $\rm CO$ (>15$\sigma$) and $\rm H_2O$ (>10$\sigma$) in the day-side atmosphere of MASCARA-1b. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we retrieve the abundances of the detected species and constrain planetary orbital velocities, $T$-$P$ profiles, and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio ($\rm C/O$). A free retrieval results in an elevated $\rm CO$ abundance ($\log_{10}$($\chi_{\rm{{}^{12}CO}}$) = $-2.85^{+0.57}_{-0.69}$), leading to a super-solar $\rm C/O$ ratio. More realistically, allowing for vertically-varying chemistry in the atmosphere by incorporating a chemical-equilibrium model results in a $\rm C/O$ of $0.68^{+0.12}_{-0.22}$ and a metallicity of $[\rm M/H] = 0.62^{+0.28}_{-0.55}$, both consistent with solar values. Finally, we also report a slight offset of the $\rm Fe$ feature in both K$_{\rm p}$ and v$_{\rm sys}$ that could be a signature of atmospheric dynamics. Due to the 3D structure of exoplanet atmospheres and the exclusion of time/phase dependence in our 1D forward models, further follow-up observations and analysis are required to confirm or refute this result.
#### Lightcurve and spectral modelling of the Type IIb SN 2020acat. Evidence  for a strong Ni bubble effect on the diffusion time

 - **Abstract**
 We use the light curve and spectral synthesis code JEKYLL to calculate a set of macroscopically mixed Type IIb supernova (SN) models, which are compared to both previously published and new late-phase observations of SN 2020acat. The models differ in the initial mass, the radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and the properties of the hydrogen envelope. The best match to the photospheric and nebular spectra and lightcurves of SN 2020acat is found for a model with an initial mass of 17 solar masses, strong radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and a 0.1 solar mass hydrogen envelope with a low hydrogen mass-fraction of 0.27. The most interesting result is that strong expansion of the clumps containing radioactive material seems to be required to fit the observations of SN 2020acat both in the diffusion phase and the nebular phase. These "Ni bubbles" are expected to expand due to heating from radioactive decays, but the degree of expansion is poorly constrained. Without strong expansion there is a tension between the diffusion phase and the subsequent evolution, and models that fit the nebular phase produce a diffusion peak that is too broad. The diffusion phase lightcurve is sensitive to the expansion of the "Ni bubbles", as the resulting Swiss-cheese-like geometry decreases the effective opacity and therefore the diffusion time. This effect has not been taken into account in previous lightcurve modelling of stripped-envelope SNe, which may lead to a systematic underestimate of their ejecta masses. It should be emphasized, though, that JEKYLL is limited to a geometry that is spherically symmetric on average, and large-scale asymmetries may also play a role. The relatively high initial mass found for the progenitor of SN 2020acat places it at the upper end of the mass distribution of Type IIb SN progenitors, and a single star origin can not be excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding orbital obliquities, or the misalignment angles between a star's rotation axis and the orbital axis of its planets, is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms of planetary formation and migration. In this study, we present an analysis of Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations of the warm Jupiter exoplanet WASP-106 b. The high-precision radial velocity measurements were made with HARPS and HARPS-N during the transit of this planet. We aim to constrain the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to its host star's rotation axis. The RM observations are analyzed using a code which models the RM anomaly together with the Keplerian orbit given several parameters in combination with a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation. We measure the projected stellar obliquity in the WASP-106 system for the first time and find $\lambda = (-1 \pm 11)^\circ$, supporting the theory of quiescent migration through the disk.
#### Dynamical characterization of the 6/1 mean motion resonance between  Quaoar's ring and Weywot

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it has been reported the discovery of a dense ring around the trans-Neptunian object 50000 Quaoar. The ring particles seem to be very close to the 6/1 mean motion resonance with Weywot, the only known satellite in the system. In this work we investigate the dynamical environment in the close vicinity of the 6/1 orbital resonance in the context of the restricted three body problem. We aim to analyze whether, in view of observational constraints, the ring could be effectively evolving in resonant motion with the satellite. Through the technique of dynamical maps we identify and characterize the 6/1 mean motion resonance, finding that the main location of the resonance deviates by only $29$ km from the central part of the ring. This difference lies within the 3$\sigma$ confidence level, considering the uncertainties in the observational parameters. We also show that the Weywot's eccentricity plays a significant role in the dynamical structure of the 6/1 resonance. The results show that the resonance width is smaller than the estimated ring's width. Under assumption of a ring with eccentricity smaller than 0.05, clumping of test particles appears at the position of the different resonant multiplets, considering the nominal value of Weywot's eccentricity. This is in agreement with observations, which indicate that the estimated resonance width ($\leq$ 10 km) is comparable with the narrow and dense arc of material within Quaoar's ring. Our results may be an indicative that the 6/1 resonance resonance plays a key role in confining the arc ring.
#### Data-driven analysis for understanding ultrahigh energy cosmic ray  source spectra

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most challenging open questions regarding the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) deals with the shape of the source emission spectra. A commonly-used simplifying assumption is that the source spectra of the highest energy cosmic rays trace a Peters cycle, in which the maximum cosmic-ray energy scales linearly with $Z$, i.e., with the charge of the UHECR in units of the proton charge. However, this would only be a natural assumption for models in which UHECRs escape the acceleration region without suffering significant energy losses. In most cases, however, UHECRs interact in the acceleration region and/or in the source environment changing the shape of the source emission spectra. Energy losses are typically parameterized in terms of $Z$ and the UHECR baryon number $A$, and therefore one would expect the source emission spectra to be a function of both $Z$ and $A$. Taking a pragmatic approach, we investigate whether existing data favor any region of the $(Z,A)$ parameter space. Using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, we carry out a maximum likelihood analysis of the observed spectrum and nuclear composition to shape the source emission spectra for the various particle species. We also study the impact of possible systematic uncertainties driven by hadronic models describing interactions in the atmosphere.

 We present the extent to which anisotropies in the ultrahigh energy neutrino sky can probe the distribution of extreme astrophysical accelerators in the universe. In this talk, we discuss the origin of an anisotropic neutrino sky and show how observers can use this anisotropy to measure the evolution of ultrahigh energy neutrino sources - and therefore, the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays - for the very first time.

 The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is the only ultrahigh energy (UHE, ${\gtrsim}30$~PeV) neutrino monitor of the Northern sky and will soon be the world's most sensitive high-uptime detector of UHE neutrinos. Because of this, RNO-G represents an important piece of the multimessenger landscape over the next decade. In this talk, we will highlight RNO-G's multimessenger capabilities and its potential to provide key information in the search for the most extreme astrophysical accelerators. In particular, we will highlight opportunities enabled by RNO-G's unique field-of-view, its potential to constrain the sources of UHE cosmic rays, and its complementarity with IceCube at lower energies.

 - **Abstract**
 New X-ray polarisation results are challenging our understanding of the accretion flow geometry in black hole binary systems. Even spectra dominated by a standard disc can give unexpected results, such as the high inclination black hole binary 4U 1630- 472, where the observed X-ray polarisation is much higher than predicted. This system also shows a strong, highly ionised wind, consistent with thermal-radiative driving from the outer disc, leading to speculation that scattering in the wind is responsible for the unexpectedly high polarisation degree from a standard optically thick disk. Here we show that this is not the case. The optically thin(ish) wind polarises the scattered light in a direction orthogonal to that predicted from a standard optically thick disc, reducing about 2% rather than enhancing the predicted polarisation of the total emission. This value is consistent with the polarisation difference between the disc-dominated soft state, where absorption lines by the wind are clearly seen, and the steep power-law state, where no absorption lines are seen. If this difference is genuinely due to the presence or absence of wind, the total polarisation direction must be orthogonal to the disc plane rather than parallel as expected from optically thick material.

 The IceCube Upgrade consists of seven new strings to be deployed in the central region of the existing IceCube detector. The goals of the IceCube Upgrade are two-fold: to enhance sensitivity to neutrinos in the GeV range, and to improve the calibration of the IceCube detector as a means of reducing systematic uncertainties due to the optical properties of the ice. Among other calibration devices designed to study ice properties, a novel camera system will be deployed as part of the Upgrade. The system will include three cameras, each paired with an illumination LED, included in each of the Upgrade optical modules. In total, 2,300 cameras will be deployed. A combination of photographic images from transmitted and reflected light will measure optical properties of both the bulk ice in-between strings and the local ice refrozen in the drill hole. In this contribution, we present the operations plans for these two types of measurements and the sensitivities to the ice properties and geometry of the new modules that can be achieved with the new camera system.

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array Station 1 (A1), the first among five autonomous stations deployed for the ARA experiment at the South Pole, is a unique ultra-high energy neutrino (UHEN) detector based on the Askaryan effect that uses Antarctic ice as the detector medium. Its 16 radio antennas (distributed across 4 strings, each with 2 Vertically Polarized (VPol), 2 Horizontally Polarized (HPol) receivers), and 2 strings of transmitting antennas (calibration pulsers, CPs), each with 1 VPol and 1 HPol channel, are deployed at depths less than 100 m within the shallow firn zone of the 2.8 km thick South Pole (SP) ice. We apply different methods to calibrate its Ice Ray Sampler second generation (IRS2) chip for timing offset and ADC-to-Voltage conversion factors using a known continuous wave input signal to the digitizer, and achieve a precision of sub-nanoseconds. We achieve better calibration for odd, compared to even samples, and also find that the HPols under-perform relative to the VPol channels. Our timing calibrated data is subsequently used to calibrate the ADC-to-Voltage conversion as well as precise antenna locations, as a precursor to vertex reconstruction. The calibrated data will then be analyzed for UHEN signals in the final step of data compression. The ability of A1 to scan the firn region of SP ice sheet will contribute greatly towards a 5-station analysis and will inform the design of the planned IceCube Gen-2 radio array.
