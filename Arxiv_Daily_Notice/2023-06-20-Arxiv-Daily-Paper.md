 - **Abstract**
 Betelgeuse has fascinated people since they first looked at the sky. Here we present a contemporary summary of the observations and theory that lead to our understanding of Betelgeuse as a massive red supergiant doomed to collapse and explosion. At only ~200 parsecs from Earth, Betelgeuse can be spatially resolved yet uncertainties in its distance remain a critical impediment to deeper understanding. The surface of Betelgeuse is rent with a complex structure as deep convective eddies arise to the surface affecting most of its measured physical properties. Determination of the equatorial rotation velocity is critical since some current estimates indicate that Betelgeuse is rotating anomalously rapidly, a property that cannot be explained by single-star evolutionary models. Betelgeuse is also moving through space at relatively high velocity that indicates that it received a boost, likely via collective interaction with other stars in its birth cluster. A bow shock and other structure in the direction of the star's motion suggest that it has affected the organization of the circumstellar and interstellar medium. Betelgeuse varies in brightness on a variety of time scales with 200, 400 and 2000 days being prominent. Betelgeuse is probable to have been born in a binary system, and the high space velocity and apparent rotation have been related to binary star evolution. One possibility is that Betelgeuse underwent common envelope evolution culminating in a final merger with the core of a massive primary. Such merger models have been invoked to account for the anomalous rotation velocity. Betelgeuse underwent a Great Dimming in 2020 that received widespread attention. Explanations have focused on large cool spots on the surface and the expulsion of a cloud of dust that obscured the surface. We sketch the nature of the explosion to come and discuss perspectives for further research.
#### The Dark Neutral Medium is (Mostly) Molecular Hydrogen

 - **Abstract**
 We acquired ALMA ground state absorption profiles of HCO+ and other molecules toward 33 extragalactic continuum sources seen toward the Galactic anticenter, deriving N(H2) = N(HCO+)/3x10^{-9}. We observed J=1-0 CO emission with the IRAM 30m in directions where HCO+ was newly detected. HCO+ absorption was detected in 28 of 33 new directions and CO emission along 19 of those 28. The 5 sightlines lacking detectable HCO+ have 3 times lower mean EBV and N(DNM). Binned in EBV, N(H2) and N(DNM) are strongly correlated and vary by factors of 50-100 over the observed range EBV~0.05-1 mag, while N(HI) varies by factors of only 2-3. On average N(DNM) and N(H2) are well matched, and detecting HCO+ absorption adds little/no H2 in excess of the previously inferred DNM. There are 5 cases where 2N(H2) < N(DNM)/2 indicates saturation of the HI emission. For sightlines with \WCO > 1 K-\kms the CO-H2 conversion factor N(H2)/\WCO\ = 2-3x10^{20}\pcc/K-\kms is higher than derived from studies of resolved clouds in gamma-rays. Our work sampled primarily atomic gas with a mean H2 fraction ~1/3, but the DNM is almost entirely molecular. CO fulfills its role as an H2 tracer when its emission is strong, but large-scale CO surveys are not sensitive to H2 columns associated with typical values N(DNM) = 2-6x10^{20}\pcc. Lower \XCO\ values from $\gamma$-ray studies arise in part from different definitions and usage. Sightlines with \WCO\ \ge 1 K-\kms\ represent 2/3 of the H2 detected in HCO+ and detecting 90% of the H2 would require detecting CO at levels \WCO\~0.2-0.3 K-\kms For full abstract see the paper
#### Astrophysical Uncertainties in the Gravitational-Wave Background from  Stellar-Mass Compact Binary Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) produced by merging binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) in the frequency ranges of LIGO/Virgo/Kagra and LISA. We develop three analytical models, that are calibrated to the measured local merger rates, and complement them with three population synthesis models based on the COSMIC code. We discuss the uncertainties, focusing on the impact of the BBH mass distribution, the effect of the metallicity of the progenitor stars and the time delay distribution between star formation and compact binary merger. We also explore the effect of uncertainties in binary stellar evolution on the background. For BBHs, our analytical models predict $\Omega_{GW}$ in the range $[4.10^{-10}-1.10^{-9}]$ (25 Hz) and $[1.10^{-12}-4.10^{-12}]$ (3 mHz), and between $[2.10^{-10}-2.10^{-9}]$ (25 Hz) and $[7.10^{-13}- 7.10^{-12}]$ (3 mHz) for our population synthesis models. This background is unlikely to be detected during the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra O4 run, but could be detectable with LISA. We predict about 10 BBH and no BNS mergers that could be individually detectable by LISA for a period of observation of 4 years. Our study provides new insights into the population of compact binaries and the main sources of uncertainty in the astrophysical SGWB.
