 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's moon Io is a highly compelling target for future exploration that offers critical insight into tidal dissipation processes and the geology of high heat flux worlds, including primitive planetary bodies, such as the early Earth, that are shaped by enhanced rates of volcanism. Io is also important for understanding the development of volcanogenic atmospheres and mass-exchange within the Jupiter System. However, fundamental questions remain about the state of Io's interior, surface, and atmosphere, as well as its role in the evolution of the Galilean satellites. The Io Volcano Observer (IVO) would address these questions by achieving the following three key goals: (A) Determine how and where tidal heat is generated inside Io; (B) Understand how tidal heat is transported to the surface of Io; and (C) Understand how Io is evolving. IVO was selected for Phase A study through the NASA Discovery program in 2020 and, in anticipation of a New Frontiers 5 opportunity, an enhanced IVO-NF mission concept was advanced that would increase the Baseline mission from 10 flybys to 20, with an improved radiation design; employ a Ka-band communications to double IVO's total data downlink; add a wide angle camera for color and stereo mapping; add a dust mass spectrometer; and lower the altitude of later flybys to enable new science. This study compares and contrasts the mission architecture, instrument suite, and science objectives for Discovery (IVO) and New Frontiers (IVO-NF) missions to Io, and advocates for continued prioritization of Io as an exploration target for New Frontiers.

          The formation of black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars is not trivial: Simulations of thermonuclear pulsations and explosions

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the formation and evolution of rapidly accreting supermassive stars has received significant attention in the hope of better understanding the origin of high redshift quasars. It is often taken for granted that once formed, these supermassive stars will encounter the general relativistic radial instability and collapse to form massive black holes. Here, we present the first ever general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of rapidly accreting supermassive stars. We find that black hole formation is in many cases prevented by nuclear burning due to the long timescales of the collapse of these stars ($10^6$ s). Consequently, this is a novel astrophysical site for hot CNO burning and hydrogen burning via proton captures. For Pop III accreting supermassive stars, we find that only stars with very high (100 $\rm{M_\odot}/$yr) or low (0.1 $\rm{M_\odot}/$yr) accretion rates can form black holes, with models in between undergoing energetic thermonuclear pulsations. The final fate of these pulsating models may be to undergo subsequent pulsations or explosions or to collapse to black holes. For metal rich accreting supermassive stars ($Z\geq 0.1 \rm{Z_\odot}$), we do not find any black hole formation, with some models undergoing extremely energetic explosions ($10^{55}$ ergs). Our results invite further study on the formation of massive black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars which have reached the general relativistic radial instability.
#### Title:
          On the correlation between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and galaxy density in late reionization models

 - **Abstract**
 The relationship between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and local galaxy density (the opacity-density relation) is a key observational test of late reionization models. Using narrow-band surveys of z=5.7 Ly$\alpha$ emitters centered on quasar sight lines, Christenson et al. (2023) showed that two of the most transmissive forest segments at this redshift intersect galaxy underdensities. This is in tension with models of a strongly fluctuating ionizing background, including some late reionization models, which predict that the vast majority of these segments should intersect overdensities where the ionizing intensity is strongest. We use radiative transfer simulations to explore in detail the opacity-density relation in late reionization models. Fields like the one toward quasar PSO J359-06 -- the more underdense of the two transmissive sight lines in Christenson et al. (2023) -- typically contain recently reionized gas in cosmic voids where the hot temperatures and low densities enhance Ly$\alpha$ transmission. The opacity-density relation's transmissive end is sensitive to the amount of neutral gas in voids, and its morphology, set by the reionization source clustering. These effects are, however, degenerate. We demonstrate that models with very different source clustering can yield similar opacity-density relations when their reionization histories are calibrated to match Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux measurements at z<6. In models with fixed source clustering, a lower neutral fraction increases the likelihood of intersecting hot, recently reionized gas in voids, increasing the likelihood of observing PSO J359-06. For instance, the probability of observing this field is 15% in a model with neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}=5\%$ at z=5.7, three times more likely than in a model with $x_{\rm HI}=15\%$. The opacity-density relation may thus provide a complementary probe of reionization's end.

          Dark matter cooling during early matter-domination boosts sub-earth halos

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of an early matter-dominated epoch prior to the big bang nucleosynthesis may lead to a scenario where the thermal dark matter cools faster than plasma before the radiation dominated era begins. In the radiation-dominated epoch, dark matter free-streams after it decouples both chemically and kinetically from the plasma. In the presence of an early matter-dominated era, chemical decoupling of the dark matter may succeed by a partial kinetic decoupling before reheating ends, depending upon the contributions of different partial wave amplitudes in the elastic scattering rate of the dark matter. We show that the s-wave scattering is sufficient to partially decouple the dark matter from the plasma, if the entropy injection during the reheating era depends on the bath temperature, while p-wave scattering leads to full decoupling in such cosmological backdrop. The decoupling of dark matter before the end of reheating causes an additional amount of cooling, reducing its free-streaming horizon compared to usual radiation-dominated cosmology. The enhanced matter perturbations for scales entering the horizon prior to the end of reheating, combined with the reduced free-steaming horizon, increase the number density of sub-earth mass halos. Resulting boost in the dark matter annihilation signatures could offer an intriguing probe to differentiate pre-BBN non-standard cosmological epochs. We show that the free-streaming horizon of the dark matter requires to be smaller than a cut-off to ensure boost in the sub-earth halo populations. As case studies we present two examples: one for a scalar dark matter with s-wave elastic scattering and the other one featuring a fermionic dark matter with p-wave elastic scattering. We identify regions of parameter space in both models where the dark matter kinetically decouples during reheating, amplifying small scale structure formation.

          On the full non-Gaussian Surprise statistic and the cosmological concordance between DESI, SDSS and Pantheon+

 - **Abstract**
 With the increasing precision of recent cosmological surveys and the discovery of important tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is becoming more and more important to develop tools to quantify accurately the discordance between different probes. One such tool is the Surprise statistic, a measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Surprise, however, has been up to now applied only under its Gaussian approximation, which can fail to properly capture discordance in cases that deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In this paper we developed the klsurprise code which computes the full numerical non-Gaussian Surprise, and analyse the Surprise for BAO + BBN and supernova data. We test different cosmological models, some of which the parameters deviate significantly from Gaussianity. We find that the non-Gaussianities, mainly present in the Supernova dataset, change the Surprise statistic significantly from its Gaussian approximation, and reveal a $2.7\sigma$ tension in the curved $w$CDM model (o$w$CDM) between the combined Pantheon+ and SH0ES (Pantheon+ & SH0ES) data and the dataset which combines SDSS, BOSS and eBOSS BAO. This tension is hidden in the Gaussian Surprise approximation. For DESI the tension with Pantheon+ & SH0ES is at the meager $1.9\sigma$ level for o$w$CDM, but a large $3.3\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM.

          Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the supernova Ia hypervelocity runaway white dwarf J0927-6335

 - **Abstract**
 The hot white dwarf (WD) J0927-6335 (Gaia DR3 5250394728194220800, effective temperature T$_{\rm eff}$ = 60,000 K, surface gravity log g = 7) was detected as the fastest known Galactic hypervelocity star with a space velocity of $\approx$2800 km s$^{-1}$ and an atmosphere dominated by carbon and oxygen. It is thought to be the surviving WD donor predicted by the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D$^6$) type Ia supernova formation model. We analysed an ultraviolet spectrum of J0927-6335 obtained recently with the Hubble Space Telescope and found very high abundances of iron and nickel. This could originate in the pollution of the remnant by the SN Ia explosion but it is uncertain to what extent atomic diffusion altered the chemical composition of the accreted material.

          Collisionless tearing instability in a relativistic pair plasma with a power-law distribution function

 - **Abstract**
 We study the tearing instability of a current sheet in a relativistic pair plasma with a power law distribution function. We first estimate the growth rate analytically and then confirm the analytical results by solving numerically the dispersion equation, taking into account all exact particle trajectories within the reconnecting layer. We found that the instability is suppressed when the particle spectrum becomes harder.

          Discovery of a hyperluminous quasar at z = 1.62 with Eddington ratio > 3 in the eFEDS field confirmed by KOOLS-IFU on Seimei Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a hyperluminous type 1 quasar (eFEDS J082826.9-013911; eFEDSJ0828-0139) at $z_{\rm spec}$ = 1.622 with a super-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We perform the optical spectroscopic observations with KOOLS-IFU on the Seimei Telescope. The black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) based on the single-epoch method with MgII $\lambda$2798 is estimated to be $M_{\rm BH} = (6.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$. To measure the precise infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$), we obtain submillimeter data taken by SCUBA-2 on JCMT and conduct the spectral energy distribution analysis with X-ray to submillimeter data. We find that $L_{\rm IR}$ of eFEDSJ0828-0139 is $L_{\rm IR} = (6.8 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{13}$ $L_{\odot}$, confirming the existence of a hypeluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG). $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is estimated to be $\lambda_{\rm Edd} = 3.6 \pm 0.7$, making it one of the quasars with the highest BH mass accretion rate at cosmic noon.

          Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity theory

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent paper in Astronomy & Astrophysics, Alimi & Koskas (2024) have highlighted in wCDM models derived from general relativity (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. We show in this paper that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different code, i.e. a different N-body solver, DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulation (Giocoli et al. 2018) and that it is also robust to the addition of neutrinos to the cold component of dark matter. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in modified gravity models. Thus, we examine whether the invariance observed by Alimi & Koskas (2024) remains robust in the case of Hu & Sawicki models of modified gravity using numerical simulations performed by Giocoli et al. (2018). By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of wCDM models of GR. These deviations suggest that the nature of the gravitation significantly influences the shape of the DM halos. We then interpret this deviation observed in the modified gravity models from the GR models as due to the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such f(R)-type theories. This one modifies the sphericalization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the deviation from cosmological invariance in the shape of DM halos is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.

          Formation of the interstellar sugar precursor, (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, through radical reactions on dust grains

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the continued detection of complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest has refueled the interest on a panspermic origin of life. The prebiotic molecule glyceraldehyde is proposed to be formed from (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, a molecule recently detected towards the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud at the galactic center. In this work, we computationally simulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface of amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving a OH addition and a H abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of the 1,1 and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H-abstraction or H-addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these reactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided a suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation pathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition products. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of the reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.

          Semi-empirical Estimates of the Cosmic Planet Formation Rate

 - **Abstract**
 We devise and exploit a data-driven, semi-empirical framework of galaxy formation and evolution, coupling it to recipes for planet formation from stellar and planetary science, to compute the cosmic planet formation rate, and the properties of the planets' preferred host stellar and galactic environments. We also discuss how the rates and formation sites of planets are affected when considering their habitability, and when including possible threatening sources related to star formation and nuclear activity. Overall, we conservatively estimate a cumulative number of some $10^{20}$ Earth-like planets and around $10^{18}$ habitable Earths in our past lightcone. Finally, we find that a few $10^{17}$ are older than our own Earth, an occurrence which places a loose lower limit a few $10^{-18}$ to the odds for a habitable world to ever hosting a civilization in the observable Universe.

          Anisotropic universe with anisotropic dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate anisotropic equation of state parameterization of dark energy within the framework of an axisymmetric (planar) Bianchi-I universe. In addition to constraining the equation of state for anisotropic dark energy and other standard cosmological model parameters, we also constrain any underlying anisotropic axis using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae data set augmented by SH0ES Cepheid distance calibrators. The mean anisotropic dark energy equation of state and corresponding difference in the equation of states in and normal to the plane of our axisymmetric Bianchi-I space-time are found to be $\bar{w}=-0.90^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ and $\delta_w=-0.140^{+0.11}_{-0.082}$ respectively. We also find an axis of anisotropy in this planar Bianchi-I model with anisotropic dark energy to be $\approx(279^{\circ} ,12^{\circ})$ in galactic coordinates. Our analysis of different cosmological models suggests that while a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic dark energy (the $w_b$CDM model) shows some preference over other anisotropic models, it is still less likely than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or a model with a constant dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM). Overall, the $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most probable model based on the Akaike Information Criterion.

          GRB Redshift Classifier to Follow-up High-Redshift GRBs Using Supervised Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense, short-lived bursts of gamma-ray radiation observed up to a high redshift ($z \sim 10$) due to their luminosities. Thus, they can serve as cosmological tools to probe the early Universe. However, we need a large sample of high$-z$ GRBs, currently limited due to the difficulty in securing time at the large aperture Telescopes. Thus, it is painstaking to determine quickly whether a GRB is high$z$ or low$-z$, which hampers the possibility of performing rapid follow-up observations. Previous efforts to distinguish between high$-$ and low$-z$ GRBs using GRB properties and machine learning (ML) have resulted in limited sensitivity. In this study, we aim to improve this classification by employing an ensemble ML method on 251 GRBs with measured redshifts and plateaus observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Incorporating the plateau phase with the prompt emission, we have employed an ensemble of classification methods to enhance the sensitivity unprecedentedly. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of various classification methods using different redshift thresholds, $z_{threshold}$=$z_t$ at $z_{t}=$ 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5. We achieve a sensitivity of 87\% and 89\% with a balanced sampling for both $z_{t}=3.0$ and $z_{t}=3.5$, respectively, representing a 9\% and 11\% increase in the sensitivity over Random Forest used alone. Overall, the best results are at $z_{t} = 3.5$, where the difference between the sensitivity of the training set and the test set is the smallest. This enhancement of the proposed method paves the way for new and intriguing follow-up observations of high$-z$ GRBs.

          The unusual events in X-ray emulsion chamber experiments

 - **Abstract**
 The article considers events recorded in an experiment with X-ray emulsion chambers (XREC) to study the trunks of extensive air showers (EAS) with energies of nuclei of primary cosmic radiation (PCR) E0 > 100 TeV, which currently have no explanation within the standard model of nuclear interactions (SM). The XREC method is the only one that allows studying EAS trunks with a high coordinate resolution of about 100 microns. EAS trunks contain the most complete information about primary acts of nuclear interactions, as a result of which all unusual events recorded by the XREC method are of great scientific interest. Several types of unusual events recorded by the XREC method were explained within the SM.
