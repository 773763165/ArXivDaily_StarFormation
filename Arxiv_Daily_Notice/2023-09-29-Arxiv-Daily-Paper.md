 - **Abstract**
 Modelling galaxy formation in hydrodynamic simulations has increasingly adopted various radiative transfer methods to account for photoionization feedback from young massive stars. However, the evolution of HII regions around stars begins in dense star-forming clouds and spans large dynamical ranges in both space and time, posing severe challenges for numerical simulations in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution that depends strongly on gas density ($\propto n^{-1}$). In this work, we perform a series of idealized HII region simulations using the moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic code Arepo-RT to study the effects of numerical resolution. The simulated results match the analytical solutions and the ionization feedback converges only if the Str\"omgren sphere is resolved by at least $10$--$100$ resolution elements and the size of each time integration step is smaller than $0.1$ times the recombination timescale. Insufficient spatial resolution leads to reduced ionization fraction but enhanced ionized gas mass and momentum feedback from the HII regions, as well as degrading the multi-phase interstellar medium into a diffuse, partially ionized, warm ($\sim8000$\,K) gas. On the other hand, insufficient temporal resolution strongly suppresses the effects of ionizing feedback. This is because longer timesteps are not able to resolve the rapid variation of the thermochemistry properties of the gas cells around massive stars, especially when the photon injection and thermochemistry are performed with different cadences. Finally, we provide novel numerical implementations to overcome the above issues when strict resolution requirements are not achievable in practice.
#### In-situ vs accreted Milky Way globular clusters: a new classification  method and implications for cluster formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new scheme for the classification of the in-situ and accreted globular clusters (GCs). The scheme uses total energy $E$ and $z$-component of the orbital angular momentum and is calibrated using [Al/Fe] abundance ratio. We demonstrate that such classification results in the GC populations with distinct spatial, kinematic, and chemical abundance distributions. The in-situ GCs are distributed within the central 10 kpc of the Galaxy in a flattened configuration aligned with the MW disc, while the accreted GCs have a wide distribution of distances and a spatial distribution close to spherical. In-situ and accreted GCs have different $\rm [Fe/H]$ distributions with the well-known bimodality present only in the metallicity distribution of the in-situ GCs. Furthermore, the accreted and in-situ GCs are well separated in the plane of $\rm [Al/Fe]-[Mg/Fe]$ abundance ratios and follow distinct sequences in the age--$\rm [Fe/H]$ plane. The in-situ GCs in our classification show a clear disc spin-up signature -- the increase of median $V_\phi$ at metallicities $\rm [Fe/H]\approx -1.3\div -1$ similar to the spin-up in the in-situ field stars. This signature signals the MW's disc formation, which occurred $\approx 11.7-12.7$ Gyrs ago (or at $z\approx 3.1-5.3$) according to GC ages. In-situ GCs with metallicities of $\rm [Fe/H]\gtrsim -1.3$ were thus born in the Milky Way disc, while lower metallicity in-situ GCs were born during early, turbulent, pre-disc stages of the evolution of the Galaxy and are part of its Aurora stellar component.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are sources observed to exceed the Eddington limit of a stellar-mass black hole (BH). A fraction of ULX sources show X-ray pulses which are evidence for accreting neutron stars (NSs). Theoretical studies have suggested that NSs dominate the compact objects of intrinsic ULXs, even though the majority of observed sample is non-pulsating, implying that X-ray pulses from many NS ULXs are unobservable. We use POSYDON to generate and study X-ray binary populations spanning starburst ages 5 to 1000Myr. Following theoretical predictions for the alignment of the NS spin axis with the accretion disc, we estimate the required accreted mass in ULXs so that the alignment suppresses observable X-ray pulses. While the properties of ULXs are sensitive to model assumptions, there are certain trends that the populations follow. Young and old stellar populations are dominated by BH and NS accretors, respectively. The donors go from massive H-rich main-sequence (MS) stars in young populations (<100Myr) to low-mass post-MS H-rich stars in older populations (>100Myr), with stripped He-rich giant stars dominating the populations at around 100Myr. In addition, we find that NS ULXs exhibit stronger geometrical beaming than BH ULXs, leading to an under-representation of NS accretors in observed populations. Coupled with our finding that X-ray pulses are suppressed in at least 60% of the NS ULXs, we suggest that the observed fraction of ULXs with detectable X-ray pulses is very small, in agreement with observations. This study investigates the effects of age on ULXs as well as the effects of different model assumptions on ULX demographics. We show that geometrical beaming and the mass-accretion phase are critical aspects of understanding ULX observations. Our results suggest that even though most ULXs have accreting NSs, those with observable X-ray pulses would be very few.
#### Wide post-common envelope binaries containing ultramassive white dwarfs:  evidence for efficient envelope ejection in massive AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 Post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) containing a white dwarf (WD) and a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain the physics of common envelope evolution and calibrate binary evolution models. Most PCEBs studied to date have short orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim 1$ d), implying relatively inefficient harnessing of binaries' orbital energy for envelope expulsion. Here, we present follow-up observations of five binaries from {\it Gaia} DR3 containing solar-type MS stars and probable ultramassive WDs ($M\gtrsim 1.2\,M_{\odot}$) with significantly wider orbits than previously known PCEBs, $P_{\rm orb} = 18-49$ d. The WD masses are much higher than expected for systems formed via stable mass transfer at these periods, and their near-circular orbits suggest partial tidal circularization when the WD progenitors were giants. These properties strongly suggest that the binaries are PCEBs. Forming PCEBs at such wide separations requires highly efficient envelope ejection, and we find that the observed periods can only be explained if a significant fraction of the energy released when the envelope recombines goes into ejecting it. Using 1D stellar evolution calculations, we show that the binding energy of massive AGB star envelopes is formally {\it positive} if recombination energy is included in the energy budget. This suggests that the star's envelope can be efficiently ejected if binary interaction causes it to recombine, and that a wide range of PCEB orbital periods can potentially result from Roche lobe overflow of an AGB star. This evolutionary scenario may also explain the formation of several wide WD+MS binaries discovered via self-lensing.
#### Envelope Ejection and the Transition to Homologous Expansion in  Common-Envelope Events

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a long-timescale ($5000\,$d) 3-D simulation of a common-envelope event with a $2\,M_{\odot}$ red giant and a $1\,M_{\odot}$ main sequence companion, using the moving-mesh hydrodynamic solver MANGA. Starting with an orbital radius of $52\,R_{\odot}$, our binary shrinks to an orbital radius of $5\,R_{\odot}$ in $200\,$d. We show that over a timescale of about $1500\,$d, the envelope is completely ejected while $80$ per cent is ejected in about $400\,$d. The complete ejection of the envelope is solely powered by the orbital energy of the binary, without the need for late-time reheating from recombination or jets. Motivated by recent theoretical and observational results, we also find that the envelope enters a phase of homologous expansion about $550\,\rm d$ after the start of our simulation. We also run a simplified 1-D model to show that heating from the central binary in the envelope at late times does not influence the ejection. This homologous expansion of the envelope would likely simplify calculations of the observational implications such as light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of the X-ray polarization of the bright transient Swift J1727.8-1613 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The observation was performed at the beginning of the 2023 discovery outburst, when the source resided in the bright hard state. We find a time- and energy-averaged polarization degree of 4.1%+/-0.2% and a polarization angle of 2.2+/-1.3 degrees (errors at 68% confidence level; this translates to about 20-sigma significance of the polarization detection). This finding suggests that the hot corona emitting the bulk of the detected X-rays is elongated, rather than spherical. The X-ray polarization angle is consistent with that found in sub-mm wavelengths. Since the sub-mm polarization was found to be aligned with the jet direction in other X-ray binaries, this indicates that the corona is elongated orthogonal to the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 We present MESA-Web, a cloud resource with an online interface to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software instrument. MESA-Web allows learners to evolve stellar models without the need to download and install MESA. Since being released in 2015, MESA-Web has delivered over 17,000 calculations to over 2,200 unique learners and currently performs about 11 jobs per day. MESA-Web can be used as an educational tool for stars in the classroom or for scientific investigations. We report on new capabilities of MESA-Web introduced since its 2015 release including learner-supplied nuclear reaction rates, custom stopping conditions, and an expanded selection of input parameters. To foster collaboration we have created a Zenodo MESA-Web community hub where instructors can openly share examples of using MESA-Web in the classroom. We discuss two examples in the current community hub. The first example is a lesson module on Red Giant Branch stars that includes a suite of exercises designed to fit a range of learners and a Jupyter workbook for additional analysis. The second example is lesson materials for an upper-level Astronomy majors course in Stars and Radiation that includes an assignment verifying some of the expected trends that are presented in a popular stellar physics textbook.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided the first opportunity to study the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets and estimate their surface conditions. Earth-sized planets around Sun-like stars are currently inaccessible with JWST however, and will have to be observed using the next generation of telescopes with direct imaging capabilities. Detecting active volcanism on an Earth-like planet would be particularly valuable as it would provide insight into its interior, and provide context for the commonality of the interior states of Earth and Venus. In this work we used a climate model to simulate four exoEarths over eight years with ongoing large igneous province eruptions with outputs ranging from 1.8-60 Gt of sulfur dioxide. The atmospheric data from the simulations were used to model direct imaging observations between 0.2-2.0 $\mu$m, producing reflectance spectra for every month of each exoEarth simulation. We calculated the amount of observation time required to detect each of the major absorption features in the spectra, and identified the most prominent effects that volcanism had on the reflectance spectra. These effects include changes in the size of the O$_3$, O$_2$, and H$_2$O absorption features, and changes in the slope of the spectrum. Of these changes, we conclude that the most detectable and least ambiguous evidence of volcanism are changes in both O$_3$ absorption and the slope of the spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 This work compares cosmological matching conditions used in approximating generic pre-inflationary phases of the universe. We show that the joining conditions for primordial scalar perturbations assumed by Contaldi et al. are inconsistent with the physically motivated Israel junction conditions, however, performing general relativistic matching with the aforementioned constraints results in unrealistic primordial power spectra. Eliminating the need for ambiguous matching, we look at an alternative semi-analytic model for producing the primordial power spectrum allowing for finite duration cosmological phase transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Space Telescope will have the first advanced coronagraph in space, with deformable mirrors for wavefront control, low-order wavefront sensing and maintenance, and a photon-counting detector. It is expected to be able to detect and characterize mature, giant exoplanets in reflected visible light. Over the past decade the performance of the coronagraph in its flight environment has been simulated with increasingly detailed diffraction and structural/thermal finite element modeling. With the instrument now being integrated in preparation for launch within the next few years, the present state of the end-to-end modeling is described, including the measured flight components such as deformable mirrors. The coronagraphic modes are thoroughly described, including characteristics most readily derived from modeling. The methods for diffraction propagation, wavefront control, and structural and thermal finite-element modeling are detailed. The techniques and procedures developed for the instrument will serve as a foundation for future coronagraphic missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory.
#### Helium Enhanced Planets Along the Upper Edge of the Radius Valley

 - **Abstract**
 The low mean densities of sub-Neptunes imply that they formed within a few million years and accreted primordial envelopes. Because these planets receive a total X-ray and extreme ultra-violet flux that is comparable to the gravitational binding energy of their envelopes, their primordial hydrogen-helium atmospheres are susceptible to mass loss. Models of photoevaporating sub-Neptunes have so far assumed that envelope compositions remain constant over time. However, preferential loss of atmospheric hydrogen has the potential to change their compositions. Here, by modeling the thermal and compositional evolution of sub-Neptunes undergoing atmospheric escape with diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium, we show that planets with radii between 1.6 and 2.5 that of Earth can become helium-enhanced from billions of years of photoevaporation, obtaining helium mass fractions in excess of 40%. Atmospheric helium enhancement can be detected through transmission spectra, providing a novel observational test for whether atmospheric escape creates the radius valley.
#### Time Delay Cosmography with a Neural Ratio Estimator

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16063
 - **Abstract**
 We explore the use of a Neural Ratio Estimator (NRE) to determine the Hubble constant ($H_0$) in the context of time delay cosmography. Assuming a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profile for the deflector, we simulate time delay measurements, image position measurements, and modeled lensing parameters. We train the NRE to output the posterior distribution of $H_0$ given the time delay measurements, the relative Fermat potentials (calculated from the modeled parameters and the measured image positions), the deflector redshift, and the source redshift. We compare the accuracy and precision of the NRE with traditional explicit likelihood methods in the limit where the latter is tractable and reliable, using Gaussian noise to emulate measurement uncertainties in the input parameters. The NRE posteriors track the ones from the conventional method and, while they show a slight tendency to overestimate uncertainties, they can be combined in a population inference without bias.
#### Irradiated Disks May Settle into Staircases

 - **Abstract**
 Much of a protoplanetary disk is thermally controlled by irradiation from the central star. Such a disk, long thought to have a smoothly flaring shape, is unstable to the so-called 'irradiation instability'. But what's the outcome of such an instability? In particular, is it possible that such a disk settles into a shape that is immune to the instability? We combine Athena++ with a simplified thermal treatment to show that passively heated disks settle into a 'staircase' shape. Here, the disk is punctuated by bright rings and dark gaps, with the bright rings intercepting the lion's share of stellar illumination, and the dark gaps hidden in their shadows. The optical surface of such a disk (height at which starlight is absorbed) resembles a staircase. Although our simulations do not have realistic radiative transfer, we use the RADMC3d code to show that this steady state is in good thermal equilibrium. It is possible that realistic disks reach such a state via ways not captured by our simulations. In contrast to our results here, two previous studies have claimed that irradiated disks stay smooth. We show here that they err on different issues. The staircase state, if confirmed by more sophisticated radiative hydrodynamic simulations, has a range of implications for disk evolution and planet formation.
#### Exploring calibration algorithms to maximize the null depth in KPIC's  vortex fiber nulling mode

 - **Abstract**
 Vortex fiber nulling (VFN) is a new interferometric technique with the potential to unlock the ability to detect and spectroscopically characterize exoplanets at angular separations smaller than the conventional diffraction limit of $\lambda$/D. In early 2022, a VFN mode was added to the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) instrument suite on Keck II. VFN operates by adding an azimuthal phase ramp to the incident wavefront so that light from the star at the center of the field is prevented from coupling into a single-mode fiber. One of the key performance goals of VFN is to minimize the ratio of on-axis starlight coupling to off-axis planet coupling, which requires minimizing the wavefront aberrations of light being injected into the fiber. Non-common path aberrations can be calibrated during the daytime and compensated for with the KPIC deformable mirror during nighttime observing. By applying different amplitudes of low-order Zernike modes, we determine which combinations maximize the system performance. Here we present our work developing and testing different procedures to estimate the incident aberrations, both in simulation and on the Keck bench. The current iteration of this calibration algorithm has been used successfully for VFN observing, and there are several avenues for improvement.

 - **Abstract**
 The fraction of the contribution from yet-unresolved gamma-ray sources in the Galactic diffuse gamma rays observed by the Tibet air shower array is an important key to interpreting recent multi-messenger observations. This paper shows a surprising fact: no Tibet diffuse events above 398TeV come from the gamma-ray sources newly detected above 100 TeV by LHAASO. Based on this observational fact, the contribution of sources unresolved by LHAASO to the Tibet diffuse events is estimated to be less than 31% above 398TeV with a 99% confidence level. Our result shows that unresolved sources make only a sub-dominant contribution to the Tibet diffuse events above 398 TeV and a large fraction of the events are truly a diffusive nature.
#### Tides in clouds: control of star formation by long-range gravitational  force

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity drives the collapse of molecular clouds through which stars form, yet the exact role of gravity in cloud collapse remains a complex issue. Studies point to a picture where star formation occurs in clusters. In a typical, pc-sized cluster-forming region, the collapse is hierarchical, and the stars should be born from regions of even smaller sizes ($\approx 0.1\;\rm pc$). The origin of this spatial arrangement remains under investigation. Based on a high-quality surface density map towards the Perseus region, we construct a 3D density structure, compute the gravitational potential, and derive eigenvalues of the tidal tensor ($\lambda_{\rm min}$, $\lambda_{\rm mid}$, $\lambda_{\rm max}$, $\lambda_{\rm min} < \lambda_{\rm mid} < \lambda_{\rm max}$), analyze the behavior of gravity at every location and reveal its multiple roles in cloud evolution. We find that fragmentation is limited to several isolated, high-density ``islands''. Surrounding them, is a vast amount of gas ($75 \%$ of the mass, $95 \%$ of the volume) that stays under the influence of extensive tides where fragmentation is suppressed. This gas will be transported towards these regions to fuel star formation. The spatial arrangement of regions under different tides explains the hierarchical and localized pattern of star formation inferred from the observations. Tides were first recognized by Newton, yet this is the first time its dominance in cloud evolution has been revealed. We expect this link between cloud density structure and role gravity to be strengthened by future studies, resulting in a clear view of the star formation process.

 - **Abstract**
 We present extended point spread function (PSF) models for the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Data Release 3 (HSC-SSP PDR3) in all $\textit{g,r,i,Z}$ and $\textit{Y}$-bands. Due to its 8.2m primary mirror and long exposure periods, HSC combines deep images with wide-field coverage, making it one of the most suitable observing facilities for low surface brightness (LSB) studies. By applying a median stacking technique of point sources with different brightnesses, we show how to construct the HSC-SSP PDR3 PSF models to an extent of R $\sim$ 5.6 arcmin. These new PSFs provide the community with a crucial tool to characterise LSB properties at large angles. We apply our HSC PSFs and demonstrate that they behave reasonably in two cases: first, to generate a 2-D model of a bright star, and second, to remove the PSF-scattered light from an Ultra Deep image of the 400020 Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) group in the SXDS field. Our main focus in this second application is characterising the $\textit{r}$-band intra-halo light (IHL) component of 400020. Building on advanced source extraction techniques with careful consideration of PSF flux, we measure the IHL surface brightness (SB) group profile up to $\sim$ 31 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and R = 300 kpc. We estimate the IHL fraction ($\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$) profile, with a mean of $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$ $\sim$ 0.13. Our results show that not removing the PSF light can overestimate the IHL SB by $\sim$ 1.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and the $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$ by $\sim$ 30%.

 - **Abstract**
 Interest to astrophysical evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe from initial cosmological perturbations has increased after the discovery of coalescing binary black holes with masses more than dozen solar ones by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We briefly discuss increasing evidence that PBHs can provide some fraction of detected merging binary BHs and can be related to an isotropic stochastic GW background recently discovered by pulsar timing arrays. We focus on PBHs with log-normal mass spectrum originated from isocurvature perturbations in the modified Affleck-Dine baryogenesis scenario by Dolgov and Silk (1993). We show that almost equal populations of astrophysical binary BHs from massive binary evolution and binary PBHs with log-normal mass spectrum can describe both the observed chirp mass distribution and effective spin -- mass ratio anti-correlation of the LVK binary BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Collaboration has embraced the concept of open access to their research data since its foundation, with the aim of giving access to the widest possible community. A gradual process of release began as early as 2007 when 1% of the cosmic-ray data was made public, along with 100% of the space-weather information. In February 2021, a portal was released containing 10% of cosmic-ray data collected from 2004 to 2018, during Phase I of the Observatory. The Portal included detailed documentation about the detection and reconstruction procedures, analysis codes that can be easily used and modified and, additionally, visualization tools. Since then the Portal has been updated and extended. In 2023, a catalog of the 100 highest-energy cosmic-ray events examined in depth has been included. A specific section dedicated to educational use has been developed with the expectation that these data will be explored by a wide and diverse community including professional and citizen-scientists, and used for educational and outreach initiatives. This paper describes the context, the spirit and the technical implementation of the release of data by the largest cosmic-ray detector ever built, and anticipates its future developments.

 The Baikal-GVD is a deep-underwater neutrino telescope being constructed in Lake Baikal. After the winter 2023 deployment campaign the detector consists of 3456 optical modules installed on 96 vertical strings. The status of the detector and progress in data analysis are discussed in present report. The Baikal-GVD data collected in 2018-2022 indicate the presence of cosmic neutrino flux in high-energy cascade events consistent with observations by the IceCube neutrino telescope. Analysis of track-like events results in identification of first high-energy muon neutrino candidates. These and other results from 2018-2022 data samples are reviewed in this report.

 - **Abstract**
 Light curves of stars encapsulate a wealth of information about stellar oscillations and granulation, thereby offering key insights into the internal structure and evolutionary state of stars. Conventional asteroseismic techniques have been largely confined to power spectral analysis, neglecting the valuable phase information contained within light curves. While recent machine learning applications in asteroseismology utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have successfully inferred stellar attributes from light curves, they are often limited by the local feature extraction inherent in convolutional operations. To circumvent these constraints, we present $\textit{Astroconformer}$, a Transformer-based deep learning framework designed to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light curves. Our empirical analysis, which focuses on estimating surface gravity ($\log g$), is grounded in a carefully curated dataset derived from $\textit{Kepler}$ light curves. These light curves feature asteroseismic $\log g$ values spanning from 0.2 to 4.4. Our results underscore that, in the regime where the training data is abundant, $\textit{Astroconformer}$ attains a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.017 dex around $\log g \approx 3 $. Even in regions where training data are sparse, the RMSE can reach 0.1 dex. It outperforms not only the K-nearest neighbor-based model ($\textit{The SWAN}$) but also state-of-the-art CNNs. Ablation studies confirm that the efficacy of the models in this particular task is strongly influenced by the size of their receptive fields, with larger receptive fields correlating with enhanced performance. Moreover, we find that the attention mechanisms within $\textit{Astroconformer}$ are well-aligned with the inherent characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation present in the light curves.
#### Transient fading X-ray emission detected during the optical rise of a  tidal disruption event

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the SRG/eROSITA detection of ultra-soft ($kT=47^{+5}_{-5}$ eV) X-ray emission ($L_{\mathrm{X}}=2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) from the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2022dsb $\sim$14 days before peak optical brightness. As the optical luminosity increases after the eROSITA detection, then the 0.2--2 keV observed flux decays, decreasing by a factor of $\sim 39$ over the 19 days after the initial X-ray detection. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopic follow-up observations reveal transient broad Balmer emission lines and a broad He II 4686A emission complex with respect to the pre-outburst spectrum. Despite the early drop in the observed X-ray flux, the He II 4686A complex is still detected for $\sim$40 days after the optical peak, suggesting the persistence of an obscured, hard ionising source in the system. Three outflow signatures are also detected at early times: i) blueshifted H$\alpha$ emission lines in a pre-peak optical spectrum, ii) transient radio emission, and iii) blueshifted Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines. The joint evolution of this early-time X-ray emission, the He II 4686A complex and these outflow signatures suggests that the X-ray emitting disc (formed promptly in this TDE) is still present after optical peak, but may have been enshrouded by optically thick debris, leading to the X-ray faintness in the months after the disruption. If the observed early-time properties in this TDE are not unique to this system, then other TDEs may also be X-ray bright at early times and become X-ray faint upon being veiled by debris launched shortly after the onset of circularisation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term with fractional power-law potentials. The coupling function enhances the curvature perturbations, then results in the generation of PBHs and detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). % We identify three separate sets of parameters for the potential functions of the form $\phi^{1/3}$, $\phi^{2/5}$, and $\phi^{2/3}$. By adjusting the model parameters, we decelerate the inflaton during the ultra slow-roll (USR) phase and enhance curvature perturbations. % Our calculations predict the formation of PBHs with masses of ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$, which are compatible with LIGO-Virgo observational data. Additionally, we find PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-5})M_{\odot}$, which can explain ultrashort-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data. % Furthermore, our proposed mechanism could lead to the formation of PBHs in mass scales around ${\cal O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$, contributing to approximately 99\% of the dark matter in the universe. % We also study the production of secondary GWs in our model. In all cases of the model, the density parameter of secondary GWs $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ exhibits peaks that intersect the sensitivity curves of GWs detectors, providing a means to verify our findings using data of these detectors. % Our numerical results demonstrate a power-law behavior for the spectra of $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ with respect to frequency, given by $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim (f/f_c)^{n}$. Additionally, in the infrared regime where $f\ll f_{c}$, the power index takes a log-dependent form, specifically $n=3-2/\ln(f_c/f)$.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1953+1844 (i.e. M71E) is a millisecond pulsar (MSP) in a 53-min binary orbit discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). It has an orbital period of 53 minutes and a mass function of $2.3\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$. The possible redback origin of this system has been discussed by Pan et al. (2023). We discuss here an alternative evolution track for this binary system as being a descendant of ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), which has a hydrogen-poor donor accreting onto a neutron-star with an orbital period of $\leq1~hr$. Noticed that some of UCXB systems hold an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs) and a $\sim$0.01 M$_\odot$ donor. M71E has a very similar orbit as AMXPs, indicating that it might be evolved from an UCXB as PSR J1653--0158. The companion star should be significantly bloated and it most probably has a carbon and oxygen composition, otherwise a low inclination angle is required for a helium companion. The discovery of this binary system may shed lights on when and how a NS in UCXBs turns to be a radio pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer high-energy neutrino detector deployed in the Antarctic ice. Two major event classes are charged-current electron and muon neutrino interactions. In this contribution, we discuss the inference of direction and energy for these classes using conditional normalizing flows. They allow to derive a posterior distribution for each individual event based on the raw data that can include systematic uncertainties, which makes them very promising for next-generation reconstructions. For each normalizing flow we use the differential entropy and the KL-divergence to its maximum entropy approximation to interpret the results. The normalizing flows correctly incorporate complex optical properties of the Antarctic ice and their relation to the embedded detector. For showers, the differential entropy increases in regions of high photon absorption and decreases in clear ice. For muons, the differential entropy strongly correlates with the contained track length. Coverage is maintained, even for low photon counts and highly asymmetrical contour shapes. For high-photon counts, the distributions get narrower and become more symmetrical, as expected from the asymptotic theorem of Bernstein-von-Mises. For shower directional reconstruction, we find the region between 1 TeV and 100 TeV to potentially benefit the most from normalizing flows because of azimuth-zenith asymmetries which have been neglected in previous analyses by assuming symmetrical contours. Events in this energy range play a vital role in the recent discovery of the galactic plane diffuse neutrino emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present and evaluate the prospects for detecting coherent radio counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events using Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) triggered observations. The MWA rapid-response system, combined with its buffering mode ($\sim4$ minutes negative latency), enables us to catch any radio signals produced from seconds prior to hours after a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. The large field of view of the MWA ($\sim1000\,\text{deg}^2$ at 120\,MHz) and its location under the high sensitivity sky region of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, forecast a high chance of being on-target for a GW event. We consider three observing configurations for the MWA to follow up GW BNS merger events, including a single dipole per tile, the full array, and four sub-arrays. We then perform a population synthesis of BNS systems to predict the radio detectable fraction of GW events using these configurations. We find that the configuration with four sub-arrays is the best compromise between sky coverage and sensitivity as it is capable of placing meaningful constraints on the radio emission from 12.6\% of GW BNS detections. Based on the timescales of four BNS merger coherent radio emission models, we propose an observing strategy that involves triggering the buffering mode to target coherent signals emitted prior to, during or shortly following the merger, which is then followed by continued recording for up to three hours to target later time post-merger emission. We expect MWA to trigger on $\sim5\text{--}22$ BNS merger events during the LVK O4 observing run, which could potentially result in two detections of predicted coherent emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Earth likely acquired much of its inventory of volatile elements during the main stage of its formation. Some of Earth's proto-atmosphere must therefore have survived the giant impacts, collisions between planet-sized bodies, that dominate the latter phases of accretion. Here we use a suite of 1D hydrodynamic simulations and impedance match calculations to quantify the effect that pre-impact surface conditions (such as atmospheric pressure and presence of an ocean) have on the efficiency of atmospheric and ocean loss from proto-planets during giant impacts. We find that -- in the absence of an ocean -- lighter, hotter, and lower-pressure atmospheres are more easily lost. The presence of an ocean can significantly increase the efficiency of atmospheric loss compared to the no-ocean case, with a rapid transition between low and high loss regimes as the mass ratio of atmosphere to ocean decreases. However, contrary to previous thinking, the presence of an ocean can also reduce atmospheric loss if the ocean is not sufficiently massive, typically less than a few times the atmospheric mass. Volatile loss due to giant impacts is thus highly sensitive to the surface conditions on the colliding bodies. To allow our results to be combined with 3D impact simulations, we have developed scaling laws that relate loss to the ground velocity and surface conditions. Our results demonstrate that the final volatile budgets of planets are critically dependent on the exact timing and sequence of impacts experienced by their precursor planetary embryos, making atmospheric properties a highly stochastic outcome of accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is a radio-based ultra-high energy neutrino detector located at Summit Station, Greenland. It is still being constructed, with 7 stations currently operational. Neutrino detection works by measuring Askaryan radiation produced by neutrino-nucleon interactions. A neutrino candidate must be found amidst other backgrounds which are recorded at much higher rates -- including cosmic-rays and anthropogenic noise -- the origins of which are sometimes unknown. Here we describe a method to classify different noise classes using the latent space of a variational autoencoder. The latent space forms a compact representation that makes classification tractable. We analyze data from a noisy and a silent station. The method automatically detects and allows us to qualitatively separate multiple event classes, including physical wind-induced signals, for both the noisy and the quiet station.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with "bar lanes" that bring gas towards the Galactic Center. Gas flowing along these bar lanes often overshoots, and instead of accreting onto the Central Molecular Zone, it collides with the bar lane on the opposite side of the Galaxy. We observed G5, a cloud which we believe is the site of one such collision, near the Galactic Center at (l,b) = (+5.4, -0.4) with the ALMA/ACA. We took measurements of the spectral lines $^{12}$CO J=2-1, $^{13}$CO J=2-1, C$^{18}$O J=2-1, H$_2$CO J=3$_{03}$-2$_{02}$, H$_{2}$CO J=3$_{22}$-2$_{21}$, CH$_{3}$OH J=4$_{22}$-3$_{12}$, OCS J=18-17 and SiO J=5-4. We observed a velocity bridge between two clouds at $\sim$50 km/s and $\sim$150 km/sin our position-velocity diagram, which is direct evidence of a cloud-cloud collision. We measured an average gas temperature of $\sim$60 K in G5 using H$_2$CO integrated intensity line ratios. We observed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in G5 is consistent with optically thin, or at most marginally optically thick $^{12}$CO. We measured 1.5 x 10$^9$ cm$^{-2}$(K km/s)$^{-1}$ for the local X$_{CO}$, 10-20x less than the average Galactic value. G5 is strong direct observational evidence of gas overshooting the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and colliding with a bar lane on the opposite side of the Galactic center.

 We describe enhancements to the digest2 software, a short-arc orbit classifier for heliocentric orbits. Digest2 is primarily used by the Near-Earth Object (NEO) community to flag newly discovered objects for a immediate follow-up and has been a part of NEO discovery process for more than 15 years. We have updated the solar system population model used to weight the digest2 score according to the 2023 catalog of known solar system orbits and extended the list of mean uncertainties for 140 observatory codes. Moreover, we have added Astrometry Data Exchange Standard (ADES) input format support to digest2, which provides additional information for the astrometry, such as positional uncertainties for each detection. The digest2 code was also extended to read the roving observer astrometric format as well as the ability to compute a new parameter from the provided astrometric uncertainties ($RMS'$) that can serve as an indicator of in-tracklet curvature when compared with tracklet's great-circle fit RMS. Comparison with the previous version of digest2 confirmed the improvement in accuracy of NEO identification and found that using ADES XML input significantly reduces the computation time of the digest2.

 - **Abstract**
 About one-fifth of the Galactic globular clusters (GCs), dubbed Type II GCs, host distinct stellar populations with different heavy elements abundances. NGC 1851 is one of the most studied Type II GCs, surrounded by several controversies regarding the spatial distribution of its populations and the presence of star-to-star [Fe/H], C+N+O, and age differences. This paper provides a detailed characterization of its stellar populations through Hubble Space Telescope (HST), ground-based, and Gaia photometry. We identified two distinct populations with different abundances of s-process elements along the red-giant branch (RGB) and the sub-giant branch (SGB) and detected two sub-populations among both s-poor (canonical) and s-rich (anomalous) stars. To constrain the chemical composition of these stellar populations, we compared observed and simulated colors of stars with different abundances of He, C, N, and O. It results that the anomalous population has a higher CNO overall abundance compared to the canonical population and that both host stars with different light-element abundances. No significant differences in radial segregation between canonical and anomalous stars are detected, while we find that among their sub-populations, the two most chemical extremes are more centrally concentrated. Anomalous and canonical stars show different 2D spatial distributions outside ~3 arcmin, with the latter developing an elliptical shape and a stellar overdensity in the northeast direction. We confirm the presence of a stellar halo up to ~80 arcmin with Gaia photometry, tagging 14 and five of its stars as canonical and anomalous, respectively, finding a lack of the latter in the south/southeast field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the dense gas structures in the immediate surroundings of the massive young stellar object (MYSO) W42-MME, using the high-resolution (0$''$.31$\times$0$''$.25) ALMA dust continuum and molecular line data. We performed a dendrogram analysis of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (4-3) line data to study multi-scale structures and their spatio-kinematic properties, and analyzed the fragmentation and dynamics of dense structures down to $\sim$2000 AU scale. Our results reveal 19 dense gas structures, out of which 12 are leaves and 7 are branches in dendrogram terminology. These structures exhibit transonic-supersonic gas motions (1$<\mathcal{M}<5$) with overvirial states ($\alpha_{\rm vir}\geq2$). The non-thermal velocity dispersion-size relation ($\sigma_{\rm nt}-L$) of dendrogram structures shows a weak negative correlation, while the velocity dispersion across the sky ($\delta\mathit{V_{\rm lsr}}$) correlates positively with structure size ($L$). Velocity structure function ($S_{2}(l)^{1/2}$) analysis of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ data reveals strong power-law dependencies with lag ($l$) up to a scale length of $\lesssim$ 6000 AU. The mass-size ($M-R$) relation of dendrogram structures shows a positive correlation with power-law index of 1.73$\pm$0.23, and the leaf L17 hosting W42-MME meets the mass-size conditions for massive star formation. Blue asymmetry is observed in the H$^{12}$CO$^{+}$ (4-3) line profiles of most of the leaves, indicating infall. Overall, our results observationally support the hierarchical and chaotic collapse scenario in the proximity of the MYSO W42-MME.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation ground-based very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory, constituted by tens of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes at two sites once its construction and commissioning are finished. Like its predecessors, CTA relies on Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) to relate the observed and reconstructed properties to the true ones of the primary gamma-ray photons. IRFs are needed for the proper reconstruction of spectral and spatial information of the observed sources and are thus among the data products issued to the observatory users. They are derived from Monte Carlo simulations, depend on observation conditions like the telescope pointing direction or the atmospheric transparency and can evolve with time as hardware ages or is replaced. Producing a complete set of IRFs from simulations for every observation taken is a time-consuming task and not feasible when releasing data products on short timescales. Consequently, interpolation techniques on simulated IRFs are investigated to quickly estimate IRFs for specific observation conditions. However, as some of the IRFs constituents are given as probability distributions, specialized methods are needed. This contribution summarizes and compares the feasibility of multiple approaches to interpolate IRF components in the context of the pyirf python software package and IRFs simulated for the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1). We will also give an overview of the current functionalities implemented in pyirf.

 We use spectra and maps of the $J=1-0$ and $J=2-1$ DCO$^{+}$, DCN, DNC, $\rm N_2D^+$ lines and $1_{11}-1_{01}$ ortho- and para-NH$_{2}$D lines, obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope, as well as observations of their hydrogenated isotopologues to study deuteration processes in five high-mass star-forming regions. The temperature was estimated from CH$_3$CCH lines, also observed with the IRAM-30m telescope, and from NH$_3$ lines, observed with the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg, as well as using the integrated intensity ratios of the $J=1-0$ H$^{13}$CN and HN$^{13}$C lines and their main isotopologues. Applying a non-LTE radiative transfer model with RADEX, the gas density and the molecular column densities were estimated. D/H ratios are $0.001-0.05$ for DCO$^{+}$, $0.001-0.02$ for DCN, $0.001-0.05$ for DNC and $0.02-0.4$ for NH$_{2}$D. The D/H ratios decrease with increasing temperature in the range of $\rm 20-40 \,K$ and slightly vary at densities $n(\rm H_2) \sim 10^4-10^6\, cm^{-3}$. The deuterium fraction of $\rm N_2H^{+}$ is $0.008-0.1$ at temperatures in the range of $\rm 20-25\, K$ and at a density of $\sim 10^5\, \rm cm^{-3}$. We also estimate relative abundances and find $ \sim 10^{-11}-10^{-9}$ for DCO$^{+}$ and DNC, $ \sim 10^{-11}-10^{-10}$ for $\rm N_2D^+$ and $ \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-8}$ for NH$_{2}$D. The relative abundances of these species decrease with increasing temperature. However, the DCN/H$_2$ ratio is almost constant ($\sim 10^{-10}$). The observational results agree with the predictions of chemical models (although in some cases there are significant differences).

 - **Abstract**
 Previously, we demonstrated that MgII and CIV reverberation-mapped quasars (RM QSOs) are standardizable and that the cosmological parameters inferred using the broad-line region radius-luminosity (R-L) relation are consistent with those determined from better-established cosmological probes. With more data expected from ongoing and future spectroscopic and photometric surveys, it is imperative to examine how new QSO data sets of varied quality, with their own specific luminosity and time-delay distributions, can be best used to determine more restrictive cosmological parameter constraints. In this study, we test the effect of adding 25 OzDES MgII RM QSOs as well as 25 lower-quality SDSS RM CIV QSOs to our previous sample of RM QSOs. Although cosmological parameter constraints become tighter after adding these new QSOs, the new combined data sets have an increased maximum difference in R-L relation parameter values (with a > 2sigma difference in some R-L relation intercepts between cosmological models), and thus a lower standardizability for the larger MgII + CIV compilation. Different time-delay methodologies, particularly the ICCF and CREAM methods used for inferring time delays of SDSS RM QSOs, slightly affect cosmological and R-L relation parameter values, however, the effect is negligible for (smaller) compilations of robust time-delay detections.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the degree to which current ultrahigh energy cosmic ray observations above the ankle support a common maximum rigidity for all nuclei, often called a Peters cycle, over alternative scenarios for the cosmic ray spectra escaping sources. We show that a Peters cycle is not generally supported by the data when compared with these alternatives. We explore the observational signatures of non-Peters cycle scenarios, and the opportunities to explore both ultrahigh energy cosmic ray source conditions, as well as, physics beyond the Standard model they present.
#### Intrinsic Emission of PSR B1937+21 at 327 MHz

 - **Abstract**
 At 327 MHz, the observed emission of PSR B1937+21 is greatly affected by scattering in the interstellar medium, on a timescale of order the pulse period. We use the bright impulsive giant pulses emitted by the pulsar to measure the impulse response of the interstellar medium and then recover the intrinsic emission of the pulsar by deconvolution -- revealing fine structure on timescales not normally observable. We find that the intrinsic widths of the main pulse and interpulse in the pulse profile are similar to those measured at higher frequencies. We detect 60,270 giant pulses which typically appear as narrow, ~100 ns bursts consisting of one to few nanoshots with widths $\lesssim \! 10$ ns. However, about 10% of the giant pulses exhibit multiple bursts which seem to be causally related to each other. We also report the first detection of giant micropulses in PSR B1937+21, primarily associated with the regular main pulse emission. These are distinct from giant pulses not only in the phases at which they occur, but also in their larger widths, of order a microsecond, and steeper energy distribution. These measurements place useful observational constraints on emission mechanisms for giant pulses as well as the regular radio emission of millisecond pulsars.
#### Statistical Bias in the Hubble Constant and Mass Power Law Slope for  Mock Strong Lenses

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing offers constraints on the Hubble constant that are independent of other methods. However, those constraints are subject to uncertainties in lens models. Previous studies suggest that using an elliptical power law + external shear (EPL+XS) for the lensing galaxy can yield results that are precise but inaccurate. We examine such models by generating and fitting mock lenses which produces multiple images of a background quasar-like point source. Despite using the same model for input and output, we find statistical bias in the Hubble constant on the order of 3% to 5%, depending on whether the elliptical lenses have noise or not. The phase space distribution has a `flared' shape that causes the mass power law slope to be underestimated and the Hubble constant to be overestimated. The bias varies with image configuration, which we quantify through annulus length between images with the first and second time delays ($\Delta r_{1,2}$). The statistical bias is worse for configurations that have narrow annuli (e.g., symmetric cross configurations). Assuming a source at redshift 2.0 and an EPL+XS lens at redshift 0.3, we find that the bias can be reduced, but not eliminated, if we limit the sample to systems with annulus lengths $\Delta r_{1,2} \gtrsim 0.3$ arcsec. As lens samples grow, it may be helpful to prioritize this range of image configurations for follow-up observation and analysis.
#### The GW Vir instability strip in the light of new observations of PG 1159  stars. Discovery of pulsations in the central star of Abell 72 and  variability of RX J0122.9-7521

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of new time series photometric observations of 29 pre-white dwarf stars of PG 1159 spectral type, carried out in the years 2014-2022. For the majority of stars, a median noise level in Fourier amplitude spectra of 0.5-1.0 mmag was achieved. This allowed the detection of pulsations in the central star of planetary nebula Abell 72, consistent with g-modes excited in GW Vir stars, and variability in RX J0122.9-7521 that could be due to pulsations, binarity or rotation. For the remaining stars from the sample that were not observed to vary, we placed upper limits for variability. After combination with literature data, our results place the fraction of pulsating PG 1159 stars within the GW Vir instability strip at 36%. An updated list of all known PG 1159 stars is provided, containing astrometric measurements from the recent Gaia DR3 data, as well as information on physical parameters, variability, and nitrogen content. Those data are used to calculate luminosities for all PG 1159 stars to place the whole sample on the theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the first time in that way. The pulsating stars are discussed as a group, and arguments are given that the traditional separation of GW Vir pulsators in "DOV" and "PNNV" stars is misleading and should not be used.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a clustering analysis of the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample, combining measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and density-split clustering down to a scale of $1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Our theoretical framework is based on emulators trained on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogues that forward model the cosmological dependence of the clustering statistics within an extended-$\Lambda$CDM framework, including redshift-space and Alcock-Paczynski distortions. Our base-$\Lambda$CDM analysis finds $\omega_{\rm cdm} = 0.1201\pm 0.0022$, $\sigma_8 = 0.792\pm 0.034$, and $n_s = 0.970\pm 0.018$, corresponding to $f\sigma_8 = 0.462\pm 0.020$ at $z \approx 0.525$, which is in agreement with Planck 2018 predictions and various clustering studies in the literature. We test single-parameter extensions to base-$\Lambda$CDM, varying the running of the spectral index, the dark energy equation of state, and the density of massless relic neutrinos, finding no compelling evidence for deviations from the base model. We model the galaxy-halo connection using a halo occupation distribution framework, finding signatures of environment-based assembly bias in the data. We validate our pipeline against mock catalogues that match the clustering and selection properties of CMASS, showing that we can recover unbiased cosmological constraints even with a volume 84 times larger than the one used in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first wide area (2.5 x 2.5 square degrees), deep (median noise of approximately 80 microJy per beam) LOFAR High Band Antenna image at a resolution of 1.2 arcseconds by 2 arcseconds. It was generated from an 8-hour International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) observation of the ELAIS-N1 field at frequencies ranging from 120 to 168 MHz with the most up-to-date ILT imaging strategy. This intermediate resolution falls between the highest possible resolution (0.3 arcseconds) achievable by using all International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) baselines and the standard 6-arcsecond resolution in the LoTSS (LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey) image products utilizing the LOFAR Dutch baselines only. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility of approximately 1 arcsecond imaging using the ILT, providing unique information on source morphology at scales below the surface brightness limits of higher resolutions. The total calibration and imaging time is approximately 52,000 core hours, nearly five times more than producing a 6-arcsecond image. We also present a radio source catalog containing 2263 sources detected over the 2.5 x 2.5 square degrees image of the ELAIS-N1 field, with a peak intensity threshold of 5.5 sigma. The catalog has been cross-matched with the LoTSS deep ELAIS-N1 field radio catalog, and its flux density and positional accuracy have been investigated and corrected accordingly. We find that approximately 80% of sources that we expect to be detectable based on their peak brightness in the LoTSS 6-arcsecond image are detected in this image, which is approximately a factor of two higher than for 0.3 arcsecond imaging in the Lockman Hole, implying there is a wealth of information on these intermediate scales.
#### The Eccentric Kozai-Lidov Mechanism as the Cause of Exocomet Transits of  KIC 8462852

 - **Abstract**
 KIC 8462852 is a star in the Kepler field that exhibits almost unique behaviour. The deep, irregular and aperiodic dips in its light curve have been interpreted as the breakup of a large exocomet on a highly eccentric orbit whose post-disruption material obscures the star. It is hypothesised that a nearby M-dwarf, recently confirmed to be bound to the system, could be exciting planetesimals in a source belt to high eccentricities if its orbit is highly misaligned with the belt: an effect known as the 'Eccentric Kozai-Lidov Mechanism'. To quantify how often this effect is expected to occur, this paper presents a Monte Carlo model of wide binary stars with embedded, misaligned planetesimal belts. These belts collisionally erode over time until they are excited to high eccentricities on secular timescales by a companion star if its orbit is sufficiently misaligned. The large planetesimals then produce an observable dimming signature in the light curve for a set period of time which may or may not overlap with similar events. The model finds that, for dimming events that persist for 100 yr, the most likely companion stars are located at $10^2 - 10^4$ au, the most likely belts are at $10^2-10^3$ au and the system age is most likely to be $10^2 - 10^3$ Myr. However, the probability of observing one or more stars exhibiting this phenomenon in the Kepler field is $1.3 \times 10^{-3}$, such that it is unlikely this mechanism is driving the observations of KIC 8462852.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry holds the potential for testing fundamental physics through the effects of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) in the $\sim 1-100$ nHz frequency band on precision measurements of stellar positions. Such measurements are complementary to tests made possible by the detection of the SGWB using Pulsar Timing Arrays. Here, the feasibility of using astrometry for the identification of parity-violating signals within the SGWB is investigated. This is achieved by defining and quantifying a non-vanishing $EB$ correlation function within astrometric correlation functions, and investigating how one might estimate the detectability of such signals.
