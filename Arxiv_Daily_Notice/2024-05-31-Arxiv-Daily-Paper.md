          NeuralODEs for VLEO simulations: Introducing thermoNET for Thermosphere Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel neural architecture termed thermoNET, designed to represent thermospheric density in satellite orbital propagation using a reduced amount of differentiable computations. Due to the appearance of a neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques. Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct approaches. In the first approach, the network undergoes training independently of spacecraft dynamics, engaging in a pure regression task against ground truth models, including JB-08 and NRLMSISE-00. In the second paradigm, network parameters are learned based on observed dynamics, adapting through ODE sensitivities. In both cases, the outcome is a flexible, compact model of the thermosphere density greatly enhancing numerical propagation efficiency while maintaining accuracy in the orbital predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiraling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealized N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiraling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.

          Dynamics of star clusters with tangentially anisotropic velocity distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-precision observations with HST and Gaia enabled new investigations of the internal kinematics of star clusters (SCs) and the dependence of kinematic properties on the stellar mass. These studies raised new questions about the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating stellar systems. We aim to develop a more complete theoretical understanding of how various kinematical properties of stars affect the global dynamical development of their host SCs. We perform N-body simulations of SCs with isotropic, radially anisotropic and tangentially anisotropic initial velocity distributions. We also study the effect of an external Galactic tidal field. We find three main results. First, compared to the conventional, isotropic case, the relaxation processes are accelerated in the tangentially anisotropic models and, in agreement with our previous investigations, slower in the radially anisotropic ones. This leads to, e.g., more rapid mass segregation in the central regions of the tangential models or their earlier core collapse. Second, although all SCs become isotropic in the inner regions after several relaxation times, we observe differences in the anisotropy profile evolution in the outer cluster regions - all tidally filling models gain tangential anisotropy there while the underfilling models become radially anisotropic. Third, we observe different rates of evolution towards energy equipartition (EEP). While all SCs evolve towards EEP in their inner regions (regardless of the filling factor), the outer regions of the tangentially anisotropic and isotropic models are evolving to an "inverted" EEP (i.e., the high-mass stars having higher velocity dispersion than the low-mass ones). The extent (both spatial and temporal) of this inversion can be attributed to the initial velocity anisotropy - it grows with increasing tangential anisotropy and decreases as the radial anisotropy rises.

 - **Abstract**
 Full sky coverage Adaptive Optics on Extremely Large Telescopes requires the adoption of several Laser Guide Stars as references.With such large apertures, the apparent elongation of the beacons is absolutely significant.With few exceptions,WaveFront Sensors designed for Natural Guide Stars are adapted and used in suboptimal mode in this context. We analyse and describe the geometrical properties of a class of WaveFront Sensors that are specifically designed to deal with Laser Guide Stars propagated from a location in the immediate vicinity of the telescope aperture. We describe in three dimensions the loci where the light of the Laser Guide Stars would focus in the focal volume located behind the focal plane (where astronomical objects are reimaged). We also describe the properties of several types of optomechanical devices that, through refraction and reflections, act as perturbers for this new class of pupil plane sensors, which we call ingot WaveFront Sensor. We give the recipes both for the most reasonable complex version of these WaveFront Sensors, with 6 pupils, and for the simplest one, with only 3 pupils. Both of them are referred to the ELT case. Elements to have a qualitative idea of how the sensitivity of such a new class of sensors compared to conventional ones are outlined. We present a new class of WaveFront Sensors, by carrying out the extension to the case of elongated sources at finite distance of the pyramid WaveFront Sensor and pointing out which advantages of the pyramid are retained and how it can be adopted to optimize the sensing.

          Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonations

 - **Abstract**
 Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become a leading contender to explain most, if not all, Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs <= 1.0 Msol, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ~1e-3 Msol of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD <= 1.0 Msol, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.

          The Pulsar Science Collaboratory: Multi-Epoch Scintillation Studies of Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of nine canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from one to three years. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey and obtain scintillation arc curvature measurements for four pulsars, detecting multiple arcs for two of them. Using updated pulsar distance estimates, we find evidence of previously undocumented scattering screens along the line of sight (LOS) of PSRs J1645$-$0317 and J2022$+$5154, as well as evidence that one of the arcs along the LOS to PSR J2313$+$4253 may reside somewhere within the Orion-Cygnus arm of the Milky Way. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and those predicted by the NE2001 electron density model. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar's dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory's 20m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 LiteBIRD, a forthcoming JAXA mission, aims to accurately study the microwave sky within the 40-400 GHz frequency range divided into 15 distinct nominal bands. The primary objective is to constrain the CMB inflationary signal, specifically the primordial B-modes. LiteBIRD targets the CMB B-mode signal on large angular scales, where the primordial inflationary signal is expected to dominate, with the goal of reaching a tensor-to-scalar ratio sensitivity of $\sigma_r\sim0.001$. LiteBIRD frequency bands will be split among three telescopes, with some overlap between telescopes for better control of systematic effects. Here we report on the development status of the detector arrays for the Low Frequency Telescope (LFT), which spans the 34-161 GHz range, with 12 bands subdivided between four types of trichroic pixels consisting of lenslet-coupled sinuous antennas. The signal from the antenna is bandpass filtered and sensed by AlMn Transition-Edge Sensors (TES). We provide an update on the status of the design and development of LiteBIRD's LFT LF1 (40-60-78 GHz), LF2 (50-68-89 GHz) pixels. We discuss design choices motivated by LiteBIRD scientific goals. In particular we focus on the details of the optimization of the design parameters of the sinuous antenna, on-chip bandpass filters, cross-under and impedance transformers and all the RF components that define the LF1 and LF2 pixel detection chain. We present this work in the context of the technical challenges and physical constraints imposed by the finite size of the instrument.

          Implications of in-ice volume scattering for radio-frequency neutrino experiments

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last three decades, several experimental initiatives have been launched with the goal of observing radio-frequency signals produced by ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHEN) interacting in solid media. Observed neutrino event signatures comprise impulsive signals with duration of order the inverse of the antenna+system bandwidth, superimposed upon an incoherent (typically white noise) thermal noise spectrum. Although bulk volume scattering (VS) of external radio-frequency signals is well-studied within the radar and glaciological communities, and can, in principle, contribute to that background. However, thus far, neutrino experiments have neglected to account for VS when projecting event rates. Herein, we present both model-dependent and model-independent constraints on both coherent, and also incoherent volume scattering, and assess their impact on UHEN experiments. We find that VS contributions are only weakly constrained by extant data; stronger limits may be obtained with dedicated calibration experiments.

          CHAOS VIII: Far-Ultraviolet Spectra of M101 and The Impact of Wolf-Rayet Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar and nebular properties of 9 H II regions in the spiral galaxy M101 with far-ultraviolet (FUV; ~900-2000 Å) and optical (~3200-10000 Å) spectra. We detect significant C III] 1907,1909 nebular emission in 7 regions, but O III] 1666 only in the lowest-metallicity region. We produce new analytic functions of the carbon ICF as a function of metallicity in order to perform a preliminary C/O abundance analysis. The FUV spectra also contain numerous stellar emission and P-Cygni features that we fit with luminosity-weighted combinations of single-burst Starburst99 and BPASS models. We find that the best-fit Starburst99 models closely match the observed very-high-ionization P-Cygni features, requiring very-hot, young (~< 3 Myr), metal-enriched massive stars. The youngest stellar populations are strongly correlated with broad He II emission, nitrogen Wolf-Rayet (WR) FUV and optical spectral features, and enhanced N/O gas abundances. Thus, the short-lived WR phase may be driving excess emission in several N P-Cygni wind features (955 Å, 991 Å, 1720 Å) that bias the stellar continuum fits to higher metallicities relative to the gas-phase metallicities. Accurate characterization of these H II regions requires additional inclusion of WR stars in the stellar population synthesis models. Our FUV spectra demonstrate that the ~900-1200 Å FUV can provide a strong test-bed for future WR atmosphere and evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents a candidate sensor for future spectroscopic applications, such as a Stage-5 Spectroscopic Survey Experiment or the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This new type of CCD sensor features multiple in-line amplifiers at its output stage allowing multiple measurements of the same charge packet, either in each amplifier and/or in the different amplifiers. Recently, the operation of an 8-amplifier sensor has been experimentally demonstrated, and the operation of a 16-amplifier sensor is presented in this work. This new sensor enables a noise level of approximately $1^e_{\rm rms}$ with a single sample per amplifier. Additionally, it is shown that sub-electron noise can be achieved using multiple samples per amplifier. In addition to demonstrating the performance of the 16-amplifier sensor, this work aims to create a framework for future analysis and performance optimization of this type of detectors. New models and techniques are presented to characterize specific parameters, which are absent in conventional CCDs and Skipper-CCDs: charge transfer between amplifiers and independent and common noise in the amplifiers, and their processing.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-star and planet-planet obliquity encode a planetary system's dynamical history, but both obliquities are hard to measure for misaligned systems with close-in companions. HAT-P-11 is a K4 star with two known planets: a close-in, misaligned super-Neptune with a approx 5-day orbit, and an outer super-Jupiter with a approx 10-year orbit. In this work we present a joint orbit fit of HAT-P-11 system with astrometry and RV data. By combining our results with previous constraints on the orientation of the star and the inner planet, we find that all three angular momenta -- those of the star, planet b, and planet c -- are significantly misaligned. We confirm the status of planet c as a super-Jupiter, with 3.06 pm 0.42 Jupiter mass, at a semimajor axis of 4.192 pm 0.07 AU, and planet b's minimum mass of 0.073 pm 0.0053 Jupiter mass. We present the posterior probability distribution of obliquity between star A and planet c, and between planet b and planet c.

          Planet-Planet Scattering and ZLK Migration -- The Dynamical History of HAT-P-11

 - **Abstract**
 The two planets of the HAT-P-11 system represent fascinating dynamical puzzles due to their significant eccentricities and orbital misalignments. In particular, HAT-P-11 b is on a close-in orbit that tides should have circularized well within the age of the system. Here we propose a two-step dynamical process that can reproduce all intriguing aspects of the system. We first invoke planet-planet scattering to generate significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations between the planets. We then propose that this misalignment initiated von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles and high-eccentricity migration that ultimately brought HAT-P-11 b to its present-day orbit. We find that this scenario is fully consistent only when significant tidally-driven radius inflation is accounted for during the tidal migration. We present a suite of N-body simulations exploring each phase of evolution and show that this scenario is consistent with all observational posteriors and the reported age of the system.

          On Kinematic Measurements of Self-Gravity in Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Using controlled injection and recovery experiments, we devised an analysis prescription to assess the quality of dynamical measurements of protoplanetary disk gas masses based on resolved (CO) spectral line data, given observational limitations (resolution, sampling, noise), measurement bias, and ambiguities in the geometry and physical conditions. With sufficient data quality, this approach performed well for massive disks ($M_{\rm d}/M_\ast=0.1$): we inferred $M_{\rm d}$ posteriors that recovered the true values with little bias ($\lesssim$ 20%) and uncertainties within a factor of two (2$\sigma$). The gas surface density profiles for such cases are recovered with remarkable fidelity. Some experimentation indicates that this approach becomes insensitive when $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast\lesssim5$%, due primarily to degeneracies in the surface density profile parameters. Including multiple lines that probe different vertical layers, along with some improvements in the associated tools, might push that practical boundary down by another factor of $\sim$two in ideal scenarios. We also demonstrated this analysis approach using archival ALMA observations of the MWC 480 disk (Öberg et al. 2021): we measured $M_{\rm d}=0.13^{\: +0.04}_{\: -0.01} \: M_\odot$ (corresponding to $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast=7\pm1$%) and identified kinematic substructures consistent with surface density gaps around 65 and 135 au. Overall, this (and similar work) suggests that these dynamical measurements offer powerful new constraints with sufficient accuracy and precision to quantify gas masses and surface densities at the high end of the $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast$ distribution, and therefore can serve as key benchmarks for detailed thermo-chemical modeling. We address some prospects for improvements, and discuss various caveats and limitations to guide future work.

 - **Abstract**
 Since volcanic activity was first discovered on Io from Voyager images in 1979, changes on Io's surface have been monitored from both spacecraft and ground-based telescopes. Here, we present the highest spatial resolution images of Io ever obtained from a ground-based telescope. These images, acquired by the SHARK-VIS instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope, show evidence of a major resurfacing event on Io's trailing hemisphere. When compared to the most recent spacecraft images, the SHARK-VIS images show that a plume deposit from a powerful eruption at Pillan Patera has covered part of the long-lived Pele plume deposit. Although this type of resurfacing event may be common on Io, few have been detected due to the rarity of spacecraft visits and the previously low spatial resolution available from Earth-based telescopes. The SHARK-VIS instrument ushers in a new era of high resolution imaging of Io's surface using adaptive optics at visible wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated ephemeris and physical parameters for the exoplanet WASP-77 A b. In this effort, we combine 64 ground- and space-based transit observations, 6 space-based eclipse observations, and 32 radial velocity observations to produce the most precise orbital solution to date for this target, aiding in the planning of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel observations and atmospheric studies. We report a new orbital period of 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days, a new mid-transit time of 2459957.337860 +- 4.3e-5 BJDTDB (Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time scale; arXiv:1005.4415) and a new mid-eclipse time of 2459956.658192 +- 6.7e-5 BJDTDB. Furthermore, the methods presented in this study reduce the uncertainties in the planet mass to 1.6654 +- 4.5e-3 Mjup and orbital period to 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days by factors of 15.1 and 10.9, respectively. Through a joint fit analysis comparison of transit data taken by space-based and citizen science-led initiatives, our study demonstrates the power of including data collected by citizen scientists compared to a fit of the space-based data alone. Additionally, by including a vast array of citizen science data from ExoClock, Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), and Exoplanet Watch, we can increase our observational baseline and thus acquire better constraints on the forward propagation of our ephemeris than what is achievable with TESS data alone.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) drive powerful shocks and thereby accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs) as they propagate from the corona into interplanetary space. Here we present the processes of three-stage particle acceleration by a CME-driven shock detected by the in situ spacecraft--Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 August 27. The onset of SEPs is produced by a fast CME with a speed of 1284 km/s when it propagates to $\sim$2.85 Rs. The second stage of particle acceleration occurs when the fast CME catches up and interacts with a preceding slow one in interplanetary space at $\sim$40 Rs ($\sim$0.19 au). The CME interaction is accompanied by an intense interplanetary type II radio enhancement. Such direct measurement of particle acceleration during interplanetary CME interaction/radio enhancement is rarely recorded in previous studies. The third stage of energetic storm particles is associated with the CME-driven shock passage of the PSP at $\sim$0.38 au. Obviously, harder particle spectra are found in the latter two stages than the first one, which can arise from a stronger shock produced by the CME interaction and the enriched seed particles inside the preceding CME.

Exploiting high spatial resolution ($\approx20$ pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array $^{12}$CO(2-1) observations, we study the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the nuclear ring and its vicinity, identifying $158$ spatially- and spectrally-resolved GMCs. The GMC sizes ($R_{\mathrm{c}}$) are comparable to those of the clouds in the Milky Way (MW) disc, but their gas masses, observed linewidths ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}$) and gas mass surface densities are larger. The GMC size -- linewidth relation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}\propto R_{\mathrm{c}}^{0.77}$) is steeper than that of the clouds of the MW disc and centre, and the GMCs are on average only marginally gravitationally bound (with a mean virial parameter $\langle\alpha_{\mathrm{obs,vir}}\rangle\approx1.7$). We discuss the possible origins of the steep size -- linewidth relation and enhanced observed linewidths of the clouds and suggest that a combination of mechanisms such as stellar feedback, gas accretion and cloud-cloud collisions, as well as the gas inflows driven by the large-scale bar, may play a role.

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of carbon-to-oxygen ratios has yielded intriguing insights into the composition of close-in giant exoplanets, giving rise to a distinct classification: carbon-rich planets, characterized by a carbon-to-oxygen ratio $\ge$ 1 in their atmospheres, as opposed to giant planets exhibiting carbon-to-oxygen ratios close to the protosolar value. In contrast, despite numerous space missions dispatched to the outer solar system and the proximity of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, our understanding of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in these giants remains notably deficient. Determining this ratio is crucial as it serves as a marker linking a planet's volatile composition directly to its formation region within the disk. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the four gas giants of our solar system and explores why there is yet no definitive dismissal of the possibility that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune could be considered carbon-rich planets. Additionally, we delve into the three primary formation scenarios proposed in existing literature to account for a bulk carbon-to-oxygen ratio $\ge$ 1 in a giant planet. A significant challenge lies in accurately inferring the bulk carbon-to-oxygen ratio of our solar system's gas giants. Retrieval methods involve integrating in situ measurements from entry probes equipped with mass spectrometers and remote sensing observations conducted at microwave wavelengths by orbiters. However, these methods fall short of fully discerning the deep carbon-to-oxygen abundance in the gas giants due to their limited probing depth, typically within the 10-100 bar range.

 - **Abstract**
 Morphological mapping is a fundamental step in studying the processes that shaped an asteroid surface. Yet, it is challenging and often requires multiple independent assessments by trained experts. Here, we present fast methods to detect and characterize meaningful terrains from the topographic roughness: entropy of information, and local mean surface orientation. We apply our techniques to Didymos and Dimorphos, the target asteroids of NASA's DART mission: first attempt to deflect an asteroid. Our methods reliably identify morphological units at multiple scales. The comparative study reveals various terrain types, signatures of processes that transformed Didymos and Dimorphos. Didymos shows the most heterogeneity and morphology that indicate recent resurfacing events. Dimorphos is comparatively rougher than Didymos, which may result from the formation process of the binary pair and past interaction between the two bodies. Our methods can be readily applied to other bodies and data sets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified Dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion ({\sigma}v), virial parameter ({\alpha}vir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the {\sigma}v-R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use non-hierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures {\alpha}vir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir > 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir < 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8-4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth has been studied at the stage of its accumulation and early evolution after impacts of large planetesimals. In the considered variants of calculations of the motion of bodies ejected from the Earth, most of the bodies left the Hill sphere of the Earth and moved in heliocentric orbits. Their dynamical lifetime reached several hundred million years. At higher ejection velocities vej the probabilities of collisions of bodies with the Earth and Moon were generally lower. Over the entire considered time interval at the ejection velocity vej, equal to 11.5, 12 and 14 km/s, the values of the probability of a collision of a body with the Earth were approximately 0.3, 0.2 and 0.15-0.2, respectively. At ejection velocities vej<11.25 km/s, i.e., slightly exceeding a parabolic velocity, most of the ejected bodies fell back to the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was approximately 15-35 times less than that with the Earth at vej>11.5 km/s. The probability of a collision of such bodies with the Moon was mainly about 0.004-0.008 at ejection velocities of at least 14 km/s and about 0.006-0.01 at vej=12 km/s. It was larger at lower ejection velocities and was in the range of 0.01-0.02 at vej=11.3 km/s. The Moon may contain material ejected from the Earth during the accumulation of the Earth and during the late heavy bombardment. At the same time, as obtained in our calculations, the bodies ejected from the Earth and falling on the Moon embryo would not be enough for the Moon to grow to its present mass from a small embryo moving along the present orbit of the Moon. This result argues in favor of the formation of a lunar embryo and its further growth to most of the present mass of the Moon near the Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids provide valuable insights into the evolution of stellar multiplicity among intermediate-mass stars. Here, we present a systematic investigation of single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) based on high-precision velocities measured by the VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) project. We detected 76 (29%) SB1 systems among the 258 Milky Way Cepheids in the first VELOCE data release, 32 (43%) of which were not previously known to be SB1 systems. We determined 30 precise and 3 tentative orbital solutions, 18 (53%) of which are reported for the first time. This large set of Cepheid orbits provides a detailed view of the eccentricity e and orbital period Porb distribution among evolved intermediate-mass stars, ranging from e=[0.0, 0.8] and Porb=[240, 9 000] d. Orbital motion on timescales exceeding the 11 yr VELOCE baseline was investigated using a template fitting technique applied to literature data. Particularly interesting objects include a) R Cru, the Cepheid with the shortest orbital period in the Milky Way (240 d), b) ASAS J103158-5814.7, a short-period overtone Cepheid exhibiting time-dependent pulsation amplitudes as well as orbital motion, c) 17 triple systems with outer visual companions, among other interesting objects. Most VELOCE Cepheids (21/23) that exhibit evidence for a companion based on Gaia proper motion anomaly are also spectroscopic binaries, whereas the remaining do not exhibit significant (> 3-sigma) orbital RV variations. Gaia quality flags, notably the Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE), do not allow to reliably identify Cepheid binaries, although statistically the average RUWE of SB1 Cepheids is slightly higher than that of non-SB1 Cepheids. Comparison with Gaia photometric amplitudes in G, Bp, and Rp also does not allow to identify spectroscopic binaries among the full VELOCE sample.

 Low mass-ratio (q) contact binary systems are progenitors of stellar mergers such as blue straggles (BS) or fast-rotating FK Com stars. In this study, we present the first light curve analysis of two newly identified low mass-ratio contact binary systems, TIC 55007847 and TIC 63597006, that are identified from TESS. Both stars are classified as A-subtype contact binaries. We obtained the precise orbit periods for the two objects by using the O-C method, i.e. P=0.6117108 d for TIC 55007847 and P=0.7008995 d for TIC 63597006, respectively, and found an obvious periodic signal in the O-C curve of TIC 63597006. We suggest that the periodic signal comes from a third body. We further use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with PHOEBE to derive the photometric solutions for the two binaries. The photometric solution for this object shows that the contribution of the third body is about 6%. Our analysis revealed that TIC 55007847 has an extremely low mass ratio of q=0.08. By calculating the ratio of spin angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum Js/Jo, we found that TIC 55007847 is very close to the instability threshold with Js/Jo = 0.31, indicating that it may merge into a single, fast-rotating star in the future. For TIC 63597006, q=0.14 and Js/Jo=0.15. This object is in a relatively stable evolutionary status at present.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, it has been demonstrated that massive stars see their infant circumstellar medium shaped into a large, irradiated, gravitationally unstable accretion disc during their early formation phase. Such discs constitute the gas reservoir in which nascent high-mass stars gain substantial fraction of their mass by episodic accretion of dense gaseous circumstellar clumps. We aim to evaluate the effects of stellar motion, caused by the disc non-axisymmetric gravitational field, on the disc evolution and its spatial morphology. In particular, we analyze the disc propensity to gravitational instability and fragmentation, and also disc appearance on synthetic millimeter-band images pertinent to the alma facility. We employed three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the surroundings of a young massive star in the non-inertial spherical coordinate system, adopting the highest spatial resolution to date and including the indirect star-disc gravitational potential caused by the asymmetries in the circumstellar disc. The resulting disc were postprocessed with the radiation transfer tool RADMC-3D and CASA softwear to obtain disc synthetic images. The redistribution of angular momentum in the system makes the disc smaller and rounder, reduces the number of circumstellar gaseous clumps formed via disc gravitational fragmentation, and prevents the ejection of gaseous clumps from the disc. The synthetic predictive images at millimeter wavelengths of the accretion disc including stellar wobbling are in better agreement with the observations of the surroundings of massive young stellar objects, namely, AFGL 4176 mm1, G17.64+0.16 and G353.273, than our numerical hydrodynamics simulations omitting this physical mechanism. Our work confirms that stellar wobbling is an essential ingredient to account for in numerical simulations of accretion discs of massive protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution of molecules in AGB circumstellar envelopes is regulated by different processes. In the outer layers all molecules are destroyed due to the interaction with interstellar ultraviolet photons. Here we aim to characterize in a coherent and uniform way the radial extent of three molecules (SiO, CS, and SiS) in envelopes around AGB stars of O- and C-rich character, and to study their dependence with mass loss rate. To that purpose, we used the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m telescopes to observe 7 M-type and 7 C-type AGB envelopes covering a wide range of mass loss rates (1e-7 - 1e-5 Msun/yr) in lines of SiO, CS, and SiS spanning a range of upper level energies of 2-130 K. We carried out excitation and radiative transfer calculations over a wide parameter space to characterize the molecular abundance and radial extent. A chi2 analysis indicates that the abundance is well constrained while the radial extent is more difficult to constrain. The radial extent increases with increasing envelope density, in agreement with previous observational findings. At high envelope densities, Mdot/vexp > 1e-6 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent of SiO, CS, and SiS are similar, while at low envelope densities, Mdot/vexp < 1e-7 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent differ among the three molecules, in agreement with theoretical expectations based on destruction due to photodissociation. At low envelope densities we find a sequence of increasing radial extent, SiS -> CS -> SiO. We also find a tentative dependence of the radial extent with the chemical type (O- or C-rich) of the star for SiO and CS. Interferometric observations and further investigation of the photodissociation of SiO, CS, and SiS should allow to clarify the situation on the relative photodissociation radius of SiO, CS, and SiS in AGB envelopes and the dependence with envelope density and C/O ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the globular cluster Omega Centauri. Our analysis combines data obtained in this work with previously published HST data from an earlier article of this series and encompasses a broad portion of the cluster's radial extension. Our findings reveal a significant radial variation in the fraction of stars within the two most populous stellar populations showing that one of the main second-population groups (referred to as bMS) is more centrally concentrated than the first-population group (referred to as rMS). Additionally, we explore the spatial variations of the other less populous stellar populations (referred to as MSa and MSd) and find a qualitatively similar, but weaker, radial decrease in the fraction of stars in these populations at larger distances from the cluster centre. Only one of the populations identified (MSe) does not show any significant radial variation.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 81P (Wild 2) is characterized by the presence of a prominent-fan shaped dust emission originating from an active source at high latitude on the nucleus, whose axis is assumed to coincide with the comet's rotation axis. Therefore, several authors estimated the spin axis orientation of 81P in past apparitions based on the polar jet model. By measuring the PAs of the fan on CCD images taken with different telescopes during the 2009-10 and 2022-23 apparitions, we estimated a position of the comet's spin axis at RA=295.0°$\pm$ 7.5°, Dec=14.5°$\pm$ 4.0° for the 2009-10 apparition and at RA=296.7°$\pm$ 2.0°, Dec=17.3°$\pm$ 2.5° for the 2022-23 apparition. Despite some degree of uncertainty of the estimate for the 2009-10 apparition, we interpolated the estimate for 2009-10 and 2022-23 with the published data of the previous apparition of 1997, to assess the presence and the extent of a drift of the pole since the 1997 passage. The analysis over a long time span of five consecutive apparitions confirms previous observations that the spin axis of comet 81P is subject to a slow drift with variable rate, probably connected to outgassing-induced jet forces and the related non-gravitational perturbations of its orbital period.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We have mapped the prestellar core H-MM1 in Ophiuchus in rotational lines of ortho-H2D+ (oH2D+), N2H+, and DCO+ at the wavelength 0.8 mm with the Large APEX sub-Millimeter Array (LAsMA) multibeam receiver of the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope. We also ran a series of chemistry models to predict the abundance distributions of the observed molecules, and to estimate the effect of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate on their abundances. The three line maps show different distributions. The oH2D+ map is extended and outlines the general structure of the core, while N2H+ mainly shows the density maxima, and the DCO+ emission peaks are shifted towards one edge of the core where a region of enhanced desorption has been found previously. According to the chemical simulation, the fractional oH2D+ abundance remains relatively high in the centre of the core, and its column density correlates strongly with the cosmic-ray ionisation rate. Simulated line maps constrain the cosmic-ray ionisation rate per hydrogen molecule to be low, between 5e-18/s and 1e-17/s in the H-MM1 core. This estimate agrees with the gas temperature measured in the core. Modelling line emission of oH2D+ provides a straightforward method of determining the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in dense clouds, where the primary ion, H3+, is not observable.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the pair-instability origin of superluminous supernova 2018ibb. As the base model, we use a non-rotating stellar model with an initial mass of 250 Msun at about 1/15 solar metallicity. We consider three versions of the model as input for radiative transfer simulations done with the STELLA and ARTIS codes: with 25 Msun of 56Ni, 34 Msun of 56Ni, and a chemically mixed case with 34 Msun of 56Ni. We present light curves and spectra in comparison to the observed data of SN 2018ibb, and conclude that the pair-instability supernova model with 34 Msun of 56Ni explains broad-band light curves reasonably well between -100 and 250 days around the peak. Our synthetic spectra have many similarities with the observed spectra. The luminosity excess in the light curves and the blue-flux excess in the spectra can be explained by an additional energy source, which may be interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar matter. We discuss possible mechanisms of the origin of the circumstellar matter being ejected in the decades before the pair-instability explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of stellar obliquities provides critical insight into the formation and evolution pathways of exoplanets. In the past decade, it was found that hot stars hosting hot Jupiters are more likely to have high obliquities than cool stars, but it is not clear whether this trend exists only for hot Jupiters or holds for other types of planets. In this work, we extend the study of the obliquities of hot (6250-7000\,K) stars with transiting super-Earth and sub-Neptune-sized planets. We constrain the obliquity distribution based on measurements of the stars' projected rotation velocities. Our sample consists of 170 TESS and \textit{Kepler} planet-hosting stars and 180 control stars chosen to have indistinguishable spectroscopic characteristics. In our analysis, we find evidence suggesting that the planet hosts have a systematically higher $\langle \sin i \rangle$ compared to the control sample. This result implies that the planet hosts tend to have lower obliquities. However, the observed difference in $\langle \sin i \rangle$ is not significant enough to confirm spin-orbit alignment, as it is 3.8$\sigma$ away from perfect alignment. We also find evidence that within the planet-hosting stars there is a trend of higher obliquity (lower $\langle \sin i\rangle$) for the hotter stars ($\teff > 6250$ K) than for the cooler stars in the sample. This suggests that hot stars hosting smaller planets exhibit a broader obliquity distribution($\langle \sin i\rangle = 0.79 \pm 0.053$) than cooler planet-hosting stars, indicating that high obliquities are not exclusive to hot Jupiters and instead are more broadly tied to hot stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteor and bolide phenomena caused by the atmospheric ablation of incoming meteoroids are predicted to occur at the planet Venus. Their systematic observation would allow to measure and compare the sub-mm to m meteoroid flux at different locations in the solar system. Using a physical model of atmospheric ablation, we demonstrate that Venus meteors would be brighter, shorter-lived, and appear higher in the atmosphere than Earth meteors. To investigate the feasibility of meteor detection at Venus from an orbiter, we apply the SWARMS survey simulator tool to sets of plausible meteoroid population parameters, atmospheric models and instrument designs suited to the task, such as the Mini-EUSO camera operational on the ISS since 2019. We find that such instrumentation would detect meteors at Venus with a 1.5x to 2.5x higher rate than at Earth. The estimated Venus-Earth detection ratio remains insensitive to variations in the chosen observation orbit and detector characteristics, implying that a meteor survey from Venus orbit is feasible, though contingent on the availability of suitable algorithms and methods for efficient on-board processing and downlinking of the meteor data to Earth. We further show that a hypothetical camera onboard the upcoming EnVision mission to Venus similar to the ISS instrument should detect many times more meteors than needed for an initial characterisation of the large meteoroid population at 0.7 au from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 HIP 41378 d is a long-period planet that has only been observed to transit twice, three years apart, with K2. According to stability considerations and a partial detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, $P_\mathrm{d} = 278.36$ d has been determined to be the most likely orbital period. We targeted HIP 41378 d with CHEOPS at the predicted transit timing based on $P_\mathrm{d}= 278.36$ d, but the observations show no transit. We find that large ($>22.4$ hours) transit timing variations (TTVs) could explain this non-detection during the CHEOPS observation window. We also investigated the possibility of an incorrect orbital solution, which would have major implications for our knowledge of this system. If $P_\mathrm{d} \neq 278.36$ d, the periods that minimize the eccentricity would be $101.22$ d and $371.14$ d. The shortest orbital period will be tested by TESS, which will observe HIP 41378 in Sector 88 starting in January 2025. Our study shows the importance of a mission like CHEOPS, which today is the only mission able to make long observations (i.e., from space) to track the ephemeris of long-period planets possibly affected by large TTVs.

 - **Abstract**
 IOP4 is a pipeline to perform photometry and polarimetry analysis of optical data from Calar Alto (CAHA) and Sierra Nevada (OSN) observatories. IOP4 implements Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to seamlessly integrate all information about the reduction and results in a database which can be used to query and plot results, flag data and inspect the reduction process in an integrated fashion with the whole pipeline. It also ships with an already built-in web interface which can be used out of the box to browse the database and supervise all pipeline processes. It is built to ease debugging and inspection of data. Reduction from five different instruments are already implemented: RoperT90, AndorT90 and DIPOL (at OSN 0.9m telescope), AndorT150 (OSN 1.5m telescope) and CAFOS (CAHA 2.2m telescope). IOP4's modular design allows for easy integration of new observatories and instruments, and its results have already featured in several high-impact refereed publications. In this paper we describe the implementation and characteristics of IOP4.

 - **Abstract**
 It is possible that a multi-component dark matter model is required if primordial black holes only contribute to a fraction of the energy density in dark matter. This is increasingly more likely with respect to the case of $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$, since there is only one remaining window, on asteroid-mass scales, where primordial black holes can make up all of the dark matter. A mixed dark matter model can lead to interesting observables that come about due to the interactions between primordial black holes and the second dark matter component. This can provide unique signatures of the presence of primordial black holes and increase the prospects of detection or improvement of constraints in the mass ranges where $f_{\rm PBH} < 1$, whilst simultaneously exploring the remaining open parameter space for other dark matter candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Ozone ($\textrm{O}_3$) is important for the survival of life on Earth because it shields the surface from ionising ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, the existence of $\textrm{O}_3$ in Earth's atmosphere is not always beneficial. Resulting from anthropogenic activity, $\textrm{O}_3$ exists as a biologically harmful pollutant at the surface when it forms in the presence of sunlight and other pollutants. As a strong oxidiser, $\textrm{O}_3$ can be lethal to several different organisms; thus, when assessing the potential habitability of an exoplanet, a key part is determining whether toxic gases could be present at its surface. Using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 (WACCM6; a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model), twelve atmospheric simulations of the terrestrial exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 e are performed with a variety of $\textrm{O}_2$ concentrations and assuming two different stellar spectra proposed in the literature. Four atmospheric simulations of the exoplanet Proxima Centauri b are also included. Some scenarios for both exoplanets exhibit time-averaged surface $\textrm{O}_3$ mixing ratios exceeding harmful levels of 40 ppbv, with 2200 ppbv the maximum concentration found in the cases simulated. These concentrations are toxic and can be fatal to most life on Earth. In other scenarios $\textrm{O}_3$ remains under harmful limits over a significant fraction of the surface, despite there being present regions which may prove inhospitable. In the case that $\textrm{O}_3$ is detected in a terrestrial exoplanet's atmosphere, determining the surface concentration is an important step when evaluating a planet's habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model's fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature can significantly impact the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), potentially easing tensions between early and late universe observations. The observational data shows an indication for a closed universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence cannot be neglected entirely.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS) is a ZTF and Rubin Observatory alert broker that will send alerts to the community regarding interesting events in the Solar System. SNAPS is actively monitoring Solar System objects and one of its functions is to compare objects (primarily main belt asteroids) to one another to find those that are outliers relative to the population. In this paper, we use the SNAPShot1 dataset which contains 31,693 objects from ZTF and derive outlier scores for each of these objects. SNAPS employs an unsupervised approach; consequently, to derive outlier rankings for each object, we propose four different outlier metrics such that we can explore variants of outlier scores and add confidence to outlier rankings. We also provide outlier scores for each object in each permutation of 15 feature spaces, between 2 and 15 features, which yields 32,752 total feature spaces. We show that we can derive population outlier rankings each month at Rubin Observatory scale using four Nvidia A100 GPUs, and present several avenues of scientific investigation that can be explored using population outlier detection.

 - **Abstract**
 As it collapses to form a halo, the shape of a protohalo patch is deformed by the initial shear field. This deformation is often modeled using the "deformation" tensor, constructed from second derivatives of the gravitational potential, whose trace gives the initial overdensity. However, especially for lower mass protohalos, this matrix is not always positive definite: one of its eigenvalues has a different sign from the others. We show that the evolution of a patch is better described by the "energy shear" tensor, which is positive definite and plays a direct role in the evolution. This positive-definiteness simplifies models of halo abundances, assembly and of the cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 When gravitational waves travel from their source to an observer, they interact with matter structures along their path, causing distinct deformations in their waveforms. In this study we introduce a novel theoretical framework for wave optics effects in gravitational lensing, addressing the limitations of existing approaches. We achieve this by incorporating the proper time technique, typically used in field theory studies, into gravitational lensing. This approach allows us to extend the standard formalism beyond the eikonal and paraxial approximations, which are traditionally assumed, and to account for polarization effects, which are typically neglected in the literature. We demonstrate that our method provides a robust generalization of conventional approaches, including them as special cases. Our findings enhance our understanding of gravitational wave propagation, which is crucial for accurately interpreting gravitational wave observations and extracting unbiased information about the lenses from the gravitational wave waveforms.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for an optimal filter design for the estimation of stellar metallicity, based on synthetic photometry from Gaia XP spectra convolved with a series of filter-transmission curves defined by different central wavelengths and bandwidths. Unlike previous designs based solely on maximizing metallicity sensitivity, we find that the optimal solution provides a balance between the sensitivity and uncertainty of the spectra. With this optimal filter design, the best precision of metallicity estimates for relatively bright ($G \sim 11.5$) stars is excellent, $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.034$\,dex for FGK dwarf stars, superior to that obtained utilizing custom sensitivity-optimized filters (e.g., SkyMapper\,$v$). By selecting hundreds of high-probabability member stars of the open cluster M67, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic photometric-metallicity scatter of these cluster members is only 0.036\,dex, consistent with this level of precision. Our results clearly demonstrate that the internal precision of photometric-metallicity estimates can be extremely high, even providing the opportunity to perform chemical tagging for very large numbers of field stars in the Milky Way. This experiment shows that it is crucial to take into account uncertainty alongside the sensitivity when designing filters for measuring the stellar metallicity and other parameters.

          WIYN Open Cluster Study. XC. Barium Surface Abundances of Blue Straggler Stars in the Open Clusters NGC 7789 and M67

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate barium (Ba) abundances in blue straggler stars (BSSs) in two open clusters, NGC 7789 (1.6 Gyr) and M67 (4 Gyr), as signatures of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) mass transfer. We combine our findings with previous Ba abundance analyses in NGC 6819 (2.5 Gyr) and NGC 188 (7 Gyr). Out of 35 BSSs studied in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, 15 (43$\pm$11%) are Ba-enriched; no BSSs in NGC 188 are Ba-enriched. The Ba abundances of enriched BSSs show an anticorrelation with cluster age, ranging from an enrichment of [Ba/Fe]$\sim$+1.5 dex in NGC 7789 to [Ba/Fe]$\sim$+1.0 dex in M67. The Ba-enriched BSSs all lie in the same region of the HR diagram, irrespective of cluster age or distance from the main-sequence turnoff. Our data suggest a link between AGB donor mass and mass-transfer efficiency in BSSs, in that less massive AGB donors tend to undergo more conservative mass transfer. We find that 40$\pm$16% of the Ba-enriched BSSs are in longer-period spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods less than 5000 days. Those Ba-enriched BSSs that do not exhibit radial-velocity variability suggest AGB mass-transfer in wide binaries by either wind mass transfer or wind Roche-lobe overflow. Given the preponderance of long orbital periods in the BSSs of M67 and NGC 188 and the frequency of Ba enrichment in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, it may be that AGB mass transfer is the dominant mechanism of BSS formation in open clusters older than 1 Gyr.

          An Expanding Accretion Disk and a Warm Disk Wind As Seen In the Spectral Evolution of HBC 722

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object HBC 722 in optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. Using a modified viscous accretion disk model, we fit the outburst epoch SED to determine the physical parameters of the disk, including $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} = 10^{-4.0} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 3.65 \ R_\odot$, $i = 79^\circ$, and a maximum disk temperature of $T_\mathrm{max} = 5700$ K. We then use a decade of optical/NIR spectra to demonstrate a changing accretion rate drives the visible-range photometric variation, while the NIR shows the outer radius of the active accretion disk expands outward as the outburst progresses. We also identify the major components of the disk system: a plane-parallel disk atmosphere in Keplerian rotation and a 2-part warm disk wind that is collimated near the star and wide-angle at larger radii. The wind is traced by classic wind lines, and appears as a narrow, low-velocity, deep absorption component in several atomic lines spanning the visible spectrum and in the CO 2.29$\mu$m band. We compare the wind lines to those computed from wind models for other FU Ori systems and rapidly accreting young stellar disks and find a 4000-6000 K wind can explain the observed line profiles. Fitting the progenitor spectrum, we find $M_* = 0.2 \ M_\odot$ and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{progenitor} = 7.8 \times 10^{-8} \ M_\odot \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we discuss HBC 722 relative to V960 Mon, another FU Ori object we have previously studied in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within the framework of more realistic dark matter halo models, transcending the limitations of spherical-collapse approximations. Through analytical computations utilizing diverse mass functions, we address critical factors typically overlooked in the standard Press-Schechter formalism, including ellipsoidal-collapse conditions, angular momentum dynamics, dynamical friction, and the cosmological constant. Our analysis incorporates two widely recognized halo density profiles, the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, considering both spherical and ellipsoidal-collapse scenarios. We present relevant calculations of pivotal gravitational lensing observables, such as Einstein radii, lensing optical depths, and time delays, spanning a wide range of redshifts and masses across two distinct lensing models: the point mass and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) lens models. Our findings illuminate that adopting more realistic dark matter halo models leads to heightened lensing effects compared to their spherical-collapse counterparts. Furthermore, our analyses of lensing optical depths and time delays reveal distinct characteristics between point mass and SIS lens models. These outcomes highlight the need for more realistic halo descriptions instead of simple approximations when modeling gravitational lensing, as this approach can potentially better reveal the complex structures of dark matter.

          A consistency test of the cosmological model at the epoch of recombination using DESI BAO and Planck measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The value of the Hubble constant determined from CMB and BAO measurements is directly dependent on the sound horizon at the photon-baryon decoupling. There has been significant interest in the possibility of new physics at the epoch around recombination that could reduce the sound horizon and increase the inferred value of $H_0$, thus helping to relieve the Hubble tension. One way to determine if new physics is required would be to measure $H_0$ from BAO and CMB without assuming any model for computing the sound horizon. In this study, we use the recently released DESI Year 1 BAO data combined with the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_\star$ and the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prior on $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$ to determine $H_0$ while treating the sound horizon at baryon decoupling $r_{\rm d}$ as a free parameter. We find $H_0=69.88 \pm 0.93$ km/s/Mpc, which is $\sim2\sigma$ larger than $H_0 = 67.44 \pm 0.47$ km/s/Mpc in the Planck-best-fit $\Lambda$CDM where $r_{\rm d}$ is derived using the standard recombination model. For comparison, we perform the same analysis using the pre-DESI BAO data with $\theta_\star$ and the same prior on $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$, finding $H_0= 67.37 \pm 0.96$ km/s/Mpc. This difference derives from the notably larger value of the product $r_{\rm d}H_0$ measured by DESI. Future BAO data from DESI will help determine if the cosmological model at the epoch of recombination model requires a modification.

          Did Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817 Leave Behind A Long-lived Neutron Star?

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the observational implications of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 leaving behind a rapidly rotating massive neutron star that launches a relativistic, equatorial outflow as well as a jet. We show that if the equatorial outflow (ring) is highly beamed in the equatorial plane, its luminosity can be "hidden" from view until late times, even if carrying a significant fraction of the spin-down energy of the merger remnant. This hidden ring reveals itself as a re-brightening in the light curve once it slows down enough for Earth to be within the ring's relativistic beaming solid angle. We compute semi-analytic light curves using this model and find they are in agreement with the observations thus far, and we provide predictions for the ensuing afterglow.
