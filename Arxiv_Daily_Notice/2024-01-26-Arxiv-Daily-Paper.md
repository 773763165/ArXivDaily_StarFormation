 - **Abstract**
 Since 2015, the Emerging Researchers in Exoplanetary Science (ERES) conference has provided a venue for early-career researchers in exoplanetary astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science to share their research, network, and build new collaborations. ERES stands out in that it is spearheaded by early-career researchers, providing a unique attendance experience for the participants and a professional experience for the organizers. In this Bulletin, we share experiences and lessons learned from the perspective of the organizing committee for the 2023 edition of ERES. For this eighth ERES conference, we hosted over 100 participants in New Haven, CT, for a three-day program. This manuscript is aimed primarily toward groups of early-career scientists who are planning a conference for their fields of study. We anticipate that this Bulletin will continue dialogue within the academic community about best practices for equitable event organization.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is increasingly studied as a potential solution to small-scale discrepancies between simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) and observations. We examine a physically motivated two-state SIDM model with both elastic and inelastic scatterings. In particular, endothermic, exothermic, and elastic scattering occur with equal probability at high relative velocities ($v_{\rm rel}\gtrsim400~{\rm km/s})$. In a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulation of Milky Way-size haloes, we vary the primordial state fractions to understand the impact of inelastic dark matter self-interactions on halo structure and evolution. In particular, we test how the initial conditions impact the present-day properties of dark matter haloes. Depending on the primordial state fraction, scattering reactions will be dominated by either exothermic or endothermic effects for high and low initial excited state fractions respectively. We find that increasing the initial excited fraction reduces the mass of the main halo, as well as the number of subhaloes on all mass scales. The main haloes are cored, with lower inner densities and higher outer densities compared with CDM. Additionally, we find that the shape of the main halo becomes more spherical the higher the initial excited state fraction is. Finally, we show that the number of satellites steadily decreases with initial excited state fraction across all satellite masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The NANOGrav, Parkes and European Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have collected strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background in the nHz-frequency band. In this work we perform a detailed statistical analysis of the signal in order to elucidate its physical origin. Specifically, we test the standard explanation in terms of supermassive black hole mergers against the prominent alternative explanation in terms of a first-order phase transition. By means of a frequentist hypothesis test we find that the observed gravitational wave spectrum prefers a first-order phase transition at $2-3\sigma$ significance compared to black hole mergers (depending on the underlying black hole model). This mild preference is linked to the relatively large amplitude of the observed gravitational wave signal (above the typical expectation of black hole models) and to its spectral shape (which slightly favors the phase-transition spectrum over the predominantly single power-law spectrum predicted in black hole models). The best fit to the combined PTA data set is obtained for a phase transition which dominantly produces the gravitational wave signal by bubble collisions (rather than by sound waves). The best-fit (energy-density) spectrum features, within the frequency band of the PTA experiments, a crossover from a steeply rising power law (causality tail) to a softly rising power law; the peak frequency then falls slightly above the PTA-measured range. Such a spectrum can be obtained for a strong first-order phase transition in the thick-wall regime of vacuum tunneling which reheats the Universe to a temperature of $T_*\sim \text{GeV}$. A dark sector phase transition at the GeV-scale provides a comparably good fit.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of $z \sim 6$ quasars powered by super-massive black holes (SMBHs, $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10}\, M_\odot$) challenge our current understanding of early black hole formation and evolution. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the study of massive black holes (MBHs, $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{6-7} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) up to $z\sim 11$, thus bridging the properties of $z\sim 6$ quasars to their ancestors. JWST spectroscopic observations of GN-z11, a well-known $z=10.6$ star forming galaxy, have been interpreted with the presence of a super-Eddington (Eddington ratio $\equiv \,\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 5.5$) accreting MBH. To test this hypothesis we use a zoom-in cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and BH co-evolution. We first test the simulation results against the observed probability distribution function (PDF) of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ found in $z\sim 6$ quasars. Then, we select in the simulation those BHs that satisfy the following criteria: (a) $10 < z < 11 $, (b) $M_{\rm BH} > 10^6 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Finally we apply the Extreme Value Statistics to the PDF of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ resulting from the simulation and find that the probability of observing a $z\sim 10-11$ MBH, accreting with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5.5$, in the volume surveyed by JWST, is very low ($<0.5\%$). We compare our predictions with those in the literature and further discuss the main limitations of our work. Our simulation cannot explain the JWST observations of GN-z11. This might be due to (i) missing physics in simulations, or (ii) uncertainties in the data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The warp is a well-known undulation of the Milky Way disc. Its structure has been widely studied, but only since Gaia DR2 has it been possible to reveal its kinematic signature beyond the solar neighbourhood. In this work we present an analysis of the warp traced by Classical Cepheids by means of a Fourier decomposition of their height ($Z$) and, for the first time, of their vertical velocity ($V_z$). We find a clear but complex signal that in both variables reveals an asymmetrical warp. In $Z$ we find the warp to be almost symmetric in amplitude at the disc's outskirts, with the two extremes never being diametrically opposed at any radius and the line of nodes presenting a twist in the direction of stellar rotation for $R>11$ kpc. For $V_z$, in addition to the usual $m=1$ mode, an $m=2$ mode is needed to represent the kinematic signal of the warp, reflecting its azimuthal asymmetry. The line of maximum vertical velocity is similarly twisted as the line of nodes and trails behind by $\approx 25^\circ$. We develop a new formalism to derive the pattern speed and change in amplitude with time $\dot{A}$ of each Fourier mode at each radius, via a joint analysis of the Fourier decomposition in $Z$ and $V_z$. By applying it to the Cepheids we find, for the $m=1$ mode, a constant pattern speed in the direction of stellar rotation of $9.2\pm3.1$ km/s/kpc, a negligible $\dot{A}$ up to $R\approx 14$ kpc and a slight increase at larger radii, in agreement with previous works.
#### 2FHLJ1745.1-3035: A Newly Discovered, Powerful Pulsar Wind Nebula  Candidate

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-epoch, multi-observatory X-ray analysis for 2FHL J1745.1-3035, a newly discovered very high energy Galactic source detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) located in close proximity to the Galactic Center (l=358.5319{\deg}; b=-0.7760{\deg}). The source shows a very hard gamma-ray photon index above 50 GeV, Gamma_gamma=1.2+-0.4, and is found to be a TeV-emitter by the LAT. We conduct a joint XMM-Newton, Chandra and NuSTAR observing campaign, combining archival XMM-Newton observations, to study the X-ray spectral properties of 2FHL J1745.1-3035 over a time-span of over 20 years. The joint X-ray spectrum is best-fitted as a broken power law model with break energy E_b~7 keV: the source is very hard at energies below 10 keV, with photon index Gamma_1~0.6, and significantly softer in the higher energy range measured by NuSTAR with photon index Gamma_2~1.9. We also perform a spatially resolved X-ray analysis with Chandra, finding evidence for marginal extension (up to an angular size r~5 arcsec), a result that supports a compact pulsar wind nebula scenario. Based on the X-ray and gamma-ray properties, 2FHL J1745.1-3035 is a powerful pulsar wind nebula candidate. Given its nature as an extreme TeV emitter, further supported by the detection of a coincident TeV extended source HESS J1745-303, 2FHL J1745.1-3035 is an ideal candidate for a follow-up with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.

 - **Abstract**
 The current standard model of cosmology - the {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model - is appropriately named after its controversial foreign ingredients: a cosmological constant ({\ensuremath{\Lambda}}) that accounts for the recent accelerated expansion of the Universe and cold dark matter needed to explain the formation and dynamics of large scale structures. Together, these form the dark sector, whose nature remains a mystery. After 25 years of withstanding confirmation and support for the {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model, enough to bypass some of its unclear theoretical issues, this paradigm is facing its biggest crisis yet. The rapid advent of technology has brought cosmology to an unprecedented observational era, with increased technical precision and the emergence of independent measures, including probes of phenomena that were thought impossible to detect or even exist, such as the gravitational ripples that propagate in the spacetime. However, such precision has unveiled cracks in the porcelain of {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM, with pieces that seem glued together and difficult to reconcile. Particularly worrying is the apparent lack of compatibility between measurements of the Universe's present expansion rate based on local measurements and those based on phenomena that occurred far in the early Universe and that can only be translated into present quantities through physical propagation under a cosmological model. In this dissertation, we delve into extensions to the standard model that consider alternatives to the mysterious nature of the dark sector and any possible new interactions therein. We analyse these alternative models, hoping to identify measurable observational signatures of extra degrees of freedom in the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 Patchick 99 is a candidate globular cluster located in the direction of the Galactic bulge, with a proper motion almost identical to the field and extreme field star contamination. A recent analysis suggests it is a low-luminosity globular cluster with a population of RR Lyrae stars. We present new spectra of stars in and around Patchick 99, targeting specifically the 3 RR Lyrae stars associated with the cluster as well as the other RR Lyrae stars in the field. A sample of 53 giant stars selected from proper motions and a position on CMD are also observed. The three RR Lyrae stars associated with the cluster have similar radial velocities and distances, and two of the targeted giants also have radial velocities in this velocity regime and [Fe/H] metallicities that are slightly more metal-poor than the field. Therefore, if Patchick 99 is a bonafide globular cluster, it would have a radial velocity of -92+/-10 km s-1, a distance of 6.7+/-0.4 kpc (as determined from the RR Lyrae stars), and an orbit that confines it to the inner bulge.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio interferometers composed of a large array of small antennas posses large fields of view, coupled with high sensitivities. For example, the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT), achieves a gain of up to 2.8 K/Jy across its $>1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of view. This capability significantly enhances the survey speed for pulsars and fast transients. Nevertheless, this also introduces challenges related to the high data rate, reaching a few Tb/s for MeerKAT, and substantial computing power requirements. To handle the large data rate of surveys, we have developed a high-performance single-pulse search software called "TransientX". This software integrates multiple processes into one pipeline, which includes radio frequency interference mitigation, de-dispersion, matched filtering, clustering, and candidate plotting. In TransientX, we have developed an efficient CPU-based de-dispersion implementation using the sub-band de-dispersion algorithm. Additionally, TransientX employs the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to eliminate duplicate candidates, utilizing an efficient implementation based on the kd-tree data structure. We also calculate the signal-to-noise ratio loss resulting from dispersion measure, boxcar width, spectral index and pulse shape mismatches. Remarkably, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio loss resulting from the mismatch between a boxcar-shaped template and a Gaussian-shaped pulse with scattering remains relatively small, at approximately 9%, even when the scattering timescale is 10 times that of the pulse width. Additionally, the S/N decrease resulting from the spectra index mismatch becomes significant with multi-octave receivers. We have benchmarked the individual processes, including de-dispersion, matched filtering, and clustering. TransientX offers the capability for efficient CPU-only real-time single pulse searching.
#### GammaBayes: a Bayesian pipeline for dark matter detection with CTA

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13876
 - **Abstract**
 We present GammaBayes, a Bayesian Python package for dark matter detection with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). GammaBayes takes as input the CTA measurements of gamma rays and a user-specified dark-matter particle model. It outputs the posterior distribution for parameters of the dark-matter model including the velocity-averaged cross section for dark-matter self interactions $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and the dark-matter mass $m_\chi$. It also outputs the Bayesian evidence, which can be used for model selection. We demonstrate GammaBayes using 525 hours of simulated data, corresponding to $10^8$ observed gamma-ray events. The vast majority of this simulated data consists of noise, but $100000$ events arise from the annihilation of scalar singlet dark matter with $m_\chi= 10$ TeV. We recover the dark matter mass within a 95% credible interval of $m_\chi \sim 5.9-11.2$ TeV. Meanwhile, the velocity averaged cross section is constrained to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 1.3-2.3\times10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ (95% credibility). This is equivalent to measuring the number of dark-matter annihilation events to be $N_S \sim 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.2} \times 10^5$. The no-signal hypothesis $\langle \sigma v \rangle=0$ is ruled out with about $5\sigma$ credibility. We discuss how GammaBayes can be extended to include more sophisticated signal and background models and the computational challenges that must be addressed to facilitate these upgrades. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lpin0002/GammaBayes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first high resolution, detailed abundances of 21 elements for giants in the Galactic bulge/bar within $1^\circ$ of the Galactic plane, where high extinction has rendered such studies challenging. Our high S/N and high-resolution, near-infrared spectra of 7 M giants in the inner-bulge, located at ($l,b$)=(0,+1$^{\circ}$), are observed using the IGRINS spectrograph. We report the first multi-chemical study of the inner Galactic bulge, by investigating relative to a robust new Solar Neighborhood sample, the abundance trends of 21 elements, including the relatively difficult to study heavy elements. The elements studied are: F, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Na, Al, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb. We investigate bulge membership of all seven stars using distances and orbital simulations, and find that the most metal-poor star may be a halo interloper. Our investigation shows that the inner-bulge also as close as $1^\circ$ North of the Galactic Center displays a similarity to the inner disk sequence, following the high [$\alpha$/Fe] envelope of the Solar vicinity metal-rich population, though no firm conclusions for a different enrichment history are evident from this sample. We find a small fraction of metal-poor stars (\feh$<-0.5$) but most of our stars are mainly of super-solar metallicity. Fluorine is found to be enhanced at high metallicity compared to the solar neighbourhood, but confirmation with a larger sample is required. We will apply this approach to explore populations of the Nuclear Stellar Disk and the Nuclear Star Cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Violent astrophysical events, including core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, can result in rotating neutron stars with diverse degrees of differential rotation. Oscillation modes of these neutron stars could be excited and emit strong gravitational waves. Detecting these modes may provide information about neutron stars, including their structures and dynamics. Hence, dynamical simulations were employed to construct relations for quantifying the oscillation mode frequency in previous studies. Specifically, linear relations for the frequencies of fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_{F}$ and fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$ were constructed by simulations with the Cowling approximation. Nevertheless, these relations can overestimate $f_{F}$ and underestimate $f_{^2f}$ up to $\sim 30\%$. Furthermore, it has yet to be fully studied how the degree of differential rotation affects $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Here, for the first time, we consider both various degrees of differential rotation $\tilde{A}$ and dynamical spacetime to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Through 2D axisymmetric simulations, we first show that both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ scale almost linearly with the stellar compactness $M/R$ for different values of $\tilde{A}$. We also observe the quasi-linear relations for both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ with the kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ for different $\tilde{A}$ values. Finally, we constructed linear fits that can quantify $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ by $T/|W|$. Consequently, this work presented universal relations for the fundamental modes of rotating neutron stars with differential rotations in dynamical spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Discovered more than 50 years ago, gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains the most puzzling aspect of GRB physics. Its complex and irregular nature should reveal how newborn GRB engines release their energy. In this respect, the possibility that GRB engines could operate as self-organized critical (SOC) systems has been put forward. Here, we present the energy, luminosity, waiting time, and duration distributions of individual pulses of GRBs with known redshift detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). This is the first study of this kind in which selection effects are accounted for. The compatibility of our results with the framework of SOC theory is discussed. We found evidence for an intrinsic break in the power-law models that describe the energy and the luminosity distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters exhibit large day-night temperature contrasts. Their cooler nightsides are thought to host clouds. However, the exact nature of these clouds, their spatial distribution, and their impact on atmospheric dynamics, thermal structure, and spectra is still unclear. We investigate the atmosphere of WASP-43 b, a short period hot Jupiter recently observed with JWST, to understand the radiative and dynamical impact of clouds on the atmospheric circulation and thermal structure. We aim to understand the impact of different kinds of condensates potentially forming in WASP-43 b, with various sizes and atmospheric metallicities. We used a 3D global climate model (GCM) with a new temperature-dependent cloud model that includes radiative feed-backs coupled with hydrodynamical integrations to study the atmospheric properties of WASP-43 b. We produced observables from our simulations and compared them to spectral phase curves from various observations. We show that clouds have a net warming effect, meaning that the greenhouse effect caused by clouds is stronger than the albedo cooling effect. We show that the radiative effect of clouds has various impacts on the dynamical and thermal structure of WASP-43 b. Depending on the type of condensates and their sizes, the radiative-dynamical feedback will modify the horizontal and vertical temperature gradient and reduce the wind speed. For super-solar metallicity atmospheres, fewer clouds form in the atmosphere, leading to a weaker feedback. Comparisons with spectral phase curves observed with HST, Spitzer, and JWST indicate that WASP-43 b s nightside is cloudy and rule out sub-micron Mg2SiO4 cloud particles as the main opacity source. Distinguishing between cloudy solar and cloudy super-solar-metallicity atmospheres is not straightforward, and further observations of both reflected light and thermal emission are needed.
#### Can radial temperature profiles be inferred using NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2)  observations?

 - **Abstract**
 A number of works infer radial temperature profiles of envelopes surrounding young stellar objects using several rotational transitions in a pixel-by-pixel or azimuthally-averaged basis. However, in many cases the assumption that the rotational temperature is constant along the line of sight is made, while this is not the case when a partially resolved envelope, assumed to be spherically symmetric, is used to obtain values of temperature for different projected radii. This kind of analysis (homogeneous analysis) is intrinsically inconsistent. By using a spherical envelope model to interpret NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2) observations, we tested how robust it is to infer radial temperature profiles of an envelope. The temperature and density of the model envelope are power laws of radius, but the density can be flat for an inner central part. The homogeneous analysis was applied to obtain radial temperature profiles, and resulted that for small projected radii, where the optical depth of the lines is high, the homogeneous temperature can be much higher than the actual envelope temperature. In general, for larger projected radii, both the temperature and the temperature power-law index can be underestimated by as much as 40%, and 0.15, respectively. We applied this study to the infrared dark cloud G14.225-0.506 for which the radial temperature profile was previously derived from the dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths and the spectral energy distribution. As expected, the homogeneous analysis underestimated both the temperature and the temperature power-law index.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we present the results from further X-ray and UV observations of the nuclear transient eRASSt J045650.3-203750 (hereafter J0456-20). We detected five repeating X-ray and UV flares from J0456-20, making it one of the most promising repeating partial tidal disruption event (pTDE) candidates. More importantly, we also found rapid changes in the recurrence time $T_\text{recur}$ of the X-ray flares by modelling the long-term X-ray light curve of J0456-20. $T_\text{recur}$ first decreased rapidly from about 300 days to around 230 days. It continued to decrease to around 190 days with an indication of a constant $T_\text{recur}$ evidenced from the latest three cycles. Our hydrodynamic simulations suggest that, in the repeating pTDE scenario, such rapid evolution of $T_\text{recur}$ could be reproduced if the original star is a $1~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ main-sequence star near the terminal age and loses nearly 80-90% of its mass during the initial encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass around $10^5~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The inferred mass loss of 0.8-0.9 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ is higher than the estimated value of around 0.12 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ from observation, which could be explained if the radiation efficiency is low (i.e. $\ll0.1$). Our results indicate that repeating pTDEs could be effective tools to explore the dynamics around supermassive black holes beyond our own Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 In June 2015, Cassini high-resolution images of Saturn's limb southwards of the planet's hexagonal wave revealed a system of at least six stacked haze layers above the upper cloud deck. Here, we characterize those haze layers and discuss their nature. Vertical thickness of layers ranged from 7 to 18 km, and they extended in altitude approx 130 km, from pressure level 0.5 bar to 0.01 bar. Above them, a thin but extended aerosol layer reached altitude approx 340 km (0.4 mbar). Radiative transfer modeling of spectral reflectivity shows that haze properties are consistent with particles of diameter 0.07- 1.4 \{mu}m and number density 100 - 500 cm -3. The nature of the hazes is compatible with their formation by condensation of hydrocarbon ices, including acetylene and benzene at higher altitudes. Their vertical distribution could be due to upward propagating gravity waves generated by dynamical forcing by the hexagon and its associated eastward jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The CM chondrites are characterized as primary accretionary rocks which originate from primitive water-rich asteroids formed during the early Solar System. Here, we study the mineralogy and organic characteristics of right CM and one ungrouped chondrite to better understand their alteration history; Queen Alexandra Range 93005 (QUE 93005), Murchison, LaPaz Icefield 02333 (LAP 02333), Miller Range (MIL 13005), Mackay Glacier 05231 (MCY 05231), Northwest Africa 8534 (NWA 8534), Northwest Africa 3340 (NWA 3340), Yamato 86695 (Y-86695), and the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Belgica 7904 (B-7904). Raman spectroscopy has been employed to detect the presence of organic carbon in the samples, specifically through the G band at approximately 1580 cm-1 and D band at around 1350 cm-1. The properties of organic matter in meteorites serve as valuable indicators for characterizing the structure and crystallinity of carbonaceous materials and estimating their thermal metamorphism degree. The R1 parameter, defined as the peak height ratio of the D and G bands, provides a quantifiable measure of this structural organization. Raman spectra are used to show the general mineralogy, thermal history and heating stage of CM and ungrouped chondrites. X-ray diffraction patterns further indicate the mineralogical compositions of the samples. Visible to near-infrared (VNIR) and attenuated total reflection (ATR) reflectance spectra illustrate the trends related to their mineralogy and furthermore infer aqueous alteration, thermal history of CM carbonaceous chondrites, formation and evolution of their parent bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Frequentist profile likelihoods have seen a resurgence in cosmology, offering an alternative to Bayesian methods as they can circumvent the impact of prior-volume effects. This paper presents Procoli, a fast and accessible package to obtain profile likelihoods in cosmology, available on GitHub and PyPI. Procoli seamlessly integrates with MontePython, incorporating all its available data likelihoods, as well as any modified versions of CLASS. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Procoli code, detailing the simulated-annealing optimizer at its core and the sequential computation of the profile. An an example, we use the early dark energy model which is afflicted by prior-volume effects to illustrate the code's features. We validate its optimizer with mock data, and compare optimization techniques for both the global minimum and the profile. Procoli further enables splitting profiles into their component contributions from individual experiments, offering nuanced insights into the data and model. As a valuable addition to the cosmologist's toolkit, Procoli supplements existing Bayesian codes, contributing to more robust parameter constraints in cosmological studies.
#### Velocity acoustic oscillations on Cosmic Dawn 21 cm power spectrum as a  probe of small-scale density fluctuations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the feasibility of using the velocity acoustic oscillations (VAO) features on the Cosmic Dawn 21 cm power spectrum to probe small-scale density fluctuations. In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, Pop III stars form in minihalos and affect the 21 cm signal through Ly$\alpha$ and X-ray radiation. Such a process is modulated by the relative motion between dark matter and baryons, generating the VAO wiggles on the 21 cm power spectrum. In the fuzzy or warm dark matter models for which the number of minihalos is reduced, the VAO wiggles are weaker or even fully invisible. We investigate the wiggle features in the CDM with different astrophysical models and in different dark matter models. We find: 1) In the CDM model the relative streaming velocities can generate the VAO wiggles for broad ranges of parameters $f_*$, $\zeta_X$ and $f_{\rm esc,LW}\zeta_{\rm LW}$, though for different parameters the wiggles would appear at different redshifts and have different amplitudes. 2) For the axion model with $m_{\rm a} \lesssim10^{-19}$ eV, the VAO wiggles are negligible. In the mixed model, the VAO signal is sensitive to the axion fraction. For example, the wiggles almost disappear when $f_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10\%$ for $m_{\rm a}=10^{-21}$ eV. Therefore, the VAO signal can be an effective indicator for small-scale density fluctuations and a useful probe of the nature of dark matter. The SKA-low with $\sim$2000 hour observation time has the ability to detect the VAO signal and constraint dark matter models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The detection of NH2CH2CH2OH (ethanolamine) in molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 adds an additional player to the prebiotic molecules discovered so far in the interstellar medium (ISM). As this molecule might be formed through condensed-phase hydrogenation steps, detecting one or more of the molecules involved might help to elucidate the chemical pathway leading to its production. Aims. The chemical path involves the formation of four chemical species. In this work, we study the energies of the isomers involved, indicate the best candidates for detection purposes, and provide the distortion constants of the most energetically favoured isomers undetected so far. Methods. We used highly accurate CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pCVTZ-F12 computations to predict the lowest energy isomers as well as their spectroscopic constants, taking corrections for core electron correlation and scalar relativity into account. Results. We studied 14 isomers. We find that the lowest energy isomer proposed in previous studies is not the actual minimum. We provide a set of rotational and distortion constants of the two new most stable isomers together with their fundamental vibrational frequencies in order to guide the search for these important astrochemical precursors of prebiotic molecules in the ISM.
#### Circumbinary discs for stellar population models

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a rapid algorithm for the evolution of stable, circular, circumbinary discs suitable for parameter estimation and population synthesis modelling. Our model includes disc mass and angular momentum changes, accretion on to the binary stars, and binary orbital eccentricity pumping. We fit our model to the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) circumbinary disc around IRAS 08544-4431, finding reasonable agreement despite the simplicity of our model. Our best-fitting disc has a mass of about $0.01\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ and angular momentum $2.7\times 10^{52}\, \mathrm{g}\, \mathrm{cm}^{2}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\simeq 9 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot }\, \mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{au}$, corresponding to 0.0079 and 0.16 of the common-envelope mass and angular momentum, respectively. The best-fitting disc viscosity is $\alpha _\mathrm{disc} = 5 \times 10^{-3}$ and our tidal torque algorithm can be constrained such that the inner edge of the disc $R_{\mathrm{in}}\sim 2a$. The inner binary eccentricity reaches about 0.13 in our best-fitting model of IRAS 08544-4431, short of the observed 0.22. The circumbinary disc evaporates quickly when the post-AGB star reaches a temperature of $\sim \! 6\times 10^4\, \mathrm{K}$, suggesting that planetismals must form in the disc in about $10^{4}\, \mathrm{yr}$ if secondary planet formation is to occur, while accretion from the disc on to the stars at about 10 times the inner-edge viscous rate can double the disc lifetime.
#### Ultrashort-period WD binaries are not undergoing strong tidal heating

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf (WD) binaries are increasingly being discovered at short orbital periods where strong tidal effects and significant tidal heating signatures may occur. We assume the tidal potential of the companion excites outgoing gravity waves within the WD primary, the dissipation of which leads to an increase in the WD's surface temperature. We compute the excitation and dissipation of the waves in cooling WD models in evolving MESA binary simulations. Tidal heating is self-consistently computed and added to the models at every time step. As a binary inspirals to orbital periods less than $\sim$20 minutes, the WD's behavior changes from cooling to heating, with temperature enhancements that can exceed 10,000 K compared with non-tidally heated models. We compare a grid of tidally heated WD models to observed short-period systems with hot WD primaries. While tidal heating affects their $T_{\rm eff}$, it is likely not the dominant luminosity. Instead these WDs are probably intrinsically young and hot, implying the binaries formed at short orbital periods. The binaries are consistent with undergoing common envelope evolution with a somewhat low efficiency $\alpha_{\rm CE}$. We delineate the parameter space where the traveling wave assumption is most valid, noting that it breaks down for WDs that cool sufficiently, where standing waves may instead be formed.
#### Small-scale radio jets and tidal disruption events: A theory of  high-luminosity compact symmetric objects

 - **Abstract**
 Double lobe radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei represent one of the longest studied groups in radio astronomy. A particular sub-group of double radio sources comprises the compact symmetric objects (CSOs). CSOs are distinguished by their prominent double structure and sub-kpc total size. It has been argued that the vast majority of high-luminosity CSOs (CSO 2s) represent a distinct class of active galactic nuclei with its own morphological structure and life-cycle. In this work, we present theoretical considerations regarding CSO 2s. We develop a semi-analytic evolutionary model, inspired by the results of large-scale numerical simulations of relativistic jets, that reproduces the features of the radio source population. We show that CSO 2s may be generated by finite energy injections and propose stellar tidal disruption events as a possible cause. We find that tidal disruption events of giant branch stars with masses $\gtrsim1$ M$_\odot$ can fuel these sources and discuss possible approaches to confirming this hypothesis. We predict that if the tidal disruption scenario holds, CSO 2s with sizes less than 400 pc should outnumber larger sources by more than a factor of $10$. Our results motivate future numerical studies to determine whether the scenarios we consider for fueling and source evolution can explain the observed radio morphologies. Multiwavelength observational campaigns directed at these sources will also provide critical insight into the origins of these objects, their environments, and their lifespans.
