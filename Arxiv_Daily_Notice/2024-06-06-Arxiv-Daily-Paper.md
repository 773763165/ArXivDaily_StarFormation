#### Title:
          Progenitor with small reaction networks should not be used as initial conditions for core collapse

 - **Abstract**
 Core collapse initial conditions are a bottleneck in understanding the explosion mechanism(s) of massive stars. Stellar evolution codes struggle after carbon burning, and either stop or adopt numerical simplifications missing crucial physics. The use of small nuclear reaction networks (NRN) that account for energy production but bypass weak reactions is typical, but insufficient to study the dynamics of the collapse. We advise against the use of progenitors computed with small NRN in expensive multi-dimensional simulations of core collapse, bounce, (jet formation), and explosion.

          Nuclear Data to Quantify Urca Cooling in Accreting Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) can accrete matter onto their surface from the companion star. Transiently accreting neutron stars go through alternating phases of active accretion outbursts and quiescence. X-ray observations during the quiescence phase show a drop in X-ray luminosity with the time in quiescence. This is also inferred as the drop in surface temperature or the cooling of accreting neutron stars in quiescence. Analyzing these cooling curves reveals a great deal of information about the structure and composition of neutron stars. However, model-observation comparisons of such cooling curves are challenging - partly due to observational uncertainties, and partly due to incomplete knowledge of heating mechanisms during accretion outbursts. This situation is further exacerbated by the recent discovery of Urca cooling in the neutron star crust. These are cycles that alternate between electron-capture and beta-decay to produce a large flux of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. These freely stream out of the star and carry energy with them, essentially cooling the neutron star crust without changing the composition. As a result, it is necessary to accurately quantify the strength of Urca cooling to constrain the heat sources in neutron star crusts and facilitate better model-observation comparisons of the cooling curves.

 - **Abstract**
 Realization of the stationary integral solutions of steady state transonic accretion flow in spherical symmetry helps to understand accretion phenomena on various astrophysical objects. In recent years, attempts have been made to study accreting black hole systems as an example of autonomous dynamical systems. The fixed point analysis is used to study the transonic properties of accretion flow onto an astrophysical black hole, hence the nature of the phase orbits for the transonic flow solutions can be understood without constructing the integral solutions. Since a large-scale astrophysical fluid flow is vulnerable to external perturbation, one needs to ensure that the stationary accretion solutions are stable under perturbation. By adopting a time-dependent stability analysis scheme for the accretion flow, one demonstrates under which condition the perturbation will not diverge. It has also been observed that a space-time metric, dubbed the sonic metric, can be constructed to describe the propagation of the perturbation embedded within the accreting fluid, which mimics a black hole like spacetime within the accreting fluid, where the transonic surfaces can be identified with a black hole like horizons. Such identification is accomplished using the theory of causal structure - by constructing Carter-Penrose diagrams. An accreting black hole system, thus, can be perceived as a classical analogue gravity model naturally found in the universe. Hence, accretion phenomena onto astrophysical black holes can be looked upon from three apparently non-overlapping perspectives - astrophysical processes, theory of dynamical systems, and emergent gravity (alternatively, the analogue gravity) phenomena, respectively. The present article illustrates, by taking the simplest possible accretion flow model, how one can study astrophysical accretion processes from the aforementioned perspectives (Abridged).

          The near-infrared degree of polarization in debris disks. Toward a self-consistent approach to model scattered light observations

 - **Abstract**
 Debris disks give us the unique opportunity to probe the properties of small $\mu$m-sized particles, allowing us to peer into the constituents of their parent bodies, young analogs of comets and asteroids of our solar system. In the past, studies of the total intensity phase function have proven powerful to constrain the main characteristics of the dust particles in debris disks. Nonetheless, there can remain some degeneracies in the modeling that can be alleviated when considering polarized intensity observations. We obtained new near-IR scattered light observations of four young debris disks which allow us to constrain the degree of linear polarization as a function of the scattering angle. All four debris disks are detected in polarized intensity, and three are also recovered in total intensity. We measured peak degree of polarization of $\lesssim 40$\% for all three disks. We find that the particles must consist of highly refractive and absorbing material. For HD129590, by measuring the polarization fraction beyond the birth ring, we constrain the width of the size distribution to be smaller and smaller, compatible with the effect of radiation pressure. We put these findings to the test and present a self-consistent approach to produce synthetic images, assuming different profiles for the radiation pressure strength, and accounting for the presence of unbound grains. We find the contribution of these grains to be especially critical to reproduce the increasing degree of polarization with stellocentric distances. Some of our results might seem difficult to reconcile with our understanding of cosmic dust but since similar results have been obtained for other disks, we discuss the current limitation of available light scattering models as well as possible avenues to alleviate these unfortunate limitations.

          TDCOSMO. XVII. Measurement of the Hubble Constant from the Lensed Quasar WGD$\,$2038$-$4008

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay cosmography is a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The TDCOSMO collaboration is performing an ongoing analysis of lensed quasars to constrain cosmology using this method. In this work, we obtain constraints from the lensed quasar~WGD$\,$2038$-$4008~using new time-delay measurements and previous mass models by TDCOSMO. This is the first TDCOSMO lens to incorporate multiple lens modeling codes and the full time-delay covariance matrix into the cosmological inference. The models are fixed before the time delay is measured, and the analysis is performed blinded with respect to the cosmological parameters to prevent unconscious experimenter bias. We obtain $D_{\Delta t} = 1.68^{+0.40}_{-0.38}$ Gpc using two families of mass models, a power-law describing the total mass distribution, and a composite model of baryons and dark matter, although the composite model is disfavored due to kinematics constraints. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we constrain the Hubble constant to be $H_{0} = 65^{+23}_{-14}\, \rm km\ s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. The dominant source of uncertainty comes from the time delays, due to the low variability of the quasar. Future long-term monitoring, especially in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, could catch stronger quasar variability and further reduce the uncertainties. This system will be incorporated into an upcoming hierarchical analysis of the entire TDCOSMO sample, and improved time delays and spatially-resolved stellar kinematics could strengthen the constraints from this system in the future.

          Using CSST and ejecta-wind interaction in type II-P supernovae to constrain the wind-mass loss of red supergiant stars

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of H-rich, type II-plateau supernova (SN II-P) progenitors remain uncertain, and this is primarily due to the complexities associated with red supergiant (RSG) wind-mass loss. Recent studies have suggested that the interaction of the ejecta with a standard RSG wind should produce unambiguous signatures in the optical (e.g., a broad, boxy H${\alpha}$ profile) and in the UV (especially Ly ${\alpha}$ and Mg ii ${\lambda}{\lambda}$ 2795, 2802) a few years following the explosion. Such features are expected to be generic in all SNe II-P and can be utilized to constrain RSG winds. Here, we investigate the possibility of detecting late-time (0.3-10 years since explosion) SNe II-P in the NUV with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). Convolving the existing model spectra of ejecta-wind interactions in SNe II-P with the transmission functions of the CSST, we calculated the associated multiband light curves, in particular, the NUV (255 nm${\sim}$317 nm) band, as well as the $NUV-r$ color. We find that the CSST will be able to detect the NUV radiation associated with ejecta-wind interaction for hundreds SNe II-P out to a few hundred Mpc over its ten-year main sky survey. The CSST will therefore provide a sizable sample of SNe II-P with the NUV signatures of ejecta-wind interaction. This will be helpful for understanding the mass loss history of SN II-P progenitors and their origins.

          Geometric reheating of the Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We study the post-inflationary energy transfer from the inflaton ($\phi$) into a scalar field ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity through $\xi R|\chi|^2$, considering models with inflaton potential $V_{\rm inf} \propto |\phi|^{\,p}$ around $\phi = 0$. This corresponds to the paradigm of {\it geometric preheating}, which we extend to its non-linear regime via lattice simulations. Considering $\alpha$-attractor T-model potentials as a proxy, we study the viability of proper {\it reheating} for $p=2, 4, 6$, determining whether radiation domination (RD) due to energetic dominance of $\chi$ over $\phi$, can be achieved. For large inflationary scales $\Lambda$, reheating is frustrated for $p = 2$, it can be partially achieved for $p = 4$, and it becomes very efficient for $p = 6$. Efficient reheating can be however blocked if $\chi$ sustains self-interactions (unless these are extremely feeble), or if $\Lambda$ is low enough, so that inflaton fragmentation brings the universe rapidly into RD. Whenever RD is achieved, either due to reheating or to inflaton fragmentation, we characterize the energy and time scales of the problem, as a function of $\Lambda$ and $\xi$.

          The R-Process Alliance: 2MASS J22132050-5137385, the Star with the Highest-known r-process Enhancement at [Eu/Fe] = +2.45

 - **Abstract**
 We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.20 +- 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050-5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 +- 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 +- 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 10^6 M_sun and a 1 percent metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only ~ 600 M_sun.

 - **Abstract**
 \textit{LiteBIRD}, the next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, aims for a launch in Japan's fiscal year 2032, marking a major advancement in the exploration of primordial cosmology and fundamental physics. Orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2, this JAXA-led strategic L-class mission will conduct a comprehensive mapping of the CMB polarization across the entire sky. During its 3-year mission, \textit{LiteBIRD} will employ three telescopes within 15 unique frequency bands (ranging from 34 through 448 GHz), targeting a sensitivity of 2.2\,$\mu$K-arcmin and a resolution of 0.5$^\circ$ at 100\,GHz. Its primary goal is to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with an uncertainty $\delta r = 0.001$, including systematic errors and margin. If $r \geq 0.01$, \textit{LiteBIRD} expects to achieve a $>5\sigma$ detection in the $\ell=$2-10 and $\ell=$11-200 ranges separately, providing crucial insight into the early Universe. We describe \textit{LiteBIRD}'s scientific objectives, the application of systems engineering to mission requirements, the anticipated scientific impact, and the operations and scanning strategies vital to minimizing systematic effects. We will also highlight \textit{LiteBIRD}'s synergies with concurrent CMB projects.

          Warped Disk Evolution in Grid-Based Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Observations show evidence that a significant fraction of protoplanetary disks contain warps. A warp in a disk evolves in time affecting the appearance of shadows and greatly influencing kinematic signatures. So far, many theoretical studies of warped disks have been conducted using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. In our approach, we use a grid-based method in spherical coordinates which has notable advantages: the method allows for accurate modelling of low viscosity values and the resolution does not depend on density or mass of the disk, which allows surface structures to be resolved. We perform 3D simulations using FARGO3D to simulate the evolution of a warped disk and compare the results to one-dimensional models using a ring code. Additionally, we extensively investigate the applicability of grid-based methods to misaligned disks and test their dependency on grid resolution as well as disk viscosity. We find that grid-based simulations are capable of simulating disks not aligned to the grid geometry. Our three-dimensional simulation of a warped disk compares well to one-dimensional models in evolution of inclination. However, we find a twist which is not captured in 1D models. After thorough analysis we suspect this to be a physical effect possibly caused by non-linear effects neglected in the one-dimensional equations. Evaluating the internal dynamics, we find sloshing and breathing motions as predicted in local shearing box analysis. They can become supersonic, which may have consequences on kinematic observations of warped disks. Warped disks can be accurately modelled in 3D grid-based simulations when using reasonably good resolution, especially in the $\theta$-direction. We find good agreement with the linear approximation of the sloshing motion which highlights the reliability of 1D models.

          Spectro-Photometry and Radial Distribution of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters from Gaia XP Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) represents a challenge for stellar population studies. Nevertheless, the outermost GC regions, which may retain information of the initial configuration of the multiple populations, are poorly studied. We use synthetic spectra that account for the chemical compositions of first- and second-population (1P, 2P) stars of 47 Tucanae to identify the spectral regions that are sensitive to its multiple populations. Hence, we defined new photometric bands that are efficient to disentangle 1P and 2P giant stars from Gaia XP spectra. To test these new filters, we constructed the pseudo two-color diagrams dubbed chromosome maps (ChMs) and identified for the first time, 1P and 2P stars in the outermost cluster regions of 47 Tucanae and outside the tidal radius. We constructed similar diagrams for NGC3201, NGC6121, NGC6752, and NGC6397, thus exploring GCs with different metallicities. The ChMs allowed us to clearly disentangle 1P and 2P stars in the external regions of all clusters, with the exception of the metal-poor NGC6397. Our findings, together with literature results from more-internal regions, show that the 2P stars of 47 Tucanae and NGC 3201 are more-centrally concentrated than the 1P, whereas the multiple populations of NGC 6121, and NGC 6752 share the same radial distributions. These radial behaviors are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where 2P stars originate in the central regions. Noticeably, results on NGC 3201 are in tension with the conclusion from recent work that its 1P is more centrally concentrated than the 2P and might form with more central concentration.

          Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep Generative Image Priors

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries in the Kuiper Belt are common. Here we present our analysis of the Solar System Origins Legacy Survey (SSOLS) to show that using a PSF-fitting method can roughly double the number of binaries identified in that dataset. Out of 198 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) observed by SSOLS, we find 23 to be visually separated binaries, while a further 19 are blended-PSF binaries detectable with the method we present here. This is an overall binary fraction of 21% for the SSOLS dataset of cold classical KBOs. In addition, we tested our fitting methods on synthetic data, and while we were able to show it to be very effective at detecting certain blended-PSF binary KBOs, fainter or closer binary KBOs may easily be missed, suggesting that the close binary KBO fraction could be even higher. These results strongly support the idea that most (if not all) KBOs were formed through the Streaming Instability process, and as a consequence, most KBOs were formed as near-equal mass binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first fluorine measurements in 12 normal giants belonging to the Galactic thin and thick disks using spectra obtained with the Phoenix infrared spectrometer on the 2.1m telescope at Kitt Peak. Abundances are determined from the (1-0) R9 2.3358 micron feature of the molecule HF. Additionally, sodium abundances are derived in 25 giants in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo using the Na I line at 2.3379 microns. We report fluorine abundances for thin and thick disk stars in the metallicity range -0.7 < [Fe/H] < 0. We add two abundance measurements for stars with [Fe/H] < 0.5 dex which are at a critical metallicity range to constrain models. We find a larger dispersion in fluorine abundances than sodium abundances despite both species having similar overall uncertainties due to atmospheric parameters, suggesting this dispersion is real and not observational. The dispersion is slightly larger in the thick disk than the thin. The thin and thick disk average [F/Fe] for our sample of stars combined with the literature differ by 0.03 dex. The observations are compared to available chemical evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the importance of precise modelling of the photometric redshift error distributions on the estimation of parameters from cross correlation measurements and present a working example of the scattering matrix formalism to correct for the redshift bin mismatch of objects in tomographic cross correlation analysis. We measured the angular galaxy auto-power spectrum and cross-power spectrum in four tomographic bins with redshift intervals $z = [0.0,0.3,0.45,0.6,0.8]$ from the cross correlation of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background lensing potential and photometric galaxy catalogue from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release 8. We estimated galaxy linear bias and amplitude of cross correlation using maximum likelihood estimation to put constraints on the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter. We show that the modified Lorentzian function used to fit the photometric redshift error distribution performs well only near the peaks of the distribution. We adopt a sum of Gaussians model to capture the broad tails of the error distribution. Our sum of Gaussians model yields $\sim 2-5\,\sigma$ smaller values of cross correlation amplitude compared to the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We compute the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter after correcting for the redshift bin mismatch of objects following the scattering matrix approach. The $\sigma_{8}$ parameter becomes consistent with $\Lambda$CDM model in the last tomographic bin but shows $\sim 1-3\,\sigma$ tension in other redshift bins.

          Investigation of boulder distribution in (1) Ceres and insight into its surface evolution

 - **Abstract**
 The surface conditions of terrestrial bodies strongly reflect their geological evolutionary processes and vary among various terrestrial bodies. This diversity is attributed to variations in the timescales of boulder formation through processes such as impact cratering, rockfalls from crater walls, seismic motion, and boulder fragmentation caused by micrometeoroid impacts and thermal stress. In this study, we examined boulders on Ceres using high-resolution images with a resolution of approximately 5 m/px obtained during the Ceres Extended Mission 2 Orbit 7 of the Dawn mission. Almost all boulders were present around impact craters, even at a resolution of 5 m/px, thus indicating that the boulders on Ceres were created by impact cratering alone. The maximum boulder size on Ceres is approximately 200 m, even around large craters, which may indicate the upper size limit determined by the mechanical strength of the boulders, such as the tensile strength, the scale effect, and/or shattering strength. The slope of the size-frequency distribution of boulders on Ceres varied significantly across the range of boulder sizes, thus making it difficult to describe it using a single function of a power-law relationship; in particular, it changed at approximately 100 m, thus indicating that destructive or formation mechanisms may be different for large boulders > 100 m and for small boulders < 100 m. There may also be a subsurface structure that prevents the formation of small boulders, although this is difficult to argue conclusively. We estimated that the lifetime of boulders larger than 50 m was equivalent to or shorter than 100 Myr. This lifetime is consistent with a theoretical estimation assuming that micrometeoroid impacts are the primary destructive mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the slopes between DESI $g,r$ and IRAS 100 $\mu m$ intensities, specifically $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$, we have constructed a substantial sample of Galactic cirri. This sample covers 561.25 deg$^2$ at high Galactic latitudes (|b| $\geq$ 30$^{\circ}$), allowing for a systematic study of the physical parameters of the Galactic cirrus on a large scale, such as $g-r$ color, dust temperature, asymmetry factor and albedo. The ratio of $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$ is consistent with the diffuse Galactic starlight model, suggesting that the diffuse starlight within our own Galaxy serves as the primary illumination source for the cirrus. Both $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$ decrease slowly with increasing Galactic latitudes and IRAS 100 $\mu m$ intensities, while they do not have a correlation with Galactic longitudes. The distribution of $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$ confirms a significant scatter in the slopes, reaching a factor of 4-5. Such large scatter cannot be explained by the weak correlation between the slopes and Galactic latitudes and IRAS 100 $\mu m$ intensities. Instead, it is attributed to substantial variations in the intrinsic properties of the dust, e.g., asymmetry factor and albedo. We propose that the properties of dust particles play a critical role in the observed scatter in slopes, making them the primary contributing factors. Moreover, the variations in dust properties within the cirrus are localized rather than exhibiting large-scale gradients.

 - **Abstract**
 The development of detectors with a high time resolution has been pivotal to our comprehension of neutron stars and the accurate measurement of their properties. While high-time resolution astronomy has become a standard in the radio and the high-/very-high-energy bands, progress in the visible band has been comparatively much slower. SiFAP2 is a high-speed optical photometer mounted at the INAF Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Its potential emerged with the discovery of the first two optical millisecond pulsars: these are among the most efficient particle accelerators and natural laboratories of fundamental physics. Optical millisecond pulsations challenge the standard pulsar paradigm, requiring innovative solutions. Higher photon counting statistics of optical telescopes, compared to high-energy instruments, attain unprecedented sensitivity for weak pulsed signals from bright accreting neutron stars, which are the best candidates for still undetected continuous gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting binary systems are relatively unexplored compared to those around single stars. Detections of circumbinary planets and planetary systems offer a first detailed view into our understanding of circumbinary planet formation and dynamical evolution. The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted by Orbiting Planets) radial velocity survey plays a special role in this adventure as it focuses on eclipsing single-lined binaries with an FGK dwarf primary and M dwarf secondary allowing for the highest-radial velocity precision using the HARPS and SOPHIE spectrographs. We obtained 4512 high-resolution spectra for the 179 targets in the BEBOP survey which we used to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters using both equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. We furthermore derive stellar masses, radii, and ages for all targets. With this work, we present the first homogeneous catalogue of precise stellar parameters for these eclipsing single-lined binaries.

          Primordial black holes: the asteroid mass window

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are an attractive dark matter candidate, particularly if they can explain the totality of it. At PBH masses below $\sim 10^{17}$g and above $\sim 10^{23}$g this possibility is excluded from the variety of arguments and with different confidence. The range in between, often referred to as the "asteroid mass window", currently remains unconstrained. The most promising, in our view, way to probe this mass range is to use stars as the PBH detectors. If a star captures even a single PBH it starts being accreted onto it and eventually gets destroyed -- converted into a sub-solar mass black hole. This process may have a variety of signatures form a mere star disappearance to supernova-type explosions of a new kind. The viability of this approach depends crucially on the probability of PBH capture by stars. In this chapter we summarize the existing capture mechanisms and discuss their implications for constraining the abundance of (or perhaps discovering) PBHs in the asteroid mass window.

 - **Abstract**
 Herschel operated as an observatory, therefore it did not cover the whole sky, but still observed ~8% of it. The first version of an overall Herschel/PACS Point Source Catalogue was released in 2017. The data are still unique and are very important for research, especially because no new far-infrared mission is foreseen for at least the next decade. In the framework of the NEMESIS project, we revisited all the photometric observations obtained by the PACS instrument on-board of the Herschel space observatory. We aimed to build the most complete and most accurate Herschel/PACS catalogue to date. Our primary goal was to increase the number of real sources, and decrease the number of spurious sources identified on a strongly variable background. Our goal was to build a blind catalogue, meaning that source extraction is conducted without relying on prior detections at various wavelengths, allowing us to detect sources never catalogued before. We define a hybrid strategy that includes classical and ML source identification and characterisation methods, providing catalogues at much higher completeness levels than before. Quality assessment also involves ML techniques. Our source extraction methodology facilitates a systematic and impartial comparison of sensitivity levels across various Herschel fields, a task that was typically beyond the scope of individual programs. We created a high-reliability and a rejected source catalogue for each PACS passband, i.e., at 70, 100, and 160 {\mu}m. With the high-reliability catalogue, we managed to significantly increase the completeness in all bands. At the same time, while the number of high-reliability detections decreased, the number of sources matching with existing catalogues increased, suggesting that the purity is also higher than before. The photometric accuracy of our pipeline is ~1% based on comparison with the standard star models.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.

          Novel Atmospheric Dynamics Shape Inner Edge of Habitable Zone Around White Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around M-dwarfs. Unlike planets around M-dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to several days. Here we use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model (GCM) to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods ($P\lesssim$1 day) enter a ``bat rotation" regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface's hottest regions from the equator towards the midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase dayside cloud cover and decrease stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by $\sim$50\% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.

          A case study of gas impacted by black-hole jets with the JWST: outflows, bow shocks, and high excitation of the gas in the galaxy IC5063

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner ~3x2 kpc^2 of the galaxy IC5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path, and the stability conditions of clouds were known to vary because of these outflows. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than ten discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, T_ex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, T_ex is more than 100K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.

          A comprehensive analysis toward the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1846.9-0227 -- Jets of a proto-planetary nebula producing gamma-rays?

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the gamma-ray sources in the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog are associated with pulsars and blazars. However, unveiling the nature of the still unassociated gamma-ray sources is important for the understanding of high energy emission mechanisms in astrophysical objects. This work presents a comprehensive study toward the region covered by the Fermi source 4FGL J1846.9$-$0227 previously suggested to be a blazar or a massive protostar. Using multiwavelength observations, we analyzed several astrophysical objects in the region as possible counterparts of the Fermi-LAT source. Having discarded most of them after a comprehensive analysis, we suggest that the most likely candidate to be such a counterpart is IRAS 18443$-$0231. We discovered that this source, previously cataloged as a planetary nebula candidate, actually is a proto-planetary nebula. The radio continuum image at 3 GHz associated with such a nebula allowed us to identify a jet-like structure. Additionally, we identified an associated red-shifted CO molecular outflow and a dense molecular clump in which the source is embedded. We obtained a radio spectral index of $-0.47 \pm 0.08$ for the source, indicating syncrothron emission due to accelerated particles. Thus, we suggest that processes such as proton-proton collisions and relativistic Bremsstrahlung are likely to occur. IRAS 18443$-$0231, lying almost at the center of the Fermi confidence ellipse and related to the hard X-ray source 4XMM J184700.4$-$022752, would be the first association between a proto-planeatry nebula and gamma emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The spins of binary black holes (BBHs) measured from gravitational waves carry notable information of the formation pathways. Here we propose a quantity "dimensionless net spin" ($\chi_{\rm N}$), which is related to the sum of angular momentum of component black holes in the system, to provide a novel perspective to study the origin(s) of BBHs. By performing hierarchical Bayesian inference on $\chi_{\rm N}$, we find strong evidence that the marginal distribution of this quantity can be better fitted by two Gaussian components rather than one: there is a narrow peak at $\chi_{\rm N} \sim 0.15$ and another extended peak at $\chi_{\rm N} \sim 0.47$. We also find that the rapidly spinning systems likely dominate the high-mass end of the population and they evolve with redshift much quicker. These findings bring new challenges to the field binary scenario, and suggest that dynamical process should plays a key role in forming high total mass BBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are among the first celestial objects catalogued by early astronomers. As simple and coeval populations, their study has been instrumental in charting the properties of the Milky Way and providing insight into stellar evolution through the 20th century. Clusters were traditionally spotted as local stellar overdensities in the plane of the sky. In recent decades, for a limited number of nearby clusters, it became possible to identify cluster members through their clustering in proper motion space. With its astrometric data of unprecedented precision, the Gaia mission has completely revolutionised our ability to discover and characterise Milky Way star clusters, to map their large-scale distribution, and to investigate their internal structure. In this review we focus on the population of open clusters, residing in the Galactic disc. We summarise the current state of the Gaia-updated cluster census and studies of young clusters and associations. We discuss recent developments in techniques for cluster detection and age estimation. We also review results enabled by Gaia data concerning the dynamical evolution of gravitationally bound clusters and their stellar inventory.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of high-energy gamma-ray emission towards the G305 star-forming region. Using almost 15 years of observation data from {\sl Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we detected an extended gamma-ray source in this region with a significance of $\sim 13 \sigma$. The gamma-ray radiation reveals a clear pion-bump feature and can be fitted with the power law parent proton spectrum with an index of $-2.5$. The total cosmic ray (CR) proton energy in the gamma-ray production region is estimated to be the order of $10^{49}\ \rm erg$. We further derived the CR radial distribution from both the gamma-ray emission and gas distribution and found it roughly obeys the $1/r$ type profile, which is consistent with other similar systems and expected from the continuous injection of CRs by the central powerful young massive star cluster Danks 1 or Danks 2 in this region. Together with former detections of similar gamma-ray structures, such as Cygnus cocoon, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and W40, the detection supports the hypothesis that young massive star clusters are CR accelerators.

 - **Abstract**
 Stage IV dark energy surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid present a unique opportunity to shed light on the nature of dark energy. However, the full constraining power of the new data cannot be unlocked unless accurate predictions are available at all observable scales. Currently, only the linear regime is well understood in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: on the nonlinear scales, expensive numerical simulations become necessary, making their direct use impractical in the analyses of large datasets. Recently, machine learning techniques have shown potential to break this impasse: by training emulators, we can reproduce complex data fields in a fraction of the time it takes to produce them. In this work, we present a field-level emulator capable of turning a $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation into one evolved under $f(R)$ gravity. To achieve this, we build on the map2map neural network, using the strength of modified gravity $|f_{R_0}|$ as style parameter. We find that our emulator correctly estimates the changes it needs to apply to the positions and velocities of the input N-body particles to produce the target simulation. We test the performance of our network against several summary statistics, finding $1\%$ agreement in the power spectrum up to $k \sim 1$ $h/$Mpc, and $1.5\%$ agreement against the independent boost emulator eMantis. Although the algorithm is trained on fixed cosmological parameters, we find it can extrapolate to models it was not trained on. Coupled with available field-level emulators and simulations suites for $\Lambda$CDM, our algorithm can be used to constrain modified gravity in the large-scale structure using full information available at the field-level.

 Anti-de Sitter vacuum, which correspond to a negative cosmological constant (CC), is theoretically important and well-motivated. It is interesting to see whether current data can allow the existence of a negative CC not. In this paper, we perform the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM+CC model using recent DESI BAO measurements combined with Planck CMB and Pantheon Plus dataset. The results reveal that the bestfit energy density of CC is $\Omega_\Lambda\sim -0.3$ and the fitting to DESI is slightly improved, while $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ is also $1\sigma$ consistent.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the extinction law in regions of high dust extinction, such as the Pillars of Creation within the M16 region, is crucial for understanding the densest parts of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we utilize observations from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze the color-excess ratios $E(F090W-\lambda)/E(F090W-F200W)$ across a wavelength range of $0.9-7.7\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our method involves performing linear regression on color-color diagrams to derive these ratios. The enhanced detection capabilities of JWST data allow us to probe the distinct extinction law to the densest regions in M16 corresponding to an extinction depth up to $A_V \sim 60$\,mag. Remarkably, the resultant color-excess ratio curve exhibits a flatter profile than predicted by typical dust extinction models with $R_V = 5.5$ for dense ISM environments. Moreover, we observe that the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction law diverges from the near-infrared (NIR) power-law, showing a tendency for the slope to flatten as the wavelength increases. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the dust properties in dense interstellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiters measure their emission spectra at multiple orbital phases, thus enabling detailed characterisation of their atmospheres. Precise constraints on the atmospheric composition of these exoplanets offer insights into their formation and evolution. We analyse four phase-resolved emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, generated from a phase curve observed with the MIRI/LRS onboard the JWST, to retrieve its atmospheric properties. Using a parametric 2D temperature model and assuming a chemically homogeneous atmosphere within the observed pressure region, we simultaneously fit the four spectra to constrain the abundances of atmospheric constituents, thereby yielding more precise constraints than previous work that analysed each spectrum independently. Our analysis reveals statistically significant evidence of NH3 (4$\sigma$) in a hot Jupiter's emission spectra for the first time, along with evidence of H2O (6.5$\sigma$), CO (3.1$\sigma$), and a non-detection of CH4. With our abundance constraints, we tentatively estimate the metallicity of WASP-43b at 0.6-6.5$\times$solar and its C/O ratio at 0.6-0.9. Our findings offer vital insights into the atmospheric conditions and formation history of WASP-43b by simultaneously constraining the abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen-bearing species.
