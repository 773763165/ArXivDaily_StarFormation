          On the origin of the gamma-ray burst GRB221009A

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze a bright and rare burst, GRB20221009A, showing through NED data that the angular distance between GRB221009A and the supernova SN 2022xiw is almost the same angular separation with galactic objects, i.e., the SN-GRB connection at z = 0.151 is not robust. Gamma rays with up to 18 TeV detected in association with the GRB constrain the attenuation to which they are subject at cosmological distances. GR221009A is out of scale relative to other long-lasting GRBs and comes from a region with an excess of soft gamma repeaters (SGR), suggesting that GRB221009A is a giant SGR, with energy release Eiso aproximately 10^{44} erg. The GRBs propagation across the galactic plane reinforces this assumption.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations from CHEOPS and TESS to clarify the architecture of the planetary system hosted by the old Galactic thick disk star TOI-561. Our global analysis, which also includes previously published photometric and radial velocity data, incontrovertibly proves that TOI-561 is hosting at least four transiting planets with periods of 0.44 days (TOI-561 b), 10.8 days (TOI-561 c), 25.7 days (TOI-561 d), and 77.1 days (TOI-561 e) and a fifth non-transiting candidate, TOI-561f with a period of 433 days. The precise characterisation of TOI-561's orbital architecture is interesting since old and metal-poor thick disk stars are less likely to host ultra-short period Super-Earths like TOI-561 b. The new period of planet -e is consistent with the value obtained using radial velocity alone and is now known to be $77.14399\pm0.00025$ days, thanks to the new CHEOPS and TESS transits. The new data allowed us to improve its radius ($R_p = 2.517 \pm 0.045 R_{\oplus}$ from 5$\%$ to 2$\%$ precision) and mass ($M_p = 12.4 \pm 1.4 M_{\oplus}$) estimates, implying a density of $\rho_p = 0.778 \pm 0.097 \rho_{\oplus}$. Thanks to recent TESS observations and the focused CHEOPS visit of the transit of TOI-561 e, a good candidate for exomoon searches, the planet's period is finally constrained, allowing us to predict transit times through 2030 with 20-minute accuracy. We present an updated version of the internal structure of the four transiting planets. We finally performed a detailed stability analysis, which confirmed the long-term stability of the outer planet TOI-561 f.

 - **Abstract**
 The plausibility of an unseen planet in the outer solar system, and the expected orbit and mass of such a planet, have long been a topic of inquiry and debate. We calculate the long-term orbital stability of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which allows us to expand the sample of objects that would carry dynamical information about a hypothetical unseen planet in the outer solar system. Using this expanded sample, we find statistically significant clustering at the $\sim 3 \sigma$ level for TNOs with semimajor axes $>170\mbox{\;AU}$, in longitude of perihelion ($\varpi$), but not in inclination ($i$), argument of perihelion ($\omega$) or longitude of node ($\Omega$). Since a natural explanation for clustering in $\varpi$ is an unseen planet, we run 300 $n$-body simulations with the giant planets, a disk of test particles representing Kuiper belt objects, and an additional planet with varied initial conditions for its mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Based on the distribution of test particles after 1--2 Gyr, we compute relative likelihoods given the actual distribution of $\varpi$ as a function of semimajor axis for distant TNOs on stable orbits using a significantly larger sample ($N = 51$) than previous work ($N = 11$). We find that the unseen planet parameters that best fit the data are a mass of $m_p = 4.4 \pm 1.1 \mathrm{\; M_{\oplus}}$, a semimajor axis of $a_p = 290 \pm 30 \mathrm{\; AU}$, an eccentricity of $e_p = 0.29 \pm 0.13$, and an inclination of $i_p = 6.8 \pm 5.0^{\circ}$ (all error bars are 1$\sigma$). Only $0.06\%$ of the Brown & Batygin (2021) reference population produce probabilities within $1\sigma$ of the maximum within our quadrivariate model, indicating that our work identifies a distinct preferred region of parameter space for an unseen planet in the solar system. If such an unseen planet exists, it is likely to be discovered by LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are the most numerous gravitational-wave sources observed to date. Their properties make them suitable for observation both by ground- and space-based detectors. Starting from synthetic catalogues constructed based on observational constraints from ground-based detectors, we explore the detection rates and the characteristic parameters of the stellar-mass black-hole binaries observable by LISA during their inspiral, using signal-to-noise ratio thresholds as a detection criterion. We find that only a handful of these sources will be detectable with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 8: about 5 sources on average in 4 years of mission duration, among which only one or two are multiband ones (i.e. merging in less than 15 years). We find that detectable sources have chirp mass $10 M_\odot\lesssim \mathcal{M}_c\lesssim 100 M_\odot$, residual time-to-coalescence $4\mathrm{yr}\lesssim \tau_c\lesssim 100 \mathrm{yr}$, and redshift $z\lesssim 0.1$, much closer than those observed up to now by ground-based detectors. We also explore correlations between the number of LISA detectable sources and the parameters of the population, suggesting that a joint measurement with the stochastic signal might be informative of the population characteristics. By performing parameter estimation on a subset of sources from the catalogues, we conclude that, even if LISA measurements will not be directly informative on the population due to the low number of resolvable sources, it will characterise a few, low-redshift candidates with great precision. Furthermore, we construct for the first time the LISA waterfall plot for low chirp mass, and demonstrate that LISA will also be able to discriminate and characterize, through very precise parameter estimation, a population of binaries with higher masses, $\mathcal{M}_c\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3) M_\odot$, if it exists.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations gather high-precision timing measurements of pulsars with the aim of detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals. A major challenge lies in the identification and characterization of the different sources of noise that may hamper their sensitivity to GWs. The presence of time-correlated noise that resembles the target signal might give rise to degeneracies that can directly impact the detection statistics. In this work, we focus on the covariance that exists between a "chromatic" dispersion measure (DM) noise and an "achromatic" stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). "Chromatic" associated to the DM noise means that its amplitude depends on the frequency of the incoming pulsar photons measured by the radio-telescope. Several frequency channels are then required to accurately characterise its chromatic features and when the coverage of incoming frequency is poor, it becomes impossible to disentangle chromatic and achromatic noise contributions. In this paper, we explore this situation by injecting realistic GWB into 100 realizations of two mock versions of the second data release (DR2) of the European PTA (EPTA), characterized by different frequency coverage. The first dataset is a faithful copy of DR2, in which the first half of the data is dominated by only one frequency channel of observation; the second one is identical except for a more homogeneous frequency coverage across the full dataset. We show that for 91% of the injections, a better frequency coverage leads to an improved statistical significance (~1.3dex higher log Bayes factor on average) of the GWB and a better characterization of its properties. We propose a metric to quantify the degeneracy between DM and GWB parameters and show that it is correlated with a loss of significance for the recovered GWB and an increase in the GWB bias towards a higher and flatter spectral shape.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal the chemical composition, temperature, cloud properties, and (potentially) the habitability of these distant worlds. The inference of such properties is generally enabled by Bayesian atmospheric retrieval algorithms. However, until recently, many retrieval codes have not been publicly available. Here, we describe the open source release of the POSEIDON exoplanet radiative transfer and retrieval code. POSEIDON is a Python package for the 1D, 2D, or 3D modelling and analysis of exoplanet spectra, which is frequently used to interpret Hubble and JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres. We provide extensive tutorials on both forward modelling and retrievals in POSEIDON's online documentation, which we hope will serve as a helpful resource for the exoplanet atmosphere community.

          CRIRES+ and ESPRESSO reveal an atmosphere enriched in volatiles relative to refractories on the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b

 - **Abstract**
 One of the outstanding goals of the planetary science community is to measure the present-day atmospheric composition of planets and link this back to formation. As giant planets are formed by accreting gas, ices, and rocks, constraining the relative amounts of these components is critical to understand their formation and evolution. For most known planets, including the Solar System giants, this is difficult as they reside in a temperature regime where only volatile elements (e.g., C, O) can be measured, while refractories (e.g., Fe, Ni) are condensed to deep layers of the atmosphere where they cannot be remotely probed. With temperatures allowing for even rock-forming elements to be in the gas phase, ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe the volatile and refractory content of giant planets. Here we directly measure and obtain bounded constraints on the abundances of volatile C and O as well as refractory Fe and Ni on the ultra-hot giant exoplanet WASP-121b. We find that ice-forming elements are comparatively enriched relative to rock-forming elements, potentially indicating that WASP-121b formed in a volatile-rich environment much farther away from the star than where it is currently located. The simultaneous constraint of ice and rock elements in the atmosphere of WASP-121b provides insights into the composition of giant planets otherwise unattainable from Solar System observations.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H$_2$O, OH, and CO$_2$, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_4$H$_2$. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C$_2$H$_2$ with models that have C/O $=$ 2$-$4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.

          Baryon-free $S_8$ tension with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately modelling matter power spectrum effects at small scales, such as baryonic feedback, is essential to avoid significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters with cosmic shear. However, Stage IV surveys like LSST will be so precise that significant information can still be extracted from large scales alone. In this work, we simulate LSST Y1-like mock data and perform a cosmic shear analysis, considering different models of baryonic feedback. To focus on large scales, we apply physically motivated scale cuts which account for the redshift dependence of the multipoles in the tomographic bin. Our main focus is to study the changes in the constraining power of $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ parameters and assess possible effects on the tension with Planck measurements. We find that the $S_8$ tension is clearly detectable at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.20\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ in the analysis where we imposed a DES-sized tension, and at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.10\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ with a KiDS-sized tension, regardless of whether an incorrect model for baryons is assumed. However, to achieve these results, LSST will need high precision measurement of the redshift distributions, with photo-$z$ biases of the order of $10^{-3}$. Without this, the ability to constrain cosmological parameters independently of baryonic feedback - particularly regarding the $S_8$ tension - will be compromised.

 - **Abstract**
 We report here the results obtained from a systematic optical photometric survey aimed at finding new compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as "spiders"): the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE). We acquired multi-band optical images over one year around $33$ unidentified Fermi-LAT sources, selected as pulsar candidates based on their curved GeV spectra and steady $\gamma$-ray emission. We present the discovery of four optical variables coinciding with the Fermi sources 3FGL J0737.2$-$3233, 3FGL J2117.6$+$3725 (two systems in this field) and 3FGL J2221.6$+$6507, which we propose as new candidate spider systems. Indeed, they all show optical flux modulation consistent with orbital periods of $0.3548(5) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.25328(6) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.441961(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, and $0.165(4) \ \mathrm{d}$, respectively, with amplitudes $\gtrsim 0.3 \ \mathrm{mag}$ and colors compatible with companion star temperatures of $5000$--$6000 \ \mathrm{K}$. These properties are consistent with the "redback" sub-class of spider pulsars. If confirmed as a millisecond pulsar, 3FGL J0737.2$-$3233 will be the closest known spider to Earth ($D=659_{-20}^{+16} \ \mathrm{pc}$, from Gaia-DR3 parallax). We searched and did not find any X-ray sources matching our four candidates, placing $3\sigma$ upper limits of $\sim10^{31}$--$10^{32} \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.3$--$10 \ \mathrm{keV}$) on their soft X-ray luminosities. We also present and discuss other multi-wavelength information on our spider candidates, from infrared to X-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Improved opacities are needed for modelling the atmospheres and evolution of cool carbon-rich stars and extra-solar planets; in particular, contributions made by the astrophysically important propadienediylidene (C$_3$) molecule need, at a minimum, to be determined using a line list which includes all significant transitions in the energy range of interest. We report variational calculations giving ro-vibrational energy levels and corresponding line-strengths for $^{12}$C$_3$, $^{12}$C$^{13}$C$^{12}$C and $^{12}$C$^{12}$C$^{13}$C. In the $^{12}$C$_3$ case we obtain 2166503 ro-vibrational state energies $\le$ 20000 cm$^{-1}$ for the electronic $\tilde{X}^1 \Sigma_g^+$ ground-state. Comparison with experiment indicates a maximum error of +/- 0.03 cm$^{-1}$ in calculated positions of lines involving an upper state energy $\lesssim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$. For lines with upper state energies $\gtrsim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$ to have comparable line-position accuracies, conical intersections would need to be accounted for in an adopted potential energy surface. Line lists and associated opacities are provided in the ExoMol Database this http URL ).

          The Density and Ionization Profile of Optically Dark and High Redshift GRBs Probed by X-ray Absorption

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray column density (NHX) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can probe the local environment of their progenitors over a wide redshift range. Previous work has suggested an increasing trend as a function of redshift. The relevance of the current analysis relies on investigating the selection bias method, such as the effect of the X-ray spectrum in high-redshift GRBs, which complicates the measurement of small NHX, have yet to be fully evaluated or discussed elsewhere. In this work, we evaluated these effects through simulations to define appropriate observational limits in the NHX versus redshift plane. We then applied a one-sided nonparametric method developed by Efron and Petrosian. Within the framework of this method, we investigated the redshift dependence of NHX and the local distribution function. Our results show that the evolution of NHX with redshift firmly exists with a significance of more than four sigma and follows a power law of $(1+z)^{1.39 (+0.22, -0.27)}$. Based on these analyses and previous studies, the GRB progenitor mass varies but is more massive in the high redshift environment and has a higher gas column density. This suggests that part of the luminosity evolution of GRBs, which has been widely reported, may be due to the evolution of the progenitor's mass. Using the same method, we demonstrate that optically dark GRBs show a consistent evolution as $(1+z)^{1.15(+0.67, -0.83)}$. By applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, it is shown that optically dark GRBs have statistically identical flux and photon index distributions compared to normal GRBs, but the NHX is systematically larger. This result suggests that the darkness of some GRB populations is not due to an intrinsic mechanism, but that a higher density surrounds them.

 - **Abstract**
 A new phosphorous mononitride (${}^{31}$P${}^{14}$N, ${}^{31}$P${}^{15}$N) line list PaiN covering infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions is presented. The PaiN line list extending to the $A\,{}^{1}\Pi$ -- $X\,{}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ vibronic band system, replaces the previous YYLT ExoMol line list for PN. A thorough analysis of high resolution experimental spectra from the literature involving the $X\,{}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ and $A\,{}^{1}\Pi$ states is conducted, and many perturbations to the $A\,{}^{1}\Pi$ energies are considered as part of a comprehensive MARVEL study. Ab initio potential energy and coupling curves from the previous work [Semenov et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 23, 22057 (2021)] are refined by fitting their analytical representations to 1224 empirical energy levels determined using the MARVEL procedure. The PaiN line list is compared to previously observed spectra, recorded and calculated lifetimes, and previously calculated partition functions. The ab initio transition dipole moment curve for the $A$--$X$ band is scaled to match experimentally measured lifetimes. The line list is suitable for temperatures up to 5000 K and wavelengths longer than 121 nm. PaiN is available from this http URL.

          Determination of commensurabilities in the dynamics of the Pluto-Charon's satellites

 - **Abstract**
 The Pluto-Charon system is a binary system, characterised by its high mass ratio and its tidally locked synchronous orbit. Surrounding the central binary, four satellites - Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra - follow near-circular and near equatorial orbits. Mutual tidal forces have probably a great influence on their long term dynamics. Several studies have pointed out some commensurabilities, sometimes using the fast Fourier transform technique. We intend to precisely identify the commensurabilities between the Pluto-Charon satellites, using the tool of fine frequency analysis, not only to investigate known commensurabilities but also to explore new ones. We used a combination of analytical and numerical approaches. The epicyclic theory of Lee and Peale served as an initial description of the motions and a comparative benchmark for numerical integrations. These integrations were performed using the IAS15 integrator within the N-body orbital integrator, REBOUND, considering both 3-body with the central binary and a single moon, and complete 6-body models. Additionally, we applied Frequency Map Analysis to determine precisely the numerical values of the system's fundamental frequencies. Our fine frequency analysis successfully identified all fundamental frequencies of the system, along with a detailed examination of the associated uncertainties. The findings, obtained with both 3-body and 6-body numerical models, align well with predictions from the epicyclic analytical theory. Notably, we highlight commensurabilities previously reported and introduce novel ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate how smooth alterations of the initial conditions can lead to the observation of libration in specific arguments, providing insights into the dynamical behavior of such a complex system.

          Exploring the physical origins of halo assembly bias from early times

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale linear halo bias encodes the relation between the clustering of dark-matter (DM) halos and that of the underlying matter density field. Although the primary dependence of bias on halo mass is well understood in the context of structure formation, the physical origins of the multiple additional relations at fixed halo mass, commonly known as secondary halo bias, have not been fully elucidated. Of particular relevance is the secondary dependence on halo assembly history, known as halo assembly bias. Our goal is to determine whether the properties of the initial regions from which $z=0$ halos originate produce any secondary bias at $z=0$. By analyzing these initial dependencies in connection with halo assembly bias, we intend to provide insight on the physical origins of the effect. To this end, we select halos at $z=0$ in the IllustrisTNG DM-only simulation and trace back the positions and velocities of their DM particles to $z=12$. The resulting initial regions are characterized according to several shape-related and kinematic properties. The secondary bias signal produced by these properties at $z=0$ is measured using an object-by-object bias estimator, which offers significant analytical advantages. We show that, when split by the properties of their initial DM clouds, $z=0$ halos display significant secondary bias, clearly exceeding the amplitude of the well-known halo assembly bias signal produced by concentration and age. The maximum bias segregation is measured for cloud velocity dispersion and radial velocity, followed by cloud concentration, sphericity, ellipticity and triaxiality. We further show that both velocity dispersion and radial velocity are also the properties of the initial clouds that most strongly correlate with halo age and concentration at fixed halo mass. Our results highlight the importance of linear effects in shaping halo assembly bias.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a uniform partitioning of cubic cells, we cover the total volume of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation based on particles. We define a visualisation cell as a spatial extension of the cubic cell, so that we collect all simulation particles contained in this visualisation cell to create a series of Cartesian plots in which the over-density of matter is clearly visible. We then use these plots as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Keras library and TensorFlow for image classification. To assign a class to each plot, we approximate the Hessian of the gravitational potential in the centre of the cubic cells. Each selected cubic cell is then assigned a label of 1,2 or 3, depending on the number of positive eigenvalues obtained for the Householder reduction of the Hessian matrix. We apply the CNN to several models, including two models with different visualisation volumes, one with a cell size of type L (large) and the other with a cell type S (small). A third model that combines the plots of the previous L and S cell types. So far, we have mainly considered a slice parallel to the XY plane to make the plots. The last model is considered based on visualisations of cells that also include slices parallel to the ZX and ZY planes. We find that the accuracy in classificating plots is acceptable, and the ability of the models to predict the class works well. These results allow us to demonstrate the aim of this paper, namely that the usual Cartesian plots contain enough information to identify the observed structures of the cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio spectral shape of quasars can provide insight into the ages of quasars. We have compiled data for 1804 quasars with $z\lesssim1$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, these quasars were also mapped by the Low-Frequency Array at 144 MHz and the Very Large Array Sky Survey at 3000 MHz. The radio spectral index, designated as $\alpha^{\rm 144}_{\rm 3000}$ (with $S(\nu)\propto\nu^\alpha$), is analyzed between 144 MHz and 3000 MHz as a proxy for the ages of quasars. We measure the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line in the SDSS spectra. A strong correlation was found between the equivalent width of the core component of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line and $\alpha^{\rm 144}_{\rm 3000}$. This relationship suggests that the core component of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line could potentially serve as a surrogate for the evolutionary stage of a quasar. The quasars at an early stage of evolutions tend to show weaker [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission, while older quasars exhibit stronger [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Here, we present the low-resolution transmission spectroscopy of three giant planets using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) on the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in Hanle, India. It is the first application of transmission spectroscopy with HCT. This study presents results from a single transit, each for three planets: HAT-P-1b, KELT- 18b and WASP-127b. The selection of suitable reference stars assisted in accurately tracking slit losses for the long cadence observations that are needed to achieve the required Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We employ the Common Mode Correction (CMC) technique, utilizing a white light transit curve to minimize time dependent systematic errors. The observed spectra for WASP-127b and HAT-P-1b agree with previous low-resolution transit spectroscopic observations using other observing facilities. We confirm the presence of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of WASP-127b. In addition, we provide the first low-resolution transmission spectrum for KELT-18b. Modeling the exoplanet atmosphere with HFOSC and available IR observations from HST and SPITZER for WASP-127b and HAT-P-1b shows that HFOSC can be an alternative optical instrument to use in conjunction with IR observations to constrain the atmospheric parameters better.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent analysis on the properties of XTE J18014-338 yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars, which are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations. In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations indicates their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.

          The Formation of Black Holes in Non-interacting, Isolated Binaries. Gaia Black Holes as Calibrators of Stellar Winds From Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The black holes discovered using Gaia, especially Gaia BH1 and BH2, have low mass companions of solar-like metallicity in wide orbits. For standard isolated binary evolution formation channels including interactions such an extreme mass ratio is unexpected; especially in orbits of hundreds to thousands of days. Aims. Here, we investigate a non-interacting formation path for isolated binaries to explain the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2. Methods. We use single star models computed with MESA to constrain the main characteristics of possible progenitors of long-period black hole binaries like Gaia BH1 and BH2. Then, we incorporate these model grids into the binary population synthesis code POSYDON, to explore whether the formation of the observed binaries at solar metallicity is indeed possible. Results. We find that winds of massive stars ($\gtrsim 80\,M_\odot$), especially during the Wolf-Rayet phase, tend to cause a plateau in the initial stellar mass to final black hole mass relation (at about $13\,M_\odot$ in our default wind prescription). However, stellar winds at earlier evolutionary phases are also important at high metallicity, as they prevent the most massive stars from expanding ($<100\,R_\odot$) and filling their Roche lobe. Consequently, the strength of the applied winds affects the range of the final black hole masses in non-interacting binaries, making it possible to form systems similar to Gaia BH1 and BH2. Conclusions. We deduce that wide binaries with a black hole and a low mass companion can form at high metallicity without binary interactions. There could be hundreds of such systems in the Milky Way. The mass of the black hole in binaries evolved through the non-interacting channel can potentially provide insights into the wind strength during the progenitors evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 TIC 157365951 has been classified as a $\delta$ Scuti type by the International Variable Star Index (VSX). Through the spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and its light curve, we further discovered that it is a binary system. This binary system comprises a red dwarf star and a compact star. Through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we determined the mass of the red dwarf star as $M_1 = 0.31 \pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ and its radius as $R_1 = 0.414 \pm 0.004 R_{\odot}$. By fitting the double-peaked H${\rm \alpha}$ emission, we derived the mass ratio of $q = 1.76 \pm 0.04 $, indicating a compact star mass of $M_2 = 0.54 \pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$. Using Phoebe to model the light curve and radial velocity curve for the detached binary system, we obtained a red dwarf star mass of $M_1 = 0.29 \pm 0.02 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_1 = 0.39 \pm 0.04 R_{\odot}$, and a Roche-lobe filling factor of $f = 0.995\pm0.129$, which is close to the $f=1$ expected for a semi-detached system. The Phoebe model gives a compact star mass $M_2 = 0.53 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$. Constraining the system to be semidetached gives $M_1 = 0.34 \pm 0.02 M_{\odot}$, $R_1 = 0.41 \pm 0.01 R_{\odot}$, and $M_2 = 0.62 \pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$. The consistency of the models is encouraging. The value of the Roche-lobe filling factor suggests that there might be ongoing mass transfer. The compact star mass is as massive as a typical white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction plays a crucial role in cosmological analysis for spectroscopic galaxy surveys because it can make the density field effectively more linear and more Gaussian. The combination of the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction helps break degeneracies among parameters, then improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. It is therefore important to estimate the covariance matrix between pre- and post-reconstructed power spectra. In this work, we use perturbation theory to estimate the covariance matrix of the related power spectra multipoles, and check the accuracy of the derived covariance model using a large suite of dark matter halo catalogs at $z=0.5$. We find that the diagonal part of the auto covariance is well described by the Gaussian prediction, while the cross covariance deviates from the Gaussian prediction quickly when $k > 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we find the non-Gaussian effect in the non-diagonal part of the cross covariance is comparable to, or even stronger than the pre-reconstruction covariance. By adding the non-Gaussian contribution, we obtain good agreement between analytical and numerical covariance matrices in the non-diagonal part up to $k \simeq 0.15\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The agreement in the diagonal part is also improved, but still under-predicts the correlation in the cross covariance block.

 - **Abstract**
 On May 8, 2024, solar active region 13664 produced an X-class flare, several M-class flares, and multiple Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The initial CME caused coronal dimmings, characterized by localized reductions in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions, indicating mass loss and expansion during the eruption. After one solar rotation, on June 8, 2024, the same region produced another M-class flare followed by coronal dimmings observed by the SDO and STEREO spacecraft. We analyzed early CME evolution and direction from coronal dimming expansion at the end of the impulsive phase using the DIRECD (Dimming Inferred Estimation of CME Direction) method. To validate the 3D CME cone, we compared CME properties from the low corona with white-light coronagraph data. The May 8 CME expanded radially, with a 7.7 deg inclination, 70 deg angular width, and 0.81 Rsun cone height, while the June 8 CME had a 15.7 deg inclination, 81 deg width, and 0.89 Rsun height. Our study shows that tracking low coronal signatures, like coronal dimming expansion, can estimate CME direction early, providing crucial lead time for space weather forecasts.

 This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the abundances and distribution of S, and the processes that control the behavior of S on the Earth's Moon and on Mercury. The two planetary bodies share notable similarities, such as lacking substantial atmospheres and featuring surfaces with high numbers of impact craters. Both objects are at variably low oxygen fugacities (fO2), where S occurs only in its reduced state as S2-, and forms sulfides. For the Moon, we present a compilation of 55 years of lunar sample analysis, from Apollo 11 to Chang'e 5, including S concentrations and isotopic compositional data. We discuss processes from S in the lunar interior to volcanic degassing from mare basalts and in pyroclastic eruptions. At the beginning of a lunar science renaissance, we highlight where future research into S on the Moon might lead. The knowledge of S on Mercury is almost entirely based on observations by the NASA MESSENGER mission, operational from 2011 to 2014. MESSENGER observed very high S abundances on Mercury with concentrations of up to 4 wt.%. We discuss proposed mechanisms that lead to the high S abundance on Mercury's surface and discuss implications for the planet's interior. Finally, we provide an outlook on how the upcoming ESA/JAXA BepiColombo will advance our understanding of Mercury and the processes controlling S on the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 A0538-66 is a neutron star/Be X-ray binary located in the Large Magellanic Cloud and, since its discovery in the seventies, it showed a peculiar behavior which makes it a unique object in the high-mass X-ray binaries scene: the extremely eccentric orbit (e=0.72), the short spin period of the neutron star (P=69 ms), the episodes of super-Eddington accretion. These characteristics contribute to a remarkable bursting activity that lasts from minutes to hours and increases the flux by a factor 10^3-10^4. In 2018, A0538-66 was observed by XMM-Newton in a particularly active state, characterized by a forest of short bursts lasting 0.7-50 seconds each. In this contribution we present a reanalysis of these observations. The timing analysis allowed us to distinguish between the epochs of direct accretion and propeller state, that do not correlate with the orbital position of the neutron star. The spectral analysis revealed that during the accretion regime three components (a soft one, a hard one, and a ~6.4-keV emission line) equally contribute to the overall emission, while the propeller regime is characterized by a single soft component. We discuss these findings in the context of spherical and disk accretion regimes, highlighting the similarities and the differences with other X-ray binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar limb darkening must be properly accounted for to accurately determine the radii of exoplanets at various wavelengths. The standard approach to address limb darkening involves either using laws with coefficients from modelled stellar spectra or determining the coefficients empirically during light curve fitting of the data. Here, we test how accurately three common laws -- quadratic, power, and a three-parameter law -- can reproduce stellar limb darkening at different wavelengths and across a broad range of stars. We show that using a quadratic limb darkening law, which is most frequently employed by the community, leads to wavelength-dependent offsets in retrieved transmission spectra. For planets with high impact parameters ($b$ larger than about 0.5) the amplitude of these offsets can reach 1\% of the transit depth which is some cases is comparable to and can even exceed the expected signals from the planetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the quadratic law causes an offset in the value of the impact parameter when it is determined by fitting the broadband transit light curves. In contrast, using the Kipping--Sing three-parameter law leads to robust retrievals. We advocate the use of this law in retrievals, especially for transits with large impact parameters.

 Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) allow for the possibility of precise characterization of its stellar components. They offer a unique opportunity to derive their physical parameters in a near-model-independent way for a number of systems consisting of late-type giant stars. Here we aim to expand the sample of low-metallicity late-type giant stars with precise parameters determined. We aim to determine the fundamental parameters like the mass, radius, or effective temperature for three long-period late-type eclipsing binaries from the Large Magellanic Cloud: OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304, OGLE-LMC-ECL-28283, and OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81. Subsequently we aim to determine the evolutionary stages of the this http URL fit the light curves from the OGLE project and radial velocity curves from high resolution spectrographs using the Wilson-Devinney code. The spectral analysis was performed with the GSSP code and resulted in the determination of atmospheric parameters such as effective temperatures and metallicities. We used isochrones provided by the MIST models based on the MESA code to derive evolutionary status of the stars. We present the first analysis of three DEBs composed of similar He-burning late-type stars passing through the blue loop. Estimated masses for OGLE-LMC-ECL-29293 (G4III + G4III) are $M_1=2.898\pm0.031$ and $M_2=3.153\pm0.038$ $M_\odot$, stellar radii are $R_1=19.43\pm0.31$ and $R_2=19.30\pm0.31$ $R_\odot$. OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304 (G4III + G5III) has stellar masses of $M_1=3.267\pm0.028$ and $M_2=3.229\pm0.029$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_1=23.62\pm0.42$ and $R_2=25.10\pm0.43$ $R_\odot$. OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81 (G2III + G2III) have masses of $M_1=3.165\pm0.020$ and $M_2=3.184\pm0.020$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_1=18.86\pm0.26$ and $R_2=19.64\pm0.26$ $R_\odot$. All masses were determined with a precision better than 2\% and radii better than 1.5\%. The ages of the stars are in the range of 270-341 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Transmission spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding exoplanet atmospheres. At optical wavelengths, it makes it possible to infer the composition and the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. However, unocculted stellar activity can result in contamination of atmospheric transmission spectra by introducing spurious slopes and molecular signals. Aims: We aim to characterise the atmosphere of the transiting exoplanet WASP-69b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an active K star, and characterise the host star's activity levels. Methods: We obtained three nights of spectrophotometric data with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT, covering a wavelength range of 340-1100 nm. We performed retrievals on the full spectrum with combined stellar activity and planet atmosphere models. Results: We directly detect a facula in the form of a hot spot crossing event in one of the transits and indirectly detect unocculted faculae through an apparently decreasing radius towards the blue end of the transmission spectrum. We determine a facula temperature of $\Delta T=+644^{+427}_{-263}$ K for the former and a stellar coverage fraction of around 30% with a temperature of $\Delta T=+231\pm72$ K for the latter. The planetary atmosphere is best fit with a high-altitude cloud deck at 1.4 mbar that mutes atomic and molecular features. We find indications of water and ammonia with $log(H_2O)=-2.01^{+0.54}_{-0.86}$ and $log(NH_3)=-3.4^{+0.96}_{-5.20} respectively and place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on TiO ($10^{-7.65}$) and K ($10^{-7}$). Conclusions. The simultaneous multi-wavelength observations allow us to break the size-contrast degeneracy for facula-crossings, meaning we can obtain temperatures for both the directly and indirectly detected faculae, which are consistent with each other.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a second radio flare from the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020vwl via long-term monitoring radio observations. Late-time radio flares from TDEs are being discovered more commonly, with many TDEs showing radio emission 1000s of days after the stellar disruption, but the mechanism that powers these late-time flares is uncertain. Here we present radio spectral observations of the first and second radio flares observed from the TDE AT2020vwl. Through detailed radio spectral monitoring, we find evidence for two distinct outflow ejection episodes, or a period of renewed energy injection into the pre-existing outflow. We deduce that the second radio flare is powered by an outflow that is initially slower than the first flare, but carries more energy and accelerates over time. Through modelling the long-term optical and UV emission from the TDE as arising from an accretion disc, we infer that the second radio outflow launch or energy injection episode occurred approximately at the time of peak accretion rate. The fast decay of the second flare precludes environmental changes as an explanation, while the velocity of the outflow is at all times too low to be explained by an off-axis relativistic jet. Future observations that search for any link between the accretion disc properties and late time radio flares from TDEs will aid in understanding what powers the radio outflows in TDEs, and confirm if multiple outflow ejections or energy injection episodes are common.

 This study presents an analysis of the optical variability of the blazar 1E 1458.8+2249 on diverse timescales using multi-band observations, including observations in the optical BVRI bands carried out with the T60 and T100 telescopes from 2020 to 2023 and ZTF gri data from 2018 to 2023. On seven nights, we searched for intraday variability using the power-enhanced F-test and the nested ANOVA test, but no significant variability was found. The long-term light curve shows a variability behaviour in the optical BVRI bands with amplitudes of $\sim100\%$ and in the gri bands with amplitudes of $\sim120\%$, including short-term variability of up to $\sim1.1$ mag. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the optical multi-band emissions without any time this http URL 62 nightly SEDs, we obtained spectral indices between 0.826 and 1.360, with an average of $1.128\pm0.063$. The relationships of both spectral indices and colour with respect to brightness indicate a mild BWB trend throughout the observation period, both intraday and long-term. We also performed a periodicity search using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle methods. A recurrent optical emission pattern with a quasi-periodicity of $\sim340$ days is detected in the combined V- and R-band light curves. The observational results indicate that the blazar 1E 1458.8+2249 has a complex variability, while emphasising the need for future observations to unravel its underlying mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a Bayesian analysis of anisotropy in binary galaxy spin directions in the Hyper-Suprime Cam Data Release 3 catalogue, in response to a recent claim that it exhibits a dipole Shamir 2024. We find no significant evidence for anisotropy, or for a direction-independent spin probability that differs from 0.5. These results are unchanged allowing for a quadrupole or simply searching for a fixed anisotropy between any two hemispheres, and the Bayes factor indicates decisive evidence for the isotropic model. Our principled method contrasts with the ad-hoc statistic employed by Shamir 2024. Our code is publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Young star-forming regions in massive environments are ideal test beds to study the influence of surroundings on the evolution of disks around low-mass stars. We explore two distant young clusters, IC 1848-East and West located in the massive W5 complex. These clusters are unique due to their similar (distance, age, and extinction) yet distinct (stellar density and FUV radiation fields) physical properties. We use deep multi-band photometry in optical, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths complete down to the substellar limit in at least five bands. We trace the spectral energy distribution of the sources to identify the young pre-main sequence members in the region and derive their physical parameters. The disk fraction for the East and West clusters down to 0.1 M$_\odot$ was found to be $\sim$27$\pm$2% (N$_{disk}$=184, N$_{diskless}$=492) and $\sim$17$\pm$1% (N$_{disk}$=173, N$_{diskless}$=814), respectively. While no spatial variation in the disk fraction is observed, these values are lower than those in other nearby young clusters. Investigating the cause of this decrease, we find a correlation with the intense feedback from massive stars throughout the cluster area. We also identified the disk sources undergoing accretion and observed the mass accretion rates to exhibit a positive linear relationship with the stellar host mass and an inverse relationship with stellar age. Our findings suggest that the environment significantly influences the dissipation of disks in both clusters. These distant clusters, characterized by their unique attributes, can serve as templates for future studies in outer galaxy regions, offering insights into the influence of feedback mechanisms on star and planetary formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter provides an overview of the basic concepts foundational to atmospheric physics and chemistry. We discuss the retention of atmospheres against thermal evaporation and the global energy balance of planets. We present simple derivations of the vertical profile of an atmosphere, which may be shaped by convective and radiative transport. We then briefly touch upon the three-dimensional atmospheric structure, as shaped by circulation patterns. We describe how the abundances of chemical species in the atmosphere are determined, starting with the assumption of chemical equilibrium and then expanding to various disequilibrium effects. We introduce the particles that can be important components of atmospheres (clouds and hazes) and sketch out some of their complexity. Finally, we review some of the differences between atmospheres of terrestrial and gaseous worlds.

          Gravothermalizing into primordial black holes, boson stars, and cannibal stars

 - **Abstract**
 Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. This scenario, in principle, provides a novel way to produce primordial black holes within the mass range of $1$ to $10^{26}$ g. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. In particular, we show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a "cannibal star". Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich complexity.
