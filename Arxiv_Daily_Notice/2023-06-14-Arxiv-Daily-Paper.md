 - **Abstract**
 Venus is Earth's sister planet, with similar mass and density but an uninhabitably hot surface, an atmosphere with a water activity 50-100 times lower than anywhere on Earths' surface, and clouds believed to be made of concentrated sulfuric acid. These features have been taken to imply that the chances of finding life on Venus are vanishingly small, with several authors describing Venus' clouds as "uninhabitable", and that apparent signs of life there must therefore be abiotic, or artefactual. In this article, we argue that although many features of Venus can rule out the possibility that Earth life could live there, none rule out the possibility of all life based on what we know of the physical principle of life on Earth. Specifically, there is abundant energy, the energy requirements for retaining water and capturing hydrogen atoms to build biomass are not excessive, defenses against sulfuric acid are conceivable and have terrestrial precedent, and the speculative possibility that life uses concentrated sulfuric acid as a solvent instead of water remains. Metals are likely to be available in limited supply, and the radiation environment is benign. The clouds can support a biomass that could readily be detectable by future astrobiology-focused space missions from its impact on the atmosphere. Although we consider the prospects for finding life on Venus to be speculative, they are not absent. The scientific reward from finding life in such an un-Earthlike environment justifies considering how observations and missions should be designed to be capable of detecting life if it is there.

 - **Abstract**
 G34.26+0.15 is a region of high-mass star formation that contains a broad range of young stellar objects in different stages of evolution, including a hot molecular core, hyper-compact HII regions and a prototypical cometary ultra-compact HII region. Previous high-sensitivity single dish observations by our group resulted in the detection of broad 6035 MHz OH absorption in this region; the line showed a significant blue-shifted asymmetry indicative of molecular gas expansion. We present high-sensitivity Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 6035 MHz OH line conducted to image the absorption and investigate its origin with respect to the different star formation sites in the region. In addition, we report detection of 6030 MHz OH absorption with the VLA and further observations of 4.7 GHz and 6.0 GHz OH lines obtained with the Arecibo Telescope. The 6030 MHz OH line shows a very similar absorption profile as the 6035 MHz OH line. We found that the 6035 MHz OH line absorption region is spatially unresolved at $\sim 2$" scales, and it is coincident with one of the bright ionized cores of the cometary HII region that shows broad radio recombination line emission. We discuss a scenario where the OH absorption is tracing the remnants of a pole-on molecular outflow that is being ionized inside-out by the ultra-compact HII region.
#### Detecting Fast Radio Bursts with Spectral Structure using the Continuous  Forward Algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with frequency-dependent intensity remains a challenge, as existing search algorithms do not account for the spectral shape and might have resulted in non-detections. We propose a novel detection statistic, which we call the Kalman detector, that improves the sensitivity of FRB signal detection by incorporating spectral shape information. The detection statistic is based on an optimal matched filter, marginalizing over all possible intensity functions, weighted by a random walk probability distribution, considering some decorrelation bandwidth. Our analysis of previously detected FRBs demonstrates that the Kalman score provides a comparable yet independent source of information for bursts with significant spectral structure and the sensitivity improvement is of the order of 0-200%, with a median improvement of 20%. We also apply the Kalman detector to existing data from FRB 20201124A and detect two new repeat bursts which were previously missed. Furthermore, we suggest a practical implementation for real-time surveys by employing a low significance soft-trigger from initial integration-based detection algorithms. The Kalman detector has the potential to significantly enhance FRB detection capabilities and enable new insights into the spectral properties of these enigmatic astrophysical phenomena.
