 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations are leading to important new insights into exoplanetary atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. In order to harness the full potential of the broad spectral range and high sensitivity of JWST, atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets require a high level of robustness and accuracy in the underlying models. We present the VIRA retrieval framework which implements a range of modelling and inference capabilities motivated by early JWST observations of exoplanet transmission spectra. This includes three complementary approaches to modelling atmospheric composition, three atmospheric aerosol models, including a physically-motivated Mie scattering approach, and consideration of correlated noise. VIRA enables a cascading retrieval architecture involving a sequence of retrievals with increasing sophistication. We demonstrate VIRA using a JWST transmission spectrum of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b in the $\sim$1-5 $\mu$m range. In addition to confirming prior chemical inferences, we retrieve molecular abundances for H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, SO$_2$ and H$_2$S, resulting in super-solar elemental abundances of log(O/H)=$-2.0\pm0.2$, log(C/H)=$-2.1\pm0.2$ and log(S/H)=$-3.6\pm0.2$, along with C/O and S/O ratios of $0.83^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$ and $0.029^{+0.012}_{-0.009}$, respectively, in the free chemistry case. The abundances correspond to $20.1^{+10.5}_{-8.1}\times$, $28.2^{+16.3}_{-12.1}\times$ and $20.8^{+10.3}_{-7.5}\times$ solar values for O/H, C/H and S/H, respectively, compared to C/H $= 8.67\pm0.35 \times$ solar for Saturn. Our results demonstrate how JWST transmission spectroscopy combined with retrieval frameworks like VIRA can measure multi-elemental abundances for giant exoplanets and enable comparative characterisation with solar system planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs $\left(\rm{T}_{eff}\sim1300 \ \text{K} \right)$ show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. An open question is whether this variability is caused by atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves or by large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds. We applied both waves and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multi-band ($Y$/$J$/$H$/$K$) photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136), collected at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7$\pm1.0 \ \rm{M_J}$) at the L/T transition (T2$\pm0.5$) known to exhibit light curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of $6.17\pm0.46\%$, $6.45\pm0.33\%$, $6.51\pm0.42\%$, and $4.33\pm0.38\%$ in the $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter's atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a $93.8^{\circ}\pm7.4^{\circ}$ ($12.7\sigma$) phase shift between the $H-K$ and $J-H$ color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The prediction of a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of curvature and tensor fluctuations is among the main features of cosmic inflation. The current measurements of the primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide tight constraints on the amplitude of the scalar and tensor spectra, and the scalar tilt. However, the precise connection between these observables and a given inflationary model, depends on the expansion history between the end of inflation and the beginning of the radiation dominated era, which corresponds to the reheating epoch. This mapping between horizon exit and reentry of fluctuations, parametrized by the number of $e$-folds $N_*$, can therefore be affected by the presence of a transient epoch of non-perturbative particle production during reheating ({\em preheating}). Using a combination of perturbative and lattice computations, we quantify the impact of preheating in a non-equilibrated dark matter sector on the CMB observables, under the assumption of a simultaneous perturbative decay of the inflaton into Standard Model particles. Combined with structure formation constraints, this allows us to impose stringent bounds on the post-inflationary reheating temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 $\mu$m and 4.83 $\mu$m, assess the presence of Pa-$\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We re-detect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 $\mu$m flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but not that of planet c. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-$\alpha$ line emission. The 4.83 $\mu$m fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment.
#### The extreme coronal line emitter AT 2022fpx: Varying optical  polarization properties and late-time X-ray flare

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes have been known to disrupt passing stars, producing outbursts called tidal disruption events (TDEs). TDEs have recently gained attention due to their unique dynamics and emission processes, which are still not fully understood. Especially, the so-called optical TDEs, are of interest as they often exhibit delayed or obscured X-ray emission from the accretion disk, making the origin of the prompt emission unclear. In this paper, we present the optical photo-, spectro-, and polarimetry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, in addition to accompanying monitoring observations in ultraviolet and X-rays. The optical spectra of AT 2022fpx show Bowen fluorescence as well as highly-ionized iron emission lines, which are characteristic of extreme coronal line emitters. Additionally, the source exhibits variable but low-polarized emission at the outburst peak, with a clear rotation of the polarization angle. X-ray emission observed later in the decay appear flare-like but is consistent with constant temperature black-body emission. The overall outburst decay is slower than for typical TDEs, and resembles more the ones seen from Bowen fluorescence flares. These observations suggest that AT 2022fpx could be a key source in linking different long-lived TDE scenarios. Its unique characteristics, such as the extreme coronal line emission, variable polarization, and the delayed X-ray flare, can be attributed to the outer shock scenario or a clumpy torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. Further studies, especially in the context of multi-wavelength observations, are crucial to fully understand the dynamics and emission mechanisms of these intriguing astrophysical events.

 - **Abstract**
 Following the Pluto fly-by of the New Horizons spacecraft, the mission provided a unique opportunity to explore the Kuiper Belt in-situ. The possibility existed to fly-by a Kuiper Belt object (KBO) as well as to observe additional objects at distances closer than are feasible from earth-orbit facilities. However, at the time of launch no KBOs were known about that were accessible by the spacecraft. In this paper we present the results of 10 years of observations and three uniquely dedicated efforts -- two ground-based using the Subaru Suprime Camera, the Magellan MegaCam and IMACS Cameras, and one with the Hubble Space Telescope -- to find such KBOs for study. In this paper we overview the search criteria and strategies employed in our work and detail the analysis efforts to locate and track faint objects in the galactic plane. We also present a summary of all of the KBOs that were discovered as part of our efforts and how spacecraft targetability was assessed, including a detailed description of our astrometric analysis which included development of an extensive secondary calibration network. Overall, these efforts resulted in the discovery of 89 KBOs including 11 which became objects for distant observation by New Horizons and (486958) Arrokoth which became the first post-Pluto fly-by destination.

 - **Abstract**
 We test Deep-Learning (DL) techniques for the analysis of rotational core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) gravitational-wave (GW) signals by performing classification and parameter inference of the GW strain amplitude ($D \cdot \Delta h $) and the maximum (peak) frequency $(f_\textrm{peak})$, attained at core bounce. Our datasets are built from a catalog of numerically generated CCSN waveforms assembled by Richers 2017. Those waveforms are injected into noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors corresponding to the O2 and O3a observing runs. For a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 5, our classification network using time series detects Galactic CCSN GW signals buried in detector noise with a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.10% and a 98% accuracy, being able to detect all signals with SNR>10. The inference of $f_\textrm{peak}$ is more accurate than for $D \cdot \Delta h $, particularly for our datasets with the shortest time window (0.25 s) and for a minimum SNR=15. From the calibration plots of predicted versus true values of the two parameters, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the slope deviation with respect to the ideal value are computed. We find $\sigma_{D \cdot \Delta h}$ = 52.6cm and $\sigma_{f_\textrm{peak}}$ = 18.3Hz, with respective slope deviations of 11.6% and 8.3%. Our best model is also tested on waveforms from a recent CCSN catalog built by Mitra 2023, different from the one used for the training. For these new waveforms the true values of the two parameters are mostly within the 1$\sigma$ band around the network's predicted values. Our results show that DL techniques hold promise to infer physical parameters of Galactic rotational CCSN even in the presence of real (non-Gaussian) noise conditions from current GW detectors.
#### Expected Impact of Glints from Space Debris in the LSST

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the simple model put forth in a recent note by Loeb 2024 regarding the brightness of space debris in the size range of 1-10 cm and their impact on the Rubin Observatory LSST transient object searches. Their main conclusion was that "image contamination by untracked space debris might pose a bigger challenge [than large commercial satellite constellations in LEO]". Following corrections and improvements to this model, we calculate the apparent brightness of tumbling Low Earth Orbit (LEO) debris of various sizes, and we briefly discuss the likely impact and potential mitigations of glints from space debris in LSST. The largest difference from the Loeb 2024 estimates is that 1-10 cm debris in LEO pose no threat to LSST transient object alert generation because their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection will be much lower than estimated by Loeb 2024. Most of the difference in predicted SNR, about a factor of six, arises from defocus of LEO objects due to the large Simonyi Survey Telescope primary mirror. We find that only tumbling LEO debris larger than 10 cm or with significantly greater reflectivity, which give 1 ms glints, might be detected with high confidence (SNR>5). We estimate that only one in five LSST exposures low on the sky during twilight might be affected. More slowly tumbling objects of larger size can give flares in brightness that are easily detected, however these will not be cataloged by the LSST Science Pipelines Bosch et al. 2019 because of the resulting long streak.
#### The Local Bubble is a Local Chimney: A New Model from 3D Dust Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Leveraging a high-resolution 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood from Edenhofer et al. (2023), we derive a new 3D model for the dust-traced surface of the Local Bubble, the supernova-driven cavity surrounding the Sun. We find that the surface of the Local Bubble is highly irregular in shape, with its peak extinction surface falling at an average distance of 170 pc from the Sun (spanning 70-600+ pc) with a typical thickness of 35 pc and a total dust-traced mass of $(6.0 \pm 0.7) \times 10^5 \ \rm{M}_{\odot}$. The Local Bubble displays an extension in the Galactic Northern hemisphere that is morphologically consistent with representing a "Local Chimney." We argue this chimney was likely created by the "bursting" of this supernova-driven superbubble, leading to the funneling of interstellar medium ejecta into the lower Galactic halo. We find that many well-known dust features and molecular clouds fall on the surface of the Local Bubble and that several tunnels to other adjacent cavities in the interstellar medium may be present. Our new, parsec-resolution view of the Local Bubble may be used to inform future analysis of the evolution of nearby gas and young stars, the investigation of direct links between the solar neighborhood and the Milky Way's lower halo, and numerous other applications.
#### Constraints on Metastable Dark Energy Decaying into Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the proposal that an energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter can be described in field theory by a first order phase transition. We analyze the model proposed in Ref. Abdalla et al. (2013), using updated constraints on the decay time of a metastable dark energy from the work of Ref. Shafieloo et al. (2018). The results of our analysis show no prospects for potentially observable signals that could distinguish this scenario. We also show that such model would not drive a complete transition to a dark matter dominated phase even in a distant future. Nevertheless, the model is not excluded by the latest data and we confirm that the mass of the dark matter particle that would result from such a process corresponds to an axion-like particle, which is currently one of the best motivated dark matter candidates. We argue that extensions to this model, possibly with additional couplings, still deserve further attention as it could provide an interesting and viable description for an interacting dark sector scenario based in a single scalar field.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star$-$white dwarf (NSWD) binaries are one of the most abundant sources of gravitational waves (GW) in the Milky Way. These GW sources are the evolutionary products of primordial binaries that experienced many processes of binary interaction. We employ a binary population synthesis method to investigate the properties of Galactic NSWD binaries detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this paper, only the NSWD systems with a COWD or ONeWD component are included. We consider various models related to mass transfer efficiencies during primordial binary evolution, supernova explosion mechanisms at NS formation, common envelope ejection efficiencies, and critical WD masses that determining the stability of mass transfer between WDs and NSs. Based on our calculations, we estimate that tens to hundreds of LISA NSWD binaries exist in the Milky Way. We find that the detection of LISA NSWD binaries is able to provide profound insights into mass transfer efficiencies during the evolution of primordial binaries and critical WD masses during mass transfer from a WD to an NS.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the plausible candidates for the cosmological dark matter. Theoretically, PBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH}$ in the range of $4\times10^{14}\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm g}$ can emit sub-GeV electrons and positrons through Hawking radiation. Some of these particles could undergo diffusive reacceleration during their propagation in the Milky Way, resulting in acceleration up to the GeV level. This falls within the observation energy range of AMS-02. In this work, we utilize AMS-02 data to constrain the PBH abundance $f_{\rm PBH}$ employing the reacceleration mechanism. Our findings reveal that the limit is more stringent than those derived from Voyager 1 for nearly $\mathcal{O}(1)$ at $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ under the assumption of a monochromatic PBH mass distribution. The constraints are even more robust in a more realistic scenario involving a log-normal mass distribution of PBHs. Moreover, we explore the impact of varying propagation parameters and solar modulation potential within reasonable ranges, and find that such variations have minimal effects on the final results.

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks, atomic carbon is expected to originate from the PDR at the disk surface where CO is dissociated by UV photons coming from the stellar, or external interstellar, radiation field. Even though atomic carbon has been detected in several protoplanetary disks, there is a lack of spatially resolved observations of it. For HD 163296 protoplanetary disk, we aim to obtain both radial and vertical structure of [CI]$={^3}{P_1} - {^3}{P_0}$ line emission and perform the first direct comparison of this tracer with optically thick line emission $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$. We used archival ALMA data for [CI]$={^3}{P_1} - {^3}{P_0}$ and previously published ${^{12}}$ CO $J=2-1$ data in HD 163296. Through the software of disksurf we extracted the vertical structure, meanwhile radial profiles were obtained directly from imaging. Brand new DALI modelling was employed to perform direct comparison to the data. We found that these tracers are collocated radially but not vertically, where $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission is, on average, located at higher altitudes, as it is also the case for other tracers in the same disk. Due to this difference in vertical height of the emission, the optically thick $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission line appears to trace the highest altitudes, despite the expected formation mechanism of [CI] in the disk. The latter phenomena may be due to efficient mixing of the upper layers of the disk, or UV photons penetrating deeper than we expected.

 - **Abstract**
 The unidentified infrared emission (UIE) features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 micron are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the unambiguous identification of any individual, specific PAH molecules has proven elusive until very recently two isomers of cyanonapthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings and substitutes a nitrile (-CN) group for a hydrogen atom, were discovered in the Taurus Molecular Cloud based on their rotational transitions at radio frequencies. To facilitate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for cyanonapthalenes in astrophysical regions, we model the vibrational excitation of cyanonapthalenes and calculate their infrared emission spectra in a number of representative astrophysical regions. The model emission spectra and intensities will allow JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundance of cyanonapthalenes.

 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of Fermi-LAT sources in the 4th Fermi LAT 14-year Catalog (4FGL) still remain unidentified (unIDed). We continued to improve our machine learning pipeline (MUWCLASS) and used it to classify 1206 X-ray sources located within the extent of 73 unIDed 4FGL sources with Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observations included in the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0. Recent improvements to our pipeline include astrometric corrections, probabilistic cross-matching to lower-frequency counterparts, and a more realistic oversampling method. X-ray sources are classified into 8 broad pre-determined astrophysical classes defined in the updated training dataset which we also release. The classifications give 115 plausible X-ray counterparts to 45 GeV sources. We present details of the machine learning classification, describe the pipeline improvements, and perform additional spectral and variability analysis for brighter sources. We identify 3 GeV sources as isolated neutron star candidates, 1 as an X-ray binary candidate, 16 as active galactic nucleus candidates, 7 sources are associated with star-forming regions, and 9 are ambiguous cases. For the remaining 37 unIDed 4FGL sources, we could not identify any plausible counterpart in X-rays or they are too close to the Galactic Center. Finally, we outline the observational strategies and further improvements in the pipeline that can lead to more accurate classifications.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the MeV gamma-ray band is a promising energy-band window in astrophysics, the current situation of MeV gamma-ray astronomy significantly lags behind those of the other energy bands in angular resolution and sensitivity. An electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC), a next-generation MeV detector, is expected to revolutionize the situation. An ETCC tracks each Compton-recoil electron with a gaseous electron tracker and determines the incoming direction of each gamma-ray photon; thus, it has a strong background rejection power and yields a better angular resolution than classical Compton cameras. Here, we study ETCC events in which the Compton-recoil electrons do not deposit all energies to the electron tracker but escape and hit the surrounding pixel scintillator array (PSA). We developed an analysis method for this untapped class of events and applied it to laboratory and simulation data. We found that the energy spectrum obtained from the simulation agreed with that of the actual data within a factor of 1.2. We then evaluated the detector performance using the simulation data. The angular resolution for the new-class events was found to be twice as good as in the previous study at the energy range 1.0--2.0~MeV, where both analyses overlap. We also found that the total effective area is dominated by the contribution of the double-hit events above an energy of 1.5~MeV. Notably, applying this new method extends the sensitive energy range with the ETCC from 0.2--2.1 MeV in the previous studies to up to 3.5~MeV. Adjusting the PSA dynamic range should improve the sensitivity in even higher energy gamma-rays. The development of this new analysis method would pave the way for future observations by ETCC to fill the MeV-band sensitivity gap in astronomy.

However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. We test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned cluster catalogue. We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. We find that only 5647 (79%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11% of clusters within 250 pc. 3530 open clusters are in a strongly cut high quality sample. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M$_\odot$. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of $1.3 \times 10^5$ open clusters, only ~4% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant SNR 0540-69.3, twin of the Crab Nebula, offers an excellent opportunity to study the continuum emission from a young pulsar and pulsar-wind nebula (PWN). We present observations taken with the VLT instruments MUSE and X-shooter in the wavelength range 3000-25,000 \r{A}, which allow us to study spatial variations of the optical spectra, along with the first near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of the source. We model the optical spectra with a power law (PL) $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$ and find clear spatial variations (including a torus-jet structure) in the spectral index across the PWN. Generally, we find spectral hardening toward the outer parts, from $\alpha\sim1.1$ to $\sim0.1$, which may indicate particle reacceleration by the PWN shock at the inner edge of the ejecta or alternatively time variability of the pulsar wind. The optical-NIR spectrum of the PWN is best described by a broken PL, confirming that several breaks are needed to model the full spectral energy distribution of the PWN, suggesting the presence of more than one particle population. Finally, subtracting the PWN contribution from the pulsar spectrum we find that the spectrum is best described with a broken-PL model with a flat and a positive spectral index, in contrast to the Crab pulsar that has a negative spectral index and no break in the optical. This might imply that pulsar differences propagate to the PWN spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We determined shock speed in the Galactic supernova remnant Cygnus Loop, using proper motion of its optical filaments and the latest estimate for its distance. The proper motion was measured by comparing H$\alpha$ images of the remnant observed in two epochs: 1993 (Kitt Peak National Observatory) and 2018/2019 (National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen and Astronomical station Vidojevica). We derived shock speed for 35 locations along different filaments, which is twice as much as in earlier studies of north-eastern part of Cygnus Loop. For the first time, we have measured shock speed of radiative filaments in this region. Three of the analyzed locations where we measured proper motion of filaments are radiative, based on their presence in [SII] images from the second epoch. The other filaments are non-radiative. The speed we obtained for the non-radiative filaments is in the range of 240-650 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, with an estimate for the uncertainty of 70 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. These values are mostly in agreement with previous studies. The radiative filaments have lower speed of 100-160$\pm${70} $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which is in agreement with the assumption that they are older in evolutionary terms. This clear distinction between the speed of the two types of filaments proves that the [SII] emission can be used for identifying radiative filaments in supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 During the process of star formation, the dense gas undergoes significant chemical evolution leading to the emergence of a rich variety of molecules associated with hot cores and hot corinos. However, the physical and chemical conditions involved in this evolution are poorly constrained. We provide here a full inventory of the emission from complex organic molecules (COMs) to investigate the physical structure and chemical composition of six high-mass protostellar envelopes. We aim to investigate the conditions for the emergence of COMs in hot cores. We performed an unbiased spectral survey towards six infrared-quiet massive clumps between 159 GHz and 374 GHz with the APEX 12 m telescope. We detect up to 11 COMs, of which at least five COMs are detected towards all sources. Towards all the objects, most of the COM emission is found to be cold, with respect to the typical temperatures at which COMs are found, with a temperature of 30 K and extended with a size of ~0.3 pc. Although for our sample of young massive clumps the bulk of the gas has a cold temperature, we also detect emission from COMs originating from the immediate vicinity of the protostar revealing a compact and hot component of the envelope. Only three out of the six sources exhibit a hot gas component. We find a gradual emergence of the warm component in terms of size and temperature, together with an increasing molecular complexity, allowing us to establish an evolutionary sequence for our sample based on COMs. Our findings confirm that our sample of infrared-quiet massive clumps are in an early evolutionary stage during which the bulk of the gas is cold. The presence of COMs is found to be characteristic of these early evolutionary stages. We suggest that the emergence of hot cores is preceded by a phase in which mostly O-bearing COMs appear first with similar abundances to hot corinos albeit with larger source sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions on the values of all the systematics examined here can have important effects in cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the neutrino flux from different kinds of galactic sources and compare it with the recently diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We find that the flux from these sources may contribute to ~ 20% of the IceCube neutrino flux. Most of the sources selected in this work populate the southern hemisphere, therefore a detector like KM3NeT could help in resolving the sources out of the observed diffused galactic neutrino flux.
#### Swift monitoring of GK Persei during the 2018 dwarf nova outburst

 - **Abstract**
 The old nova and intermediate polar (IP) GK Persei underwent one of its recurrent dwarf nova (DN) outbursts in 2018. We proposed monitoring it in UV and X-rays with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, starting less than six days after the eruption, until 16 days after the eruption ended. For the first time we could follow the decay to minimum light UV and X-rays. We present the timing and spectral analysis, comparing the results with the previous outbursts and with the quiescent status. We confirm the spin modulation in X-rays with a period 351.325(9) s, only in the 2-10 keV range. The period was not detected in the 0.3-2 keV range and in the UV band, suggesting that the soft portion of the X-ray spectrum in GK Per does not originate near the poles, but in a wind or circumstellar material. The amplitude of the modulation was less prominent than in 2015, a fact that seems correlated with a lower average mass accretion rate. The spectral fits are consistent with a mass accretion rate increasing by a factor of 2 from rise to maximum and decreasing during the return to minimum, following the trend of the modulation amplitude. The maximum plasma temperature is higher than the Swift XRT energy range of 0.3-10 keV, thus it is not well constrained, but our spectral fits indicate that it may have varied irregularly during the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an implicit method for solving the diffusion equation for the evolution of the dust fraction in the terminal velocity approximation using dust-as-mixture smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The numerical scheme involves casting the dust diffusion equation into implicit form, rearranging into its resolvent cubic equation and solving analytically. This method is relevant for small grains that are tightly coupled to the gas, such as sub-micron dust grains in the interstellar medium or millimetre-sized dust grains in protoplanetary discs. The method avoids problems with the variable used to evolve the dust fraction becoming negative when evolved explicitly and is fast and accurate, avoiding the need for dust stopping time limiters and significantly reducing computational expense. Whilst this method is an improvement over using the explicit terminal velocity approximation method, as with any dust-as-mixture method it still fails to give accurate solutions in the limit of large (weakly coupled) grains.

 - **Abstract**
 The temperature structure of a giant planet was traditionally thought to be an adiabat assuming convective mixing homogenizes entropy. The only in-situ measurement made by the Galileo Probe detected a near-adiabatic temperature structure within one of Jupiter's 5$\mu$m hot spots with small but definite local departures from adiabaticity. We analyze Juno's microwave observations near Jupiter's equator (0 ~ 5$^o$N) and find that the equatorial temperature structure is best characterized by a stable super-adiabatic temperature profile rather than an adiabatic one. Water is the only substance with sufficient abundance to alter the atmosphere's mean molecular weight and prevent dynamic instability if a super-adiabatic temperature gradient exists. Thus, from the super-adiabaticity, our results indicate a water concentration (or the oxygen to hydrogen ratio) of about 4.9 times solar with a possible range of 1.5 ~ 8.3 times solar in Jupiter's equatorial region.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation transport plays a crucial role in star formation models, as certain questions within this field cannot be accurately addressed without taking it into account. Given the high complexity of the interstellar medium from which stars form, numerical simulations are frequently employed to model the star formation process. This study reviews recent methods for incorporating radiation transport into star formation simulations, discussing them in terms of the used algorithms, treatment of radiation frequency dependence, the interaction of radiation with the gas, and the parallelization of methods for deployment on supercomputers. Broadly, the algorithms fall into two categories: (i) moment-based methods, encompassing the flux-limited diffusion approximation, M1 closure, and variable Eddington tensor methods, and (ii) methods directly solving the radiation transport equation, including forward and reverse ray tracing, characteristics-based methods, and Monte Carlo techniques. Beyond discussing advantages and disadvantages of these methods, the review also lists recent radiation hydrodynamic codes implemented the described methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-interferometric (RI) imaging entails solving high-resolution high-dynamic range inverse problems from large data volumes. Recent image reconstruction techniques grounded in optimization theory have demonstrated remarkable capability for imaging precision, well beyond CLEAN's capability. These range from advanced proximal algorithms propelled by handcrafted regularization operators, such as the SARA family, to hybrid plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms propelled by learned regularization denoisers, such as AIRI. Optimization and PnP structures are however highly iterative, which hinders their ability to handle the extreme data sizes expected from future instruments. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a novel deep learning approach, dubbed ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. It thus takes a hybrid structure between a PnP algorithm and a learned version of the matching pursuit algorithm that underpins CLEAN. We present a comprehensive study of our approach, featuring its multiple incarnations distinguished by their DNN architectures. We provide a detailed description of its training process, targeting a telescope-specific approach. R2D2's capability to deliver high precision is demonstrated in simulation, across a variety of image and observation settings using the Very Large Array (VLA). Its reconstruction speed is also demonstrated: with only few iterations required to clean data residuals at dynamic ranges up to 105, R2D2 opens the door to fast precision imaging. R2D2 codes are available in the BASPLib library on GitHub.
#### Bayesian mass mapping with weak lensing data using KARMMA -- validation  with simulations and application to Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data

 - **Abstract**
 We update the field-level inference code KARMMA to enable tomographic forward-modelling of shear maps. Our code assumes a lognormal prior on the convergence field, and properly accounts for the cross-covariance in the lensing signal across tomographic source bins. We use mock weak lensing data from N-body simulations to validate our mass-mapping forward model by comparing our posterior maps to the input convergence fields. We find that KARMMA produces more accurate reconstructions than traditional mass-mapping algorithms. More-over, the KARMMA posteriors reproduce all statistical properties of the input density field we tested -- one- and two-point functions, and the peak and void number counts -- with $\lesssim~10\%$ accuracy. Our posteriors exhibit a small bias that increases with decreasing source redshift, but these biases are small compared to the statistical uncertainties of current (DES) cosmic shear surveys. Finally, we apply KARMMA to Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak lensing data, and verify that the two point shear correlation function $\xi_+$ is well fit by the correlation function of the reconstructed convergence field. This is a non-trivial test that traditional mass mapping algorithms fail. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Supranta/KaRMMa.git. KARMMA DES-Y3 mass maps are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/10672062.
