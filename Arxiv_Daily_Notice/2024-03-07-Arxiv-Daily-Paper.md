 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has ushered in a new era in atmospheric characterisations of temperate low-mass exoplanets with recent detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the candidate Hycean world K2-18 b. We investigated JWST observations of the TOI-270 system, with two sub-Neptunes simultaneously transiting the nearby M dwarf during the visit. We report our atmospheric characterisation of the outer planet TOI-270 d, a candidate Hycean world, with JWST transmission spectroscopy using the NIRSpec G395H instrument in the 2.7-5.2 $\mu$m range, combined with previous observations obtained with the HST WFC3 spectrograph (1.1-1.6 $\mu$m). The spectrum reveals strong signatures of CH4 and CO2 at 3.8-4.9$\sigma$ and 2.9-3.9$\sigma$ confidence, respectively, and no evidence of NH3. The abundant CH4 and CO2, at ~0.1-1% mixing ratios, and the non-detection of NH3 are similar to the findings reported for K2-18 b and consistent with predictions for a Hycean world with a planet-wide ocean under a H2-rich atmosphere. We also report evidence of CS2 at a 2.3-3.0$\sigma$ confidence and a potential inference of H2O at 1.6-4.4$\sigma$, depending on the data analysis approach, and discuss possible interpretations of these results. The spectrum does not provide strong constraints on the presence of clouds or hazes in the observable atmosphere, nor any evidence for the effects of stellar heterogeneities, which is consistent with previous studies. For the smaller inner planet TOI-270 b, we find that the spectrum is inconsistent with a featureless spectrum at ~3$\sigma$, showing some preference for an H2-rich atmosphere in a super-Earth. We discuss the implications of our findings and future prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 Multimessenger signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are promising tools to infer the largely unknown properties of nuclear matter at densities that are presently inaccessible to laboratory experiments. The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) that would complement those coming from the late inspiral, direct mass-radius measurements, or ab-initio dense-matter calculations. To explore this possibility, we perform a representative series of general-relativistic simulations of BNS systems with EOSs carefully constructed so as to cover comprehensively the high-density regime of the EOS space. From these simulations, we identify a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular-momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the "long ringdown", and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores. When applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, we find a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available. Hence, the long ringdown has the potential of providing new and stringent constraints on the state of matter in neutron stars in general and, in particular, in their cores.
#### Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body  problem

 - **Abstract**
 The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can have significant consequences.
#### Extreme resonant eccentricity excitation of stars around merging  black-hole binary

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03250
 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics of a star orbiting a merging black-hole binary (BHB) in a coplanar triple configuration. During the BHB's orbital decay, the system can be driven across the apsidal precession resonance, where the apsidal precession rate of the stellar orbit matches that of the inner BHB. As a result, the system gets captured into a state of resonance advection until the merger of the BHB, leading to an extreme eccentricity growth of the stellar orbit. This resonance advection occurs when the inner binary has a non-zero eccentricity and unequal masses. The resonant driving of the stellar eccentricity can significantly alter the hardening rate of the inner BHB, and produce observational signatures to uncover the presence of nearby merging or merged BHBs.
#### How to Break the Mass Sheet Degeneracy with the Lightcurves of  Microlensed Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The standardizable nature of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) makes them an attractive target for time delay cosmography, since a source with known luminosity breaks the mass sheet degeneracy. It is known that microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy can add significant stochastic uncertainty to the unlensed luminosity which is often much larger than the intrinsic scatter of the Ia population. In this work, we show how the temporal microlensing variations as the supernova disc expands can be used to improve the standardization of glSNe Ia. We find that SNe are standardizable if they do not cross caustics as they expand. We estimate that this will be the case for $\approx$6 doubly imaged systems and $\approx$0.3 quadruply imaged systems per year in LSST. At the end of the ten year LSST survey, these systems should enable us to test for systematics in $H_0$ due to the mass sheet degeneracy at the $1.00^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$\% level, or $1.8\pm0.2$\% if we can only extract time delays from the third of systems with counter images brighter than $i=24$ mag.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) can be detected at cosmological distances and therefore can be used to study the contents and phases of the early Universe. The 4 -- 150 keV wide-field trigger camera ECLAIRs to fly on-board the Space-based multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) mission dedicated to study high-energy transient sky in synergy with multi-messenger follow-up instruments, is adapted to detect high-z GRBs. Aims. Investigating the detection capabilities of ECLAIRs for high redshift GRBs and estimating the impacts of instrumental biases in reconstructing some of the source measured properties, focusing on GRB duration biases as a function of redshift. Methods. We simulated realistic detection scenarios for a sample of 162 already observed GRBs with known redshift values as they would have been seen by ECLAIRs. We simulated them at redshift values equal and higher than their measured value. Then, we assessed whether they would be detected with a trigger algorithm resembling that on-board of ECLAIRs, and derived some quantities such as T90 for those that would have been detected. Results. We find that ECLAIRs would be capable of detecting GRBs up to very high redshift values (e.g. 20 GRBs of our sample are detectable within more than 0.4 of the ECLAIRs Field of View for z > 12). The ECLAIRs low-energy threshold of 4 keV, contributes to this great detection capability, as it may enhance it at high redshift (z > 10) by over 10% compared to a 15 keV low-energy threshold. We have also shown that the detection of GRBs at high-z values may imprint tip-of-the-iceberg biases on the GRB duration measurements, which can affect the reconstruction of other source properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We verify candidate hypervelocity red clump stars located in the Galactic bulge that were selected based on the VVV and the Gaia DR2 data by Luna et al. (2019). To do so, we analyze data from the OGLE-IV survey: difference images and astrometric time series. We have data for 30 stars out of 34 hypervelocity candidates. We confirmed high proper motion of only one of these stars and find out that it is a nearby one, hence, not hypervelocity. To sum up, we do not confirm the candidate stars as hypervelocity ones. Hence, we disprove the production rate of hypervelocity red clump stars by the central supermassive black hole provided by Luna et al. (2019).

 - **Abstract**
 Even though sub-Neptunes likely represent the most common outcome of planet formation, their natures remain poorly understood. In particular, planets near 1.5-2.5$\,R_\oplus$ often have bulk densities that can be explained equally well with widely different compositions and interior structures, resulting in grossly divergent implications for their formation. Here, we present the full 0.6-5.2$\,\mu \mathrm{m}$ JWST NIRISS/SOSS+NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the 2.2$\,R_\oplus$ TOI-270d ($4.78\,M_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq}$=350-380 K), delivering unprecedented sensitivity for atmospheric characterization in the sub-Neptune regime. We detect five vibrational bands of CH$_4$ at 1.15, 1.4, 1.7, 2.3, and 3.3$\,\mu$m (9.4$\sigma$), the signature of CO$_2$ at 4.3$\,\mu$m (4.8$\sigma$), water vapor (2.5$\sigma$), and potential signatures of SO$_2$ at 4.0$\,\mu \mathrm{m}$ and CS$_2$ at 4.6$\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Intriguingly, we find an overall highly metal-rich atmosphere, with a mean molecular weight of $5.47_{-1.14}^{+1.25}$. We infer an atmospheric metal mass fraction of $58_{-12}^{+8}\%$ and a C/O of $0.47_{-0.19}^{+0.16}$, indicating that approximately half the mass of the outer envelope is in high-molecular-weight volatiles (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$) rather than H$_2$/He. We introduce a sub-Neptune classification scheme and identify TOI-270d as a "miscible-envelope sub-Neptune" in which H$_2$/He is well-mixed with the high-molecular-weight volatiles in a miscible supercritical metal-rich envelope. For a fully miscible envelope, we conclude that TOI-270d's interior is $90_{-4}^{+3}\,$wt$\,\%$ rock/iron, indicating that it formed as a rocky planet that accreted a few wt % of H$_2$/He, with the overall envelope metal content explained by magma-ocean/envelope reactions without the need for significant ice accretion. TOI-270d may well be an archetype of the overall population of sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 The scalar and tensor fluctuations produced during inflation can be correlated, if arising from the same underlying mechanism. In this paper we investigate such correlation in the model of axion inflation, where the rolling inflaton produces quanta of a $U(1)$ gauge field which, in turn, source scalar and tensor fluctuations. We compute the primordial correlator of the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, with the amplitude of the gravitational waves squared, $h_{ij}h_{ij}$, at frequencies probed by gravitational wave detectors. This two-point function receives two contributions: one arising from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations generated by the standard mechanism of amplification of vacuum fluctuations, and the other coming from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations sourced by the gauge field. Our analysis shows that the latter effect is generally dominant. The correlator, normalized by the amplitude of $\zeta$ and of $h_{ij}h_{ij}$, turns out to be of the order of $ 10^{-2}\,\times (f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil})^{1/3}$, where $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$ measures the scalar bispectrum sourced by the gauge modes.
#### Giant impact on early Ganymede and its subsequent reorientation

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and early evolution of the Jovian moon Ganymede, known to have an internal ocean, have garnered considerable interest in the field of origin of satellites and life. Ganymede has an ancient impact structure, called a furrow system. The furrow system is the largest impact structures in the outer solar system and the impact should have significantly affected Ganymede's early history; however, its impact is poorly understood. Here we show that mass redistribution induced by the furrow-forming impact caused a reorientation (true polar wander) of Ganymede. The center of the furrow system is located close to the tidal axis, indicating that the impact created a positive mass anomaly that reoriented the impact site toward the tidal axis. We found that an impactor with a radius of 150 km and an incidence angle between 60 degree and 90 degree can reproduce the current location of the furrow system. Furthermore, this ejecta model is adoptable in Pluto's reorientation. Although it is proposed that Pluto's reorientation indicates the presence of a global ocean, our model indicates that it occurs even if no ocean.
#### How habitable are M-dwarf Exoplanets? Modeling surface conditions and  exploring the role of melanins in the survival of Aspergillus niger spores  under exoplanet-like radiation

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet habitability remains a challenging field due to the large distances separating Earth from other stars. Using insights from biology and astrophysics, we studied the habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets by modeling their surface temperature and flare UV and X-ray doses using the Martian atmosphere as a shielding model. Analyzing the Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1 systems, our models suggest that Proxima b and TRAPPIST-1 e are likeliest to have temperatures compatible with surface liquid water, as well as tolerable radiation environments. Results of the modeling were used as a basis for microbiology experiments to assess spore survival of the melanin-rich fungus Aspergillus niger to exoplanet-like radiation (UV-C and X-rays). Results showed that A. niger spores can endure superflare events on M-dwarf planets when shielded by a Mars-like atmosphere or by a thin layer of soil or water. Melanin-deficient spores suspended in a melanin-rich solution showed higher survival rates and germination efficiency when compared to melanin-free solutions. Overall, the models developed in this work establish a framework for microbiological research in habitability studies. Finally, we showed that A. niger spores can survive harsh radiation conditions of simulated exoplanets, also emphasizing the importance of multifunctional molecules like melanins in radiation shielding beyond Earth.
#### ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): I.  What triggered the current episode of eruption?

 - **Abstract**
 An unbiased spectral survey of V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, was carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 6. The detected line emission from various molecules reveals morphological/kinematical features in both the Keplerian disk and the infalling envelope. A direct infall signature, red-shifted absorption against continuum, has been detected in CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, and H$_2$CO. HCO$^+$ and SO show large arm-like structures that probably connect from an infalling envelope to the disk. HCN and H$_2$CO reveal a distinct boundary between the inner and outer disk and reveal tentative spiral structures connecting the outer disk to the inner disk. HNC shows a large central emission hole (r $\sim$0.3\arcsec) due to its chemical conversion to HCN at high temperatures. The HDO emission, a direct tracer of the water sublimation region, has been detected in the disk. Molecular emission from complex organic molecules (COMs) is confined within the HDO emission boundary, and HCO$^+$ has an emission hole in its distribution due to its destruction by water. Together, these features suggest that the current episode of eruption in V883 Ori may be triggered by the infall from the envelope to the outer disk, generating a spiral wave, which propagates inward and greatly enhances the accretion onto the central star.
#### Hubble tension may indicate time-dependent dark matter energy density

 - **Abstract**
 The values of Hubble constant H0 by direct measurements with standard distance ladder are typically larger than those obtained from the observation of cosmic microwave background and the galaxy survey with inverse distance ladder. On the other hand, although the errors are still large, various determinations of the value of matter density parameter Omega_m are consistent with each other. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in Hubble constant is translated to the difference of physical matter energy density omega_m = Omega_m h^2, where h = H0 / (100 Km/s/Mpc). In this article it is examined the possibility of an increase of the physical dark matter energy density by a fast transition at a certain value of redshift as a possible resolution of the Hubble tension. A phenomenological fluid model of the dark sector, which is the modification of a so-called unified dark matter model, is introduced to concretely realize such a fast transition in the physical dark matter energy density.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak Lensing (WL) surveys are reaching unprecedented depths, enabling the investigation of very small angular scales. At these scales, nonlinear gravitational effects lead to higher-order correlations making the matter distribution highly non-Gaussian. Extracting this information using traditional statistics has proven difficult, and Machine Learning based summary statistics have emerged as a powerful alternative. We explore the capabilities of a discriminative, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based approach, focusing on parameter constraints in the ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$) cosmological parameter space. Leveraging novel training loss functions and network representations on WL mock datasets without baryons, we show that our models achieve $\sim 5$ times stronger constraints than the power spectrum, $\sim 3$ stronger constraints than peak counts, and $\sim 2$ stronger constraints than previous CNN-learned summary statistics and scattering transforms, for noise levels relevant to Rubin or Euclid. For WL convergence maps with baryonic physics, our models achieve $\sim 2.3$ times stronger constraining power than the power spectrum at these noise levels, also outperforming previous summary statistics. To further explore the possibilities of CNNs for this task, we also discuss transfer learning where we adapt pre-trained models, trained on different tasks or datasets, for cosmological inference, finding that these do not improve the performance.
#### Radiation-mediated shocks in GRB prompt emission

 - **Abstract**
 The debate regarding the emission mechanism in gamma-ray bursts has been long-standing. Here, we study the spectral signatures of photospheric emission, accounting for subphotospheric dissipation by a radiation-mediated shock. The shocks are modeled using the Kompaneets RMS approximation (KRA). We find that the resulting observed spectra are soft, broad, and exhibit an additional break at lower energies. When fitting a collection of 150 mock data samples generated by the model, we obtain a distribution of the low-energy index $\alpha$ that is similar to the observed one. These results are promising and show that dissipative photospheric models can account for many of the observed properties of prompt gamma-ray burst emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital dynamics of a very young asteroid pair (5026) Martes and 2005 WW113 is studied. We detect strong resonant perturbations of the larger member of the pair (5026) Martes by the 3:11 mean motion resonance with the Earth. The second asteroid of the pair (2005 WW113) has orbited far from the resonance and is not perturbed. We provide a new estimation of the resonance structure and found that, under the planetary perturbations, a single resonance splits into a multiplet. The nominal position of the resonance is 2.37783 AU. However, the center of the corresponding chaotic zone is detected at 2.37754 AU. As a result, we noted a small but not negligible difference between the calculated and observed position of resonance. The multiplet structure of the 3:11 Earth resonance cannot explain this offset (the position of the main term of the multiplet is 2.377698 AU).

 - **Abstract**
 Using the MESA code, we have carried out a detailed survey of the available parameter space for the double-peaked type I X-ray bursts. We find that the double-peaked structure appears at mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ in the range of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-10}\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ when metallicity $Z=0.01$, while in the range of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-9}\,M_{\odot}/\rm{yr}$ when $Z=0.05$. Calculations of the metallicity impact suggest that the double peaks will disappear when $Z\lesssim0.005$ for $\dot{M}=5\times10^{-10}\,M_{\odot}/\rm{yr}$ and $Z\lesssim0.04$ for $\dot{M}=5\times10^{-9}\,M_{\odot}/\rm{yr}$. Besides, the impacts of base heating $Q_{\rm b}$, as well as nuclear reaction waiting points: $^{22}\rm{Mg}$, $^{26}\rm{Si}$, $^{30}\rm{S}$, $^{34}\rm{Ar}$, $^{56}{\rm Ni}$, $^{60}\rm Zn$, $^{64}\rm{Ge}$, $^{68}\rm{Se}$, $^{72}\rm{Kr}$ have been explored. The luminosity of the two peaks decreases as $Q_{\rm b}$ increases. $^{68}{\rm Se}(p,\gamma){^{69}{\rm Br}}$ is the most sensitive reaction, the double peaks disappear assuming that $^{56}{\rm Ni}(p,\gamma)^{57}{\rm Cu}$ and $^{64}{\rm Ge}(p,\gamma)^{65}{\rm As}$ reaction rates have been underestimated by a factor of 100 and the $^{22}{\rm Mg}(\alpha,p)^{25}{\rm Al}$ reaction rate has been overestimated by a factor of 100, which indicates that $^{22}{\rm Mg}$, $^{56}{\rm Ni}$, $^{64}{\rm Ge}$, $^{68}{\rm Se}$ are possibly the most important nuclear waiting points impedance. Comparisons to the double-peaked bursts from 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1730-22 suggest that the nuclear origins of double-peaked type I X-ray bursts are difficult to explain the observed larger peak times ($t_{\rm p,1}\gtrsim4\,{\rm s}$, $t_{\rm p,2}\gtrsim8\,{\rm s}$) and smaller peak ratio($r_{1,2}\lesssim0.5$). The composition of ashes from double-peaked bursts is very different from the single-peaked bursts especially for the heavier p-nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting planets within protoplanetary disks around young stars is essential for understanding planet formation and evolution. However, planet detection using the radial velocity method faces challenges due to strong stellar activity in these early stages. We aim to detect long-term periodicities in photometric and spectroscopic time series of the classical T Tauri star (CTTS) CI Tau, and retrieve evidence for inner embedded planets in its disk. The study conducted photometric and spectroscopic analyses using K2 and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Network light curves, and high-resolution spectra from ESPaDOnS and SPIRou. We focus our radial velocity analysis on a wavelength domain less affected by spot activity. To account for spot effects, a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model was applied to K2 light curve, ESPaDOnS, and SPIRou radial velocity data. Additionally, a detailed bisector analysis on cross-correlation functions was carried out to understand the cause of long-term periodicity. We detect coherent periods at $\sim$ 6.6 d, 9 d, $\sim$ 11.5 d, $\sim$ 14.2 d and $\sim$ 25.2 d, the latter is seen consistently across all datasets. Bisector analysis of the cross-correlation functions provides strong hints for combined activity-induced and Doppler reflex signal in the radial velocities at a period of 25.2 d. Our analysis suggests that this periodicity is best explained by the presence of a 3.6$\pm$0.3 M$_{Jup}$, eccentric (e$\sim$0.58) planet at a semi-major axis of 0.17 au. Our study outlines the difficulty of searching for disk-embedded planets in the inner 0.1 au's of young and active systems. We demonstrate that, when searching for planets in actively accreting stars such as CI Tau, the primary limitation is stellar activity rather than the precision of RV measurements provided by the instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a tool for the analysis of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from cosmological first-order phase transitions with LISA: we initiate a template databank for these signals, prototype their searches, and forecast their reconstruction. The templates encompass the gravitational wave signals sourced by bubble collisions, sound waves and turbulence. Accounting for Galactic and extra-Galactic foregrounds, we forecast the region of the parameter space that LISA will reconstruct with better than $\sim 10\,\%$ accuracy, if certain experimental and theoretical uncertainties are solved by the time LISA flies. We illustrate the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the parameters on a few benchmark signals, both in terms of the template parameters and the phase transition ones. To show the impact of the forecasts on physics beyond the Standard Model, we map the reconstructed benchmark measurements into the parameter spaces of the singlet extension of the Standard Model and of the classically conformal invariant $U(1)_{B-L}$ model.

 Context. The recent discovery of several ultra high-energy gamma-ray emitters in our Galaxy constitutes a significant advancement towards unveiling its most powerful accelerators and their properties. Nonetheless, in order to unambiguously locate the regions where the highest energy particles are produced and understand the responsible physical mechanisms, detailed spectral and morphological studies are required, especially given that most of the observed sources were found to be significantly extended. Aims. In these regards, pointing observations with the next-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, like the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Observatory and the ASTRI Mini-Array (ASTRI), are expected to provide significant improvements. Here we aim at identifying the most promising sources to target in future observations. Methods. To this purpose, we performed a comparative analysis of the expected performance of ASTRI and CTA, computing their differential sensitivities towards extended sources, and further explored their capabilities with respect to specific case studies, including follow-ups of existing gamma-ray source catalogs. Results. We find that almost all of the sources so far detected by LHAASO-WCDA and HGPS will be in the reach of ASTRI and CTA with 300 and 50 hours of exposure, respectively. For the highest energy emitters detected by LHAASO-KM2A, in turn, we provide the list of the most promising objects to be investigated. We further examined specific classes of sources in order to identify potentially detectable gamma-ray emitters, such as passive molecular clouds (i.e. illuminated by the cosmic-ray sea) and pulsars surrounded by a halo of runaway particles.

 - **Abstract**
 We present here an extended nuclear network, with 90 species, designed for being coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, which includes neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and the corresponding neutrino and anti-neutrino emission. This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf. The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with the extended network WinNet (> 2000 isotopes) in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrogen deuteride (HD) molecule is an important deuterium tracer in astrophysical studies. The atmospheres of gas giants are dominated by molecular hydrogen, and simultaneous observation of H$_2$ and HD lines provides reliable information on the D/H ratios on these planets. The reference spectroscopic parameters play a crucial role in such studies. Under thermodynamic conditions encountered in these atmospheres, the spectroscopic studies of HD require not only the knowledge of line intensities and positions but also accurate reference data on pressure-induced line shapes and shifts. Our aim is to provide accurate collision-induced line-shape parameters for HD lines that cover any thermodynamic conditions relevant to the atmospheres of giant planets, i.e., any relevant temperature, pressure, and perturbing gas (the H$_2$/He mixture) composition. We perform quantum-scattering calculations on a new highly accurate ab initio potential energy surface, and we use scattering S-matrices obtained this way to determine the collision-induced line-shape parameters. We use the cavity ring-down spectroscopy for validation of our theoretical methodology. We report accurate collision-induced line-shape parameters for the pure rotational R(0), R(1), and R(2) lines, the most relevant HD lines for the investigations of atmospheres of the giant planets. Besides the basic Voigt-profile collisional parameters (i.e. the broadening and shift parameters), we also report their speed dependences and the complex Dicke parameter, which can influence the effective width and height of the HD lines up to almost a factor of 2 for giant planet conditions. The sub-percent-level accuracy, reached in this work, considerably improves the previously available data. All the reported parameters are consistent with the HITRAN database format, hence allowing for the use of HAPI for generating the beyond-Voigt spectra of HD.
#### A simple prediction of the non-linear matter power spectrum in  Brans-Dicke gravity from linear theory

 - **Abstract**
 Brans-Dicke (BD) was one of the first proposed scalar-tensor theories of gravity, and effectively turns the gravitational constant of General Relativity (GR) time-dependent. Constraints on the BD parameter $\omega$ serve as a benchmark for testing GR, which is recovered in the limit $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. Current small-scale astrophysical constraints $\omega \gtrsim 10^5$ are much tighter than large-scale cosmological constraints $\omega \gtrsim 10^3$, but these decouple if the true theory of gravity features screening. On the largest cosmological scales BD approximates the most general second order scalar-tensor (Horndeski) theory, so constraints here have wider implications. These will improve with upcoming large-scale structure and CMB surveys. To constrain BD with weak gravitational lensing, one needs its non-linear matter power spectrum $P_{\rm BD}$. By comparing the boost $B = P_{\rm BD}/P_{\rm GR}$ from linear theory and non-linear $N$-body simulations, we show that the non-linear boost can simply be predicted from linear theory if the ${\rm BD}$ and ${\rm GR}$ universes are parametrized in a way that makes their early cosmological evolution and quasi-linear power today similar. In particular, they need the same $H_0 / \sqrt{\smash[b]{G_{\rm eff}(a=0)}}$ and $\sigma_8$, where $G_{\rm eff}$ are their (effective) gravitational strengths. Our prediction is $1\%$ accurate for $\omega \geq 100$, $z \leq 3$ and $k \leq 1\,h/\rm{Mpc}$, and $2\%$ further up to $k \leq 5\,h/\rm{Mpc}$. It also holds for $G_{\rm BD}$ that do not match Newton's constant today, so one can study GR with different gravitational constants $G_{\rm GR}$ by sending $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. We provide a code that computes $B$ with the linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class and multiplies it by the non-linear $P_{\rm GR}$ from EuclidEmulator2 to predict $P_{\rm BD}$.

 - **Abstract**
 With current and planned gravitational-wave (GW) observing runs, coincident multimessenger timing of Resonant Shattering Flares (RSFs) and GWs may soon allow for neutron star (NS) asteroseismology to be used to constrain the nuclear symmetry energy, an important property of fundamental nuclear physics that influences the composition and equation of state of NSs. In this work we examine the effects of combining multiple RSF detections on these symmetry energy constraints, and consider how realistic uncertainties in the masses of the progenitor NSs may weaken them. We show that the detection of subsequent multimessenger events has the potential to substantially improve constraints beyond those obtained from the first, and that this improvement is insensitive to the mass of the NSs which produce the RSFs and its uncertainty. This sets these asteroseismic constraints apart from bulk NS properties such as radius, for which the NS mass is highly important, meaning that any multimessenger RSF and GW events can equally improve our knowledge of fundamental physics.
#### Cosmological measurements from the CMB and BAO are insensitive to the  tail probability in the assumed likelihood

 - **Abstract**
 When fitting cosmological models to data, a Bayesian framework is commonly used, requiring assumptions on the form of the likelihood and model prior. In light of current tensions between different data, it is interesting to investigate the robustness of cosmological measurements to statistical assumptions about the likelihood distribution from which the data was drawn. We consider the impact of changes to the likelihood caused by uncertainties due to the finite number of mock catalogs used to estimate the covariance matrix, leading to the replacement of the standard Gaussian likelihood with a multivariate $t$-distribution. These changes to the likelihood have a negligible impact on recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. We then extend our analysis to perform a sensitivity test on the Gaussian likelihoods typically adopted, considering how increasing the size of the tails of the likelihood (again using a $t$-distribution) affects cosmological inferences. For an open $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by BAO alone, we find that increasing the weight in the tails shifts and broadens the resulting posterior on the parameters, with a $\sim$0.2-0.4$\sigma$ effect on $\Omega_\Lambda$ and $\Omega_{\rm k}$. In contrast, the CMB temperature and polarization constraints in $\Lambda$CDM showed less than 0.03$\sigma$ changes in the parameters, except for $\{\tau$, ln($10^{10}A_{\rm s})$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$, $\sigma_8\Omega_{\rm m}^{0.25}$, $z_{\rm re}$, $10^9A_{\rm s}e^{-2\tau}\}$ which shifted by around 0.1-0.2$\sigma$. If we use solely $\ell < 30$ data, the amplitude $A_{\rm s} e^{-2\tau}$ varies in the posterior mean by 0.7$\sigma$ and the error bars increase by 6%. We conclude, at least for current-generation CMB and BAO measurements, that uncertainties in the shape and tails of the likelihood do not contribute to current tensions.
#### Impact of baryonic feedback on HSC Y1 weak lensing non-Gaussian  statistics

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback is a major systematic in weak lensing cosmology. Its most studied effect is the suppression of the lensing power spectrum, a second-order statistic, on small scales. Motivated by the growing interest in statistics beyond the second order, we investigate the effect of baryons on lensing non-Gaussian statistics and the resulting biases in the matter clustering amplitude $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$. We focus on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) data which, with its high source number density, closely resembles those expected from the upcoming Euclid and Rubin LSST. We study four non-Gaussian statistics -- peak counts, minimum counts, the probability distribution function, and the scattering transform -- in addition to the usual power spectrum. We first estimate the biases in $S_8$ using mock observations built from the IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulations and theoretical models built from dark matter-only simulations. We find up to $1\sigma$ bias in $S_8$ when the smallest scales (2 arcmin) and the highest feedback level are considered. We then analyze the HSC-Y1 data and compare the $S_8$ obtained for each statistic with different smoothing scales or scale cuts. As we expect that baryons mostly affect the small scales, comparing the results obtained from including and excluding small scales can indicate the level of impact from baryons. With HSC data, we find only minor ($\leq0.5\sigma$) differences in $S_8$ for all statistics, even when considering very small scales (2 arcmin). Our results suggest that the effect of baryons is insignificant at the level of HSC-Y1 down to 2~arcmin for all statistics examined here, or it is canceled by other scale-dependent systematics.

 The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes, demonstrating the possibility of detecting them through a radio interferometer. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. Firstly, a data pipeline is established for generating simulated observations. Next, we present an ensemble neural network model for detecting and estimating the parameters of black holes with different angular sizes. The model can achieve a mean average precision value [0, 0.5] of 0.9176 when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) of the telescope and maintains its detection ability until $0.33\theta_c$. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. The model accurately estimates the size of the accretion disk, the inclination angle, the positional angle, and the temperature. This provides a specific scheme for automatically detecting captured images using neural networks. Moreover, the validity of the model is assessed by analyzing the shadow of M87*, which indicates that the model can discriminate the black hole from background noise and other celestial objects with a confidence level of 0.639. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting black holes in the UV band and provides a new method for the accurate and real-time detection of candidate black holes and further parameter estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cryogenic scintillating calorimeters are ultrasensitive particle detectors for rare event searches, particularly for the search for dark matter and the measurement of neutrino properties. These detectors are made from scintillating target crystals generating two signals for each particle interaction. The phonon (heat) signal precisely measures the deposited energy independent of the type of interacting particle. The scintillation light signal yields particle discrimination on an event-by-event basis. This paper presents a likelihood framework modeling backgrounds and a potential dark matter signal in the two-dimensional plane spanned by phonon and scintillation light energies. We apply the framework to data from CaWO$_4$-based detectors operated in the CRESST dark matter search. For the first time, a single likelihood framework is used in CRESST to model the data and extract results on dark matter in one step by using a profile likelihood ratio test. Our framework simultaneously fits (neutron) calibration data and physics (background) data and allows combining data from multiple detectors. Although tailored to CaWO$_4$-targets and the CRESST experiment, the framework can easily be expanded to other materials and experiments using scintillating cryogenic calorimeters for dark matter search and neutrino physics.

 - **Abstract**
 During the final stage of planetary formation, different formation pathways of planetary embryos could significantly influence the observed variations in planetary densities. Of the approximately 5,000 exoplanets identified to date, a notable subset exhibit core fractions reminiscent of Mercury, potentially a consequence of high-velocity giant impacts. In order to better understand the influence of such collisions on planetary formation and compositional evolution, we conducted an extensive set of smoothed particle hydrodynamics giant impact simulations between two-layered rocky bodies. These simulations spanned a broad range of impact velocities from one to eleven times the mutual escape velocity. We derived novel scaling laws that estimate the mass and core mass fraction of the largest post-collision remnants. Our findings indicate that the extent of core vaporization markedly influences mantle stripping efficiency at low impact angles. We delineate the distinct roles played by two mechanisms -- kinetic momentum transfer and vaporization-induced ejection -- in mantle stripping. Our research suggests that collisional outcomes for multi-layered planets are more complex than those for undifferentiated planetesimal impacts. Thus, a single universal law may not encompass all collision processes. We found a significant decrease in the mantle stripping efficiency as the impact angle increases. To form a 5 M$_{\oplus}$ super-Mercury at $45^{\circ}$, an impact velocity over 200 km s$^{-1}$ is required. This poses a challenge to the formation of super-Mercuries through a single giant impact, implying that their formation would either favor relatively low-angle single impacts or multiple

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) can make up all of the dark matter (DM) if their mass, $m$, is in the so-called 'asteroid-mass window', $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{22} \, {\rm g}$. Observational constraints on the abundance of PBHs are usually calculated assuming they all have the same mass, however this is unlikely to be a good approximation. PBHs formed from the collapse of large density perturbations during radiation domination are expected to have an extended mass function (MF), due to the effects of critical collapse. The PBH MF is often assumed to be lognormal, however it has recently been shown that other functions are a better fit to numerically calculated MFs. We recalculate both current and potential future constraints for these improved fitting functions. We find that for current constraints the asteroid-mass window narrows, but remains open (i.e. all of the DM can be in the form of PBHs) unless the PBH MF is wider than expected. Future evaporation and microlensing constraints may together exclude all of the DM being in PBHs, depending on the width of the PBH MF and also the shape of its low and high mass tails.

 Monoceros R2 (Mon R2) is one of the closest large active star-forming regions. This extremely young and partially embedded region provides an excellent laboratory for studying star formation and the early evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs). In this paper, we conduct an optical study of the greater Mon R2 region. Beginning with 1690 previously identified candidate YSOs, we used 496 sources with good proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 to determine the astrometric properties for likely members of Mon R2. We then used both astrometric and photometric (isochronal and variability) criteria to determine that 308 of these stars are highly probable members. Using the same criteria, we considered a broad area search around Mon R2 in Gaia DR3, and separated candidate members from field stars. In total, we selected 651 likely new cluster members that had been missed in the previous x-ray and infrared excess selection techniques used in the past to establish cluster membership. Revised astrometric properties of the cluster were found using the combined sample of ~959 highly probable member stars. For the literature plus new candidate member list, optical light curves were compiled from the Zwicky Transient Facility. For 470 identified variable sources, we attempted classification based on the Flux Asymmetry (M) and Quasi-Periodicity (Q) metrics. We find that Mon R2 is dominated by quasi-periodic symmetric variables, with aperiodic sources also a significant population. A few tens of large-amplitude variables are identified that may be of interest for further study.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes already in place in the first few hundred million years after Big Bang. The channels of formation and growth of these early, massive black holes are not clear, with scenarios ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate. Here we present the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Halpha emission in a galaxy at z=6.68, which traces a black hole with mass of ~ 4 * 10^8 Msun and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The host galaxy has low star formation rate (~ 1 Msun/yr, a factor of 3 below the star forming main sequence). The black hole to stellar mass ratio is ~ 0.4, i.e. about 1,000 times above the local relation, while the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionisation. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.

#### The Geochemical Potential for Metabolic Processes on the Sub-Neptune  Exoplanet K2-18b

 - **Abstract**
 Quantifying disequilibria is important to understand whether an environment could be habitable. It has been proposed that the exoplanet K2-18b has a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean, making it a "hycean world". The James Webb Space Telescope recently made measurements of methane, CO$_2$, and possibly dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the atmosphere of this planet. The initial interpretation of these data is that they may support the occurrence of hycean conditions. Here, I attempt to take a next step in exploring the prospects for habitability. I use constraints on the abundances of atmospheric gases to calculate how much chemical disequilibrium there could be, assuming K2-18b is a hycean world. I find that the presence of oxidized carbon species coexisting with abundant H$_2$ (1-1000 bar) at cool to warm (25-120{\deg}C) conditions creates a strong thermodynamic drive for methanogenesis. More than ~75 kJ (mol C)$^{-1}$ of free energy can be released from CO$_2$ hydrogenation. Partially oxidized carbon compounds such as DMS (if present) also have potential to provide metabolic energy, albeit in smaller quantities. Because of the thermodynamic instability of CO$_2$ under hycean conditions, other reductive reactions of CO$_2$ are likely to be favored, including the synthesis of amino acids. Glycine and alanine synthesis can be energy-releasing or at least much less costly on K2-18b than in Earth's ocean, even when NH$_3$ is scarce but not totally absent. These first bioenergetic calculations for a proposed ocean-bearing exoplanet lay new groundwork for assessing exoplanetary habitability.
