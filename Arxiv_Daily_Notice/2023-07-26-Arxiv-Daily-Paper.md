#### Suppression of Chaotic Motion of Tethered Satellite Systems Using Tether  Length Control

 - **Abstract**
 This study focuses on attitude and control motion of two bodies (a base-satellite and a sub-satellite) connected by an inextensible and massless tether in a circular orbit under the influence of the Earths gravitational force. The base-satellite is assumed to be far more heavier than the sub-satellite. In such cases, the base-satellite is regarded as the reference spacecraft. Because of the complexity of the problem, no thrusters on the sub-satellite are considered, and the effect of atmospheric drag, Earths oblateness, and electrodynamic force on the spacecraft are neglected.

 Context. The availability of large bandwidth receivers for millimeter radio telescopes allows the acquisition of position-position-frequency data cubes over a wide field of view and a broad frequency coverage. These cubes contain much information on the physical, chemical, and kinematical properties of the emitting gas. However, their large size coupled with inhomogenous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are major challenges for consistent analysis and interpretation.Aims. We search for a denoising method of the low SNR regions of the studied data cubes that would allow to recover the low SNR emission without distorting the signals with high SNR.Methods. We perform an in-depth data analysis of the 13 CO and C 17 O (1 -- 0) data cubes obtained as part of the ORION-B large program performed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyse the statistical properties of the noise and the evolution of the correlation of the signal in a given frequency channel with that of the adjacent channels. This allows us to propose significant improvements of typical autoassociative neural networks, often used to denoise hyperspectral Earth remote sensing data. Applying this method to the 13 CO (1 -- 0) cube, we compare the denoised data with those derived with the multiple Gaussian fitting algorithm ROHSA, considered as the state of the art procedure for data line cubes.Results. The nature of astronomical spectral data cubes is distinct from that of the hyperspectral data usually studied in the Earth remote sensing literature because the observed intensities become statistically independent beyond a short channel separation. This lack of redundancy in data has led us to adapt the method, notably by taking into account the sparsity of the signal along the spectral axis. The application of the proposed algorithm leads to an increase of the SNR in voxels with weak signal, while preserving the spectral shape of the data in high SNR voxels.Conclusions. The proposed algorithm that combines a detailed analysis of the noise statistics with an innovative autoencoder architecture is a promising path to denoise radio-astronomy line data cubes. In the future, exploring whether a better use of the spatial correlations of the noise may further improve the denoising performances seems a promising avenue. In addition,

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies indicate that thermally produced dark matter will form highly concentrated, low-mass cusps in the early universe that often survive until the present. While these cusps contain a small fraction of the dark matter, their high density significantly increases the expected gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation, particularly in searches of large angular regions. We utilize 14 years of Fermi-LAT data to set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation through a detailed study of the isotropic gamma-ray background, excluding with 95% confidence dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states for dark matter masses below 120 GeV.
#### Ro-vibrational Spectroscopy of CI Tau -- Evidence of a Multi-Component  Eccentric Disk Induced by a Planet

 - **Abstract**
 CI Tau is currently the only T Tauri star with an inner protoplanetary disk that hosts a planet, CI Tau b, that has been detected by a radial velocity survey. This provides the unique opportunity to study disk features that were imprinted by that planet. We present multi-epoch spectroscopic data, taken with NASA IRTF in 2022, of the ${}^{12}$CO and hydrogen Pf$\beta$ line emissions spanning 9 consecutive nights, which is the proposed orbital period of CI Tau b. We find that the star's accretion rate varied according to that 9~d period, indicative of companion driven accretion. Analysis of the ${}^{12}$CO emission lines reveals that the disk can be described with an inner and outer component spanning orbital radii 0.05-0.13~au and 0.15-1.5~au, respectively. Both components have eccentricities of about 0.05 and arguments of periapses that are oppositely aligned. We present a proof-of-concept hydrodynamic simulation that shows a massive companion on a similarly eccentric orbit can recreate a similar disk structure. Our results allude to such a companion being located around an orbital distance of 0.14~au. However, this planet's orbital parameters may be inconsistent with those of CI Tau b whose high eccentricity is likely not compatible with the low disk eccentricities inferred by our model.
#### A Comparison of the Composition of Planets in Single- and Multi-Planet  Systems Orbiting M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate and compare the composition of M-dwarf planets in systems with only one known planet (``singles") to those residing in multi-planet systems (``multis") and the fundamental properties of their host stars. We restrict our analysis to planets with directly measured masses and radii, which comprise a total of 70 planets: 30 singles and 40 multis in 19 systems. We compare the bulk densities for the full sample, which includes planets ranging in size from $0.52 R_{\oplus}$ to $12.8R_\oplus$, and find that single planets have significantly lower densities on average than multis, which we cannot attribute to selection biases. We compare the bulk densities normalized by an Earth model for planets with $R_{p} < 6R_{\oplus}$, and find that multis are also denser with 99\% confidence. We calculate and compare the core/water mass fractions (CMF/WMF) of low-mass planets ($M_p <10 M_{\oplus}$), and find that the likely rocky multis (with $R_p <1.6 R_{\oplus}$) have lower CMFs than singles. We also compare the [Fe/H] metallicity and rotation period of all single versus multi-planet host stars with such measurements in the literature and find that multi-planet hosts are significantly more metal-poor than those hosting a single planet. Moreover, we find that host star metallicity decreases with increasing planet multiplicity. In contrast, we find only a modest difference in the rotation period. The significant differences in planetary composition and metallicity of the host stars point to different physical processes governing the formation of single- and multi-planet systems in M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Observatory at the South Pole has been operating in its full configuration since May 2011 with a duty cycle of about 99%. Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Nagoya, Japan (July 26 - August 3, 2023) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients such as Galactic supernovae, fundamental physics, detector calibration and event reconstruction, education and public outreach, and research and development for the IceCube Upgrade, a scheduled dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices.

#### Non-Equilibrium Abundances Treated Holistically (NEATH): the molecular  composition of star-forming clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Much of what we know about molecular clouds, and by extension star formation, comes from molecular line observations. Interpreting these correctly requires knowledge of the underlying molecular abundances. Simulations of molecular clouds typically only model species that are important for the gas thermodynamics, which tend to be poor tracers of the denser material where stars form. We construct a framework for post-processing these simulations with a full time-dependent chemical network, allowing us to model the behaviour of observationally-important species not present in the reduced network used for the thermodynamics. We use this to investigate the chemical evolution of molecular gas under realistic physical conditions. We find that molecules can be divided into those which reach peak abundances at moderate densities ($10^3 \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$) and decline sharply thereafter (such as CO and HCN), and those which peak at higher densities and then remain roughly constant (e.g. NH$_3$, N$_2$H$^+$). Evolving the chemistry with physical properties held constant at their final values results in a significant overestimation of gas-phase abundances for all molecules, and does not capture the drastic variations in abundance caused by different evolutionary histories. The dynamical evolution of molecular gas cannot be neglected when modelling its chemistry.
#### Constraints on Tidal Quality Factor in Kepler Eclipsing Binaries using  Tidal Synchronization: A Frequency-Dependent Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal dissipation in binary systems is the primary source for synchronization and circularization of the objects in the system. The efficiency of the dissipation of tidal energy inside stars or planets results in significant changes in observed properties of the binary system and is often studied empirically using a parameter, commonly known as the modified tidal quality factor ($Q_\star'$). Though often assumed constant, in general that parameter will depend on the particular tidal wave experiencing the dissipation and the properties of the tidally distorted object. In this work we study the frequency dependence of $Q_\star'$ for Sun-like stars. We parameterize $Q_\star'$ as a saturating power-law in tidal frequency and obtain constraints using the stellar rotation period of 70 eclipsing binaries observed by Kepler. We use Bayesian analysis to account for the uncertainties in the observational data required for tidal evolution. Our analysis shows that $Q_\star'$ is well constrained for tidal periods > 15 days, with a value of $Q_\star' \sim 10^8$ for periods > 30 days and a slight suggested decrease at shorter periods. For tidal periods < 15 days, $Q_\star'$ is no longer tightly constrained, allowing for a broad range of possible values that overlaps with the constraints obtained using tidal circularization in binaries, which point to much more efficient dissipation: $Q_\star' \sim 10^6$.
#### The Cosmic Microwave Background and $H_0$

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a unique window into the early universe, providing insights into cosmological parameters like the Hubble constant. Recent precise measurements of the CMB by experiments like Planck seem to point to a lower value for the Hubble constant compared to some other measurements like those from Type Ia supernovae. This discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, currently lacks a definitive explanation. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how the Hubble constant is determined from detailed measurements of the CMB power spectrum. We explain the physics underlying key features of the CMB spectrum and their connection to cosmological parameters. We then examine the consistency of Planck's Hubble constant determination, both internally within the data itself and externally with other astrophysical probes. While largely consistent, some anomalies like the lensing amplitude parameter $A_L$ remain unresolved. We also explore various theoretical extensions to the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmological model and assess their potential to resolve the Hubble tension. No clear resolution emerges, indicating significant tensions remain between early and late universe probes within simple extensions to ${\Lambda}$CDM. Upcoming CMB experiments promise improved precision and should provide further insights into this cosmic conundrum. A coherent picture bridging measurements across cosmic time remains an open challenge at the forefront of modern cosmology.
#### Extra-tensor-induced origin for the PTA signal: No primordial black hole  production

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations announced evidence for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. The origin of the PTA signal can be astrophysical or cosmological. In the latter case, the so-called secondary scalar-induced GW scenario is one of the viable explanations, but it has a potentially serious issue of the overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs) due to the enhanced curvature perturbation. In this letter, we present a new interpretation of the PTA signal. Namely, it is originated from an extra spectator tensor field that exists on top of the metric tensor perturbation. As the energy density of the extra tensor field is always subdominant, it cannot lead to the formation of PBHs. Thus our primordial-tensor-induced scenario is free from the PBH overproduction issue.

 - **Abstract**
 GRANDProto300 is the planned 300-antenna pathfinder array of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), of which the first 100 detection units have been already produced. Its main goal is to demonstrate the viability of the detection of the radio emission from air showers initiated by inclined ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies of $10^{16.5}$ to $10^{18.5}$ eV, covering the purported transition region from their Galactic to extragalactic origin. The front-end readout system of each detection unit of GRANDProto300 processes signals from the radio antenna and the particle detector, generates the first-level trigger, and communicates with a central processing station. Based on earlier designs, we have built the first prototype of this system using two development boards and one self-designed front-end board. We present our new design that is improved and more economical than the earlier one, as well as test results and prospects for future work.
#### Photochemical origin of SiC$_2$ in the circumstellar envelope of  carbon-rich AGB stars revealed by ALMA

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13216
 - **Abstract**
 Whether SiC$_2$ is a parent species, that is formed in the photosphere or as a by-product of high-temperature dust formation, or a daughter species, formed in a chemistry driven by the photodestruction of parent species in the outer envelope, has been debated for a long time. Here, we analyze the ALMA observations of four SiC$_2$ transitions in the CSEs of three C-rich AGB stars (AI Vol, II Lup, and RAFGL 4211), and found that SiC$_2$ exhibits an annular, shell-like distribution in these targets, suggesting that SiC$_2$ can be a daughter species in the CSEs of carbon-rich AGB stars. The results can provide important references for future chemical models.

 GRANDProto300 is a 300-antenna prototype array of the envisioned GRAND (Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) project. The goal of GRANDProto300 is to detect radio signals emitted by cosmic ray-induced air showers, with energies ranging from $10^{16.5}$~eV to $10^{18.5}$~eV, which covers the transition region between Galactic and extragalactic sources. We use simulations to optimize the layout of GRANDProto300 and develop a shower reconstruction method. Based on them, we present the performance of GRANDProto300 for cosmic-ray detection, by means of its effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Noise characterization for pulsar-timing applications accounts for interstellar dispersion by assuming a known frequency-dependence of the delay it introduces in the times of arrival (TOAs). However, calculations of this delay suffer from mis-estimations due to other chromatic effects in the observations. The precision in modeling dispersion is dependent on the observed bandwidth. In this work, we calculate the offsets in infinite-frequency TOAs due to mis-estimations in the modeling of dispersion when using varying bandwidths at the Green Bank Telescope. We use a set of broadband observations of PSR J1643-1224, a pulsar with an excess of chromatic noise in its timing residuals. We artificially restricted these observations to a narrowband frequency range, then used both data sets to calculate residuals with a timing model that does not include short-scale dispersion variations. By fitting the resulting residuals to a dispersion model, and comparing the ensuing fitted parameters, we quantify the dispersion mis-estimations. Moreover, by calculating the autocovariance function of the parameters we obtained a characteristic timescale over which the dispersion mis-estimations are correlated. For PSR J1643-1224, which has one of the highest dispersion measures (DM) in the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, we find that the infinite-frequency TOAs suffer from a systematic offset of ~22 microseconds due to DM mis-estimations, with correlations over ~1 month. For lower-DM pulsars, the offset is ~7 microseconds. This error quantification can be used to provide more robust noise modeling in NANOGrav's data, thereby increasing sensitivity and improving parameter estimation in gravitational wave searches.
#### The Impact of Satellite Trails on H.E.S.S. Astronomical Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The number of satellites launched into Earth orbit has almost tripled in the last three years (to over 4000) due to the increasing commercialisation of space. Multiple satellite constellations, consisting of over 400,000 individual satellites, have either been partially launched or are proposed for launch in the near future. Many of these satellites are highly reflective, resulting in a high optical brightness that affects ground-based astronomical observations. Despite this, the potential effect of these satellites on gamma-ray-observing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) has largely been assumed to be negligible due to their nanosecond-scale integration times. This has, however, never been verified. As IACTs are sensitive to optical wavelength light, we aim to identify satellite trails in data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) IACT array. This is to quantify the potential effects on data quality and extensive air shower event classification and reconstruction. Using night sky background measurements from H.E.S.S., we determine which observation times and pointing directions are affected most by these satellite trails, and evaluate the impact on the standard Hillas parameter variables used for event analysis. Due to the brightest trails, false trigger events can occur, however for most modern analyses the effect on astronomical results will be minimal. We observe a mild increase in the rate of trail detections over time (approximately doubling in three years), which is partially correlated with the number of satellite launches. But the fraction of H.E.S.S. data affected ($\sim0.2\%$ of dark time observations) is currently small. Nevertheless, these trails could have a non-negligible effect on future Cherenkov Telescope Array observations if advanced analysis techniques designed to lower the energy threshold of the instrument are used.
#### SRG/eROSITA survey of Be stars

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are known X-ray emitters and those belonging to the Be category are no exception. One type of X-ray emission even appears specific to that category, the gamma Cas phenomenon. Its actual incidence has been particularly difficult to assess. Thanks to four semesters of sky survey data taken by SRG (Spectrum Roentgen Gamma)/eROSITA, we revisit the question of the X-ray properties of Be stars. Amongst a large catalog of Be stars, eROSITA achieved 170 detections (20% of sample), mostly corresponding to the earliest spectral types and/or close objects. While X-ray luminosities show an uninterrupted increasing trend with the X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratios, the X-ray hardness was split between a large group of soft (and fainter on average) sources and a smaller group of hard (and brighter on average) sources. The latter category gathers at least 34 sources, nearly all displaying early spectral types. Only a third of them were known before to display such X-ray properties. The actual incidence of hard and bright X-rays amongst early-type Be stars within 100--1000pc appears to be ~12%, which is far from negligible. At the other extreme, no bright supersoft X-ray emission seem to be associated to any of our targets.

 - **Abstract**
 We complete the analysis of planetary candidates found by the KMT AnomalyFinder for the 2017 prime fields that cover $\sim 13\,{\rm deg}^2$. We report 3 unambiguous planets: OGLE-2017-BLG-0640, OGLE-2017-BLG-1275, and OGLE-2017-BLG-1237. The first two of these were not previously identified, while the last was not previously published due to technical complications induced by a nearby variable. We further report that a fourth anomalous event, the previously recognized OGLE-2017-BLG-1777, is very likely to be planetary, although its light curve requires unusually complex modeling because the lens and source both have orbiting companions. One of the 3 unambiguous planets, OGLE-2017-BLG-1275 is the first AnomalyFinder discovery that has a {\it Spitzer} microlens parallax measurement, $\pi_E \sim 0.045\pm0.015$, implying that this planetary system almost certainly lies in the Galactic bulge. In the order listed, the four planetary events have planet-host mass ratios $q$, and normalized projected separations $s$, of $(\log q,s)$ = $(-2.31,0.61)$, $(-2.06,0.63/1.09)$, $(-2.10,1.04)$, and $(-2.86,0.72)$. Combined with previously published events, the 2017 AnomalyFinder prime fields contain 11 unambiguous planets with well-measured $q$ and one very likely candidate, of which 3 are AnomalyFinder discoveries. In addition to these 12, there are three other unambiguous planets with large uncertainties in $q$.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the eccentricity measurement threshold of LISA for gravitational waves radiated by massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with redshifted BH masses $M_z$ in the range $10^{4.5}\mbox{-}10^{7.5}~{\rm M}_\odot$ at redshift $z=1$. The eccentricity can be an important tracer of the environment where MBHBs evolve to reach the merger phase. To consider LISA's motion and apply the time delay interferometry, we employ the lisabeta software and produce year-long eccentric waveforms using the inspiral-only post-Newtonian model TaylorF2Ecc. We study the minimum measurable eccentricity ($e_{\rm min}$, defined at one year before the merger) analytically by computing matches and Fisher matrices, and numerically via Bayesian inference by varying both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. We find that $e_{\rm min}$ has a strong dependence on $M_z$ and a weak dependence on mass ratio and extrinsic parameters. Match-based signal-to-noise ratio criterion suggest that LISA will be able to detect $e_{\rm min}\sim10^{-2.5}$ for lighter systems ($M_z\lesssim10^{5.5}~{\rm M}_\odot$) and $\sim10^{-1.5}$ for heavier MBHBs with a $90\%$ confidence. Bayesian inference with Fisher initialization and a zero noise realization pushes this limit to $e_{\rm min}\sim10^{-2.75}$ for lower-mass binaries assuming a $<50\%$ relative error. Bayesian inference can recover injected eccentricities of $0.1$ and $10^{-2.75}$ for a $10^5~{\rm M}_\odot$ system with a $\sim10^{-2}\%$ and a $\sim10\%$ relative errors, respectively. Both analytical and numerical methodologies provide almost consistent results for our systems of interest. LISA will launch in a decade, making this study valuable and timely to prepare for unlocking the mysteries of the MBHB evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of giant planets has traditionally been divided into two pathways: core accretion and gravitational instability. However, in recent years, gravitational instability has become less favored, primarily due to the scarcity of observations of fragmented protoplanetary disks around young stars and low occurrence rate of massive planets on very wide orbits. In this study, we present a SPHERE/IRDIS polarized light observation of the young outbursting object V960 Mon. The image reveals a vast structure of intricately shaped scattered light with several spiral arms. This finding motivated a re-analysis of archival ALMA 1.3 mm data acquired just two years after the onset of the outburst of V960 Mon. In these data, we discover several clumps of continuum emission aligned along a spiral arm that coincides with the scattered light structure. We interpret the localized emission as fragments formed from a spiral arm under gravitational collapse. Estimating the mass of solids within these clumps to be of several Earth masses, we suggest this observation to be the first evidence of gravitational instability occurring on planetary scales. This study discusses the significance of this finding for planet formation and its potential connection with the outbursting state of V960 Mon.

 - **Abstract**
 Starting from a recently proposed framework for the evaluation of the cosmological averages, we evaluate the higher-order moments for the distribution of a given observable. Then, we explicitly discuss the case of the Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram and evaluate its skewness at the leading order in the cosmological perturbative expansion of the gravitational potential. In particular, we focus on perturbations of the luminosity distance due to gravitational lensing. Finally, we discuss our findings in view of recent numerical relativistic simulations, confirming that the skewness in the Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram primarily originates from the late-time matter bispectrum, with other line-of-sight projection effects being sub-dominant.
#### Themal Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements and cosmic infrared background  leakage mitigation combining upcoming ground-based telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 The Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) and the Simons Observatory Large Aperture Telescope (SO\ LAT) will deliver unprecedented high-resolution measurements of microwave sky emissions. Notably, one of those microwave sky emissions, the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signal, is an essential probe for cluster astrophysics and cosmology. However, an obstacle to its measurement is contamination by the cosmic infrared background (CIB), especially at high frequencies. Our goal is to assess the detection and purity of tSZ power spectrum measurements from these two telescopes. We demonstrate that FYST's high-frequency coverage helps lower CIB contamination and improves signal detection. We simulated the various components of the microwave sky at the frequencies, sensitivities, and beam sizes of the upcoming SO LAT and FYST telescopes using full-sky Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation (HEALPix) map templates from the Websky simulations and the Python Sky Model (PySM). We used a map-based internal linear combination (ILC) and a constrained ILC (CILC) to extract the tSZ signal and compute residual noises to assess CIB contamination and signal recovery. We find that the CIB's residual noise power spectrum in the ILC-recovered tSZ is lowered by $\sim 35\%$ on average over the scales $\ell \in [500,5000]$ when SO LAT and FYST are combined compared to when SO LAT is used alone. We find that when using CILC to deproject CIB, the combined abilities of SO LAT and FYST offer a large $\ell \in [1800,3500]$ window in which the recovered tSZ power spectrum is not noise dominated.

 - **Abstract**
 We report optical observations of the millisecond pulsar binary system PSR J1622-0315 with the Lulin 1m telescope in Taiwan and the Lijiang 2.4m telescope in China between 2019 and 2021. The companion of the pulsar, which is of V~19 mag, showed ellipsoidal-distorted orbital variations in its light curves. The best-fit model to the light curves, with the binary code PHOEBE, gives a companion mass of 0.122+/-0.006 M_sun. This places PSR J1622-0315 in the spider-system subclass. We compared the properties of PSR J1622-0315 with other spider pulsar binaries for the scalings between the spin-down luminosity derived for the pulsar, irradiation luminosity of the companion, and X-ray luminosity of the binary. We find that pulsar irradiation in PSR J1622-0315 is insignificant and the irradiation luminosity of the transitional millisecond pulsars PSR J1023+0038 and PSR J1227-4853 are the highest among the redback systems.
#### Reverberation of pulsar wind nebulae (III): Modelling of the plasma  interface empowering a long term radiative evolution

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) present in the Galaxy is formed by middle-aged systems characterized by a strong interaction of the PWN itself with the supernova remnant (SNR). Unfortunately, modelling these systems can be quite complex and numerically expensive, due to the non-linearity of the PWN-SNR evolution even in the simple 1D / one-zone case when the reverse shock of the SNR reaches the PWN, and the two begin to interact (and reverberation starts). Here we introduce a new numerical technique that couples the numerical efficiency of the one-zone thin shell approach with the reliability of a full ``lagrangian'' evolution, able to correctly reproduce the PWN-SNR interaction during the reverberation and to consistently evolve the particle spectrum beyond. Based on our previous findings, we show that our novel strategy resolves many of the uncertainties present in previous approaches, as the arbitrariness in the SNR structure, and ensure a robust evolution, compatible with results that can be obtained with more complex 1D dynamical approaches. Our approach enable us for the first time to provide reliable spectral models of the later compression phases in the evolution of PWNe. While in general we found that the compression is less extreme than that obtained without such detailed dynamical considerations, leading to the formation of less structured spectral energy distributions, we still find that a non negligible fraction of PWNe might experience a super-efficient phase, with the optical and/or X-ray luminosity exceeding the spin-down one.
#### XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL observations of the bright GRB 230307A :  vanishing of the local absorption and limits on the dust in the Magellanic  Bridge

 - **Abstract**
 230307A is the second brightest gamma ray burst detected in more than 50 years of observations and is located in the direction of the Magellanic Bridge. Despite its long duration, it is most likely the result of the compact merger of a binary ejected from a galaxy in the local universe (redshift z=0.065). Our XMM-Newton observation of its afterglow at 4.5 days shows a power-law spectrum with photon index $\Gamma =1.73 \pm0.10$, unabsorbed flux $F_{0.3-10\,\rm keV}=(8.8\pm0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and no absorption in excess of that produced in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Bridge. We derive a limit of $N_{\rm H}^{\rm HOST} < 5\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the absorption at the GRB redshift, which is a factor $\sim\,$5 below the value measured during the prompt phase. We searched for the presence of dust scattering rings with negative results and set an upper limit of the order of $A_V<0.05$ on the absorption from dust in the Magellanic Bridge.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection of the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization via the redshifted 21-cm line of neutral Hydrogen will have unprecedented implications for studying structure formation in the early Universe. This exciting goal is challenged by the difficulty of extracting the faint 21-cm signal buried beneath bright astrophysical foregrounds and contaminated by numerous systematics. Here, we focus on improving the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) signal separation method originally developed for LOFAR observations. We address a key limitation of the current approach by incorporating covariance prior models learnt from 21-cm signal simulations using Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Interpolatory Autoencoder (IAE). Extensive tests are conducted to evaluate GPR, VAE-GPR, and IAE-GPR in different scenarios. Our findings reveal that the new method outperforms standard GPR in component separation tasks. Moreover, the improved method demonstrates robustness when applied to signals not represented in the training set. It also presents a certain degree of resilience to data systematics, highlighting its ability to effectively mitigate their impact on the signal recovery process. However, our findings also underscore the importance of accurately characterizing and understanding these systematics to achieve successful detection. Our generative approaches provide good results even with limited training data, offering a valuable advantage when a large training set is not feasible. Comparing the two algorithms, IAE-GPR shows slightly higher fidelity in recovering power spectra compared to VAE-GPR. These advancements highlight the strength of generative approaches and optimise the analysis techniques for future 21-cm signal detection at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) has been reported in the nano-Hertz band. Interpreting the origin of this background to be scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we explore the equation of state (EoS) of the early universe by performing Bayes parameter inferences across the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), cosmic microwave background (CMB), and pulsar timing array (PTA) joint observations for the first time. Assuming a monochromatic power spectrum for primordial curvature perturbations, we obtain the spectral amplitude $A\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ and spectral peak frequency $f_\ast\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ Hz. We find that the radiation domination with EoS $w=1/3$ is compatible with the current observational data, the kination domination with EoS $w=1$ is not forbidden, while the early matter domination with EoS $w=0$ is excluded at more than $2\sigma$ confidence level. These results can be tested with future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Evolutionary calculations for stars in close binary systems are in high demand to obtain better constraints on gravitational wave source progenitors, understand transient events from stellar interactions, and more. Modern one-dimensional stellar codes make use of the Roche lobe radius $R_{\rm L}$ concept in order to treat stars in binary systems. If the stellar companion is approaching its $R_{\rm L}$, mass transfer treatment is initiated. However, the effective acceleration also affects the evolution of a star in a close binary system. This is different from the gravity inside a single star, whether that single star is rotating or not. Here, we present numerically obtained tables of properties of stars in a binary system as a function of the effective potential: volume-equivalent radii of the equipotential surfaces, effective accelerations and the inverse effective accelerations averaged over the same equipotential surfaces, and the properties of the L1 plane cross-sections. The tables are obtained for binaries where the ratios of the primary star mass to the companion star mass are from $10^{-6}$ to $10^5$ and include equipotential surfaces up to the star's outer Lagrangian point. We describe the numerical methods used to obtain these quantities and report how we verified the numerical results. We also describe and verify the method to obtain the effective acceleration for non-point mass distributions. We supply a sample code showing how to use our tables to get the average effective accelerations in one-dimensional stellar codes.

 - **Abstract**
 In the latest data release from the Fermi $\gamma$-Ray Space Telescope (the 4th Fermi LAT 12-year Catalog or 4FGL) more than 50% of the Galactic sources are yet to be identified. We observed thirteen unidentified Fermi LAT sources with Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO) to explore their nature. We report the results of the classification of X-ray sources in the fields of these $\gamma$-ray sources and discuss the implications for their nature. We use the multiwavelength (MW) data for machine-learning classification accompanied by a more detailed spectral/variability analysis for brighter sources. Seven 4FGL sources have $\gamma$-ray pulsars within their position error ellipses. Three of these pulsars are either detected in the CXO images or show hints of X-ray emission. Within the positional uncertainties of three 4FGL sources we detect X-ray sources that may be yet unknown pulsars, depending on the MW association. In addition to point sources, we discovered 2 extended sources one of which is likely to be a bowshock pulsar-wind nebula associated with PSR J1358.3-6026. Finally, we classify other X-ray sources detected in these observations and report most interesting classifications.

 - **Abstract**
 With its near-to-mid-infrared high contrast imaging capabilities, JWST is ushering us into a golden age of directly imaging Jupiter-like planets. As the two closest cold Jupiters, $\varepsilon$ Ind A b and $\varepsilon$ Eridani b have sufficiently wide orbits and adequate infrared emissions to be detected by JWST. To detect more Jupiter-like planets for direct imaging, we develop a GOST-based method to analyze radial velocity data and multiple Gaia data releases simultaneously. Without approximating instantaneous astrometry by catalog astrometry, this approach enables the use of multiple Gaia data releases for detection of both short-period and long-period planets. We determine a mass of $2.96_{-0.38}^{+0.41}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and a period of $42.92_{-4.09}^{+6.38}$ yr for $\varepsilon$ Ind A b. We also find a mass of $0.76_{-0.11}^{+0.14}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, a period of $7.36_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$ yr, and an eccentricity of 0.26$_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ for $\varepsilon$ Eridani b. The eccentricity differs from that given by some previous solutions probably due to the sensitivity of orbital eccentricity to noise modeling. Our work refines the constraints on orbits and masses of the two nearest Jupiters and demonstrate the feasibility of using multiple Gaia data releases to constrain Jupiter-like planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of white dwarf atmospheres is crucial for accurately deriving stellar parameters such as effective temperature, mass, and age. We aim to classify the population of white dwarfs up to 500 pc into hydrogen-rich or hydrogen-deficient atmospheres based on Gaia spectra and to derive an accurate spectral type-temperature distribution of white dwarfs as a function of the effective temperature for the largest observed unbiased sample of these objects. We took advantage of the recent Gaia low-resolution spectra available for 76,657 white dwarfs up to 500 pc. We calculated synthetic J-PAS narrow-band photometry and fitted the spectral energy distribution of each object with up-to-date models for hydrogen-rich and helium-rich white dwarf atmospheres. We estimated the probability for a white dwarf to have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and validated the results using the Montreal White Dwarf Database. Finally, precise effective temperature values were derived for each object using La Plata evolutionary models. We have successfully classified a total of 65,310 white into DAs and non-DAs with an accuracy of 94%. An unbiased subsample of nearly 34,000 objects was built, from which we computed a precise spectral distribution spanning an effective temperature range from 5,500 to 40,000 K, while accounting for potential selection effects. Some characteristic features of the spectral evolution, such as the deficit of helium-rich stars at T_eff $\approx$35,000-40,000 K and in the range 22,000 < T_eff < 25,000 K, as well as a gradual increase from 18,000K to T_eff $\approx$7,000K, where the non-DA stars percentage reaches its maximum of 41%, followed by a decrease for cooler temperatures, are statistically significant. These findings will provide precise constraints for the proposed models of spectral evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the non-linear corrections entering in the calculation of the primordial black hole abundance from the non-linear radiation transfer function and the determination of the true physical horizon crossing. We show that the current standard techniques to calculate the abundance of primordial black holes suffer from uncertainties and argue that the primordial black hole abundance may be much smaller than what routinely considered. This would imply, among other consequences, that the interpretation of the recent pulsar timing arrays data from scalar-induced gravitational waves may not be ruled out because of an overproduction of primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] In contemporary literature, the calculation of modifications to the inflationary scalar power spectrum due to the loops from the higher order interaction terms in the Hamiltonian have led to a discussion regarding the validity of perturbation theory. Recently, there have been efforts to examine the contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the loops arising from the cubic order terms in the action describing the perturbations, specifically in inflationary scenarios that permit an epoch of ultra slow roll (USR). A phase of USR inflation leads to significant observational consequences, such as the copious production of primordial black holes. In this work, we study the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum in a scenario of USR inflation arising due to the quartic order terms in the action describing the scalar perturbations. We compute the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the dominant term in the action at the quartic order. We consider a scenario wherein a phase of USR is sandwiched between two stages of slow roll inflation and analyze the behavior of the loop contributions in terms of the parameters involved. We examine the late, intermediate and early epochs of USR during inflation. In the inflationary scenario involving a late phase of USR, for reasonable choices of the parameters, we show that the loop corrections are negligible for the entire range of wave numbers. In the intermediate case, the contributions from the loops prove to be scale invariant over large scales, and we find that these contributions can amount to 30% of the leading order power spectrum. In the case wherein USR sets in early, we find that the loop contributions could be negative and can dominate the power spectrum at the leading order, which indicates a breakdown of the perturbative expansion. We conclude with a brief summary and outlook.

 Ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos (UHE), with energies above 100 PeV, are unparalleled probes of the most energetic astrophysical sources and weak interactions at energies beyond the reach of accelerators. GRAND is an envisioned observatory of UHE particles - neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays - consisting of 200,000 radio antennas deployed in sub-arrays at different locations worldwide. GRAND aims to detect the radio emission from air showers induced by UHE particle interactions in the atmosphere and underground. For neutrinos, it aims to reach a flux sensitivity of $\sim 10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, with a sub-degree angular resolution, which would allow it to test the smallest predicted diffuse fluxes of UHE neutrinos and to discover point sources. The GRAND Collaboration operates three prototype detector arrays simultaneously: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRANDProto300 in China, and GRAND@Auger in Argentina. The primary purpose of GRAND@Nan\c cay is to serve as a testbench for hardware and triggering systems. On the other hand, GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger are exploratory projects that pave the way for future stages of GRAND. GRANDProto300 is being built to demonstrate autonomous radio-detection of inclined air showers and study cosmic rays near the proposed transition between galactic and extragalactic sources. All three arrays are in the commissioning stages. It is expected that by 2028, the detector units of the final design could be produced and deployed, marking the establishment of two GRAND10k arrays in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We will survey preliminary designs, simulation results, construction plans, and the extensive research program made possible by GRAND.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematic study of a thousand of dwarf satellites of MW/M31-like hosts from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Internal kinematics were derived for all the snapshots to obtain a historical record of their rotation velocity in the plane of the sky ($|V_T|$) and the amplitude of their velocity gradients along the line of sight ($A_{\rm grad}^{v_z}$) measured from the host. For the majority of the satellites we initially detected rotation in the plane of the sky (65%) or velocity gradients (80%), and this was progressively reduced to 45% and 68% at $z = 0$ respectively. We find that the evolution of the rotation in the plane of the sky and the velocity gradients differs according to type of dwarfs, which could be explained in terms of their different masses and orbital histories. We observe that interaction with the host has an impact on the evolution of the internal kinematics of the satellites. The rotation signal of the satellites is progressively reduced during pericentric passages, the first pericentre being especially disruptive for the initial kinematics. We observe temporary increases in $A_{\rm grad}^{v_z}$ during pericentric passage caused by tidal interaction with the host, $A_{\rm grad}^{v_z}$ increasing as the satellites approach their pericentre and dropping as they move away. In summary, we conclude that the presence of detectable rotation in dwarf satellites is not uncommon, and that the evolution of their internal kinematics is clearly affected by their interaction with the host.
