 - **Abstract**
 We present highly sampled photometry of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf, a Type II SN in M101, beginning 2 days before its first known detection. To gather these data, we enlisted the global Unistellar Network of citizen scientists. These 252 observations from 115 telescopes show the SN's rising brightness associated with shock emergence followed by gradual decay. We measure a peak $M_{V}$ = -18.18 $\pm$ 0.09 mag at 2023-05-25 21:37 UTC in agreement with previously published analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to both extract more information than the traditional two-point statistics from cosmological fields, and marginalise over astrophysical effects extremely well. However, CNNs require large amounts of training data, which is potentially problematic in the domain of expensive cosmological simulations, and it is difficult to interpret the network. In this work we apply the learnable scattering transform, a kind of convolutional neural network that uses trainable wavelets as filters, to the problem of cosmological inference and marginalisation over astrophysical effects. We present two models based on the scattering transform, one constructed for performance, and one constructed for interpretability, and perform a comparison with a CNN. We find that scattering architectures are able to outperform a CNN, significantly in the case of small training data samples. Additionally we present a lightweight scattering network that is highly interpretable.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter will go through the important nuclear reactions in stellar evolution and explosions, passing through the individual stellar burning stages and also explosive burning conditions. To follow the changes in the composition of nuclear abundances requires the knowledge of the relevant nuclear reaction rates. For light nuclei (entering in early stellar burning stages) the resonance density is generally quite low and the reactions are determined by individual resonances, which are best obtained from experiments. For intermediate mass and heavy nuclei the level density is typically sufficient to apply statistical model approaches. For this reason, while we discuss all burning stages and explosive burning, focusing on the reactions of importance, we will for light nuclei refer to the chapters by M. Wiescher, deBoer & Reifarth (Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics) and P. Descouvement (Theoretical Studies of Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions), which display many examples, experimental methods utilized, and theoretical approaches how to predict nuclear reaction rates for light nuclei. For nuclei with sufficiently high level densities we discuss statistical model methods used in present predictions of nuclear reaction cross sections and thermonuclear rates across the nuclear chart, including also the application to nuclei far from stability and fission modes.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of aerosols is intimately linked to the global energy budget and composition of planet atmospheres. Their ability to reflect incoming light prevents energy from being deposited into the atmosphere, and they shape spectra of exoplanets. We observed one near-infrared secondary eclipse of WASP-80b with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to provide constraints on the presence and properties of atmospheric aerosols. We detect a broadband eclipse depth of $34\pm10$ ppm for WASP-80b, making this the lowest equilibrium temperature planet for which a secondary eclipse has been detected so far with WFC3. We detect a higher planetary flux than expected from thermal emission alone at $1.6\sigma$ that hints toward the presence of reflecting aerosols on this planet's dayside. We paired the WFC3 data with Spitzer data and explored multiple atmospheric models with and without aerosols to interpret this spectrum. Albeit consistent with a clear dayside atmosphere, we found a slight preference for near-solar metallicities and for dayside clouds over hazes. We exclude soot haze formation rates higher than $10^{-10.7}$ g cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and tholin formation rates higher than $10^{-12.0}$ g cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$. We applied the same atmospheric models to a previously published WFC3/Spitzer transmission spectrum for this planet and find weak haze formation. A single soot haze formation rate best fits both the dayside and the transmission spectra simultaneously. However, we emphasize that no models provide satisfactory fits in terms of chi-square of both spectra simultaneously, indicating longitudinal dissimilarity in the atmosphere's aerosol composition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST/MRS spectrum of the quasar J1120+0641 at z=7.0848, the first spectroscopic observation of a reionisation-era quasar in the rest-frame infrared ($0.6<\lambda<3.4\mu$m). In the context of the mysterious fast assembly of the first supermassive black holes at z>7, our observations enable for the first time the detection of hot torus dust, the H$\alpha$ emission line, and the Paschen-series broad emission lines in a quasar at z>7. Hot torus dust is clearly detected as an upturn in the continuum emission at $\lambda_{\text{rest}}\simeq1.3\mu$m, leading to a black-body temperature of $T=1413.5^{+5.7}_{-7.4}$K. Compared to similarly-luminous quasars at 0<z<6, the hot dust in J1120+0641 is somewhat elevated in temperature (top 1%). The temperature is more typical among 6<z<6.5 quasars (top 25%), leading us to postulate a weak evolution in the hot dust temperature at z>6 ($2\sigma$ significance). We measure the black hole mass of J1120+0641 based on the H$\alpha$ Balmer line, $M_{\text{BH}}=1.52\pm0.17\cdot 10^9 M_\odot$, which is in good agreement with the previous rest-UV MgII black hole mass measurement. The black hole mass based on the Paschen-series lines is also consistent, indicating no significant extinction in the rest-frame UV measurement. The broad H$\alpha$, Pa-$\alpha$ and Pa-$\beta$ emission lines are consistent with an origin in a common broad-line region (BLR) with density log$N_H/\text{cm}^{-3}\geq 12$, ionisation parameter $-7<$log$U<-4$, and extinction E(B-V)$\lesssim 0.1$mag. These BLR parameters are consistent with similarly-bright quasars at 0<z<4. Overall, we find that both J1120+0641's hot dust torus and hydrogen BLR properties show no significant peculiarity when compared to luminous quasars down to z=0. The quasar accretion structures must have therefore assembled very quickly, as they appear fully "mature" less than 760 million years after the Big Bang.
#### The evolution of the Milky Way's thin disc radial metallicity gradient  with K2 asteroseismic ages

 - **Abstract**
 The radial metallicity distribution of the Milky Way's disc is an important observational constraint for models of the formation and evolution of our Galaxy. It informs our understanding of the chemical enrichment of the Galactic disc and the dynamical processes therein, particularly radial migration. We investigate how the metallicity changes with guiding radius in the thin disc using a sample of red-giant stars with robust astrometric, spectroscopic and asteroseismic parameters. Our sample contains $668$ stars with guiding radii $4$ kpc < $R_\mathrm{g}$ < $11$ kpc and asteroseismic ages covering the whole history of the thin disc with precision $\approx 25\%$. We use MCMC analysis to measure the gradient and its intrinsic spread in bins of age and construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to investigate the evolution of these parameters independently of the bins. We find a smooth evolution of the gradient from $\approx -0.07$ dex/kpc in the youngest stars to $\approx -0.04$ dex/kpc in stars older than $10$ Gyr, with no break at intermediate ages. Our results are consistent with those based on asteroseismic ages from CoRoT, with that found in Cepheid variables for stars younger than $1$ Gyr, and with open clusters for stars younger than $6$ Gyr. For older stars we find a significantly lower metallicity in our sample than in the clusters, suggesting a survival bias favouring more metal-rich clusters. We also find that the chemical evolution model of Chiappini (2009) is too metal-poor in the early stages of disc formation. Our results provide strong new constraints for the growth and enrichment of the thin disc and radial migration, which will facilitate new tests of model conditions and physics.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14473
 - **Abstract**
 The light element lithium is formed by nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang. Its abundance can help to define the parameters of the early universe. To find this primordial value, it is necessary to determine Li abundances in the oldest stars because it is readily destroyed by nuclear reactions in stellar interiors. We have made high-resolution (~45,000) spectroscopic observations of five identical unevolved turn-off stars in the 13 Gyr old globular cluster M5. In our analysis we find a range in Li abundance of a factor of two; the spread is five times the individual error. The comparison of these results with those for turn-off stars from five other globular clusters reveals similarly large range in Li. Lithium in M5 and the other clusters all have stars above the field star Li plateau, but none are as high as the predictions for primordial Li. The maximum values for Li are the same in all six clusters. Multiple generations of stars are found in many globular clusters; those later generations are expected to have formed from Li-depleted gas. Such second- and later-generation stars would have no Li. However, only one of the six clusters has a few unevolved stars with upper limits on the Li abundance.
#### CEERS MIRI Imaging: Data Reduction and Quality Assessment

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS), targeting the Extended Groth Strip extragalactic field, is one of the JWST Director's Discretionary Early Release Science programs. To date, all observations have been executed and include NIRCam/MIRI imaging and NIRSpec/NIRCam spectroscopic exposures. Here, we discuss the MIRI imaging, which includes eight pointings, four of which provide deep imaging with the bluer bands (F560W, F770W) and four with contiguous wavelength coverage in F1000W, F1280W, F1500W, and F1800W, where two of these also include coverage in F770W and F2100W. We present a summary of the data, the data quality, and data reduction. The data reduction is based on the JWST Calibration Pipeline combined with custom modifications and additional steps designed to enhance the output quality, including improvements in astrometry and the removal of detector artifacts. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics, and show that these generally agree with expectations from the Exposure Time Calculator. We compare the MIRI F560W and F770W flux densities for bright sources to measurements from Spitzer/IRAC Ch3 (5.8 $\mu$m) and Ch4 (8.0 $\mu$m), and we find that they agree with systematic differences of $<0.1$ mag. For the redder MIRI bands, we assess their quality by studying the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Galactic stars. The SEDs are consistent with the expected Rayleigh-Jeans law with a deviation $\sim 0.03$ mag, indicating that the MIRI colors are reliable. We also discuss all publicly released data products (images and source catalogs), which are available on the CEERS website (https://ceers.github.io/).
#### Dust enrichment and grain growth in a smooth disk around the DG Tau  protostar revealed by ALMA triple bands frequency observations

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the physical properties of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk is critical to comprehending the planet formation process. Our study presents ALMA high-resolution observations of the young protoplanetary disk around DG Tau at a 1.3 mm dust continuum. The observations, with a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.04''$, or $\approx5$ au, revealed a geometrically thin and smooth disk without substantial substructures, suggesting that the disk retains the initial conditions of the planet formation. To further analyze the distributions of dust surface density, temperature, and grain size, we conducted a multi-band analysis with several dust models, incorporating ALMA archival data of the 0.87 mm and 3.1 mm dust polarization. The results showed that the Toomre $Q$ parameter is $\lesssim2$ at a 20 au radius, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01. This implies that a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio is necessary to stabilize the disk. The grain sizes depend on the dust models, and for the DSHARP compact dust, they were found to be smaller than $\sim400$ $\mu$m in the inner region ($r\lesssim20$ au), while exceeding larger than 3 mm in the outer part. Radiative transfer calculations show that the dust scale height is lower than at least one-third of the gas scale height. These distributions of dust enrichment, grain sizes, and weak turbulence strength may have significant implications for the formation of planetesimals through mechanisms such as streaming instability. We also discuss the CO snowline effect and collisional fragmentation in dust coagulation for the origin of the dust size distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Past results from the IceCube Collaboration have suggested that the blazar TXS 0506+056 is a potential source of astrophysical neutrinos. However, in the years since there have been numerous updates to event processing and reconstruction, as well as improvements to the statistical methods used to search for astrophysical neutrino sources. These improvements in combination with additional years of data have resulted in the identification of NGC 1068 as a second neutrino source candidate. This talk will re-examine time-dependent neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 using the most recent northern-sky data sample that was used in the analysis of NGC 1068. The results of using this updated data sample to obtain a significance and flux fit for the 2014 TXS 0506+056 "untriggered" neutrino flare are reported
#### On the origin of outward migration of Population III stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14562
 - **Abstract**
 Outward migration of massive binary stars or black holes in their circumbinary disc is often observed in simulations and it is key to the formation of wide black hole binaries. Using numerical simulations of Population III (Pop III) star formation, we study the angular momentum of Pop III binaries and the torques between stars and gas discs to understand the origin of outward migration and high ellipticity. The outward migration of protostars is produced by gravitational torques exerted on them by their circumstellar minidiscs. The minidiscs, on the other hand, migrate outward mainly by gaining angular momentum by accreting gas from the circumbinary disc. The angular momentum transfer is most efficient for rapidly accreting equal-mass binaries, and weaker when the secondary mass is small or the massive companion evaporates the gas disc via radiative feedback. We conclude that outward migration and the formation of wide equal-mass massive binaries is common in metal-free/metal-poor star formation, mainly driven by their large accretion rates. We expect that the lower gas temperature and accretion rates in metal-enriched circumstellar discs would lead more often to inward migration and closer binary separations. We also observe inward migration for smaller mass Pop III protostars/fragments, leading to the rapid merging of sink particles and likely the formation of close binary black holes that, however, reach separations below the resolution of our simulations. We discuss the implications that Pop III separations and ellipticity may have on the interpretation that gravitational wave signals from merging intermediate-mass black holes come from Pop III remnants.
#### Performance studies on new 4" photomultiplier types intended for  IceCube-Gen2 optical modules

 - **Abstract**
 In the upcoming IceCube-Gen2 extension, the newly developed optical modules will include 4-inch PMTs. For this purpose, the manufacturers Hamamatsu and North Night Vision Technology have developed new PMT models to meet the requirements of the IceCube-Gen2 science case. The specifications include strict requirements on temporal resolution, detection efficiency, and dark noise. We summarize the efforts to measure these performance characteristics and show that both PMT models meet the performance specifications set by IceCube-Gen2. Prototype optical modules based on both PMT models will be deployed with the IceCube Upgrade in order to test them in situ and help decide on a vendor for the Gen2 extension.
#### White-light superflare and long-term activity of the nearby M7 type  binary EI~Cnc observed with GWAC system

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar white-light flares are believed to play an essential role on the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere of the surrounding exoplanets. Here we report an optical monitoring campaign on the nearby flaring system EI~Cnc carried out by the Ground-based Wide Angle Cameras (GWAC) and its dedicated follow-up telescope. A superflare, coming from the brighter component EI~CncA, was detected and observed, in which four components are required to properly model the complex decay light curve. The lower limit of flare energy in the $R-$band is estimated to be $3.3\times10^{32}$ ergs. 27 flares are additionally detected from the GWAC archive data with a total duration of 290 hours. The inferred cumulative flare frequency distribution follows a quite shallow power-law function with a slope of $\beta=-0.50\pm 0.03$ over the energy range between $10^{30}$ and $10^{33}$ erg, which reinforces the trend that stars cooler than M4 show enhanced superflare activity. The flares identified in EI~Cnc enable us to extend the $\tau-E$ relationship previously established in the white-light superflares of solar-type stars down to an energy as low as $\sim10^{30}$erg (i.e., by three orders): $\tau\propto E^{0.42\pm0.02}$, which suggests a common flare mechanism for stars with a type from M to solar-like, and implies an invariant of $B^{1/3}\upsilon_{\rm A}$ in the white-light flares.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14604
 - **Abstract**
 We studied the polarization properties of Cygnus X--1 in both hard and soft spectral states with Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations. The polarization degree is $\sim 4\%$, and $\sim 2.6-2.8\%$ in the hard and soft states, respectively. The polarization angle is observed along the jet axis and remains the same in both states. Energy-dependent analysis revealed an increasing polarization with the energy. The observed polarization rules out the lamp-post corona and prefers a conical corona if the coronal geometry remains the same in the hard and soft states. The polarization degree is found to be higher for the disk emission, compare to the coronal emission. The scattering of the seed photons inside the corona is likely to reduce the polarization. This could explain the different polarization in different spectral states.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of massive neutrinos and their interactions is a critical aspect of contemporary cosmology. Recent advances in parallel computation and high-performance computing provide new opportunities for accurately constraining Large-Scale Structures (LSS). In this paper, we introduce the TianNu cosmological N-body simulation during the co-evolution of massive neutrino and cold dark matter components via the CUBEP$^3$M code running on the supercomputer Tianhe-2 and TianNu's connected works. We start by analyzing $2.537\times10^7$ dark halos from the scientific data of TianNu simulation, and compare their angular momentum with the matched halos from neutrino-free TianZero, revealing a dependence of angular momentum modulus on neutrino injection at scales below 50 Mpc and around 10 Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy of the transition from Galactic to extra-galactic origin of cosmic rays is one of the major unresolved issues of cosmic-ray physics. However, strong constraints can be obtained from studying the anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays. The sensitivity to cosmic-ray anisotropy is, in particular, a matter of statistics. Recently, the cosmic ray anisotropy measurements in the TeV to PeV energy range were updated from IceCube using 11 years of data. The IceCube-Gen2 surface array will cover an area about 8 times larger than the existing IceTop surface array with a corresponding increase in statistics and capability to investigate cosmic-ray anisotropy with higher sensitivity. In this contribution, we present details on the performed simulation studies and sensitivity to the cosmic-ray anisotropy signal for the IceCube-Gen2 surface array.
#### Rocky sub-Neptunes formed by pebble accretion: Rain of rocks from  polluted envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptune planets formed in the protoplanetary disk accreted hydrogen-helium (H,He) envelopes. Planet formation models of sub-Neptunes formed by pebble accretion result in small rocky cores surrounded by polluted H,He envelopes where most of the rock (silicate) is in vapor form at the end of the formation phase. This vapor is expected to condense and rain-out as the planet cools. In this Letter we examine the timescale for the rainout and its effect on the thermal evolution. We calculate the thermal and structural evolution of a 10 Earth masses planet formed by pebble accretion, taking into account material redistribution from silicate rainout (condensation and settling) and from convective mixing. We find that the duration of the rainout in sub-Neptunes is on Gyr timescale and varies with envelope mass: planets with envelopes below 0.75 Earth mass rainout into a core-envelope structure in less than 1 Gyr, while planets in excess of 0.75 Earth mass of H,He preserve some of their envelope pollution for billions of years. The energy released by the rainout inflates the radius with respect to planets that start out from a plain core-envelope structure. This inflation would result in estimates of the H,He contents of observed exoplanets based on the standard core-envelope structure to be too high.We identify a number of planets in the exoplanet census where rainout may operate, which would result in their H,He contents to be overestimated by up to a factor two. Future accurate age measurements by the PLATO mission may allow the identification of planets formed with polluted envelopes.

 FRB 20210912A is a fast radio burst (FRB), detected and localised to sub-arcsecond precision by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. No host galaxy has been identified for this burst despite the high precision of its localisation and deep optical and infrared follow-up, to 5-$\sigma$ limits of $R=26.7$ mag and $K_\mathrm{s}=24.9$ mag with the Very Large Telescope. The combination of precise radio localisation and deep optical imaging has almost always resulted in the secure identification of a host galaxy, and this is the first case in which the line-of-sight is not obscured by the Galactic disk. The dispersion measure of this burst, $\mathrm{DM_{FRB}}=1233.696\pm0.006~\mathrm{pc}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, allows for a large source redshift of $z>1$ according to the Macquart relation. It could thus be that the host galaxy is consistent with the known population of FRB hosts, but is too distant to detect in our observations ($z>0.7$ for a host like that of the first repeating FRB source, FRB 20121102A); that it is more nearby with a significant excess in $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$, and thus dimmer than any known FRB host; or, least likely, that the FRB is truly hostless. We consider each possibility, making use of the population of known FRB hosts to frame each scenario. The fact of the missing host has ramifications for the FRB field: even with high-precision localisation and deep follow-up, some FRB hosts may be difficult to detect, with more distant hosts being the less likely to be found. This has implications for FRB cosmology, in which high-redshift detections are valuable.

 - **Abstract**
 We reconstructed dark spots in the images of supermassive black holes SgrA* and M87* provided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration by using the geometrically thin accretion disk model. In this model, the black hole is highlighted by the hot accretion matter up to the very vicinity of the black hole event horizon. The existence of hot accretion matter in the vicinity of black hole event horizons is predicted by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which is confirmed by recent general relativistic MHD simulations in supercomputers. A dark spot in the black hole image in the described model is a gravitationally lensed image of an event horizon globe. The lensed images of event horizons are always projected at the celestial sphere inside the awaited positions of the classical black hole shadows, which are invisible in both cases of M87* and SgrA*. We used the sizes of dark spots in the images of SgrA* and M87* for inferring their spins, 0.65<a<0.9 and a>0.75, accordingly.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory measures high energy atmospheric neutrinos with high statistics. These atmospheric neutrinos are produced in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, mainly by the decay of pions and kaons. The rate of the measured neutrinos is affected by seasonal temperature variations in the stratosphere, which are expected to increase with the energy of the particle. In this contribution, seasonal energy spectra are obtained using a novel spectrum unfolding approach, the Dortmund Spectrum Estimation Algorithm (DSEA+), in which the energy distribution from 125 GeV to 10 TeV is estimated from measured quantities with machine learning algorithms. The seasonal spectral difference to the annual average flux will be discussed based on preliminary results from IceCube's atmospheric muon neutrino data.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the cubic kilometer detector embedded in ice of the geographic South Pole, is capable of detecting particles from several GeV up to PeV energies enabling precise neutrino spectrum measurement. The diffuse neutrino flux can be subdivided into three components: astrophysical, from extraterrestrial sources; conventional, from pion and kaon decays in atmospheric Cosmic Ray cascades; and the yet undetected prompt component from the decay of charmed hadrons. A particular focus of this work is to test the predicted angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux using an unfolding method. Unfolding is a set of methods aimed at determining a value from related quantities in a model-independent way, eliminating the influence of several assumptions made in the process. In this work, we unfold the muon neutrino energy spectrum and employ a novel technique for rebinning the observable space to ensure sufficient event numbers within the low statistic region at the highest energies. We present the unfolded energy and zenith angle spectrum reconstructed from IceCube data and compare the result with model expectations and previous measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We have classified the point-like X-ray sources detected by the SRG/eROSITA telescope in the deep Lockman Hole survey. The goal was to separate the sources into Galactic and extragalactic objects. In this work have used the results of our previous cross-match of X-ray sources with optical catalogs. To classify SRG/eROSITA sources we have used the flux ratio $F_{x}/F_{o}$ and information about the source optical extent. As a result, of the 6885 X-ray sources in the eROSITA catalog 357 sources have been classified as Galactic and 5929 and as extragalactic. 539 out of 6885 have been treated as hostless, i.e., having no optical counterparts in the optical catalogs under consideration. 60 have remained unclassified due to the insufficient reliability of optical photometry. Precision and recall for the extragalactic sources are 99.9 and 98.9% (respectively) and 91.6 and 99.7% for the Galactic sources. Using this classification, we have constructed the curves of cumulative number counts for the Galactic and extragalactic sources in the Lockman Hole field.

 - **Abstract**
 We critically examine the state of current constraints on the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w$. Our study is partially motivated by the observation that, while broadly consistent with the cosmological constant value $w=-1$, several independent probes appear to point towards a slightly phantom EoS ($w \sim -1.03$). We pay attention to the apparent preference for phantom DE from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data alone, whose origin we study in detail and attribute to a wide range of (physical and geometrical) effects. We deem the combination of Planck CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, and Cosmic Chronometers data to be particularly trustworthy, inferring from this final consensus dataset $w=-1.013^{+0.038}_{-0.043}$, in excellent agreement with the cosmological constant value. Overall, despite a few scattered hints, we find no compelling evidence forcing us away from the cosmological constant (yet).

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we measured the polarization properties of the X-rays emitted from the X-ray tubes, which were used during the calibration of the instrument onboard Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). X-ray tubes are used as a source of unpolarized X-rays to calibrate the response of the gas pixel detectors to unpolarized radiation. However, even though the characteristic fluorescent emission lines are unpolarized, continuum bremsstrahlung emission can be polarized based on the geometry of the accelerated electrons and emitted photons. Hence, characterizing the contribution of polarized X-rays from bremsstrahlung emission is of interest, also for future measurements. We find that when accelerated electrons are parallel to the emitted photons, the bremsstrahlung emission is unpolarized, and when they are perpendicular, the polarization increases with energy, as expected from the theoretical predictions. A comparison with the theoretical predictions is also shown.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has discovered a flux of astrophysical neutrinos and presented evidence for the first neutrino sources, a flaring blazar known as TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068. However, the sources responsible for the majority of the astrophysical neutrino flux remain elusive. In addition to hypothetical sources within our Galaxy, high energy neutrinos are produced when cosmic rays interact at their acceleration sites and during propagation through the interstellar medium. The Galactic plane has therefore long been hypothesized as a neutrino source. In this contribution, new results are presented for searches of neutrino sources utilizing a dataset that builds upon recent advances in deep-learning-based reconstruction methods for neutrino-induced cascades. This work presents the first observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Milky Way Galaxy, rejecting the background-only hypothesis at 4.5$\sigma$. The neutrino signal is consistent with diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, potentially in combination with emission by a population of sources.
#### Study of the variable star ASASSN-V j104912.47+274312.7; a rare peculiar  RRc star

 - **Abstract**
 During a screening in ASAS-SN database searching candidates of Delta Scuti stars with short period, our attention was drawn to the variable star ASASSN-V J104912.47+274312.7, we considered interesting to follow. It is an ASAS-SN discovery, classified by them as a RRc. We observed it for 16 nights in 2021, obtaining several maxima that allow us to refine its period. After a frequency analysis, we conclude that this star belongs to a small subgroup of RRc stars having the peculiarity to show two close frequencies with ratio greater than 0.96, without 0.61 or 0.68 period ratio mode. This behaviour is very similar to two stars found by Netzel & Smolec (2019) in OGLE data, and one star in NGC 6362, studied by Smolec et al. (2017). This large period ratios are also found as additional mode to standard double mode RRc stars (Px/Pl= 0.61-0.68) by Netzel et al. (2023).

 - **Abstract**
 The millisecond pulsar(MSP) is believed to be an old neutron star(NS) having undergone spin-up by the accreting material from the donor. Whereas, the discovery of eccentric millisecond pulsars (eMSPs) in the Galactic field challenges such a scenario producing MSP-white dwarf (WD) only in the circular orbit. As orbital periods and companion mass of these eMSPs are located in a narrow range, a reasonable postulation is that they have the same origin. Although many models have been proposed to interpret their origin, however, the origin of the narrow range of the orbital period is still an open question. The accretion-induced collapse(AIC) of the ONe WD is considered to be an important pathway to form MSP, which was expected to result in the formation of MSP in the circular orbit due to tidal circularization. Here we revisited this scenario by the binary population synthesis including the specific circularization calculation. Our results indicate that binaries with insufficient circularization in this scenario can evolve into the eMSPs. The narrow initial binary parameters required by insufficient circularization can naturally account for the narrow range of the orbital period. Although the evolution of WD's AIC process has not been well understood, the characteristic of a narrow range in the orbital period of eMSPs can still set constraints on the physics of their evolution.
#### On the survivability of a population of gas giant planets on wide orbits

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of giant planets on wide orbits ($\stackrel{>}{_\sim}100$AU) challenge planet formation theories; the core accretion scenario has difficulty in forming them, whereas the disc instability model forms an overabundance of them that is not seen observations. We perform $N$-body simulations investigating the effect of close stellar encounters ($\leq 1200$AU) on systems hosting wide-orbit giant planets and the extent at which such interactions may disrupt the initial wide-orbit planet population. We find that the effect of an interaction on the orbit of a planet is stronger for high-mass, low-velocity perturbers, as expected. We find that due to just a single encounter there is a $\sim 17%$ chance that the wide-orbit giant planet is liberated in the field, a $\sim 10$% chance it is scattered significantly outwards, and a $\sim 6$% chance it is significantly scattered inwards. Moreover, there is a $\sim 21\%$ chance that its eccentricity is excited to e>0.1, making it more prone to disruption in subsequent encounters. The results strongly suggest that the effect of even a single stellar encounter is significant in disrupting the primordial wide-orbit giant planet population; in reality the effect will be even more prominent, as in a young star-forming region more such interactions are expected to occur. We conclude that the low occurrence rate of wide-orbit planets revealed by observational surveys does not exclude the possibility that such planetary systems are initially abundant, and therefore the disc-instability model may be a plausible scenario for their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently released data by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have amassed substantial evidence corroborating the existence of a stochastic signal consistent with gravitational-wave background at frequencies around the nanoHertz regime. We investigate the situation that the PTA signal originates from scalar-induced gravitational waves~(SIGWs), which serves as a valuable tool to probe the equation of state parameter $w$ during the early stages of the Universe. The joint consideration of the PTA data from the NANOGrav 15-yr data set, PPTA DR3, and EPTA DR2 yields that $w=0.60^{+0.32}_{-0.39}$ (median + $90\%$ credible interval), indicating a period of condensate domination at the production of SIGWs and the preferred $w$ reveals the dynamics of the homogeneous field. We also impose an upper bound on the reheating temperature and the constraint on $w$ reveals valuable information of the inflationary potential and the dynamics at the end of inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar binaries harbour complex environment morphologies. Observations represent a snapshot in time, and projection and optical depth effects impair our ability to interpret them. Careful comparison with high-resolution models that include the larger star-forming region can help isolate the driving physical processes and give observations context in the time domain. We carry out zoom-in simulations with AU-scale resolution, and for the first time ever we follow the evolution until a circumbinary disk is formed. We investigate the gas dynamics around the young stars and extract disk sizes. Using radiative transfer, we obtain evolutionary tracers of the binary systems. We find that the centrifugal radius in prestellar cores is a poor estimator of the resulting disk size due to angular momentum transport at all scales. For binaries, the disk sizes are regulated periodically by the binary orbit, having larger radii close to the apastron. The bolometric temperature differs systematically between edge-on and face-on views and shows a high frequency time dependence correlated with the binary orbit and a low frequency time dependence with larger episodic accretion events. These oscillations can bring the system appearance to change rapidly from class 0 to class I and for short time periods even bring it to class II. The highly complex structure in early stages, as well as the binary orbit itself, affects the classical interpretation of protostellar classes and direct translation to evolutionary stages has to be done with caution and include other evolutionary indicators such as the extent of envelope material.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a multi-scale problem, and only global simulations that account for the connection from the molecular cloud scale gas flow to the accreting protostar can reflect the observed complexity of protostellar systems. Star-forming regions are characterised by supersonic turbulence and as a result, it is not possible to simultaneously design models that account for the larger environment and in detail reproduce observed stellar systems. Instead, the stellar inventories can be matched statistically, and best matches found that approximate specific observations. Observationally, a combination of single-dish telescopes and interferometers are now able to resolve the nearest protostellar objects on all scales from the protostellar core to the inner 10 AU. We present a new non-parametric methodology which uses high-resolution simulations and post-processing methods to match simulations and observations using deep learning. Our goal is to perform a down-selection from large data sets of synthetic images to a ranked list of best-matching candidates with respect to the observation. This is particularly useful for binary and multiple stellar systems that form in turbulent environments. The objective is to accelerate the rate at which we can do such comparisons, remove biases from hand-picking matches, and contribute to identifying the underlying physical processes that drive the creation and evolution of observed protostellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Trajectory design in highly-perturbed environments like binary asteroids is challenging. It typically requires using realistic, non-autonomous dynamical models in which periodic solutions vanish. In this work, a novel technique to find regions of bounded motion in the perturbed planar bi-elliptic restricted four-body problem is proposed. Lagrangian descriptors are employed to find regions of bounded motion about Dimorphos, the secondary body of the (65803) Didymos binary system. Results show that Lagrangian descriptors successfully reveal phase space organizing structures both in the unperturbed and perturbed planar bi-elliptic restricted four-body problem. With no solar radiation pressure, regions of bounded motion are visually identified, so granting access to a vast selection of bounded orbits about Dimorphos. Conversely, the presence of solar radiation pressure breaks down the majority of structures, leading to a large region of unstable motion with rare exceptions. Compared to other chaos indicators applied to the astrodynamics, Lagrangian descriptors are more convenient since they avoid propagating variational equations.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are expected to have the collecting area required to detect potential biosignature gases such as molecular oxygen, $\mathrm{O_2}$, in the atmosphere of terrestrial planets around nearby stars. One of the most promising detection methods is transmission spectroscopy. To maximize our capability to detect $\mathrm{O_2}$ using this method, spectral resolutions $\mathrm{R}\geq 300,000$ are required to fully resolve the absorption lines in an Earth-like exoplanet atmosphere and disentangle the signal from telluric lines. Current high-resolution spectrographs typically achieve a spectral resolution of $\mathrm{R}\sim100,000$. Increasing the resolution in seeing limited observations/instruments requires drastically larger optical components, making these instruments even more expensive and hard to fabricate and assemble. Instead, we demonstrate a new approach to high-resolution spectroscopy. We implemented an ultra-high spectral resolution booster to be coupled in front of a high-resolution spectrograph. The instrument is based on a chained Fabry Perot array which generates a hyperfine spectral profile. We present on-sky telluric observations with a lab demonstrator. Depending on the configuration, this two-arm prototype reaches a resolution of R=250,000-350,000. After carefully modeling the prototype's behavior, we propose a Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI) design for an eight-arm array configuration aimed at ELTs capable of exceeding R=300,000. The novel FPI resolution booster can be plugged in at the front end of an existing R=100,000 spectrograph to overwrite the spectral profile with a higher resolution for exoplanet atmosphere studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporation is a potential explanation for several features within exoplanet demographics. Atmospheric escape observed in young Neptune-sized exoplanets can provide insight into and characterize which mechanisms drive this evolution and at what times they dominate. AU Mic b is one such exoplanet, slightly larger than Neptune (4.19 Earth radii). It closely orbits a 23 Myr pre-Main Sequence M dwarf with a period of 8.46 days. We obtained two visits of AU Mic b at Lyman-alpha with HST/STIS. One flare within the first HST visit is characterized and removed from our search for a planetary transit. We present a non-detection in our first visit followed by the detection of escaping neutral hydrogen ahead of the planet in our second visit. The outflow absorbed about 30% of the star's Lyman-alpha blue-wing 2.5 hours before the planet's white-light transit. We estimate the highest velocity escaping material has a column density of 10^13.96 cm^-2 and is moving 61.26 km/s away from the host star. AU Mic b's large high energy irradiation could photoionize its escaping neutral hydrogen in 44 minutes, rendering it temporarily unobservable. Our time-variable Lyman-alpha transit ahead of AU Mic b could also be explained by an intermediate stellar wind strength from AU Mic that shapes the escaping material into a leading tail. Future Lyman-alpha observations of this system will confirm and characterize the unique variable nature of its Lyman-alpha transit, which combined with modeling will tune the importance of stellar wind and photoionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation from the Dark Ages ($z \simeq 30-100$) will allow us to probe the inflationary epoch on very small scales ($>0.1 \, \mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$), inaccessible to cosmic microwave background experiments. Combined with the possibility to collect information from different redshift slices, the 21-cm bispectrum has the potential to significantly improve constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. However, recent work has shown secondary effects source off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix which can significantly affect forecasted constraints, especially in signals that peak in the squeezed configuration, such as the local bispectrum. In this paper we propose the three-point $\langle 21-21-\rm CMB \rangle$ bispectrum cross-correlation as a new independent observational channel sensitive to local primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that, contrary to the 21-cm bispectrum, secondary contributions are subdominant to the primordial signal for values $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} \sim 1$, resulting in negligible effects from off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix. We forecast that CMB $T$ and $E$ modes cross-correlated with an ideal cosmic variance-limited 21-cm experiment with a $0.1$ MHz frequency and $0.1$ arc-minute angular resolution could reach $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} \sim 6 \times 10^{-3}$. This forecast suggests cross-correlation between CMB and 21-cm experiments could provide a viable alternative to 21-cm auto-spectra in reaching unprecedented constraints on primordial local non-Gaussianities.
