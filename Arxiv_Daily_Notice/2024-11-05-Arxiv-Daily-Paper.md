          Galactic Neutral Hydrogen Structures Spectroscopy and Kinematics: Designing a Home Radio Telescope for 21 cm Emission
 - **Authors:** Jack Phelps

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the methodology for creating a cost-efficient radio astronomy telescope that can be used to detect 21 cm emissions (1420.405 MHz) and determine the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen specifically in the Milky Way. By measuring the Doppler shifts of the 21 cm emission, the velocities of hydrogen clouds relative to Earth can be determined. This enables the identification of these clouds' movements, their positions within the galaxy's spiral arms, and their roles in the overall rotational dynamics of the Milky Way. The setup is designed to be accessible to amateurs, enabling others to conduct similar projects. The measurement apparatus consists of a 1-meter parabolic dish, a H1-LNA for 21 cm emissions, an SDR, and a Raspberry Pi. This paper also provides an overview of the data processing required to detect the hydrogen line and generate velocity profiles. Additionally, it examines RFI mitigation techniques, such as spectral filtering and instrument shielding, which enhance observational clarity even in urban environments like Los Angeles. This study also analyzes the observed velocities of different galactic arms, as well as measurements across the sky.

          TOPO: Time-Ordered Provable Outputs

 - **Abstract**
 We present TOPO (Time-Ordered Provable Outputs), a tool designed to enhance reproducibility and data integrity in astrophysical research, providing a trustless alternative to data analysis blinding. Astrophysical research frequently involves probabilistic algorithms, high computational demands, and stringent data privacy requirements, making it difficult to guarantee the integrity of results. TOPO provides a secure framework for verifying reproducible data analysis while ensuring sensitive information remains hidden. Our approach utilizes deterministic hashing to generate unique digital fingerprints of outputs, and Merkle Trees to store outputs in a time-ordered manner. This enables efficient verification of specific components or the entire dataset while making it computationally infeasible to manipulate results - thereby mitigating the risk of human interference and confirmation bias, key objectives of blinding methods. We demonstrate TOPO's utility in a cosmological context using TOPO-Cobaya, showcasing how blinding and verification can be seamlessly integrated into Markov Chain Monte Carlo calculations, rendering the process cryptographically provable. This method addresses pressing challenges in the reproducibility crisis and offers a robust, verifiable framework for astrophysical data analysis.

          Differing Manifestations of Spatial Curvature in Cosmological FRW Models

 - **Abstract**
 We find statistical evidence for a mismatch between the (global) spatial curvature parameter $K$ in the geodesic equation for incoming photons, and the corresponding parameter in the Friedmann equation that determines the time evolution of the background spacetime and its perturbations. The mismatch hereafter referred to as `curvature-slip' is especially evident when the SH0ES prior on the current expansion rate is assumed. This result is based on joint analyses of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations with the PLANCK satellite (P18), first year results of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Baryonic Oscillation (BAO) data, and - at a lower level of significance - also on Pantheon SNIa (SN) catalog. For example, the betting odds against the Null Hypothesis are greater than $10^7$:1, 1400:1 and 1000:1 when P18+SH0ES, P18+DES+SH0ES, and P18+BAO+SH0ES, respectively, are considered. Datasets involving SNIa weaken this curvature slip considerably. Notably, even when the SH0ES prior is not imposed the betting odds for the rejection of the Null Hypothesis are 70:1 and 160:1 in cases where P18+DES and P18+BAO are considered. When the SH0ES prior is imposed, global fit of the modified model (that allows for a nonvanishing `curvature slip') strongly outperforms that of $\Lambda$CDM as is manifested by significant Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) gains, ranging between 7 and 23, depending on the dataset combination considered. Even in comparison to K$\Lambda$CDM the proposed model results in significant, albeit smaller, DIC gains when SN data are excluded. Our finding could possibly be interpreted as an inherent inconsistency between the (idealized) maximally symmetric nature of the FRW metric, and the dynamical evolution of the GR-based homogeneous and isotropic $\Lambda$CDM model (abridged)

          A generative model for Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs: selection functions for binary stars, giant planets, and compact object companions

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry from Gaia DR3 has produced a sample of $\sim$170,000 Keplerian orbital solutions, with many more anticipated in the next few years. These data have enormous potential to constrain the population of binary stars, giant planets, and compact objects in the Solar neighborhood. But in order to use the published orbit catalogs for statistical inference, it is necessary to understand their selection function: what is the probability that a binary with a given set of properties ends up in a catalog? We show that such a selection function for the Gaia DR3 astrometric binary catalog can be forward-modeled from the Gaia scanning law, including individual 1D astrometric measurements, the fitting of a cascade of astrometric models, and quality cuts applied in post-processing. We populate a synthetic Milky Way model with binary stars and generate a mock catalog of astrometric orbits. The mock catalog is quite similar to the DR3 astrometric binary sample, suggesting that our selection function is a sensible approximation of reality. Our fitting also produces a sample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are mainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally resolved wide binaries. We show that Gaia's sensitivity to astrometric binaries falls off rapidly at high eccentricities, but only weakly at high inclinations. We predict that DR4 will yield $\sim 1$ million astrometric orbits, mostly for bright ($G \lesssim 15$) systems with long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 1000$ d). We provide code to simulate and fit realistic Gaia epoch astrometry for any data release and determine whether any hypothetical binary would receive a cataloged orbital solution.

          Does it matter? A more careful treatment of density fluctuations in 21-cm simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological 21-cm signal is sourced from hyperfine transitions in neutral hydrogen atoms. Yet, although hydrogen atoms belong to the sub-class of baryonic matter, it is customary to simplify their treatment and analyze the 21-cm signal as if all the matter in the Universe was in the form of collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). This is usually done by evolving the density field via a scale-independent growth factor (SIGF). In this work, we separate the baryons from CDM and evolve the two species with a proper scale-dependent growth factor (SDGF). By incorporating the SDGF in the 21cmFirstCLASS code, we demonstrate the effect that baryons and CDM have on the 21-cm signal at the linear dark ages epoch and the subsequent non-linear epochs of cosmic dawn and reionization. Our analysis shows that the baryonic nature of hydrogen cannot be ignored during the dark ages, and that non-linear effects in density-field evolution must be accounted for after stars have formed. Furthermore, we discuss how the 21-cm signal is modified at lower redshifts, where ground-based 21-cm interferometers are mostly sensitive, due to the choice of working with either the "linear" or "non-linear" matter over-density (that is, the over-density as computed from linear perturbation theory, and non-linear perturbation theory, respectively) in the extended Press-Schechter formalism.

          Is there a dynamical tendency in H0 with late time measurements?

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the Hubble constant $H_0$ values derived from early-time and late-time measurements, reaching up to $4\sigma$, represents the most serious challenge in modern cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate if a similar tension exists between only late time measurements at different redshifts. We use the latest public datasets including Cosmic Chronometers, Megamasers, SNe Ia and DESI-BAO, that span from redshift $z \sim 0$ up to $z\sim 2.3$. By dividing the data into redshift bins, we derive $H_0$ values from each bin separately. Our analysis reveals a phenomenological dynamic evolution in $H_0$ across different redshift ranges, with a significance from $1.5\sigma$ and $2.3\sigma$, depending on the parameterization. Consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$ since it is an integration constant within the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Thus, these findings suggest that the observed Hubble tension might not only exist between early and late-time measurements but also among late-time data themselves, providing new insights into the nature of the Hubble tension.

          The formation and stability of a cold disc made out of stellar winds in the Galactic Centre

 - **Abstract**
 The reported discovery of a cold ($\sim$10$^4~\text{K}$) disc-like structure around the super-massive black hole at the centre of the Milk Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), has challenged our understanding of the gas dynamics and thermodynamic state of the plasma in its immediate vicinity. State-of-the-art simulations do not agree on whether or not such a disc can indeed be a product of the multiple stellar wind interactions of the mass-losing stars in the region. This study aims to constrain the conditions for the formation of a cold disc as a natural outcome of the system of the mass-losing stars orbiting around Sgr A*, to investigate if the disc is a transient or long-lasting structure, and to assess the validity of the model through direct comparisons with observations. We conduct a set of hydrodynamic simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars feeding Sgr A* using the finite-volume adaptive mesh-refinement code Ramses. We focus, for the first time, on the impact of the chemical composition of the plasma emanating from the WR stars. The simulations show that the chemical composition of the plasma affects the radiative cooling enough to impact the properties of the medium such as density and temperature and, as a consequence, the rate at which the material inflows onto Sgr A*. We demonstrated that the formation of a cold disc from the stellar winds is possible for certain chemical compositions that are consistent with the current observational constraints. However, even in such a case, it is not possible to reproduce the reported properties of the observed disc-like structure, namely its inclination and hydrogen recombination line fluxes. We conclude that the stellar winds on their own cannot form the cold disc around Sgr A* inferred from the observations. Either relevant ingredients are still missing in the model, or the interpretation of the observed data needs to be revised.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Baryon Pasted (BP) X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps derived from the half-sky Uchuu Lightcone simulation. These BP-Uchuu maps are constructed using more than $75$ million dark matter halos with masses $M_{500c} \geq 10^{13} M_\odot$ within the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. A distinctive feature of our BP-Uchuu Lightcone maps is their capability to assess the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic scatter caused by triaxial gaseous halos and internal gas characteristics, respectively, at the map level. We show that triaxial gas drives substantial scatter in X-ray luminosities of clusters and groups, accounting for nearly half of the total scatter in core-excised measurements. Additionally, scatter in the thermal pressure and gas density profiles of halos enhances the X-ray and SZ power spectra, leading to biases in cosmological parameter estimates. These findings are statistically robust due to the extensive sky coverage and large halo sample in the BP-Uchuu maps.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has revealed a significant challenge in air shower physics: a discrepancy between the simulated and observed muon content in cosmic-ray interactions, known as the 'Muon Puzzle'. This issue stems from a lack of understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. Current state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models fall short, underscoring the need for improvements. In this contribution, we explore the integration of the Pythia 8 hadronic interaction model into air shower simulations. While Pythia 8 is primarily used in Large Hadron Collider experiments, recent advancements in its Angantyr module show promise in better describing hadron-nucleus interactions, making it a valuable tool for addressing the Muon Puzzle.

 - **Abstract**
 We present three separate void catalogs created using a volume-limited sample of the DESI Year 1 Bright Galaxy Survey. We use the algorithms VoidFinder and V2 to construct void catalogs out to a redshift of z=0.24. We obtain 1,461 interior voids with VoidFinder, 420 with V2 using REVOLVER pruning, and 295 with V2 using VIDE pruning. Comparing our catalog with an overlapping SDSS void catalog, we find generally consistent void properties but significant differences in the void volume overlap, which we attribute to differences in the galaxy selection and survey masks. These catalogs are suitable for studying the variation in galaxy properties with cosmic environment and for cosmological studies.

          Characterizing the effects of pulse shape changes on pulsar timing precision

 - **Abstract**
 Time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements of pulses from pulsars are conventionally made by a template matching algorithm that compares a profile constructed by averaging a finite number of pulses to a long-term average pulse shape. However, the shapes of pulses can and do vary, leading to errors in TOA estimation. All pulsars show stochastic variations in shape, amplitude, and phase between successive pulses that only partially average out in averages of finitely many pulses. This jitter phenomenon will only become more problematic for timing precision as more sensitive telescopes are built. We describe techniques for characterizing jitter (and other shape variations) and demonstrate them with data from the Vela pulsar, PSR B0833$-$45. These include partial sum analyses; auto-and cross correlations between templates and profiles and between multifrequency arrival times; and principal component analysis. We then quantify how pulse shape changes affect TOA estimates using both analytical and simulation methods on pulse shapes of varying complexity (multiple components). These methods can provide the means for improving arrival time precision for many applications, including gravitational wave astronomy using pulsar timing arrays.

          The Search for the Inbetweeners: How packed are TESS planetary systems?

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we examine seven systems discovered by TESS, to see whether there is any room in those systems for an additional planet (or several) to lurk unseen between the two planets already confirmed therein. In five of those systems (namely HD 15337; HD 21749; HD 63433; HD 73583 and LTT 3780) we find that there is ample room for an undiscovered planet to move between those that have already been discovered. In other words, as they currently stand, those systems are not tightly packed. In stark contrast, the perturbative influence of the two known TOI-1670 planets is such that additional planets in between are ruled out. The final system, TOI 421, is more challenging. In the vast majority of cases, adding an Earth-mass planet to that system between the orbits of the known planets caused catastrophic instability. Just ~1.1% of our simulations of the modified system proved dynamically stable on a timescale of one million years. As a result, it seems that there is very little room between the two known planets in the TOI 421 system for an addition unseen world to exist, but the existence of such a planet can not be definitely ruled out on dynamical grounds alone.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA surveys have suggested that protoplanetary disks are not massive enough to form the known exoplanet population, under the assumption that the millimeter continuum emission is optically thin. In this work, we investigate how the mass determination is influenced when the porosity of dust grains is considered in radiative transfer models. The results show that disks with porous dust opacities yield similar dust temperature, but systematically lower millimeter fluxes compared to disks incorporating compact dust grains. Moreover, we recalibrate the relation between dust temperature and stellar luminosity for a wide range of stellar parameters, and calculate the dust masses of a large sample of disks using the traditionally analytic approach. The median dust mass from our calculation is about 6 times higher than the literature result, and this is mostly driven by the different opacities of porous and compact grains. A comparison of the cumulative distribution function between disk dust masses and exoplanet masses show that the median exoplanet mass is about 2 times lower than the median dust mass, if grains are porous, and there are no exoplanetary systems with masses higher than the most massive disks. Our analysis suggests that adopting porous dust opacities may alleviate the mass budget problem for planet formation. As an example illustrating the combined effects of optical depth and porous dust opacities on the mass estimation, we conduct new IRAM/NIKA-2 observations toward the IRAS 04370+2559 disk and perform a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution. The best-fit dust mass is roughly 100 times higher than the value from the traditionally analytic calculation. Future spatially resolved observations at various wavelengths are required to better constrain the dust mass.

          X-ray and Radio Campaign of the Z-source GX 340+0 II: the X-ray polarization in the normal branch

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first X-ray polarization measurement of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary and Z-source, GX 340$+$0, in the normal branch (NB) using a 200 ks observation with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetric Explorer (IXPE). This observation was performed in 2024 August. Along with IXPE, we also conducted simultaneous observations with NICER, AstroSat, Insight-HXMT, ATCA, and GMRT to investigate the broadband spectral and timing properties in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. During the campaign, the source traced a complete Z-track during the IXPE observation but spent most of the time in the NB. We measure X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $1.22\pm0.25\%$ in the 2-8 keV energy band with a polarization angle (PA) of $38\pm6^\circ$. The PD in the NB is observed to be weaker than in the horizontal branch (HB) but aligned in the same direction. The PD of the source exhibits a marginal increase with energy while the PA shows no energy dependence. The joint spectro-polarimetric modeling is consistent with the observed X-ray polarization originating from a single spectral component from the blackbody, the Comptonized emission, or reflection feature, while the disk emission does not contribute towards the X-ray polarization. GMRT observations at 1.26 GHz during HB had a tentative detection at 4.5$\pm$0.7 mJy while ATCA observations a day later during the NB detected the source at 0.70$\pm$0.05 mJy and 0.59$\pm$0.05 mJy in the 5.5 & 9 GHz bands, respectively, suggesting an evolving jet structure depending on the Z-track position.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point-like objects observed with extremely high X-ray luminosity that exceeds the Eddington limit of a $\rm10\,M_\odot$ black hole. A fraction of ULXs has been confirmed to contain neutron star (NS) accretors due to the discovery of their X-ray pulsations. The donors detected in NS ULXs are usually luminous massive stars because of the observational biases. Recently, the He donor star in NGC 247 ULX-1 has been identified, which is the first evidence of a He donor star in ULXs. In this paper, we employed the stellar evolution code MESA to investigate the formation of ULXs through the NS+He star channel, in which a He star transfers its He-rich material onto the surface of a NS via Roche-lobe overflow. We evolved a large number of NS+He star systems and provided the parameter space for the production of ULXs. We found that the initial NS+He star systems should have $\rm\sim 0.7-2.6 \, M_\odot$ He star and $\rm \sim 0.1-2500\, d$ orbital period for producing ULXs, eventually evolving into intermediate-mass binary pulsars. According to binary population synthesis calculations, we estimated that the Galactic rate of NS ULXs with He donor stars is in the range of $\sim1.6-4.0\times10^{-4}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and that there exist $\sim7-20$ detectable NS ULXs with He donor stars in the Galaxy.

 We present results of a comprehensive analysis of the polarization characteristics of GRB 200503A and GRB 201009A observed with the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) on board AstroSat. Despite these GRBs being reasonably bright, they were missed by several spacecraft and had thus far not been localized well, hindering polarization analysis. We present positions of these bursts obtained from the Inter-Planetary Network (IPN) and the newly developed CZTI localization pipeline. We then undertook polarization analyses using the standard CZTI pipeline. We cannot constrain the polarization properties for GRB 200503A, but find that GRB 201009A has a high degree of polarization.

          Evaluation of Sunspot Areas Derived by Automated Sunspot-Detection Methods

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspot-area measurements using digital images captured by two telescopes at the Mitaka campus of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan are conducted using automated sunspot detection. A comparison between sunspot areas derived from Mitaka and those from the reference data by Mandal et al. ({\it Astron. Astrophys.} {\bf 640,} A78, 2020), who compiled a cross-calibrated daily sunspot-area catalog, revealed that the correlation coefficients between them are high (0.96--0.97), whereas the areas in the Mitaka data are 70 \%--83 \% of those of Mandal et al. The correlation is limited by the differences in observation times and detection capabilities of spots near the limb, with discrepancies in areas arising from different definitions of spot outlines. Given the high correlation and the ease of calibrating area discrepancies with a correction factor, automated sunspot detection appears promising for future sunspot-area measurements. Furthermore, we addressed the measurements of brightness deficit caused by sunspots.

          The Faint Particle Trigger for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The Faint Particle Trigger (FPT) was developed for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to enhance the detection efficiency for faint signatures, produced by free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCP) predicted in several Standard Model (SM) extensions. A previous IceCube analysis has shown a reduced trigger efficiency in detecting FCP with a charge of e/3 due to the $\text{z}^2$ dependence of photon production processes. The FPT addresses this shortcoming by incorporating a so far unused hit type, so called SLC hits in the trigger decision. These are single isolated hits that are not used for triggering high energy signatures in IceCube. The FPT employs a sliding time window to analyze hits, utilizing four cuts to remove noise and bright background contributions. The noise contribution is effectively decreased to a few Hz by velocity and directional consistency of hit pairs. Furthermore a part of the dominating atmospheric muon rate is reduced, by requiring a minimum fraction of SLC hits in the trigger window. The FPT significantly improves the trigger efficiency by a factor of 1.55, compared to standard triggers, while increasing the event rate in IceCube by a factor 1.004. The trigger algorithm was tested and successfully deployed at South Pole in November 2023.

 - **Abstract**
 The objective of the coronagraphic IFU of RISTRETTO is to enable High Dispersion Coronagraphy of planets at a distance of 2$\lambda$/D from their star, without compromising on transmission. The new idea of a PIAA Nuller (PIAAN) allows contrast down to 10$^{-5}$ over large bandwidth $\ge$ 25%, with high transmission $\ge$ 70% at the distance of 2$\lambda$/D. While RISTRETTO will be installed on a VLT, this development is of tremendous importance for fully exploiting future ELTs XAO. We will discuss our PIAAN prototyping activities.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanism of interstellar formamide (NH$_2$CHO), a key prebiotic precursor, is currently a matter of hot debate within the astrochemistry community, with both gas-phase and grain-surface chemical pathways having been proposed as its dominant formation route. The aim of the present study is to place firm observational constraints on the formation pathways leading to formamide thanks to new interferometric observations of the molecular outflow driven by the protostellar binary L1157. We employed the IRAM NOEMA interferometer to map the entire southern outflow of L1157, which contains three main shocked regions with increasing post-shock age: B0, B1, and B2. This allowed us to measure how the abundance of formamide, that of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and the ratio of the two, vary with time in this region. In order to gain a greater understanding of the most likely formation routes of formamide, we ran a grid of astrochemical models and compared these to our observations. A comparison between observations and astrochemical modelling indicates that there are two possible scenarios: one in which the amount of formamide observed can be explained by gas-phase-only chemistry, and more specifically via the reaction H$_2$CO + NH$_2$ $\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CHO + H$_2$, and another in which part of the observed formamide originates from surface chemistry and part from gas-phase chemistry. Surface chemistry alone cannot account for the abundance of formamide that we measure. While grain-surface chemistry cannot be ruled out, the present study brings definitive proof that gas-phase chemistry does work in L1157-B and acts efficiently in the production of this molecular species.

 - **Abstract**
 The double neutron star PSR J1846-0513 is discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey. The pulsar is revealed to be harbored in an eccentric orbit with $e=0.208$ and orbital period of 0.613 days. The total mass of the system is constrained to be $2.6287(35)\rm{M}_{\odot}$, with a mass upper limit of $1.3455{\rm~M}_{\odot}$ for the pulsar and a mass lower limit of $1.2845{\rm~M}_{\odot}$ for the companion star. To reproduce its evolution history, we perform a 1D model for the formation of PSR J1846-0513 whose progenitor is assumed to be neutron star - helium (He) star system via MESA code. Since the large eccentricity is widely believed to originate from an asymmetric supernova explosion, we also investigate the dynamical effects of the supernova explosion. Our simulated results show that the progenitor of PSR J1846-0513 could be a binary system consisting of a He star of $3.3-4.0{\rm~M}_\odot$ and a neutron star in a circular orbit with an initial period of $\sim0.5$ days.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a freeze-out approach to the formation of heavy elements in expanding nuclear matter. Applying concepts used in the description of heavy-ion collisions or ternary fission, we determine the abundances of heavy elements taking into account in-medium effects such as Pauli blocking and the Mott effect, which describes the dissolution of nuclei at high densities of nuclear matter. With this approach, we search for a universal primordial distribution in an equilibrium state from which the gross structure of the solar abundances of heavy elements freezes out via radioactive decay of the excited states. The universal primordial state is characterized by the Lagrangian parameters of temperature and chemical potentials of neutrons and protons. We show that such a state exists and determine a temperature of 5.266 MeV, a neutron chemical potential of 940.317 MeV and a proton chemical potential of 845.069 MeV, at a baryon number density of 0.013 fm$^{-3}$ and a proton fraction of 0.13. Heavy neutron-rich nuclei such as the hypothesized double-magic nucleus $^{358}$Sn appear in the primordial distribution and contribute to the observed abundances after fission. We discuss astrophysical scenarios for the realization of this universal primordial distribution for heavy element nucleosynthesis, including supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and the inhomogeneous Big Bang. The latter scenario may be of interest in the light of early massive objects observed with the James Webb Space Telescope and opens new perspectives to explain universality of the observed r-process patterns and the lack of observations of population III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The sulfur content in dense molecular regions of the interstellar medium is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason of this phenomenon is unclear, thus it is necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species towards dense regions, mainly at early evolutive stages to uncover the early sulfur chemistry. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we investigated a sample of 37 dense cores embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Lines of 34SO, SO2, NS, SO, SO+, and H2CS were analyzed and column densities of each molecular species were obtained. From the continuum emission, and two CH3OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H2 column densities were derived. The abundances of such sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed species increase with the growth of the gas temperature, suggesting that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecule may have a similar dependence with Tk in the range 20 to 100 K. We find that the comparisons among abundances are, in general, highly correlated. Given that such correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species here analyzed should have a similar chemical origin. From the measured line widths we point out that molecules with oxygen content (34SO, SO2, SO, and SO+) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other ones. H2CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores. This work gives quantitative information about abundances that could be useful in chemical models pointing to explain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 In our former paper I, we showed on the Sun that different active regions possess unique intensity profiles on the Ca II H & K lines. We now extend the analysis by showing how those properties can be used on real stellar observations, delivering more powerful activity proxies for radial velocity correction. More information can be extracted on rotational timescale from the Ca II H & K lines than the classical indicators: S-index and log(R'HK). For high-resolution HARPS observations of alpha Cen B, we apply a principal and independent component analysis on the Ca II H & K spectra time-series to disentangle the different sources that contribute to the disk-integrated line profiles. While the first component can be understood as a denoised version of the Mount-Wilson S-index, the second component appears as powerful activity proxies to correct the RVs induced by the inhibition of the convective blueshift in stellar active regions. However, we failed to interpret the extracted component into a physical framework. We conclude that a more complex kernel or bandpass than the classical triangular of the Mount Wilson convention should be used to extract activity proxies. To this regard, we provide the first principal component activity profile obtained across the spectral type sequence between M1V to F9V type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray binary system Cygnus X-3 (4U 2030+40, V1521 Cyg) is luminous but enigmatic owing to the high intervening absorption. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy uniquely probes the dynamics of the photoionized gas in the system. In this paper we report on an observation of Cyg X-3 with the XRISM/Resolve spectrometer which provides unprecedented spectral resolution and sensitivity in the 2-10 keV band. We detect multiple kinematic and ionization components in absorption and emission, whose superposition leads to complex line profiles, including strong P-Cygni profiles on resonance lines. The prominent Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ emission complexes are clearly resolved into their characteristic fine structure transitions. Self-consistent photoionization modeling allows us to disentangle the absorption and emission components and measure the Doppler velocity of these components as a function of binary orbital phase. We find a significantly higher velocity amplitude for the emission lines than for the absorption lines. The absorption lines generally appear blueshifted by ${\sim}-500$-$600$km s$^{-1}$. We show that the wind decomposes naturally into a relatively smooth and large scale component, perhaps originating with the background wind itself, plus a turbulent more dense structure located close to the compact object in its orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage. With the increasing popularity of SiPMs among new spaceborne missions, especially on CubeSats, it is of paramount importance to characterize their performance in space environment. In this work, we report the in-orbit ageing of SiPM arrays, so-called multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs), using measurements acquired by the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over three years, which in duration is unique. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021, to a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a gamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and regularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar flares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched on January 13, 2022 also to a 550 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among other payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have flight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs, shielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in an LEO environment on a scientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of MPPCs being employed in future satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 The extinction curve of interstellar dust in the dense molecular cloud cores is crucial for understanding dust properties, particularly size distribution and composition. We investigate the infrared extinction law in four nearby isolated molecular cloud cores, L429, L483, L673, and L1165, across the 1.2 - 8.0 $\mu$m wavelength range, using deep near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data from UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations probe an unprecedented extinction depth, reaching $A_V\sim$ 40-60 mag in these dense cloud cores. We derive color-excess ratios $E(K-\lambda)/E(H-K)$ by fitting color-color diagrams of $(K-\lambda)$ versus $(H-K)$, which are subsequently used to calculate the extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our analysis reveals remarkably similar and exceptionally flat infrared extinction curves for all four cloud cores, exhibiting the most pronounced flattening reported in the literature to date. This flatness is consistent with the presence of large dust grains, suggesting significant grain growth in dense environments. Intriguingly, our findings align closely with the Astrodust model for a diffuse interstellar environment proposed by Hensley \& Draine. This agreement between dense core observations and a diffuse medium model highlights the complexity of dust evolution and the need for further investigation into the processes governing dust properties in different interstellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. Unlike previous binary stars catalogs, which were heterogeneous collections of orbits from different surveys and instruments, these orbits were derived using Gaia data alone. Despite this homogeneity, the selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in the construction of the catalog. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. We also construct a binary population synthesis model based on Moe & Di Stefano (2017) to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 5000$ for $100 < P_{orb} < 400$ day, $\lesssim 2,000$ for $400 < P_{orb} < 1000$ day, and $ \lesssim 20,000$ for $1000 < P_{orb} < 2000$ days.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the energetic significance of Lyman-alpha (Ly{\alpha}; 1216Å) emission from solar flares, regular observations of flare related Ly{\alpha} have been relatively scarce until recently. Advances in instrumental capabilities and a shift in focus over previous Solar Cycles mean it is now routinely possible to take regular co-observations of Ly{\alpha} emission in solar flares. Thus, it is valuable to examine how the instruments selected for flare observations may influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis of their unique measurements. Here, we examine three M-class flares each observed in Ly{\alpha} by GOES-14/EUVS-E, GOES-15/EUVS-E, or GOES-16/EXIS-EUVS-B, and at least one other instrument from PROBA2/LYRA, MAVEN/EUVM, ASO-S/LST-SDI, and SDO/EVE-MEGS-P. For each flare, the relative and excess flux, contrast, total energy, and timings of the Ly{\alpha} emission were compared between instruments. It was found that while the discrepancies in measurements of the relative flux between instruments may be considered minimal, the calculated contrasts, excess fluxes, and energetics may differ significantly - in some cases up to a factor of five. This may have a notable impact on multi instrument investigations of the variable Ly{\alpha} emission in solar flares and estimates of the contribution of Ly{\alpha} to the radiated energy budget of the chromosphere. The findings presented in this study will act as a guide for the interpretation of observations of flare-related Ly{\alpha} from upcoming instruments during future Solar Cycles and inform conclusions drawn from multi-instrument studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.
