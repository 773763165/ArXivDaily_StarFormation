 - **Abstract**
 Galactic binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a unique laboratory to probe the evolution of BNSs and their progenitors. Here, we use a new version of the population synthesis code SEVN to evolve the population of Galactic BNSs, by modeling the spin up and down of pulsars self-consistently. We analyze the merger rate $\mathcal{R}_{\rm MW}$, orbital period $P_{\rm orb}$, eccentricity $e$, spin period $P$, and spin period derivative $\dot{P}$ of the BNS population. Values of the common envelope parameter $\alpha=1 - 3$ and an accurate model of the Milky Way star formation history best reproduce the BNS merger rate in our Galaxy ($\mathcal{R}_{\rm MW}\approx{}30$ Myr$^{-1}$). We apply radio-selection effects to our simulated BNSs and compare them to the observed population. Using a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture method, we evaluate the four-dimensional likelihood in the $(P_{\rm orb}, e, P, \dot{P})$ space, by comparing our radio-selected simulated pulsars against Galactic BNSs. Our analysis favours an uniform initial distribution for both the magnetic field ($10^{10-13}$ G) and the spin period ($10-100$ ms). The implementation of radio selection effects is critical to match not only the spin period and period derivative, but also the orbital period and eccentricity of Galactic BNSs. According to our fiducial model, the Square Kilometre Array will detect $\sim 20$ new BNSs in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 An ionization front (I-front) that propagates through an inhomogeneous medium is slowed down by self-shielding and recombinations. We perform cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the I-front propagation during the epoch of cosmic reionization. The simulations resolve gas in minihalos (halo mass $10^4\lesssim M_h[{\rm M}_\odot]\lesssim 10^8)$ that could dominate recombinations, in a computational volume that is large enough to sample the abundance of such halos. The numerical resolution is sufficient (gas particle mass $\sim 20{\rm M}_\odot$, spatial resolution $< 0.1\;{\rm ckpc}$) to allow accurate modelling of the hydrodynamic response of gas to photo-heating. We quantify the photo-evaporation time of minihalos as a function of $M_h$ and its dependence on the photo-ionization rate, $\Gamma_{-12}$, and the redshift of reionization, $z_i$. The recombination rate can be enhanced over that of a uniform medium by a factor $\sim 10-20$ early on. The peak value increases with $\Gamma_{-12}$ and decreases with $z_i$, due to the enhanced contribution from minihalos. The clumping factor, $c_r$, decreases to a factor of a few at $\sim 100\;{\rm Myr}$ after the passage of the I-front when the minihalos have been photo-evaporated; this asymptotic value depends only weakly on $\Gamma_{-12}$. Recombinations increase the required number of photons per baryon to reionize the Universe by 20-100 per cent, with the higher value occurring when $\Gamma_{-12}$ is high and $z_i$ is low. We complement the numerical simulations with simple analytical models for the evaporation rate and the inverse Str\"omgren layer. The study also demonstrates the proficiency and potential of SPHM1RT to address astrophysical problems in high-resolution cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemistry plays a key role in many aspects of astrophysical fluids. Atoms and molecules are agents for heating and cooling, determine the ionization fraction, serve as observational tracers, and build the molecular foundation of life. We present the implementation of a chemistry module in the publicly available magneto-hydrodynamic code Athena++. We implement several chemical networks and heating and cooling processes suitable for simulating the interstellar medium (ISM). A general chemical network framework in the KIDA format is also included, allowing the user to easily implement their own chemistry. Radiation transfer and cosmic-ray ionization are coupled with chemistry and solved with the simple six-ray approximation. The chemical and thermal processes are evolved as a system of coupled ODEs with an implicit solver from the CVODE library. We perform and present a series of tests to ensure the numerical accuracy and convergence of the code. Many tests combine chemistry with gas dynamics, including comparisons with analytic solutions, 1D problems of the photo-dissociation regions and shocks, and realistic 3D simulations of the turbulent ISM. We release the code with the new public version of Athena++, aiming to provide a robust and flexible code for the astrochemical simulation community.

 - **Abstract**
 A growing number of supernovae (SNe) are now known to exhibit evidence for significant interaction with a dense, pre-existing, circumstellar medium (CSM). SNe Ibn comprise one such class that can be characterised by both rapidly evolving light curves and persistent narrow He I lines. The origin of such a dense CSM in these systems remains a pressing question, specifically concerning the progenitor system and mass-loss mechanism. In this paper, we present multi-wavelength data of the Type Ibn SN 2020nxt, including $HST$/STIS ultraviolet spectra. We fit the data with recently updated CMFGEN models designed to handle configurations for SNe Ibn. The UV coverage yields strong constraints on the energetics and, when combined with the CMFGEN models, offer new insight on potential progenitor systems. We find the most successful model is a $\lesssim4 {\rm M}_\odot$ helium star that lost its $\sim 1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ He-rich envelope in the years preceding core collapse. We also consider viable alternatives, such as a He white dwarf merger. Ultimately, we conclude at least some SNe Ibn do not arise from single, massive ($>30 {\rm M}_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet-like stars.
#### An analysis of the isomers HCN and HNC in the evolution of high-mass  star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 The study of molecules and their chemistry in star-forming regions is fundamental to understand the physical process occurring in such regions. The HCN and HNC J=1-0 emissions were used to derive their integrated line intensities (I), to probe a relation recently appeared in the literature between the kinetic temperatures (T$_{K}$) and the isomeric (I) ratio, and to obtain the isomers abundances (X) in 55 high-mass star-forming regions. These last ones are classified, according to the evolutive stage, as infrared dark clouds, high-mass protostellar objects, hot molecular cores, and ultracompact HII regions. It is inferred that the T$_{K}$ obtained from the isomeric integrated intensity ratio (I$^{HCN/HNC}$) are underestimated, and hence we suggest that this relation cannot be employed as an universal thermometer in the interstellar medium. The isomers abundances show a behavior that can be explained from the chemistry occurring as the temperature and the UV radiation increase according to the evolutive stage. We found that the abundance ratio (X$^{HCN/HNC}$) hardly could be used as a chemical clock, and we suggest that it can be approximated by I$^{HCN/HNC}$. This work is part of an on-going study of multiple molecules that stand in the sample of analyzed regions which intends to contribute in the chemical knowledge of high-mass star formation.
#### AREPO White Dwarf merger simulations resulting in edge-lit detonation  and run-away hypervelocity companion

 - **Abstract**
 We present a series of high-resolution simulations generated with the moving-mesh code AREPO to model the merger of a $1.1 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen primary white dwarf with an outer helium layer and a $0.35\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ secondary helium white dwarf. Our simulations lead to detonations that are consistent with the edge-lit scenario, where a helium detonation is ignited at the base of the helium layer of the primary WD, which triggers an off-centre carbon detonation. This produces an asymmetric ejecta pattern and differences in line-of-sight observables (e.g. mean atomic weight). The ejecta that are flung into space are dominated by $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, $^{4}\mathrm{He}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\mathrm{S}$. Our simulations result in a surviving degenerate companion of mass $0.22-0.25$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ moving at $>1\,700$ $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, consistent with the observational findings of hypervelocity WDs. The secondary's surface layers are enriched by heavy metals, with $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ making up approximately $0.8 \%$ of the remaining mass. We also analyse the sensitivity of the outcome on simulation parameters, including the "inspiral time", which defines a period of accelerated angular momentum loss. We find that the choice of "inspiral time" qualitatively influences the simulation result, including the survival of the secondary. We argue that the shorter inspiral cases result in qualitatively and quantitatively similar outcomes. We also investigate the sensitivity of our results on the primary's chemical profile by comparing simulations using isothermal, constant composition models with the same mass and central composition and characterised by either a bare carbon-oxygen core (no helium) or a carbon-oxygen core enveloped by a thick helium layer.

 - **Abstract**
 Very precise satellite photometry has revealed a large number of variable stars whose variability is caused either by surface spots or by binarity. Detailed studies of such variables provide insights into the physics of these objects. We study the nature of the periodic light variability of the white dwarf EPIC 206197016 that was observed by the K2 mission. We obtain phase-resolved medium-resolution spectroscopy of EPIC 206197016 using XSHOOTER spectrograph at VLT to understand the nature of the white dwarf variability. We use NLTE model atmospheres to determine stellar parameters at individual phases. EPIC 206197016 is a hot DA white dwarf with $T_\text{eff}=78\,$kK. The analysis of the spectra reveals periodic radial velocity variations that can result from gravitational interaction with an invisible secondary whose mass corresponds to a red dwarf. The close proximity of the two stars where the semimajor axis is about $3\,R_\odot$ results in the irradiation of the companion with temperatures more than twice as high on the illuminated side compared to the nonilluminated hemisphere. This effect can explain the observed light variations. The spectra of the white dwarf show a particular feature of the Balmer lines called the Balmer line problem, where the observed cores of the lower Balmer lines are deeper than predicted. This can be attributed to either weak pollution of hydrogen in the white dwarf atmosphere by heavy elements or to the presence of a circumstellar cloud or disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The reaction N(4S) + NO -> O(3P) + N2 plays a pivotal role in the conversion of atomic to molecular nitrogen in dense interstellar clouds and in the atmosphere. Here we report a joint experimental and computational investigation of the N + NO reaction with the aim of providing improved constraints on its low temperature reactivity. Thermal rates were measured over the 50 to 296 K range in a continuous supersonic flow reactor coupled with pulsed laser photolysis and laser induced fluorescence for the production and detection of N(4S) atoms, respectively. With decreasing temperature, the experimentally measured reaction rate was found to monotonously increase up to a value of (6.6 +- 1.3) x 10-11 cm3 s-1 at 50 K. To confirm this finding, quasi-classical trajectory simulations were carried out on a previously validated, full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES). However, around 50 K the computed rates decreased which required re-evaluation of the reactive PES in the long-range part due to a small spurious barrier with height 40 K in the entrance channel. By exploring different correction schemes the measured thermal rates can be adequately reproduced, displaying a clear negative temperature dependence over the entire temperature range. The possible astrochemical implications of an increased reaction rate at low temperature are also discussed.
#### Measurement of ultra-high-energy diffuse gamma-ray emission of the  Galactic plane from 10 TeV to 1 PeV with LHAASO-KM2A

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission, mainly produced via interactions between cosmic rays and the diffuse interstellar medium, is a very important probe of the distribution, propagation, and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this work we report the measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-rays from the Galactic plane between 10 TeV and 1 PeV energies, with the square kilometer array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Diffuse emissions from the inner ($15^{\circ}<l<125^{\circ}$, $|b|<5^{\circ}$) and outer ($125^{\circ}<l<235^{\circ}$, $|b|<5^{\circ}$) Galactic plane are detected with $29.1\sigma$ and $12.7\sigma$ significance, respectively. The outer Galactic plane diffuse emission is detected for the first time in the very- to ultra-high-energy domain ($E>10$~TeV). The energy spectrum in the inner Galaxy regions can be described by a power-law function with an index of $-2.99\pm0.04$, which is different from the curved spectrum as expected from hadronic interactions between locally measured cosmic rays and the line-of-sight integrated gas content. Furthermore, the measured flux is higher by a factor of $\sim3$ than the prediction. A similar spectrum with an index of $-2.99\pm0.07$ is found in the outer Galaxy region, and the absolute flux for $10\lesssim E\lesssim60$ TeV is again higher than the prediction for hadronic cosmic ray interactions. The latitude distributions of the diffuse emission are consistent with the gas distribution, while the longitude distributions show slight deviation from the gas distribution. The LHAASO measurements imply that either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray intensities have spatial variations.
#### Understanding Sun-as-a-star variability of solar Balmer lines

 - **Abstract**
 Precise, high-cadence, long-term records of stellar spectral variability at different temporal scales lead to better understanding of a wide variety of phenomena including stellar atmospheres and dynamos, convective motions, and rotational periods. Here, we investigate the variability of solar Balmer lines (H-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, -$\gamma$, -$\delta$) observed by space-borne radiometers (OSIRIS, SCIAMACHY, OMI, and GOME-2), combining these precise, long-term observations with high-resolution data from the ground-based NSO/ISS spectrograph. We relate the detected variability to the appearance of magnetic features on the solar disk. We find that on solar-rotational timescales (about 1 month), the Balmer line activity indices (defined as line-core to line-wing ratios) closely follow variations in the total solar irradiance (which is predominantly photospheric), thus frequently (specifically, during passages of sunspot groups) deviating from behavior of activity indices that track chromospheric activity levels. On longer timescales, the correlation with chromospheric indices increases, with periods of low- or even anti-correlation found at intermediate timescales. Comparison of these observations with estimates from semi-empirical irradiance reconstructions helps quantify the contributions of different magnetic and quiet features. We conclude that both the lower sensitivity to network and in part the higher sensitivity to filaments and prominences, may result in complex, time-dependent relationships between Balmer and other chromospheric indices observed for the Sun and solar-like stars. The fact that core and wings contribute in similar manner to the variability, and current knowledge of Balmer-lines formation in stellar atmospheres, support the notion that Balmer lines core-to-wing ratios indices behave more like photospheric rather than chromospheric indices.

 - **Abstract**
 The amide-related molecules are essential for the formation of the other complex bio-molecules and an understanding of the prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). We presented the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the amide-like molecule cyanamide (NH$_{2}$CN) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). Using the rotational diagram model, the derived column density of NH$_{2}$CN towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (5.9$\pm$2.5)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a rotational temperature of 100.6$\pm$30.4 K. The derived fractional abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 with respect to H$_{2}$ was (4.72$\pm$2.0)$\times$10$^{-10}$, which is very similar to the existent three-phase warm-up chemical model abundances of NH$_{2}$CN. We compare the estimated abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 with other sources, and we observe the abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is nearly similar to that of the sculptor galaxy NGC 253 and the low-mass protostars IRAS 16293-2422 B and NGC 1333 IRAS4A2. We also discussed the possible formation mechanisms of NH$_{2}$CN towards the hot molecular cores and hot corinos, and we find that the NH$_{2}$CN molecule was created in the grain-surfaces of G358.93-0.03 MM1 via the neutral-neutral reaction between NH$_{2}$ and CN.
