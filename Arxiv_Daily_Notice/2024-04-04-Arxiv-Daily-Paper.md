 - **Abstract**
 The goal of this white paper is to provide a snapshot of the data availability and data needs primarily for the Ariel space mission, but also for related atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It covers the following data-related topics: molecular and atomic line lists, line profiles, computed cross-sections and opacities, collision-induced absorption and other continuum data, optical properties of aerosols and surfaces, atmospheric chemistry, UV photodissociation and photoabsorption cross-sections, and standards in the description and format of such data. These data aspects are discussed by addressing the following questions for each topic, based on the experience of the "data-provider" and "data-user" communities: (1) what are the types and sources of currently available data, (2) what work is currently in progress, and (3) what are the current and anticipated data needs. We present a GitHub platform for Ariel-related data, with the goal to provide a go-to place for both data-users and data-providers, for the users to make requests for their data needs and for the data-providers to link to their available data. Our aim throughout the paper is to provide practical information on existing sources of data whether in databases, theoretical, or literature sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmic shear analyses have exhibited inconsistencies of up to $1\sigma$ between the inferred cosmological parameters when analyzing summary statistics in real space versus harmonic space. In this paper, we demonstrate the consistent measurement and analysis of cosmic shear two-point functions in harmonic and real space using the $i${\sc Master} algorithm. This algorithm provides a consistent prescription to model the survey window effects and scale cuts in both real space (due to observational systematics) and harmonic space (due to model limitations), resulting in a consistent estimation of the cosmic shear power spectrum from both harmonic and real space estimators. We show that the $i$\textsc{Master} algorithm gives consistent results using measurements from the HSC Y1 mock shape catalogs in both real and harmonic space, resulting in consistent inferences of $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$. This method provides an unbiased estimate of the cosmic shear power spectrum, and $S_8$ inference that has a correlation coefficient of 0.997 between analyses using measurements in real space and harmonic space. We observe the mean difference between the two inferred $S_8$ values to be 0.0004, far below the observed difference of 0.042 for the published HSC Y1 analyses and well below the statistical uncertainties. While the notation employed in this paper is specific to photometric galaxy surveys, the methods are equally applicable and can be extended to spectroscopic galaxy surveys, intensity mapping, and CMB surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 d and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 min), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target sample, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 min eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed diversity of exoplanets can possibly be traced back to the planet formation processes. Planet-disk interactions induce sub-structures in the circumstellar disk that can be revealed via scattered light observations. However, a high-contrast imaging technique such as polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) must first be applied to suppress the stellar diffraction halo. In this work we present the PDI PiPelIne for NACO data (PIPPIN), which reduces the archival polarimetric observations made with the NACO instrument at the Very Large Telescope. Prior to this work, such a comprehensive pipeline to reduce polarimetric NACO data did not exist. We identify a total of 243 datasets of 57 potentially young stellar objects observed before NACO's decommissioning. The PIPPIN pipeline applies various levels of instrumental polarisation correction and is capable of reducing multiple observing setups, including half-wave plate or de-rotator usage and wire-grid observations. A novel template-matching method is applied to assess the detection significance of polarised signals in the reduced data. In 22 of the 57 observed targets, we detect polarised light resulting from a scattering of circumstellar dust. The detections exhibit a collection of known sub-structures, including rings, gaps, spirals, shadows, and in- or outflows of material. Since NACO was equipped with a near-infrared wavefront sensor, it made unique polarimetric observations of a number of embedded protostars. This is the first time detections of the Class I objects Elia 2-21 and YLW 16A have been published. Alongside the outlined PIPPIN pipeline, we publish an archive of the reduced data products, thereby improving the accessibility of these data for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous paper we showed that, like the migration speed, the eccentricity damping efficiency is modulated linearly by the depth of the partial gap a planet carves in the disk surface density profile, resulting in less efficient $e$-damping compared to the prescription commonly used in population synthesis works. Here, we extend our analysis to 3D, refining our $e$-damping formula and studying how the inclination damping efficiency is also affected. We perform high resolution 3D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses embedded in disks with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We extract the gap profile and orbital damping timescales for fixed eccentricities and inclinations up to the disk scale height. The limit in gap depths below which vortices appear, in the low-viscosity case, happens roughly at the transition between classical type-I and type-II migration regimes. The orbital damping timescales can be described by two linear trends with a break around gap depths $\sim80\%$ and with slopes and intercepts depending on the eccentricity and inclination. These trends are understood on physical grounds and are reproduced by simple fitting formulas whose error is within the typically uncertainty of type-I torque formulas. Thus, our recipes for the gap depth and orbital damping efficiencies yield a simple description for planet-disk interactions to use in N-body codes in the case of partial gap opening planets that is consistent with high-resolution 3D hydro-simulations. Finally, we show examples of how our novel orbital damping prescription can affect the outcome of population synthesis experiments.
#### Core to ultracompact HII region evolution in the W49A massive  protocluster

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to identify and characterize cores in the high-mass proto-cluster W49, determine their evolutionary stages and measure the associated lifetimes. We built a catalog of 129 cores extracted from an ALMA 1.3 mm continuum image at 0.26" (2900 au) angular resolution. The association between cores and Hyper/Ultra Compact HII (H/UC HII) regions was established from the analysis of VLA 3.3 cm continuum and H30$\alpha$ line observations. We also looked for emission of hot molecular cores (HMCs) using the methyl formate doublet at 218.29 GHz. We identified 40 cores associated with an H/UC HII region and 19 HMCs over the ALMA mosaic. The 52 cores with an H/UC HII region and/or a HMC are assumed to be high-mass protostellar cores, while the rest of the core population likely consists in prestellar cores and low-mass protostellar cores. We found a good agreement between the two tracers of ionized gas, with 23 common detections and only four cores detected at 3.3 cm and not in H30$\alpha$. The spectral indexes from 3.3 cm to 1.3 mm range from 1, for the youngest cores with partially optically thick free-free emission, to about -0.1, that is optically thin free-free emission obtained for cores likely more evolved. Using as a reference the H/UC HII regions, we found the statistical lifetimes of the HMC and massive protostellar phases in W49N to be about $6\times10^4$ yr and $1.4\times10^5$ yr, respectively. We also showed that HMC can co-exist with H/UC HII regions during a short fraction of the core lifetime, about $2\times10^4$ yr. This indicates a rapid dispersal of the inner molecule envelope once the HC HII is formed.

 - **Abstract**
 We reconstruct the 3D matter density and peculiar velocity fields in the local Universe up to a distance of $200\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ from the Two-Micron All-Sky Redshift Survey (2MRS), using a neural network (NN). We employ a NN with U-net autoencoder architecture and a weighted mean squared error loss function, trained separately to output either the density or velocity field for a given input grid of galaxy number counts. The NN is trained on mocks derived from the Quijote N-body simulations, incorporating redshift-space distortions (RSD), galaxy bias and selection effects, closely mimicking the characteristics of 2MRS. The trained NN is benchmarked against a standard Wiener filter (WF) on a validation set of mocks, before applying it to 2MRS. The NN reconstructions effectively approximate the mean posterior estimate of the true density and velocity fields conditioned on the observations. They consistently outperform the WF in terms of reconstruction accuracy, and effectively capture the nonlinear relation between velocity and density. The NN-reconstructed bulk flow of the total survey volume exhibits a significant correlation with the true mock bulk flow, demonstrating that the NN is sensitive to information on super-survey scales encoded in the RSD. When applied to 2MRS, the NN successfully recovers the main known clusters, some of which are partially in the Zone of Avoidance. The reconstructed bulk flows in spheres of different radii less than $100\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ are in good agreement with a previous 2MRS analysis that required an additional external bulk flow component inferred from directly observed peculiar velocities. The NN-reconstructed peculiar velocity of the Local Group closely matches the observed CMB dipole in amplitude and Galactic latitude, and only deviates by $18^\circ$ in longitude. The NN-reconstructed fields are publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.
#### Physical properties of circumnuclear ionising clusters. III. Kinematics  of gas and stars in NGC 7742

 - **Abstract**
 In this third paper of a series, we study the kinematics of the ionised gas and stars, calculating the dynamical masses of the circumnuclear star-forming regions in the ring of of the face-on spiral NGC 7742. We have used high spectral resolution data from the MEGARA instrument attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) to measure the kinematical components of the nebular emission lines of selected HII regions and the stellar velocity dispersions from the CaT absorption lines that allow the derivation of the associated cluster virialized masses. The emission line profiles show two different kinematical components: a narrow one with velocity dispersion $\sim$ 10 km/s and a broad one with velocity dispersion similar to those found for the stellar absorption lines. The derived star cluster dynamical masses range from 2.5 $\times$ 10$^6$ to 10.0 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of gas and stellar velocity dispersions suggests a scenario where the clusters have formed simultaneously in a first star formation episode with a fraction of the stellar evolution feedback remaining trapped in the cluster, subject to the same gravitational potential as the cluster stars. Between 0.15 and 7.07 % of the total dynamical mass of the cluster would have cooled down and formed a new, younger, population of stars, responsible for the ionisation of the gas currently observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Broadband low-resolution near-infrared spectrographs in a compact form are crucial for ground- and space-based astronomy and other fields of sensing. Astronomical spectroscopy poses stringent requirements including high efficiency, broad band operation ($>$ 300 nm), and in some cases, polarization insensitivity. We present and compare experimental results from the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband (1200 - 1650 nm) arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) spectrographs built using the two most promising low-loss platforms - Si$_3$N$_4$ (rectangular waveguides) and doped-SiO$_2$ (square waveguides). These AWGs have a resolving power ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$) of ~200, a free spectral range of ~ 200-350 nm, and a small footprint of ~ 50-100 mm$^2$. The peak overall (fiber-chip-fiber) efficiency of the doped-SiO$_2$ AWG was ~ 79\% (1 dB), and it exhibited a negligible polarization-dependent shift compared to the channel spacing. For Si$_3$N$_4$ AWGs, the peak overall efficiency in TE mode was ~ 50\% (3 dB), and the main loss component was found to be fiber-to-chip coupling losses. These broadband AWGs are key to enabling compact integrations such as multi-object spectrographs or dispersion back-ends for other astrophotonic devices such as photonic lanterns or nulling interferometers.
#### Full orbital solutions in pre-main sequence high-order multiple systems:  GG Tau Ab and UX Tau B

 - **Abstract**
 High-order multiple (triple and beyond) systems are relatively common. Their interaction with circumstellar and circumbinary material can have a large impact on the formation and evolution of planetary systems and depends on their orbital properties. GG\,Tau and UX\,Tau are two pre-main sequence high-order multiple systems in which the tightest pair has a projected separation of $\approx5$--20\,au. Characterizing precisely their orbits is crucial to establish their long-term stability, to predict the dynamics and evolution of circumstellar matter, and to evaluate the potential for planet formation in such systems. We combine existing astrometric measurements with previously unpublished high-resolution observations of the GG\,Tau\,Ab and UX\,Tau\,B pairs and perform Keplerian orbital fits. For GG\,Tau\,Ab the data presented here represent the first detection of orbital motion. For both systems they yield dramatic increases in orbital coverage ($\gtrsim60\%$ and $\approx100\%$ for UX\,Tau\,B and GG\,Tau\,Ab, for orbital periods of $\approx32$ and $\approx8$\,yr, respectively) and allow us to obtain well-constrained orbital fits, including dynamical masses with $\lesssim10\%$ and $\lesssim7\%$ random and systematic uncertainties. We find that both GG\,Tau\,A and UX\,Tau\,A--B likely form stable hierarchical systems, although one possible deprojection solution for GG\,Tau is strongly misaligned and could experience von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations. We further find that the UX\,Tau\,B orbit is much more eccentric than the GG\,Tau\,Ab one, possibly explaining the lack of circumstellar material in the former. The newly-determined orbits revive the question of the dynamical fate of gas and dust in these two hierarchical systems and should spur new dedicated simulations to assess the long-term evolution of the systems and the dynamical perturbations imposed by the close binaries they host.
#### A fast-rotating blue straggler star in the tidal tail of the open  cluster NGC 752

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02473
 - **Abstract**
 NGC 752 is a famous Galactic open cluster of intermediate age. In recent works, a very long and asymmetric tail was newly revealed. A blue straggler star (BSS) at the periphery of the tidal tail of the cluster has been identified subsequently. We aim to perform a detailed analysis of the newly detected BSS based on the available comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric data. We also explored this BSS's possible formation pathway and age limitation based on the collected spectroscopic and photometric data. We estimated the projected rotational velocity $v\ \mathrm{sin}i$ and the mass of the BSS from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectra and multiband photometric data from various catalogs, respectively. The newly discovered BSS is confirmed as a genuine member of NGC 752. The lack of ultraviolet excess in the SED and no significant variations in the light curve imply that this BSS is likely a single star ($mass=1.86^{+3.62}_{-0.94}\ M_{\odot}$) formed through stellar mergers. The fast rotation velocity ($v\ \mathrm{sin}i=206.9\pm4.9$~km $\rm s^{-1}$) of the BSS may provide constraints on its age (less than a hundred million years), but more formation details require further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.
#### Adaptation of the Phase Distance Correlation Periodogram to Account for  Measurement Uncertainties

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02506
 - **Abstract**
 We present an improvement of the phase distance correlation (PDC) periodogram to account for uncertainties in the time-series data. The PDC periodogram, which we introduced in previous papers, is based on the statistical concept of distance correlation. By viewing each measurement and its accompanying error estimate as a probability distribution, we use the concept of energy distance to design a distance function (metric) between measurement-uncertainty pairs. We use this metric as the basis for the PDC periodogram, instead of the simple absolute difference. We demonstrate the periodogram performance using both simulated and real-life data. This adaptation makes the PDC periodogram much more useful, and it can be helpful for the exploration of large time-resolved astronomical databases, from Gaia radial velocity and photometry data releases to those of smaller surveys, such as APOGEE and LAMOST. We have made a public GitHub repository with a Python implementation of the new tools available to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the rarity of significant solar flares compared to smaller ones, training effective machine learning models for solar activity forecasting is challenging due to insufficient data. This study proposes using generative deep learning models, specifically a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), to create synthetic images of solar phenomena, including flares of varying intensities. By employing a dataset from the AIA instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft, focusing on the 171 {\AA} band that captures various solar activities, and classifying images with GOES X-ray measurements based on flare intensity, we aim to address the data scarcity issue. The DDPM's performance is evaluated using cluster metrics, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and F1-score, showcasing promising results in generating realistic solar imagery. We conduct two experiments: one to train a supervised classifier for event identification and another for basic flare prediction, demonstrating the value of synthetic data in managing imbalanced datasets. This research underscores the potential of DDPMs in solar data analysis and forecasting, suggesting further exploration into their capabilities for solar flare prediction and application in other deep learning and physical tasks.
#### Detached Circumstellar Matter as an Explanation for Slowly-Rising  Interacting Type Ibc Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Some hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) supernovae (SNe) are known to have massive circumstellar matter (CSM) that are well detached from the star. Using the open-source code CHIPS, we construct a grid of models of SN Ibc interacting with detached CSM. We find that interaction with detached CSM can produce a slowly rising phase in the light curve seen in some interacting SN Ibc, which is difficult to reproduce by interaction with CSM of a density profile motivated from wind or eruptions that are continuous down to the star. We also show that SNe having double peaks in their light curves with timescales of months (e.g., SN 2022xxf) can be explained by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co, followed by interaction with detached CSM.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of large spectroscopic surveys requires homogenising on the same scale the quantities they measure in order to increase their scientific legacy. We developed the SpectroTranslator, a data-driven deep neural network algorithm that can convert spectroscopic parameters from the base of one survey to another. The algorithm also includes a method to estimate the importance that the various parameters play in the conversion from base A to B. As a showcase, we apply the algorithm to transform effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, [Mg/Fe] and los velocity from the base of GALAH into the APOGEE base. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SpectroTranslator algorithm to translate the spectroscopic parameters from one base to another using parameters directly by the survey teams, and are able to achieve a similar performance than previous works that have performed a similar type of conversion but using the full spectrum rather than the spectroscopic parameters, allowing to reduce the computational time, and to use the output of pipelines optimized for each survey. By combining the transformed GALAH catalogue with the APOGEE catalogue, we study the distribution of [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] across the Galaxy, and we find that the median distribution of both quantities present a vertical asymmetry at large radii. We attribute it to the recent perturbations generated by the passage of a dwarf galaxy across the disc or by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Although several aspects still need to be refined, in particular how to deal in an optimal manner with regions of the parameter space meagrely populated by stars in the training sample, the SpectroTranslator already shows its capability and promises to play a crucial role in standardizing various spectroscopic surveys onto a unified basis.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrogen and water molecules respond very differently to the collisional-radiative processes taking place in planetary atmospheres. Naturally, the question arises whether H2O-rich atmospheres are more (or less) resilient to long-term mass loss than H2-dominated ones if they radiate away the incident stellar energy more (or less) efficiently. If confirmed, the finding would have implications on our understanding of the evolution of sub-Neptune exoplanets. As a key step towards answering this question, we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of H2O for the atmospheric region where the gas accelerates to escape the planet and conditions relevant to close-in sub-Neptunes. Our exploratory calculations for isothermal gas composed of H2, H2O and e- reveal that: 1) In the pressure region ~1e-2 - 1e-4 dyn cm-2 where the stellar extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) photons are typically deposited in the atmosphere, H2O is in rotational LTE but vibrational NLTE. Vibrational LTE is facilitated by high H2O abundances and fractional ionizations, and we report critical densities for the LTE-NLTE transition; 2) Vibrational cooling may locally dominate over rotational cooling, partly because of the comparatively small opacities of ro-vibrational lines; 3) Even low H2O abundances notably enhance the cooling, foreseeably offsetting some of the stellar heating; 4) Heating due to the deposition of stellar infrared (IR) photons is significant at pressures >=0.1 dyn cm-2. We estimate the contribution of H2O excitation to the internal energy of the gas and speculate on the photodissociation from the excited vibrational states. Ultimately, our findings motivate the consideration of NLTE in the mass loss rate calculations of H2O-rich atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) 050709 by the HETE-2 satellite opened a new window into understanding the nature of SGRBs, offering clues about their emission mechanism and progenitors, with the crucial aid of optical follow-up observations. Here, we revisit the prompt emission of GRB 050709. Our analysis reveals an initial hard spike ~200 ms long, followed by a subsequent soft tail emission lasting ~300 ms. These components could be common among other SGRBs originating from binary neutron merger events, such as GW/GRB 170817A. Detailed temporal and spectral analyses indicate that the soft tail emission might be attributed to the cocoon formed by the relativistic jet depositing energy into the surrounding material. We find the necessary cocoon parameters at the breakout, as consistent with numerical simulation results. We compared the physical parameters of this cocoon with those of other SGRBs. The relatively higher cocoon pressure and temperature in GRB 050709 may indicate a more on-axis jet compared to GRB 170817A and GRB 150101B.

 - **Abstract**
 The Neupert effect refers to the strong correlation between the soft X-ray (SXR) light curve and the time-integrated hard X-rays (HXR) or microwave flux, which is frequently observed in solar flares. In this article, we therefore utilized the newly launched Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory to investigate the Neupert effect during solar flares. By checking the HXR light curves at 20-50 keV, a sample of 149 events that cover the flare impulsive phase were selected. Then, we performed a cross-correlation analysis between the HXR fluence (i.e., the time integral of the HXR flux) and the SXR 1-8 A flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. All the selected flares show high correlation coefficients (>0.90), which seem to be independent of the flare location and class. The HXR fluences tend to increase linearly with the SXR peak fluxes. Our observations indicate that all the selected flares obey the Neupert effect.

 - **Abstract**
 To explain grain growth and destruction in warm media, ice mantle formation and sublimation in cold media, and gas line emission spectroscopy, astrochemical models must mimic the gas--solid abundance ratio. Ice-sublimation mechanisms determine the position of snow lines and the nature of gas emitted by and locked inside planetary bodies in star-forming regions. To interpret observations from the interplanetary and extragalactic interstellar mediums, gas phase abundances must be modelled correctly. This study presents comprehensive thermal desorption data for interstellar ice analogues, aiming to refine astrochemical models by generating a set of benchmarks to evaluate both the kinetics and thermodynamics in astrochemical models. Our experiments focused on temperature-programmed desorption of pure and mixed ices, including Ar, CO, CO2, NH3, CH3OH, and H2O, under ultrahigh vacuum (1 x 10^-10 hPa) and low temperatures (10 K). Each experiment includes the experimental parameters, ice desorption kinetics for pure species, and the desorption yield (gas--solid ratio) for ice mixtures. From the desorption yields, we find common trends in the trapping of molecules when their abundance is compared to water: compact amorphous water ices are capable of trapping up to 20 % of volatiles (Ar, CO, and CO2), ~ 3 % of CH3OH, and ~ 5% NH3 in relation to the water content within the ice matrix; ammonium formate is not trapped in the water ice films, and compact amorphous water ice formed in situ has similar trapping capabilities to a compact amorphous water ice deposited using molecular beams. Our results highlight the limited trapping capacity of compact amorphous water ice for gases, crucial for understanding the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectral and timing study of the bright NS-LMXB GX 5-1 using \textit{\textit{AstroSat}/LAXPC} and \textit{SXT} observations conducted in the year 2018. During the observation, the source traces out the complete HB and NB of the Z-track in the HID. Understanding the spectral and temporal evolution of the source along the 'Z' track can probe the accretion process in the vicinity of a neutron star. Spectral analysis was performed in the 0.7-20 keV energy range for different segments in the HID using a multi-temperature disc black body with an average temperature, $kT_{in} \sim$0.46 and a thermal Comptonization model. It is found that the optical depth of the corona drops from $\sim$6.68 in HB to $\sim$2.74 in NB. The Timing analysis using the LAXPC instrument indicates the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations in HB, NB, and the hard apex of the Z-track. The observed QPO frequencies are similar to the characteristic frequencies of horizontal branch and normal branch oscillations. The HBO frequency increase from $\sim$12-46 Hz towards the hard apex. The timing studies conducted in soft and hard band indicate the association of HBO and NBO origin with the non-thermal component. Further research could explore the implications of this relationship for understanding the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars.
#### Simulating the Universe from the cosmological horizon to halo scales

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-large scales close to the cosmological horizon will be probed by the upcoming observational campaigns. They hold the promise to constrain single-field inflation as well as general relativity, but in order to include them in the forthcoming analyses, their modelling has to be robust. In particular, fictitious gauge modes may be mistaken for primordial signals, and no consensus has emerged either from analytical modelling nor from the numerical route, obstructed by the large dynamical range to be simulated. In this work, we present a numerical technique to overcome the latter limitation: we compute the general relativistic displacement field with the N-body relativistic code gevolution and combine it with the accurate Newtonian simulation Gadget-4. This combination leads to an effective simulation reproducing the desired behaviour at the level of the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. We then measure, for the first time in a simulation, the relativistic scale-dependent bias in Poisson gauge; at redshift $z=0$, we find $b_1^{\mathrm{GR}}=-5.7 \pm 1.7$. Our results at the field level are only valid in the Poisson gauge and need to be complemented with a relativistic ray tracing algorithm to compute the number count observable.

 - **Abstract**
 We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I & II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1". This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two Flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 40 au decreases with the protostellar evolutionary stage. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. We find that Class 0 dust disk size resembled the gas disk size, enabling a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.
#### Sensitivity of Polarization to Grain Shape: II. Aggregates

 - **Abstract**
 A previous study (Paper I) investigated the polarization properties of a variety of simple convex grain shapes, some of which were found to be consistent with the observed polarization properties of interstellar dust from far-ultraviolet to far-infrared. Here we study the optical properties of 45 non-convex shapes, all aggregates of $N$ equal-sized spheres. We consider $N=2$, $N=3$, and $N=256$ random aggregates obtained from 3 different aggregation schemes. We also consider "trimmed" $N=256$ aggregates obtained by systematically trimming initially random aggregates to increase either flattening or elongation. The "macroporosities" of the studied aggregates range from ${\cal P}_{\rm macro}=0.18$ (for the $N=2$ bisphere) to ${\cal P}_{\rm macro}\approx 0.85$ (for the $N=256$ "BA" aggregates). The only aggregates consistent with observations of starlight polarization and polarized thermal emission are shapes that have been trimmed to increase their asymmetry. If interstellar grains are high-porosity aggregates, there must be processes causing extreme elongation or flattening; if not, interstellar grains must be dominated by fairly compact structures, with at most moderate porosities. The ratio of polarization in the 10$\mu$m silicate feature to starlight polarization in the optical is shown to be insensitive to porosity and shape. X-ray scattering may be the best tool to determine the porosity of interstellar grains. We propose that modest porosities of interstellar grains could be the result of "photolytic densification". High polarization fractions observed in some Class-0 cores require processes to reduce porosities and/or increase asymmetries of aggregates in dense regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules gives an idea about the complex prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this article, we present the identification of the rotational emission lines of N-bearing molecules ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN), cyanoacetylene (HC$_{3}$N), and O-bearing molecules methyl formate (CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We also detected the emission lines of both N- and O-bearing molecule formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) in the envelope of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We have detected the $v$ = 0 and 1 states rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$OCHO. We also detected the two vibrationally excited states of HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1 and $v$7 = 2). The estimated fractional abundances of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1), HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 2), and NH$_{2}$CHO towards the IRAS 18089$-$1732 are (1.40$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$, (7.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{-11}$, (3.1$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{-11}$, and (6.25$\pm$0.82)$\times$10$^{-11}$. Similarly, the estimated fractional abundances of CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 0) and CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 1) are (1.90$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{-9}$ and (8.90$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{-10}$, respectively. We also created the integrated emission maps of the detected molecules, and the observed molecules may have originated from the extended envelope of the protostar. We show that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and HC$_{3}$N are most probably formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of the CH$_{2}$CHCN and the reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We found that NH$_{2}$CHO is probably produced due to the reaction between NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase. Similarly, CH$_{3}$OCHO is possibly created via the reaction between radical CH$_{3}$O and radical HCO on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732.

 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations hinted towards the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency band. Still, the nature of the SGWB signal cannot be confidently inferred from current data, and the leading explanation invokes mergers of supermassive black holes. If confirmed, such discovery would not only represent a turning point in our understanding of astrophysics, but it may severely limit the capability of searching for additional cosmological sources in the nHz frequency range. In this work, we build a simple framework to forecast the sensitivity of future PTA configurations and assess the parameter estimation of SGWB, which could consist of several contributions. We release the python code fastPTA implementing this framework and ready to use.

 - **Abstract**
 We continue to present the results of the Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). The main goal of this survey is to search for Herbig-Haro (HH) objects and jets in Galactic dark clouds. In this work we present the results of the search in the vicinity of infrared sources that are bright in the WISE survey and embedded in the dark clouds. The survey is performed with the 1 m Schmidt telescope of Byurakan Observatory, lately equipped with a new CCD detector, which allows to obtain one square degree images of the sky in various filters. Narrow-band filters were used to obtain Halpha and [S II] images, and a medium-width filter was used for the continuum imaging. New HH flows and knots were found near six embedded IR sources, which constitutes a significant proportion of the objects observed. At least two of the newly found HH flows (HH 1226 and HH 1227) lie in isolated dark clouds, thus pointing to active star formation in these regions. Other flows are also located in detached and dense globules or filaments. The length of the HH 1228 flow is about 1 pc; it has also a molecular hydrogen counterpart of the same extension. Coordinates, charts, detailed descriptions and distance estimates are provided. The lower limits of bolometric luminosities of the source stars are typical for low-mass young stellar objects.
