 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes occupy an intriguing region of planetary mass-radius space, where theoretical models of interior structure predict that they could be water-rich, where water is in steam and supercritical state. Such planets are expected to evolve according to the same principles as canonical H$_2$-He rich planets, but models that assume a water-dominated atmosphere consistent with the interior have not been developed yet. Here, we present a state of the art structure and evolution model for water-rich sub-Neptunes. Our set-up combines an existing atmosphere model that controls the heat loss from the planet, and an interior model that acts as the reservoir of energy. We compute evolutionary tracks of planetary radius over time. We find that planets with pure water envelopes have smaller radii than predicted by previous models, and the change in radius is much slower (within $\sim$10\%). We also find that water in the deep interior is colder than previously suggested, and can transition from plasma state to superionic ice, which can have additional implications for their evolution. We provide a grid of evolutionary tracks that can be used to infer the bulk water content of sub-Neptunes. We compare the bulk water content inferred by this model and other models available in the literature, and find statistically significant differences between models when the uncertainty on measured mass and radius are both smaller than 10\%. This study shows the importance of pursuing efforts in the modeling of volatile-rich planets, and how to connect them to observations.

          A Universal Energy Relation between synchrotron and Synchrotron Self-Compton radiation in GRBs and Blazars

 - **Abstract**
 The recent and brightest GRB 221009A observed by LHAASO marked the first detection of the onset of TeV afterglow, with a total of 7 GRBs exhibiting very high energy (VHE) afterglow radiation. However, consensus on VHE radiation of GRBs is still lacking. Multi-wavelength studies are currently a primary research method for investigating high-energy $\gamma$-ray astronomy. The limited sample of VHE GRBs, combined with their transient nature, hinders the progress of physical studies of GRBs. This paper aims to obtain useful information for GRB research through the properties of blazars, which share significant similarities with GRBs. By fitting high-quality and simultaneous multiwavelength spectral energy distributions with a one-zone leptonic model, the study explores the similarity of radiation properties of blazars and GRBs. A tight correlation between synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission luminosities suggests that blazars and GRBs share similar radiation mechanisms, to be specific, synchrotron radiation produces the observed X-ray photons, which also serve as targets for electrons in the SSC process. We hope that ground-based experiments can observe more GRBs in sub-TeV to confirm these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 The Herzberg Extensible Adaptive optics Real-Time Toolkit (HEART) is a complete framework written in C and Python for building next-generation adaptive optics (AO) system real-time controllers, with the performance needed for extremely large telescopes. With numerous HEART-based RTCs now in their design or build phases, each with different AO algorithms, target hardware, and observatory requirements, continuous automated builds and tests are a cornerstone of our development effort. In this paper we describe the many levels of testing that we perform, from low-level unit tests of individual functions, to more complex component and system-level tests that verify both numerical correctness and execution performance. Incorporating extensive testing into HEART since its inception has allowed us to continuously (and confidently) refactor and extend it to both meet the changing needs of local on-sky experiments, as well as those of the several major facility instruments that we are developing.

          Mechanical softening and enhanced elasticity of lunar olivine probed via nanoindentation and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. This may be attributed to macroscopic effects, like increased porosity, or even to modifications at the chemical bond scale. We have performed high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the elastic compressibility properties on this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, on three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite, relative to terrestrial olivine. The origin of the observed differences may be the consequence of a combination of factors reflecting their complex history. The combined study by nanoindentations and HP-XRD of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue to characterize these materials that will be crucial for future extraterrestrial resource utilization purposes.

 - **Abstract**
 Persistence effects in HgCdTe infrared detectors cause significant artifacts that can impact the quality of science observations for up to many hours after exposure to bright/saturating sources. This problem will have a substantially greater impact on viable observing modes for infrared cameras on future ELTs due to the leap in sensitivities that is expected. In this paper we present new results from an updated test system that was previously used to prototype ``on-detector guide windows'' to provide fast T/T feedback to AO systems, interleaved with simultaneous (slow) full-frame readouts for science. We now explore the possibility of continuously resetting these small regions of the detector that are illuminated with a compact source as a strategy for mitigating persistence, using two different detectors. While our results generally show promise for this observing strategy, we found for one of our detectors that the combination of fast localized resets with intense illumination can introduce a potentially problematic persistent change in local reset levels.

 - **Abstract**
 The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\bigodot$IS) energetic particle instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe is dedicated to measuring energetic ions and electrons in the near-Sun environment. It includes a half-sky-viewing time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EPI-Lo) and five high-energy silicon solid-state detector-telescopes (EPI-Hi). To August 2024, eight of EPI-Lo's eighty separate telescope foils have experienced direct dust puncture events, most of which occurred inside 40 solar radii (0.19 au). These impacts represent the closest ever direct dust detections to the Sun. While there is limited information about the size/mass of each impact due to the lack of a dedicated dust instrument, we can determine the impact direction for six punctures, allowing us to partially constrain the inner zodiacal abundance. Remarkably, one of six unambiguous dust impacters was likely on a retrograde orbit, suggesting long-period cometary material may survive within 20 solar radii (0.09 au). We discuss observations in the context of improving our understanding of the inner zodiacal dust environment, highlighting multiple dust populations responsible for these events, and refining hazard assessment for near-Sun spacecraft.

          Demise of Kreutz Sungrazing Comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS)

 - **Abstract**
 Most Kreutz family sungrazing comets are discovered only days before perihelion, severely limiting observational opportunities to study their physical nature and decay. Kreutz sungrazer C/2024 S1 (ATLAS) was discovered a month before reaching its perihelion distance of 0.008 au, allowing physical observations from both ground- and space-based telescopes. We present observations from 0.9 au to 0.4 au using the Nordic Optical Telescope showing that 1) nucleus disintegration was on-going already at 0.7 au pre-perihelion, 2) the activity varied unpredictably with distance and 3) the nucleus radius was $<$600 m (red geometric albedo 0.04 assumed). We also use coronagraphic observations from the STEREO-A spacecraft to study C/2024 S1 at heliocentric distances $\lesssim$0.1 au. We find that the coma scattering cross-section peaked near 0.075 au and faded progressively, by a factor $\sim$20, towards the last observation at 0.02 au. We interpret the near-perihelion fading as a result of the sublimation of refractory coma grains, beginning at blackbody temperatures $\sim$1000 K, consistent with olivine composition. The comet was not detected after perihelion. We consider processes operating to destroy the nucleus when near perihelion, concluding that rotational instability and sublimation losses work together towards this end, even before entry of the comet into the Roche lobe of the Sun.

          Ejecta Wakes from Companion Interaction in Type Ia Supernova Remnants

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae are triggered by accretion onto a white dwarf from a companion which is most likely Roche lobe-filling at the time of the explosion. The collision between the ejecta and a surviving companion carves out a conical wake, which could manifest as an asymmetry when the ejecta reaches the remnant phase. We simulate the companion interaction using the Athena++ hydrodynamics solver to determine the ejecta structure for a double-degenerate type Ia supernova. Ejecta in the wake is of lower density and higher velocity than the unperturbed ejecta. We then evolve the ejecta for several thousand years using the expanding-grid code Sprout. The forward shock within the wake is initially indented, but becomes spherical after roughly a thousand years due to transverse motion of shocked ejecta that fills the wake. The reverse shock travels quickly within the wake, leading to an off-center convergence of the reverse shock and leaving the remnant with an asymmetrical core. This also draws material from the interstellar medium deep into the remnant, eventually reaching the center. Large Rayleigh-Taylor plumes are found around the edge of the wake, creating a toroidal structure composed primarily of ejecta. Estimates of the thermal X-ray emission show that such remnants exhibit observable asymmetries for thousands of years.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility is a dedicated high energy astronomy and particle physics experiment planned to be installed on the Chinese space station, aiming to detect high-energy cosmic rays (\si{\giga\electronvolt} $\sim$ \si{\peta\electronvolt}) and high-energy gamma rays (> \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}). The Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD) is one of the sub-detectors of HERD, with its main function of providing real-time anti-conincidence signals for gamma-ray detection and the secondary function of measuring the charge of cosmic-rays. In 2023, a prototype of PSD was developed and tested at CERN PS\&SPS. In this paper, we investigate the position response of the PSD using two reconstruction algorithms: the classic dual-readout ratio and the deep learning method (KAN \& MLP neural network). With the latter, we achieved a position resolution of 2 mm ($1\sigma$), which is significantly better than the classic method.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of determining the parameters characterizing the shape and orientation of residual velocity ellipsoids from the Gaia DR3 red giants and subgiants. We show the distribution of velocity dispersions in the Galactic plane obtained from three components of the spatial velocity, as well as the coordinate distribution of the intersection points of the velocity ellipsoid axes with the celestial sphere, in particular the deviations of the longitudes and latitudes of the vertices of stellar regions located within spheres with a radius of 1 kpc centered in the Galactic mid-plane. The area of the Galactic disk under study is in the range of Galactocentric coordinates 0 < R < 15 kpc and $120^\circ < \theta < 240^\circ$. We show that the vertex deviations in some regions of the Galactic mid-plane can reach $30^\circ$ in longitude, and $15^\circ$ in latitude. This indicates the presence of kinematic distortions of the stellar velocity field, especially noticeable in the angular range of $150^\circ < \theta < 210^\circ$ at a distance of approximately 13 kpc. We propose the angles of deviation of longitudes and latitudes of the ellipsoid axes of residual stellar velocities to be considered as kinematic signatures of various Galactic deformations determined from real fields of spatial velocities. We present the distribution of parameters characterizing the shapes of velocity ellipsoids, as well as their distribution of the semi-axes length ratios. We note a local feature in this distribution and in the distribution of the elongation measurements of the ellipsoids. We perform a comparison of the results obtained from the tensor of deformation velocities and from the observed spatial velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 SPARC4 is a new astronomical instrument developed entirely by Brazilian institutions, currently installed on the 1.6-m Perkin-Elmer telescope of the Pico dos Dias Observatory. It allows the user to perform photometric or polarimetric observations simultaneously in the four SDSS bands (g, r, i, and z). In this paper, we describe the control system developed for SPARC4. This system is composed of S4ACS, S4ICS, and S4GUI softwares and associated hardware. S4ACS is responsible for controlling the four EMCCD scientific cameras (one for each instrument band). S4ICS controls the sensors and motors responsible for the moving parts of SPARC4. Finally, S4GUI is the interface used to perform observations, which includes the choice of instrument configuration and image acquisition parameters. S4GUI communicates with the instrument subsystems and with some observatory facilities, needed during the observations. Bench tests were performed for the determination of the overheads added by SPARC4 control system in the acquisition of photometric and polarimetric series of images. In the photometric mode, SPARC4 allows the acquisition of a series of 1400 full-frame images, with a deadtime of 4.5 ms between images. Besides, several image series can be concatenated with a deadtime of 450 ms plus the readout time of the last image. For the polarimetric mode, measurements can be obtained with a deadtime of 1.41 s plus the image readout time between subsequent waveplate positions. For both photometric and polarimetric modes, the user can choose among operating modes with image readout times between 5.9 ms and 1.24 s, which ultimately defines the instrument temporal performance.

          Examination of the Relationship Between Spectral Type and Stellar Rotational Velocity in $\sim$50,000 Single Stars

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present the results of the relationship between spectral type (ST) and the projected stellar rotational velocity ($vsini$), utilising a sample of approximately 50,000 single stars across a range of evolutionary stages. The STs of the stars included in this study span a broad range, from O0 to M9. We examine the stars in our data set, which has been divided into two groups according to ST and luminosity class (LC). The groups were conducted an investigation into the relationship between the mean $vsini$ ($\langle vsini \rangle$) and STs, as well as the dependence of $\langle vsini \rangle$ on STs and LCs. The rationale for investigating the two subgroups separately is to take into account for the evolutionary status of the stars and ascertain the impact on stellar rotation. The results demonstrate a notable decline in $\langle vsini \rangle$ as the spectral type progresses from early to late types. In particular, we found a significant decrease in $\langle vsini \rangle$ values, amounting to approximately 100 km/s, between hot stars (STs O0 to F2) and cool stars (STs F2 to M9). Moreover, a reduction in $\langle vsini \rangle$ is discernible as stars evolve, with this trend being most pronounced in evolutionary stages beyond the subgiant phase.

          Determining $H_0$ from distance sum rule combining gamma-ray bursts with observational Hubble data and strong gravitational lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Model-independent bounds on the Hubble constant $H_0$ are important to shed light on cosmological tensions. We work out a model-independent analysis based on the sum rule, which is applied to late- and early-time data catalogs to determine $H_0$. Through the model-independent Bézier interpolation of the observational Hubble data (OHD) and assuming a flat universe, we reconstruct the dimensionless distances of the sum rule and apply them to strong lensing data to derive constraints on $H_0$. Next, we extend this method to the high-redshift domain including, in other two separated analyses, gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets from the well-established Amati and Combo correlations. In all three analyses, our findings agree at $1\sigma$ level with the $H_0$ determined from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and only at $2\sigma$ level with the measurement derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our method evidences that the bounds on $H_0$ are significantly affected by strong lensing data, which favor the local measurement from SNe Ia. Including GRBs causes only a negligible decrease in the value of $H_0$. This may indicate that GRBs can be used to trace the expansion history and, in conjunction with CMB measurements, may heal the Hubble tension and accommodate to the flat $\Lambda$CDM paradigm purported by CMB data.

          The massive fast spinning white dwarf in the HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 binary

 - **Abstract**
 I review the properties and discuss some of the puzzling aspects of the unique binary system composed of the luminous hot subdwarf HD 49798 and a white dwarf with mass of 1.2 solar masses and spin period of 13.2 s. This is one of the few massive white dwarfs with a dynamically measured mass and the one with the shortest spin period. It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum, powered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO spectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough angular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of 72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the radial contraction of this young white dwarf. The higher mass transfer rate expected during the future evolutionary stages of HD 49798 will drive the white dwarf above the Chandrasekhar limit, but the final fate, a type Ia SN explosion or the collapse to a millisecond pulsar, is uncertain.

          Red supergiant stars in binary systems II. Confirmation of B-type companions of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud using Hubble ultra-violet spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiant stars (RSGs) represent the final evolutionary phase of the majority of massive stars and hold a unique role in testing the physics of stellar models. Eighty eight RSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were recently found to have an ultra-violet excess that was attributed to a B-type companion. We present follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) ultra-violet (1700 -- 3000\,Å) spectroscopy for 16 of these stars to investigate the nature of the UV excess and confirm the presence of a hot companion. In all cases we are able to confirm that the companion is a main-sequence B-type star based on the near-UV continuum. We determine effective temperatures, radii and luminosities from fitting the UV continuum with TLUSTY models and find stellar parameters in the expected range of SMC B-type stars. We display these results on a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram and assess the previously determined stellar parameters using UV photometry alone. From this comparison we conclude that UV photometric surveys are vital to identify such companions and UV spectroscopy is similarly vital to characterise the hot companions. From a comparison with IUE spectra of 32 Cyg, a well known RSG binary system in the Galaxy, four targets display evidence of being embedded in the wind of the RSG, like 32 Cyg, although none to the more extreme extent of VV Cep. The ages of six targets, determined via the stellar parameters of the hot companions, are found to be in tension with the ages determined for the RSG. A solution to this problem could be binary mass-transfer or red straggler stars.
