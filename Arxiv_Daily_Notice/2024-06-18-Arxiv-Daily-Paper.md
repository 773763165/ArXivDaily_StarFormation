          Investigation of reflection-based measurements of microwave kinetic inductance detectors in the optical bands

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the single photon response from the reflection of the Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) array. Reflection measurements are carried out using two configurations: one is measured simultaneously with the transmission, and the other is obtained with a single-ended MKID array terminated with an open load. Compared with the transmission, reflection measurements significantly reduce the readout noise of the single-ended MKID array. This is also reflected in the improvement of the median energy resolving power by around 20%-30% under pulsed photon illumination at $\lambda = 405$~nm, mainly due to an increase in the size of the resonance circle on the IQ plane. This method has the potential to be used to read out large MKID arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$-CDM model of cosmology has done much to clarify our picture of the early universe. However, there are still some questions that $\Lambda$-CDM does not necessarily answer; questions such as what is the fundamental nature of dark matter? What is its origin? And what causes the intriguing measurements that we are seeing from cosmic dawn? In this thesis, I will describe three directions in which I have pushed forward our understanding of how fundamental physics manifests in cosmology. First, I have studied the signatures of exotic energy injection in various astrophysical and cosmological probes, including the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, and the formation of the earliest stars in our universe. Second, I have investigated the formation of primordial black hole dark matter in a general model for inflation with multiple scalar fields. I have identified the space of models that can generate primordial black holes while remaining in compliance with observational constraints using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and also showed that future gravitational wave observatories will be able to further constrain these models. Finally, I have developed an analytic description of signals from 21\,cm cosmology using methods inspired by effective field theory. This method includes realistic observational effects and has been validated against state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic simulations, including those with alternative dark matter scenarios. With these recent efforts, we are advancing the frontiers of dark matter phenomenology and cosmology, thereby paving the way towards illuminating the remaining mysteries of our cosmos and drawing closer to a comprehensive understanding of the universe.

          Observational characteristics of circum-planetary-mass-object disks in the era of James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have confirmed circumplanetary disks (CPDs) embedded in parental protoplanetary disks (PPDs). On the other hand, planetary-mass companions (PMCs) and planetary-mass objects (PMOs) are likely to harbor their own accretion disks. Unlike PPDs, CPDs and other disks around planet analogues are generally too compact to be spatially resolved by current instrumentation. In this study, we generate over 4,000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of circum-PMO-disks (CPMODs) with various host temperature and disk properties, which can be categorized into four prototypes, i.e., full, pre-transitional, transitional and evolved CPMODs. We propose a classification scheme based on their near-to-mid-infrared colors. Using those CPMOD models, we synthesize JWST (NIRCam and MIRI) photometry for F444W, F1000W and F2550W wide filters. We show F444W - F1000W and F444 - F2550W colors can be applied to distinguish different types of CPMODs, especially for those around hot hosts. Our results indicate that the ongoing and future JWST observations are promising to unveil structures and properties of CPMODs.

          Time dependence of neutrino quantum kinetics in a core-collapse supernova

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the supernova core is still preliminary, despite its likely relevance to the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism. We present multi-angle and multi-energy numerical simulations of neutrino quantum kinetics within a spherically symmetric shell in the proximity of the region of neutrino decoupling. We rely on inputs from a one-dimensional core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6\ M_\odot$ and find that, at early post-bounce times ($t_{\mathrm pb} \lesssim 0.5$ s), no crossing is present in the angular distribution of the electron neutrino lepton number and flavor conversion develops due to vacuum mixing. Angular crossings appear for $t_{\textrm{pb}} \gtrsim 0.5$ s and fast flavor conversion leads to flavor equipartition, with the spectral energy distribution of $\nu_{e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) and $\nu_{x}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{x}$) becoming comparable. Notably, flavor equipartition is not a generic outcome of fast flavor conversion, but rather a consequence of the relatively similar properties of neutrinos of different flavors characterizing the late accretion phase. Artificially tweaking the collision term to introduce an electron lepton number angular crossing for $t_{\mathrm{pb}} \lesssim 0.05$ s, we observe that flavor equipartition is not achieved. While our findings are restricted to a specific supernova model, they suggest a rich phenomenology of flavor conversion in the supernova core as a function of the post-bounce time which needs to be further explored to assess its impact on the explosion mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a next-generation space very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission concept that will extend the ground-based millimeter/submillimeter arrays into space. The mission, closely aligned with the science priorities of the Japanese VLBI community, involves an active engagement of this community in the development of the mission, resulting in the formation of the Black Hole Explorer Japan Consortium. Here we present the current Japanese vision for the mission, ranging from scientific objectives to instrumentation. The Consortium anticipates a wide range of scientific investigations, from diverse black hole physics and astrophysics studied through the primary VLBI mode, to the molecular universe explored via a potential single-dish observation mode in the previously unexplored 50-70\,GHz band that would make BHEX the highest-sensitivity explorer ever of molecular oxygen. A potential major contribution for the onboard instrument involves supplying essential elements for its high-sensitivity dual-band receiving system, which includes a broadband 300\,GHz SIS mixer and a space-certified multi-stage 4.5K cryocooler akin to those used in the Hitomi and XRISM satellites by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Additionally, the Consortium explores enhancing and supporting BHEX operations through the use of millimeter/submillimeter facilities developed by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, coupled with a network of laser communication stations operated by the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology.

 - **Abstract**
 By considering the Friedmann equations emerging from the entropy-area law of black hole thermodynamics in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle, we study tachyon inflation in the early universe. The presence of a minimal length modifies the Friedmann equations and hence the slow-roll and perturbation parameters in the tachyon model. These modifications, though small, affect the viability of the tachyon inflation in confrontation with observational data. We compare the numerical results of the model with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BAO+BK14(18) data and Planck2018 TT, TE,EE +lowE+lensing+BK14(18) +BAO+LIGO $\&$ Virgo2016 data at $68\%$ and $95\%$ CL. We show that while the tachyon inflation with power-law, inverse power-law and inverse exponential potentials is not observationally viable in comparison with the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ confidence levels of the new joint data, in the presence of the minimal length the model becomes observationally viable.

 - **Abstract**
 With a dynamical mass of $3 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$, the recently discovered giant planet AF Lep b is the lowest-mass imaged planet with a direct mass measurement. Its youth and spectral type near the L/T transition make it a promising target to study the impact of clouds and atmospheric chemistry at low surface gravities. In this work, we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of AF Lep b. Across two epochs, we detect AF Lep b in F444W ($4.4 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) with S/N ratios of 9.6 and 8.7, respectively. At the planet's separation of $320 \, \mathrm{mas}$ during the observations, the coronagraphic throughput is ${\approx}7\%$, demonstrating that NIRCam's excellent sensitivity persists down to small separations. The F444W photometry of AF Lep b affirms the presence of disequilibrium carbon chemistry and enhanced atmospheric metallicity. These observations also place deep limits on wider-separation planets in the system, ruling out $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets beyond $15.6 \, \mathrm{au}$ (0.58 arcsec), $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Sat}$ planets beyond $27 \, \mathrm{au}$ (1 arcsec), and $2.8 \, M_\mathrm{Nep}$ planets beyond $67 \, \mathrm{au}$ (2.5 arcsec). We also present new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ imaging of AF Lep b; combining this with the two epochs of F444W photometry and previous Keck $L'$ photometry provides limits on the long-term 3-$5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ variability of AF Lep b on months-to-years timescales. AF Lep b is the closest-separation planet imaged with JWST to date, demonstrating that planets can be recovered well inside the nominal (50% throughput) NIRCam coronagraph inner working angle.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce the receiver architecture for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission, designed to reveal the photon ring of black holes. The primary instrument is a dual-polarization receiver operating over the 240-320 GHz frequency range, utilizing a Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) mixer. This Double-Side-Band (DSB) receiver has an intermediate frequency (IF) range of 4-12 GHz and operates at a bath temperature of 4.5 K, for optimal performance, which necessitates the integration of a cryocooler. Complementing the primary receiver is a secondary unit covering the 80-106 GHz spectrum, featuring a cryogenic low noise amplifier. This secondary receiver, affixed to the 20 K stage of the cryocooler, serves to augment the SIS receiver performance by employing the Frequency Phase Transfer technique to boost the signal-to-noise ratio at the correlator output. Together, this sophisticated receiver duo is engineered to achieve the quantum-limited sensitivity required to detect the photon ring of black holes, marking a breakthrough in astrophysical observation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a mission concept that can dramatically improve state-of-the-art astronomical very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging resolution by extending baseline distances to space. To support these scientific goals, a high data rate downlink is required from space to ground. Laser communications is a promising option for realizing these high data rate, long-distance space-to-ground downlinks with smaller space/ground apertures. Here, we present a scalable laser communications downlink design and current lasercom mission results.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of circumstellar discs (CDs) produced in hydrodynamical simulations of gravoturbulent core collapse considering Kolmogorov and Burger-type turbulence. We report that massive discs are more prevalent in the Kolmogorov regime than for Burger-type turbulence. A significant number of discs are formed with a radius of $\sim$ 15 au in both cases. However, the number of extended discs with radii $>$ 15 au is significantly larger in case of Kolmogorov turbulence. The two regimes of turbulence, in general, yield disc radii in the ranges of 7 au $-$ 30 au, and 13 au $-$ 39 au, respectively. The corresponding ranges of the disc masses are 30.37 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.92 M$_{\odot}$, and 2.09 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.13 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Moreover, the ratio $M_{\rm disc}$/$M_{\rm star}$ is higher in models of Kolmogorov-type turbulence than in models of Burgers-type turbulence. We do not find any correlation between $R_{\rm disc}$ and $M_{\rm disc}$ over the explored range of initial temperatures (8 K $-$ 14 K) and the type of turbulence. Also, for these initial thermal variations, the turbulent circumstellar disc structures do not exhibit signs of turbulent diffusion. Nonetheless, both sub and supersonic velocity dispersions cause variations in the specific angular momentum (AM) of infalling gas, especially for CDs with radii $\sim$ 16 au $-$ 21 au. The radial profiles of CDs do not correlate with the initial conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and validation of HD 21520 b, a transiting planet found with TESS and orbiting a bright G dwarf (V=9.2, $T_{eff} = 5871 \pm 62$ K, $R_{\star} = 1.04\pm 0.02\, R_{\odot}$). HD 21520 b was originally alerted as a system (TOI-4320) consisting of two planet candidates with periods of 703.6 and 46.4 days. However, our analysis supports instead a single-planet system with an orbital period of $25.1292\pm0.0001$ days and radius of $2.70 \pm 0.09\, R_{\oplus}$. Three full transits in sectors 4, 30 and 31 match this period and have transit depths and durations in agreement with each other, as does a partial transit in sector 3. We also observe transits using CHEOPS and LCOGT. SOAR and Gemini high-resolution imaging do not indicate the presence of any nearby companions, and MINERVA-Australis and CORALIE radial velocities rule out an on-target spectroscopic binary. Additionally, we use ESPRESSO radial velocities to obtain a tentative mass measurement of $7.9^{+3.2}_{-3.0}\, M_{\oplus}$, with a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 17.7 $M_{\oplus}$. Due to the bright nature of its host and likely significant gas envelope of the planet, HD 21520 b is a promising candidate for further mass measurements and for atmospheric characterization.

          The Effect of Age and Stellar Model Choice on Globular Cluster Color-to-Metallicity Conversions

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric colors of globular clusters (GCs) act as effective proxies for metallicity, since all normally used optical/IR color indices exhibit a nonlinear but monotonic relation between their integrated color and their metallicity. One color index, (g - z) or (F475W - F850LP), has been spectroscopically calibrated in several studies, providing leverage to define color-to-metallicity conversions for other indices. In this paper, building on the work of arXiv:2307.01863, we study the GC color-metallicity relation in more detail by testing the dependence of the relations on different suites of stellar models and different assumed GC ages. Though noticeable differences between models exist, we find that the net effect on the derived GCS metallicity distributions is small.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a baseline science operations plan for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), a space mission concept aiming to confirm the existence of the predicted sharp ``photon ring" resulting from strongly lensed photon trajectories around black holes, as predicted by general relativity, and to measure its size and shape to determine the black hole's spin. BHEX will co-observe with a ground-based very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) array at high-frequency radio wavelengths, providing unprecedented high resolution with the extension to space that will enable photon ring detection and studies of active galactic nuclei. Science operations require a simultaneous coordination between BHEX and a ground array of large and small radio apertures to provide opportunities for surveys and imaging of radio sources, while coordination with a growing network of optical downlink terminals provides the data rates necessary to build sensitivity on long baselines to space. Here we outline the concept of operations for the hybrid observatory, the available observing modes, the observation planning process, and data delivery to achieve the mission goals and meet mission requirements.

          Phase-resolving the absorption signatures of water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b with GEMINI-S/IGRINS

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters are among the best targets for atmospheric characterization at high spectral resolution. Resolving their transmission spectra as a function of orbital phase offers a unique window into the 3D nature of these objects. In this work, we present three transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b observed with Gemini-S/IGRINS. For the first time, we measure the phase-dependent absorption signals of CO and H$_{\text{2}}$O in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, and we find that they are different. While the blueshift of CO increases during the transit, the absorption lines of H$_{\text{2}}$O become less blueshifted with phase, and even show a redshift in the second half of the transit. These measurements reveal the distinct spatial distributions of both molecules across the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. Also, we find that the H$_{\text{2}}$O signal is absent in the first quarter of the transit, potentially hinting at cloud formation on the evening terminator of WASP-121b. To further interpret the absorption trails of CO and H$_{\text{2}}$O, as well as the Doppler shifts of Fe previously measured with VLT/ESPRESSO, we compare the data to simulated transits of WASP-121b. To this end, we post-processes the outputs of global circulation models with a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. Our analysis shows that the atmosphere of WASP-121b is subject to atmospheric drag, as previously suggested by small hotspot offsets inferred from phase-curve observations. Our study highlights the importance of phase-resolved spectroscopy in unravelling the complex atmospheric structure of ultra-hot Jupiters and sets the stage for further investigations into their chemistry and dynamics.

          Interstellar Nitrogen Isotope Ratios: Measurements on tracers of C$^{14}$N and C$^{15}$N

 - **Abstract**
 The nitrogen isotope ratio 14N/15N is a powerful tool to trace Galactic stellar nucleosynthesis and constraining Galactic chemical evolution. Previous observations have found lower 14N/15N ratios in the Galactic center and higher values in the Galactic disk. This is consistent with the inside-out formation scenario of our Milky Way. However, previous studies mostly utilized double isotope ratios also including 12C/13C, which introduces additional uncertainties. Here we therefore present observations of C14N and its rare isotopologue, C15N, toward a sample of star forming regions, measured by the IRAM 30 m and/or the ARO 12 m telescope at $\lambda$ ~3 mm wavelength. For those 35 sources detected in both isotopologues, physical parameters are determined. Furthermore we have obtained nitrogen isotope ratios using the strongest hyperfine components of CN and C15N. For those sources showing small deviations from Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium and/or self-absorption, the weakest hyperfine component, likely free of the latter effect, was used to obtain reliable 14N/15N values. Our measured 14N/15N isotope ratios from C14N and C15N measurements are compatible with those from our earlier measurements of NH3 and 15NH3 (Paper I), i.e., increasing ratios to a Galacticentric distance of ~9 kpc. The unweighted second order polynomial fit yields $\frac{{\rm C^{14}N}}{{\rm C^{15}N}} = (-4.85 \pm 1.89)\;{\rm kpc^{-2}} \times R_{\rm GC}^{2} + (82.11 \pm 31.93) \;{\rm kpc^{-1}} \times R_{\rm GC} - (28.12 \pm 126.62)$. Toward the outer galaxy, the isotope ratio tends to decrease, supporting an earlier finding by H13CN/HC15N. Galactic chemical evolution models are consistent with our measurements of the 14N/15N isotope ratio, i.e. a rising trend from the Galactic center region to approximately 9 kpc, followed by a decreasing trend with increasing $R_{\rm GC}$ toward the outer Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 After decades of brown dwarf discovery and follow-up, we can now infer the functional form of the mass distribution within 20 parsecs, which serves as a constraint on star formation theory at the lowest masses. Unlike objects on the main sequence that have a clear luminosity-to-mass correlation, brown dwarfs lack a correlation between an observable parameter (luminosity, spectral type, or color) and mass. A measurement of the brown dwarf mass function must therefore be procured through proxy measurements and theoretical models. We utilize various assumed forms of the mass function, together with a variety of birthrate functions, low-mass cutoffs, and theoretical evolutionary models, to build predicted forms of the effective temperature distribution. We then determine the best fit of the observed effective temperature distribution to these predictions, which in turn reveals the most likely mass function. We find that a simple power law ($dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha \approx 0.5$ is optimal. Additionally, we conclude that the low-mass cutoff for star formation is $\lesssim0.005M_{\odot}$. We corroborate the findings of Burgasser (2004) which state that the birthrate has a far lesser impact than the mass function on the form of the temperature distribution, but we note that our alternate birthrates tend to favor slightly smaller values of $\alpha$ than the constant birthrate. Our code for simulating these distributions is publicly available. As another use case for this code, we present findings on the width and location of the subdwarf temperature gap by simulating distributions of very old (8-10 Gyr) brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy has enabled unprecedented insights into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum combines contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, but these limbs may have different temperatures, compositions, and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. High-resolution ground-based observations have detected limb asymmetry on several ultra-hot (>2000 K) exoplanets, but space-based investigation into limb asymmetry is in its infancy, and limb asymmetry's prevalence in the broader exoplanet population remains unexplored. We find evidence for limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107b via transmission spectroscopy from 2.5 to 4.0 micrometers with JWST/NIRCam. This is one of the first low-resolution space-based measurements of limb asymmetry and is unique because, at 770 K, WASP-107b is in a relatively cool regime where planetary terminators are expected to be homogeneous. These observations imply a difference in temperature and cloud properties between WASP-107b's limbs, challenging our models of limb asymmetry in this cooler regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the nucleosynthetic isotope composition of the outermost protoplanetary disk is critical to understand the formation and early dynamical evolution of the Solar System. We report the discovery of outer disk material preserved in a pristine meteorite based on its chemical composition, organic-rich petrology, and 15N-rich, deuterium-rich, and 16O-poor isotope signatures. We infer that this outer disk material originated in the comet-forming region. The nucleosynthetic Fe, Mg, Si and Cr compositions of this material reveal that, contrary to current belief, the isotope signature of the comet-forming region is ubiquitous amongst outer Solar System bodies, possibly reflecting an important planetary building block in the outer Solar System. This nucleosynthetic component represents fresh material added to the outer disk by late accretion streamers connected to the ambient molecular cloud. Our results show that most Solar System carbonaceous asteroids accreted material from the comet-forming region, a signature lacking in the terrestrial planet region.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar neutral (ISN) hydrogen is the most abundant species in the outer heliosheath and the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). Charge exchange collisions in the outer heliosheath result in filtration, reducing the ISN hydrogen density inside the heliosphere. Additionally, these atoms are intensively ionized close to the Sun, resulting in a substantial reduction of their density within a few au from the Sun. The products of this ionization - pickup ions (PUIs) - are detected by charged particle detectors. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on New Horizons provides, for the first time, PUI observations from the distant heliosphere. We analyze the observations collected between 22 and 52 au from the Sun to find the ISN hydrogen density profile and compare the results with predictions from global heliosphere models. We conclude that the density profile derived from the observations is inconsistent with steady-state model predictions. This discrepancy is not explained by time variations close to the Sun and thus may be related to the temporal evolution of the outer boundaries or VLISM conditions. Furthermore, we show that the cold and hot models of ISN hydrogen distribution are not a good approximation closer to the termination shock. Therefore, we recommend a new fiduciary point based on the available New Horizons observations at 40 au from the Sun, at ecliptic direction (285.62°, 1.94°), where the ISN hydrogen density is 0.11 cm$^{-3}$. The continued operation of New Horizons should give better insight into the source of the discussed discrepancy.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of several L-band emission sources in the S cluster has led to a rich discussion of their nature. However, a definitive answer to the classification of the dusty objects requires an explanation for the detection of compact Doppler-shifted Br$\gamma$ emission. The ionized hydrogen in combination with the observation of mid-infrared $L$-band continuum emission suggests that most of these sources are embedded in a dusty envelope. These embedded sources are part of the S-cluster, and their relationship to the S-stars is still under debate. Until now, the question of the origin of these two populations is vague, although all explanations favor migration processes for the individual cluster members. This work revisits the S-cluster and its dusty members orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr~A* on bound Keplerian orbits from a kinematic perspective. The aim is to explore the Keplerian parameters for patterns that might imply a non-random distribution of the sample. Additionally, various analytical aspects are considered to address the nature of the dusty sources. Based on the photometric analysis, we estimated the individual $H-K$ and $K-L$ colors for the source sample and compared the results to known cluster members. The classification revealed a noticeable contrast between the S-stars and the dusty sources. To fit the flux-density distribution, we utilized the radiative transfer code HYPERION and implemented a Young Stellar Object Class I model. We obtained the position angle from the Keplerian fit results, and additionally, we analyzed the distribution of the inclinations and the longitudes of the ascending node. The colors of the dusty sources suggest a stellar nature consistent with the spectral energy distribution in the near and mid-infrared domains.

 - **Abstract**
 Considering the possibility of complex organic molecules and microbial life appearing under the ice shell of those satellites in the Solar system, this study investigates the possible analog sources (targeting the potential ice satellite hosting, Jupiter and Saturn-like planets in exoplanet databases) and the transport of such bioaerosols in an attempt to support or contradict Panspermia, a fringe theory about the fertilization of Earth. Along many general parameters of the candidate planets, the host star, and the star system, additional factors thought to be related to Panspermia were also considered (e.g., the evolution of icy satellites, the frequency of impact related ejection, the traveling time from a source, and so on), revealing the following results. Eleven exosystems, with candidate gas giants hosting icy satellites, were found in a database listing more than 5000 exoplanets. The exomoons of the oldest systems (c.a. > 8 Ga; HD 191939, HD 4203, and HD 34445) could have developed rapidly considering the short formation time (~100 Myrs), which may result in the overlap of the putative early biological evolution and asteroid bombardment phase, providing a higher chance to bioaerosol ejection to space due to frequent collisions. However, the direct transfer might have occurred too early, even before our Solar system was formed, which prevented the fertilization of the latter. A longer formation of the exomoons (~3 Gyrs) significantly reduces the chance of ejection into space by asteroid impacts, which become less frequent over time, but increased the chance of arrival in time to the Solar system. Younger systems, such as HD 217107, HD 219828, HD 140901, and HD 156279 (c.a. 4 to 6 Ga), are better candidates of putative microbe source if the short icy satellite formation, along the higher impact and ejection frequency are expected considering direct transport from those systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.

 - **Abstract**
 I summarize the stellar side of the cosmological lithium problem(s). Evidence from independent studies is accumulating and indicates that stars may very well be fully responsible for lowering their surface lithium from the predicted primordial value to observed levels through internal element-transport mechanisms collectively referred to as atomic diffusion. While atomic diffusion can be modelled from first principles, stellar evolution uses a parametrized representation of convection making it impossible to predict convective-boundary mixing as a vital stellar process moderating atomic diffusion. More work is clearly needed here for a fully quantitative picture of lithium (and metallicity) evolution as stars age. Lastly, note that inferred stellar lithium-6 abundances have all but disappeared.

 - **Abstract**
 The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a space-based very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission aimed at precision black hole measurements, detecting the photon ring around black holes, exploring spacetime, spin, and mass properties, and validating predictions of General Relativity. These objectives are achieved using cryogenic receivers with quantum-limited sensitivities across a broad frequency range. Dual-band receivers at 80-106 GHz and 240-320 GHz require operating temperatures of 20 K and 4.5 K, respectively. A cryocooling system with two cold stages will be employed: a 20 K stage handling a 125 mW heat load and a 4.5 K stage handling a 10 mW heat load. To design the cryocooling system, the mission leverages existing space industry technology at high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), informed by missions such as Planck, JEM/SMILES, Hitomi, and XRISM, and advancements from the ACTDP/JWST program. Integrating the cryocooler with the receivers and broader instrument involves careful consideration of thermal challenges, including linking the cold ends of each cooling stage to minimize heat losses and ensuring adequate passive cooling for the cryocooler warm end heat rejection. Key challenges and trade-offs include sizing the mass and reducing power consumption while meeting the receiver cold temperature requirements, which impact the scientific objectives. This paper addresses efforts to balance the scientific requirements with the limitations of technical cryocooling capabilities within the framework of a small-class (SMEX) space mission, presenting an overview of cooling needs, initial design considerations, a survey of 4 K spaceflight cryocooler developments, and trade-offs.

 - **Abstract**
 The metal mass fractions of gas giants are a powerful tool to constrain their formation mechanisms and evolution. The metal content is inferred by comparing mass and radius measurements with interior structure and evolution models. In the midst of the JWST, CHEOPS, TESS, and the forthcoming PLATO era, we are at the brink of obtaining unprecedented precision in radius, age and atmospheric metallicity measurements. To prepare for this wealth of data, we present the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), an easy-to-use, publicly available Python package. The code is optimized to rapidly calculate mass-radius relations, and radius and luminosity thermal evolution curves for a variety of envelope compositions and core mass fractions. Its applicability spans planets with masses $17 \ M_{\oplus} < M < 6 \ M_{Jup}$, and equilibrium temperatures $T_{eq} < 1000$ K. The interior model is stratified in a core composed of water and rock, and an envelope constituted by H/He and metals (water). The interior is coupled to a grid of self-consistent, cloud-free atmospheric models to determine the atmospheric and boundary interior temperature, as well as the contribution of the atmosphere to the total radius. We successfully validate GASTLI by comparing it to previous work and data of the Solar System's gas giants and Neptune. We also test GASTLI on the Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26 b, finding a bulk metal mass fraction between 0.60-0.78 and a core mass of 8.5-14.4 $M_{\oplus}$. Finally, we explore the impact of different equations of state and assumptions, such as C/O ratio and transit pressure, in the estimation of bulk metal mass fraction. These differences between interior models entail a change in radius of up to 2.5% for Jupiter-mass planets, but more than 10\% for Neptune-mass. These are equivalent to variations in core mass fraction of 0.07, or 0.10 in envelope metal mass fraction.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing, resulting from the bending of light due to the presence of matter along the line of sight, is a potent tool for exploring large-scale structures, particularly in quantifying non-Gaussianities. It stands as a pivotal objective for upcoming surveys. In the realm of current and forthcoming full-sky weak-lensing surveys, the convergence maps, representing a line-of-sight integration of the matter density field up to the source redshift, facilitate field-level inference, providing an advantageous avenue for cosmological exploration. Traditional two-point statistics fall short of capturing non-Gaussianities, necessitating the use of higher-order statistics to extract this crucial information. Among the various higher-order statistics available, the wavelet $\ell_1$-norm has proven its efficiency in inferring cosmology (Ajani et al.2021). However, the lack of a robust theoretical framework mandates reliance on simulations, demanding substantial resources and time. Our novel approach introduces a theoretical prediction of the wavelet $\ell_1$-norm for weak lensing convergence maps, grounded in the principles of Large-Deviation theory. We present, for the first time, a theoretical prediction of the wavelet $\ell_1$-norm for convergence maps, derived from the theoretical prediction of their one-point probability distribution. Additionally, we explore the cosmological dependence of this prediction and validate the results on simulations. A comparison of our predicted wavelet $\ell_1$-norm with simulations demonstrates a high level of accuracy in the weakly non-linear regime. Moreover, we show its ability to capture cosmological dependence, paving the way for a more robust and efficient parameter inference process.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a common prediction in various models of the early Universe. Despite constraints at different frequency ranges and claims of detection in the nHz range by Pulsar Timing Arrays, the amplitude and spectral dependence of the SGWB in the mHz range remain largely unknown. Plausible models of early Universe Physics predict a wide range of SGWB amplitudes, from undetectable to exceeding the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. This paper explores the potential impact of a prominent primordial SGWB on LISA's main scientific targets. Our main analyses focuses on Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). By employing publicly available MBHB population models and state-of-the-art LISA's forecasting pipeline, we analyze the effects of the SGWB on MBHB detections. We find that the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio induced by a strong primordial GWB can significantly reduce the number of detectable events, compromise the precision of constraints, and even hinder sky localization for some events. We also examine the impact of the SGWB on Stellar Origin Black Hole Binaries (SOBHBs) and Galactic Binaries (GBs), which are fainter sources than MBHBs. Depending on the spectral properties of the SGWB, we conclude that these sources could be either marginally affected or rendered completely undetectable. This largely unexplored aspect raises critical questions about the potential challenges posed by a prominent SGWB to LISA's astrophysical objectives, including MBHBs, SOBHBs, and GBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic Dark Ages represent a pivotal epoch in the evolution of the Universe, marked by the emergence of the first cosmic structures under the influence of dark matter. The 21-cm hydrogen line, emanating from the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, serves as a critical probe into this era. We describe the development and implementation of the spectrometer for CosmoCube, a novel lunar orbiting CubeSat designed to detect the redshifted 21-cm signal within the redshift range of 13 to 150. Our instrumentation utilizes a Xilinx RFSoC, which integrates both Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), tailored for the spectrometer component of the radiometer. This system is characterized by a 4096 FFT length at 62.5 kHz steps using a Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB), achieving an average Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of 11.5 bits throughout the frequency of interest, from 10 MHz to 100 MHz. The spectrometer design is further refined through loopback tests involving both DAC and ADC of the RFSoC, with DAC outputs varying between high (+1 dBm) and low (-3 dBm) power modes to characterize system performance. The power consumption was optimized to 5.45 W using three ADCs and one DAC for the radiometer. Additionally, the stability of the ADC noise floor was investigated in a thermal chamber with environmental temperatures ranging from 5°C to 40°C. A consistent noise floor of approximately -152.5 dBFS/Hz was measured, with a variation of $\pm$0.2 dB, ensuring robust performance under varying thermal conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes specification and early design of back end signal processing subsystems for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) space telescope. The "back end" consists of two subsystems. First, the block downconverter (BDC) is a heterodyne system that performs a frequency translation of the analog signal from IF to baseband and amplifies and filters it for digitization. Second, the digital back end (DBE) samples the analog signal with an analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and digitally processes the data stream formatting them to the VLBI "VDIF" standard and converting to Ethernet packets for 100 gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) Ethernet transport to the optical downlink system. Both the BDC and the DBE for BHEX support eight channels of 4.096 GHz bandwidth each, for a total processed bandwidth of 32.768 GHz. The BHEX back end benefits from mature terrestrial back end heritage, described in some detail. The BHEX back end itself is in the early stages of design, with requirements, interface specifications, and component trade studies well advanced. The aim is to build a prototype using terrestrial grade parts which are available in functionally identical space grade equivalents, and to use this prototype to advance the back end Technology Readiness Level (TRL) preparing for a Small Explorer (SMEX) proposal in 2025.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon monoxide (CO) emission has been observed in a number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and is known to be an important coolant at late times. We have implemented a chemical reaction network in the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN to investigate the formation of CO and its impact on SN ejecta. We calculate two 1D SN models with and without CO: a BSG explosion model at one nebular epoch and a full time sequence (50 to 300 days) for a RSG explosion. In both models, CO forms at nebular times in the dense, inner regions at velocities $<2000 \mathrm{km/s}$ where line emission from CO can dominate the cooling and reduce the local temperature by as much as a factor of two, weakening emission lines and causing the optical light curve to fade faster. That energy is instead emitted in CO bands, primarily the fundamental band at $\sim 4.5\mathrm{\mu m}$, which accounts for up to 20% of the total luminosity at late times. However, the non-monotonic nature of the CO cooling function can cause numerical difficulties and introduce multiple temperature solutions. This issue is compounded by the sensitivity of the CO abundance to a few reaction rates, many of which have large uncertainties or disparate values across literature sources. Our results also suggest that, in many SNe, CO level populations are far from their LTE values. Unfortunately, accurate collisional data, necessary to compute NLTE populations, are limited to a few transitions.

 The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a space very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission concept that is currently under development. BHEX will study supermassive black holes at unprecedented resolution, isolating the signature of the "photon ring" - light that has orbited the black hole before escaping - to probe physics at the edge of the observable universe. It will also measure black hole spins, study the energy extraction and acceleration mechanisms for black hole jets, and characterize the black hole mass distribution. BHEX achieves high angular resolution by joining with ground-based millimeter-wavelength VLBI arrays, extending the size, and therefore improving the angular resolution of the earthbound telescopes. Here we discuss the science instrument concept for BHEX. The science instrument for BHEX is a dual-band, coherent receiver system for 80-320 GHz, coupled to a 3.5-meter antenna. BHEX receiver front end will observe simultaneously with dual polarizations in two bands, one sampling 80-106 GHz and one sampling 240-320 GHz. An ultra-stable quartz oscillator provides the master frequency reference and ensures coherence for tens of seconds. To achieve the required sensitivity, the front end will instantaneously receive 32 GHz of frequency bandwidth, which will be digitized to 64 Gbits/sec of incompressible raw data. These data will be buffered and transmitted to the ground via laser data link, for correlation with data recorded simultaneously at radio telescopes on the ground. We describe the challenges associated with the instrument concept and the solutions that have been incorporated into the baseline design.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements and analyses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration and supernova surveys combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, indicate that the dark energy density changes over time. Here we explore the possibility that the dark energy density is constant, but that the cosmological recombination history differs substantially from that in $\Lambda$CDM. When we free up the ionization history, but otherwise assume the standard cosmological model, we find the combination of CMB and DESI data prefer i) early recombination qualitatively similar to models with small-scale clumping, ii) a value of $H_0$ consistent with the estimate from the SH0ES Collaboration at the $2\sigma$ level, and iii) a higher CMB lensing power, which takes pressure off of otherwise tight constraints on the sum of neutrino masses. Our work provides additional motivation for finding physical models that lead to the small-scale clumping that can theoretically explain the ionization history preferred by DESI and CMB data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two-dimensional near-infrared temperature maps of the canonical hot Jupiter WASP-43b using a phase-curve observation with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. From the white-light planetary transit, we improve constraints on the planet's orbital parameters and measure a planet-to-star radius ratio of $0.15883^{+0.00056}_{-0.00053}$. Using the white-light phase curve, we measure a longitude of maximum brightness of $6.9^{+0^\circ.5}_{-0^\circ.5}$ east of the substellar point and a phase-curve offset of $10.0^{+0^\circ.8}_{-0^\circ.8}$. We also find an $\approx4\sigma$ detection of a latitudinal hotspot offset of $-13.4^{+3^\circ.2}_{-1^\circ.7}$, the first significant detection of a non-equatorial hotspot in an exoplanet atmosphere. We show that this detection is robust to variations within planetary parameter uncertainties, but only if the transit is used to improve constraints, showing the importance of transit observations to eclipse mapping. Maps retrieved from the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors are similar, with hotspot locations consistent between the two detectors at the $1\sigma$ level. Our JWST data show brighter (hotter) nightsides and a dimmer (colder) dayside at the shorter wavelengths relative to fits to \textit{Spitzer} 3.6 and 4.5 \microns\ phase curves. Through comparison between our phase curves and a set of general circulation models, we find evidence for clouds on the nightside and atmospheric drag or high metallicity reducing the eastward hotspot offset.

 Most stars form in multiple systems whose properties can significantly impact circumstellar disk evolution. We investigate the physical and chemical properties of the equal-mass, small separation (~66 mas, ~9 au) DF Tau binary system. Previous observations indicated that only DF Tau A has a circumstellar disk. We present JWST-MIRI MRS observations of DF Tau. The MIRI spectrum shows a forest of H2O lines and emission from CO, C2H2, HCN, CO2, and OH. LTE slab models are used to determine the properties of the gas, and we analyze high angular spatial and spectral resolution data from ALMA, VLTI-GRAVITY, and IRTF-iSHELL to aid in the interpretation of the JWST data. The 1.3 mm ALMA continuum data show two equal-brightness sources of compact (R<3 au) emission, with separations and movement consistent with astrometry from VLTI-GRAVITY and the known orbit. This is interpreted as a robust detection of a disk around DF Tau B, which we suggest may host a small (~1 au) cavity to reconcile all observations. The disk around DF Tau A is expected to be a full disk, and spatially and spectrally resolved dust and gas emission points to hot, close-in (<0.2 au) material. Hot (~500-1000 K) H2O, HCN, and C2H2 emission in the MIRI data likely originate in the DF Tau A disk, while a cold (<200 K) H2O component with an extended emitting area is consistent with an origin from both disks. Despite the very compact outer disks, the inner disk composition and conditions are similar to isolated systems, suggesting that the close binary nature is not a driving factor in setting the inner disk chemistry. However, constraining the geometry of the disks, for instance, via higher resolution ALMA observations, would provide additional insight into the mid-infrared gas emission. JWST observations of spatially resolved binaries will be important for understanding the impact of binarity on inner disk chemistry more generally.

 - **Abstract**
 In this effort, we demonstrate the performance of a highly stable time reference for the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) mission, a space-based extension to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) project. This precision timing system is based on the use of a space-qualified, ultra-low noise laser developed as part of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission as the timing reference, and an optical frequency comb to transfer the stability of this laser to the microwave regime for instrumentation use. We describe the implementation of this system and experimental setup to characterize the stability performance. We present the results of this experiment that demonstrate the performance of this system meets requirements for the BHEX mission.
