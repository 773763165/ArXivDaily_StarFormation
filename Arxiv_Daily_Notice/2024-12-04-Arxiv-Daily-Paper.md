 - **Abstract**
 Determining the internal structure of Uranus is a key objective for planetary science. Knowledge of Uranus's bulk composition and the distribution of elements is crucial to understanding its origin and evolutionary path. In addition, Uranus represents a poorly understood class of intermediate-mass planets (intermediate in size between the relatively well studied terrestrial and gas giant planets), which appear to be very common in the Galaxy. As a result, a better characterization of Uranus will also help us to better understand exoplanets in this mass and size regime. Recognizing the importance of Uranus, a Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) workshop was held in September 2023 to investigate how we can improve our knowledge of Uranus's internal structure in the context of a future Uranus mission that includes an orbiter and a probe. The scientific goals and objectives of the recently released Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey were taken as our starting point. We reviewed our current knowledge of Uranus's interior and identified measurement and other mission requirements for a future Uranus spacecraft, providing more detail than was possible in the Decadal Survey's mission study and including new insights into the measurements to be made. We also identified important knowledge gaps to be closed with Earth-based efforts in the near term that will help guide the design of the mission and interpret the data returned.

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk abundances of exoplanetesimals can be measured when they are accreted by white dwarfs. Recently, lithium from the accretion of exoplanetesimals was detected in relatively high levels in multiple white dwarfs. There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection of excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring material. We present new observations of three previously known lithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and one with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619). We also present atmospheric model fits to these white dwarfs. We then evaluate the abundances of these white dwarfs and two additional lithium-polluted white dwarfs that were previously fit using the same atmospheric models (WD J1644$-$0449 and SDSS J1330+6435) in the context of the three extant hypotheses for explaining lithium excesses in polluted white dwarfs. We find Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis to be the most plausible explanation of the abundances in WD J1644$-$0449, WD J1824+1213, and WD J2317+1830. SDSS J1330+6435 will require stricter abundances to determine its planetesimal's origins, and LHS 2534, as presently modeled, defies all three hypotheses. We find the accretion of an exomoon formed from spalled ring material to be highly unlikely to be the explanation of the lithium excess in any of these cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Venus's climatic history provides powerful constraint on the location of the inner-edge of the liquid-water habitable zone. However, two very different histories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate climate for billions of years, with surface liquid water, and the other where a hot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water. Here we offer a novel constraint on Venus's climate history by inferring the water content of its interior. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and OCS, which must be restored by volcanism to maintain atmospheric stability, we show Venus's interior is dry. Venusian volcanic gases have at most a 6% water mole fraction, substantially drier than terrestrial magmas degassed at similar conditions. The dry interior is consistent with Venus ending its magma ocean epoch desiccated and thereafter having had a long-lived dry surface. Volcanic resupply to Venus's atmosphere therefore indicates that the planet has never been `liquid-water' habitable.

          Transformation relations for UBV photometric system of 1m telescope at the T\"{U}B\.{I}TAK National Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 UBV CCD observations of standard stars selected from Landolt (2009, 2013) were performed using the 1-meter telescope (T100) of the TÜBİTAK National Observatory equipped with a back-illuminated and UV enhanced CCD camera and Bessell UBV filters. Observations span a long time from the years 2012 to 2024, 50 photometric nights in total. Photometric measurements were used to find the standard transformation relations of the T100 photometric system. The atmospheric extinction coefficients, zero points and transformation coefficients of each night were determined. It could not be found time dependence of the secondary extinction coefficients. However, it was determined that the primary extinction coefficients decreased until the year 2019 and increased after that year. It could not be found a strong seasonal variation of the extinction coefficients. Small differences in seasonal median values of them were used to attempt to find the atmospheric extinction sources. We found calculated minus catalogue values for each standard star, $\Delta(U-B)$, $\Delta(B-V)$ and $\Delta V$. Means and standard deviations of $\Delta(U-B)$, $\Delta(B-V)$ and $\Delta V$ were estimated to be 1.4$\pm$76, 1.9$\pm$18 and 0.0$\pm$36 mmag, respectively. We found that our data well matched Landolt's standards for $V$ and $B-V$, i.e. there are no systematic differences. However, there are systematic differences for $U-B$ between the two photometric systems, which is probably originated from the quantum efficiency differences of the detectors used in the photometric systems, although the median differences are relatively small ($|\Delta(U-B)|$< 50 mmag) for stars with $-0.5<U-B~{(\rm mag)} <1.6$ and $0.2<B-V~{(\rm mag)} <1.8$. As an overall result, we conclude that the transformation relations found in this study can be used for standardized photometry with the T100 photometric system.

          Clustering and Runaway Merging in a Primordial Black Hole Dominated Universe

 - **Abstract**
 If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their contribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and generically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially small. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable

          CO2-rich protoplanetary discs as a probe of dust radial drift & trapping

 - **Abstract**
 MIR spectra imply considerable chemical diversity in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs: some are H2O-dominated, others by CO2. Sublimating ices from radially drifting dust grains are often invoked to explain some of this diversity, particularly the H2O-rich discs. We use a 1D protoplanetary disc evolution code to model how radially drifting dust grains that transport ices inwards to snowlines impact the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. We explore differences between smooth discs and those where radial drift is impeded by dust trapping outside gas gaps and quantify the effects of gap location and formation time. Discs evolve through an initial H2O-rich phase due to sublimating ices, followed by a CO2-rich phase as H2O vapour advects onto the star and CO2 advects into the inner disc from its snowline. The inclusion of traps hastens the transition between the phases, raising the CO2/H2O ratio; gaps opened early or close-in produce lower increases by blocking more CO2 ice from reaching the inner disc. This leads to a potential correlation between CO2/H2O and gap location that occurs on Myr timescales for fiducial parameters. We produce synthetic spectra from the models which we analyse with 0D LTE slab models to understand how this evolution may be expressed observationally. Whether the evolution can be retrieved depends on the contribution of dust grains to the optical depth: dust that couples to the gas after crossing the H2O snowline can add to the continuum optical depth and obscure the delivered H2O, largely hiding the evolution in its visible column density. However, the CO2/H2O visible column density ratio is only weakly sensitive to dust continuum obscuration. This suggests it may be a clearer tracer of the impact of transport on chemistry than individual column densities for spectra that show weak features probing deep enough in the disc. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Horizon-scale imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has provided transformative insights into supermassive black holes but its resolution and scope are limited by ground-based constraints such as the size of the Earth, its relatively slow rotation, and atmospheric delays. Space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers the capability for studying a larger and more diverse sample of black holes. We identify a number of nearby supermassive black holes as prime candidates for horizon-scale imaging at millimeter wavelengths, and use source characteristics such as angular size, sky distribution, and variability timescales to shape the design of a space-based array. We identify specific metrics that serve as key predictors of image fidelity and scientific potential, providing a quantitative basis for optimizing mission design parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal configuration requires two space-based elements in high Earth orbits (HEO) that are not coplanar and are apparently counter-rotating. Our results delineate the key requirements for a space-based VLBI mission, enabling detailed studies of black hole shadows, plasma dynamics, and jet formation, advancing black hole astrophysics beyond the current capabilities of the EHT.

 - **Abstract**
 Significant mass loss in the red supergiant (RSG) phase has great influence on the evolution of massive stars and their final fate as supernovae. We present near-infrared interferometric imaging of the circumstellar environment of the dust-enshrouded RSG WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. WOH G64 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.0--2.45 micron. We succeeded in imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of WOH G64 -- the first interferometric imaging of an RSG outside the Milky Way. The reconstructed image reveals elongated compact emission with a semimajor and semiminor axis of ~2 and ~1.5 mas (~13 and 9 stellar radii), respectively. The GRAVITY data show that the stellar flux contribution at 2.2 micron at the time of our observations in 2020 is much lower than predicted by the optically and geometrically thick dust torus model based on the VLTI/MIDI data taken in 2005 and 2007. We found a significant change in the near-infrared spectrum of WOH G64: while the (spectro)photometric data taken at 1--2.5 micron before 2003 show the spectrum of the central RSG with H2O absorption, the spectra and JHK' photometric data taken after 2016 are characterized by a monotonically rising continuum with very weak signatures of H2O. This spectral change likely took place between December 2009 and 2016. On the other hand, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained in 2022 with VLT/VISIR agrees well with the spectra obtained before 2007. The compact emission imaged with GRAVITY and the near-infrared spectral change suggest the formation of hot new dust close to the star, which gives rise to the monotonically rising near-infrared continuum and the high obscuration of the central star. The elongation of the emission may be due to the presence of a bipolar outflow or effects of an unseen companion.

          Late-time Evolution and Instabilities of Tidal Disruption Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) on a timescale of years after the main flare show evidence of continued activity in the form of optical/UV emission, quasi-periodic eruptions, and delayed radio flares. Motivated by this, we explore the time evolution of these disks using semi-analytic models to follow the changing disk properties and feeding rate to the central black hole (BH). We find that thermal instabilities typically begin $\sim150-250\,{\rm days}$ after the TDE, causing the disk to cycle between high and low accretion states for up to $\sim10-20\,{\rm yrs}$. The high state is super-Eddington, which may be associated with outflows that eject $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}\,M_\odot$ with a range of velocities of $\sim0.03-0.3c$ over a span of a couple of days and produce radio flares. In the low state, the accretion rate slowly grows over many months to years as continued fallback accretion builds the mass of the disk. In this phase, the disk may reach luminosities of $\sim10^{41}-10^{42}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the UV as seen in some late-time observations. We highlight the importance of the iron-opacity "bump" at $\approx2\times10^5\,{\rm K}$ in generating sufficiently high luminosities. This work suggests that joint optical/UV observations with radio monitoring could be key for following the disk state as the radio flares are produced.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA-IMF imaged 15 massive protoclusters down to a resolution of of 2 kau scales, identifying about 1000 star-forming cores. The mass and luminosity of these cores, which are fundamental physical characteristics, are difficult to determine, a problem greatly exacerbated at the distances >2 kpc of ALMA-IMF protoclusters. We combined new datasets and radiative transfer modeling to characterize these cores. We estimated their mass-averaged temperature and the masses these estimates imply. For 1/6 of the sample, we measured the bolometric luminosities, implementing deblending corrections when necessary. We used spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis obtained with the PPMAP Bayesian procedure, which aims to preserve the best angular resolution of the input data. We extrapolated the luminosity and dust temperature images provided by PPMAP at 2.5" resolution to estimate those of individual cores, which were identified at higher angular resolution. To do this, we applied approximate radiative transfer relationships between the luminosity of a protostar and the temperature of its surrounding envelope and between the external heating of prestellar cores and their temperatures. For the first time, we provide data-informed estimates of dust temperatures for 883 cores identified with ALMA-IMF: 17-31 K and 28-79 K (5th and 95th percentiles, up to 127 K) for the 617 prestellar and 266 protostellar cores, respectively. We also measured protostellar luminosities spanning 20-80 000 Lsun. For hot cores, we estimated systematically lower temperatures than studies based on complex organic molecules. We established a mass-luminosity evolutionary diagram, for the first time at the core spatial resolution and for a large sample of high-mass protostellar cores. The ALMA-IMF data favor a scenario in which protostars accrete their mass from a larger mass reservoir than their host cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of three new transiting giant planets orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837 and TOI-5027, and one new warm sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328, whose transits events were detected in the lightcurves of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \textbf{(TESS)} space mission. By combining TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations we confirm the planetary nature of the observed transits and radial velocity variations. TOI-6628~$b$ has a mass of 0.75$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.98$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and is orbiting a metal-rich star with a period of 18.18424$\pm{0.00001}$ days and an eccentricity of 0.667$\pm0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric orbits of all known warm giants. TOI-3837~$b$ has a mass of 0.59$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.96$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and orbits its host star every 11.88865$\pm$0.00003~days, with a moderate eccentricity of 0.198$^{+0.046}_{-0.058}$. With a mass of 2.01$\pm$0.13~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.99$^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ $R_J$, TOI-5027~$b$ orbits its host star in an eccentric orbit with $e$~=~0.395$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ every 10.24368$\pm{0.00001}$~days. TOI-2328~$b$ is a Saturn-like planet with a mass of 0.16$\pm$0.02~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.89$\pm$0.04~$R_J$, orbiting its host star in a nearly circular orbit with $e$~=~0.057$^{+0.046}_{-0.029}$ at an orbital period of 17.10197$\pm{0.00001}$ days. All four planets have orbital periods above 10 days, and our planet interior structure models are consistsent a rocky-icy core with a H/He envelope, providing evidence supporting the core accretion model of planet formation for this kind of planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial information about the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.

 Atmospheric studies are essential for elucidating the formation history, evolutionary processes, and atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy offers the advantage of detecting subtle variations in stellar spectral profiles, thereby enabling the identification of the sources of observed signals. In this study, we present the transmission spectra of the exoplanet WASP-77Ab, a hot Jupiter with a 1.36-day orbital period around a G8 host star with $V=11.29$ mag. These observations were conducted using the high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope over three transit events. We analyze the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for WASP-77A and determine a projected spin-orbit angle of ${\lambda = 16.131^{\circ}}^{+2.106}_{-2.324}$, indicating that the planet's orbit is nearly aligned. Following the generation of transmission spectra for the three nights, we model and correct for center-to-limb variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effects. In the residual transmission spectra, we detect H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and CaII H with a significance exceeding 3.5$\sigma$. After applying 0.1-0.5 Å masks to the cores of these lines to mitigate stellar contamination, all them still shows visible absorptions although not significant, suggesting at least partial planet contribution to them. Therefore, we are yet unable to confirm or reject the planetary origin of these spectral signals based on the current data set. Further investigation of WASP-77Ab's atmosphere, particularly in areas beyond the terminator region, is essential to illuminate the planet's two-dimensional atmospheric structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time, to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant challenges for their identification and classification. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct observables in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and 0.9987, respectively. These findings lay the foundation for the development of an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the survey's potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling timely follow-up observations and further characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate $N$-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this this http URL, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchial triples.

We have fitted the 15-year average gamma-ray spectra of 755 FSRQs by using both a broken power-law (BPL) and the Logarithmic Parabolas (LP) models, and obtained 87 bright gamma-ray FSRQs with their integrated photon fluxes greater than $2.16\times 10^{-8}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. From our results, the FSRQ population shows similar preferences for both the BPL and LP models in gamma-ray spectral fitting and clustering analysis suggests that BPL-preferred and LP-preferred FSRQs belong to the same category. Our results indicate that GeV spectral breaks in bright gamma-ray FSRQs are located at $\rm 2.90\pm1.92$ GeV in the rest frame, and the observed change in photon index is $\rm \Delta \gamma =0.45 \pm 0.19$, which is consistent with the expected value for a cooling break of electrons scattering seed photons.

 - **Abstract**
 The rate coefficients of various isotopic variations of the H2+ + H2 and H3+ + H2 reactions in the 10-250 K temperature range were measured using a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. The processes involving diatomic ions were found to behave close to the Langevin rate, whereas temperature-dependent rate coefficients were obtained for the four isotopic exchange processes with triatomic ions. Fitting the experimental data using a chemical code allowed us in specific cases to constrain rate coefficients that were not directly measured in the ion trap. The reported rate coefficients suggest a more efficient hydrogenation of deuterated H3+ forms than usually assumed in astrochemical models, which might affect deuteration rates in warmer environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution observations at millimeter (mm) and sub-mm reveal a diverse spatial distribution for sub-pc scale dense cores within star-forming regions, ranging from clustered to aligned arrangements. To address the increasing volume of observational and simulation data, we introduce "alignment parameters" as a quantitative and reproducible method to automatically assess core alignment. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of these parameters by applying them to artificial test clumps and comparing the results with labels from visual inspection. A threshold value is then proposed to differentiate between "clustered" and "aligned" categories. Subsequently, we apply these parameters to dense cores identified from a sample of ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum images in high-mass star-forming regions. Analysis exploring correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties rules out the presence of moderate or strong correlation, indicating that clump properties do not appear to strongly influence the outcome of fragmentation. One possible explanation for this is that the fragmentation process is chaotic, meaning that small variations in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in fragmentation outcomes, thus obscuring any direct link between clump properties and core alignment/distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to compute the bispectrum covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $\nu=154.25$ MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with $\approx 10-15 \%$ accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles $46 \le \ell \le 1320$. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21-cm bispectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Making inferences about physical properties of the Universe requires knowledge of the data likelihood. A Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed for the uncertainties with a covariance matrix estimated from a set of simulations. The noise in such covariance estimates causes two problems: it distorts the width of the parameter contours, and it adds scatter to the location of those contours which is not captured by the widths themselves. For non-Gaussian likelihoods, an approximation may be derived via Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). It is often implicitly assumed that parameter constraints from SBI analyses, which do not use covariance matrices, are not affected by the same problems as parameter estimation with a covariance matrix estimated from simulations. We investigate whether SBI suffers from effects similar to those of covariance estimation in Gaussian likelihoods. We use Neural Posterior and Likelihood Estimation with continuous and masked autoregressive normalizing flows for density estimation. We fit our approximate posterior models to simulations drawn from a Gaussian linear model, so that the SBI result can be compared to the true posterior. We test linear and neural network based compression, demonstrating that neither methods circumvent the issues of covariance estimation. SBI suffers an inflation of posterior variance that is equal or greater than the analytical result in covariance estimation for Gaussian likelihoods for the same number of simulations. The assumption that SBI requires a smaller number of simulations than covariance estimation for a Gaussian likelihood analysis is inaccurate. The limitations of traditional likelihood analysis with simulation-based covariance remain for SBI with a finite simulation budget. Despite these issues, we show that SBI correctly draws the true posterior contour given enough simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep-learning-based methods have been favored in astrophysics owing to their adaptability and remarkable performance and have been applied to the task of the classification of real and bogus transients. Different from most existing approaches which necessitate massive yet expensive annotated data, We aim to leverage training samples with only 1000 labels available to discover real sources that vary in brightness over time in the early stage of the WFST 6-year survey. Methods. We present a novel deep-learning method that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning to construct a competitive real/bogus classifier. Our method incorporates an active learning stage, where we actively select the most informative or uncertain samples for annotation. This stage aims to achieve higher model performance by leveraging fewer labeled samples, thus reducing annotation costs and improving the overall learning process efficiency. Furthermore, our approach involves a semi-supervised learning stage that exploits the unlabeled data to enhance the model's performance and achieve superior results compared to using only the limited labeled data.

          The influence of the bar on the chaotic dynamics of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The paper is devoted to the analysis of the influence of the galactic bar on the nature of the orbital motion (chaotic or regular) of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are subject to the greatest influence of the bar. The sample includes 45 globular clusters. To form the 6D phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (Vasiliev, Baumgardt, 2021) were used, as well as new refined average distances (Baumgardt, Vasiliev, 2021). The orbits of the globular clusters were obtained both in an axisymmetric potential and in a potential including the bar. The following, most realistic, bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\odot$, semi-major axis length 5 kpc, bar axis rotation angle 25$^o$, angular rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. The analysis of the chaoticity/regularity of the orbital motion in both potentials was carried out using one of the most effective methods, namely, the frequency method, which consists in calculating the drift of fundamental frequencies. As a result, the influence of the bar on the dynamics of each GC of the sample was assessed. It is established that 8 GCs changed regular dynamics to chaotic under the influence of the bar, and 9 GCs changed chaotic dynamics to regular one.

 - **Abstract**
 The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\le$5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their proximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble ($D_{\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they are from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the supernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also exhibit a mild age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly younger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc. Considering their distribution in the age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ space is well separated from the older DYSOs, they may also be products of the Local Bubble but formed in more recent and localized events.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation of solitons inside scalar-field dark matter halos with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential. We consider a self-interaction potential that is quartic in the scalar field in the low-density regime but saturates at large densities. This mimics the behaviour of axion monodromy potentials. We concentrate on the semi-classical regime, where the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the size of the system. We find that depending on the strength and scale of the self-interactions, the system can form solitons of the Thomas-Fermi type (dominated by self-interactions) or of the Fuzzy Dark Matter type (dominated by the quantum pressure). The system can also display transitions from a Thomas-Fermi soliton to a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton as the former becomes unstable. We show that these behaviours can be understood from a simple Gaussian ansatz. We find that even in cases where the self-interactions are always subdominant they can play a critical role, by providing a small density boost that is enough to generate the seed for the formation of a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton at much later times. We also point out that the intuition derived from a hydrodynamical picture can be misleading in regimes where wave effects are important.

 - **Abstract**
 A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.

 Many questions posed in the Astro2020 Decadal survey in both the New Messengers and New Physics and the Cosmic Ecosystems science themes require a gamma-ray mission with capabilities exceeding those of existing (e.g. Fermi, Swift) and planned (e.g. COSI) observatories. ComPair, the Compton Pair telescope, is a prototype of such a next-generation gamma-ray mission. It had its inaugural balloon flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in August 2023. To continue the goals of the ComPair project to develop technologies that will enable a future gamma-ray mission, the next generation of ComPair (ComPair-2) will be upgraded to increase the sensitivity and low-energy transient capabilities of the instrument. These advancements are enabled by AstroPix, a silicon monolithic active pixel sensor, in the tracker and custom dual-gain silicon photomultipliers and front-end electronics in the calorimeter. This effort builds on design work for the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) concept that was submitted the 2021 MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity. Here we describe the ComPair-2 prototype design and integration and testing plans to advance the readiness level of these novel technologies.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of pebble accretion (PA) has become a popular planet formation theory during the past decade. However, PA studies generally rely on large planetary embryos, much larger than those expected from the streaming instability. This study analyses the formation of terrestrial planets around stars with masses ranging from 0.09 to 1.00 M$_\odot$ through PA, starting with small planetesimals with radii between 175 and 450 km. We perform numerical simulations, using a modified version of the N-body simulator SyMBA, which includes pebble accretion, type I and II migration, and eccentricity and inclination damping. Two prescriptions for the pebble accretion rate are analysed. We find that Earth-mass planets are consistently formed around 0.49, 0.70 and 1.00 M$_\odot$ stars, irrespective of the pebble accretion model. However, Earth-like planets seldom remain in the habitable zone, for they rapidly migrate to the inner edge of the disc. Furthermore, we find that pebble accretion onto small planetesimals cannot produce Earth-mass planets around 0.09 and 0.20 M$_\odot$, challenging the proposed narrative of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Further research is needed to determine if models with a lower pebble mass flux, or additional migration traps, could produce solar-system-like planetary systems in which Earth-like planets remain in the habitable zone.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) presents great promise for future cosmological large-scale structure surveys. However, a major challenge for HIIM cosmological studies is to accurately subtract the foreground contamination. An accurate beam model is crucial for improving foreground subtraction accuracy. In this work, we develop a stacking-based beam reconstruction method utilizing the radio continuum point sources within the drift-scan field. Based on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we employ two series of drift-scan survey data and merge the measurements to construct the beam patterns of the FAST L-band 19 feeds. To model the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively captures % the side lobes and asymmetric features of the side lobes. asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due to the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are closely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the distance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline leverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns exclude the reflector's changing effects, and provides a more accurate measurement beam and a more precise model beam for FAST HIIM cosmology surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data; 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. We compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 triples, revealing a range of $V$ from approximately 40~km~s$^{-1}$ to 210~km~s$^{-1}$. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below 90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2--20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.

 - **Abstract**
 A multi-wavelength, multi-scale study of the Mon R2 hub-filament system (HFS) reveals a spiral structure, with the central hub containing more mass than its filaments. ALMA C$^{18}$O(1-0) emission reveals several accreting filaments connected to a molecular ring (size $\sim$0.18 pc $\times$ 0.26 pc). The molecular ring surrounds the infrared (IR) ring (size $\sim$0.12 pc $\times$ 0.16 pc), which is not usually observed. The IR ring encircles IR dark regions and a population of embedded near-IR sources, including the massive stars IRS 1 and IRS 2. ALMA HNC(3-2) line data reveal a mirrored B-shaped feature (extent $\sim$19000 AU $\times$ 39000 AU) toward the eastern part of the molecular ring, suggesting expansion at $\sim$2.25 km s$^{-1}$. Distinct HNC sub-structures in both redshifted and blueshifted velocity components are investigated toward the B-shaped feature. The presence of these braid-like substructures in each velocity component strongly suggests instability in photon-dominated regions. A dusty shell-like feature (extent $\sim$0.04 pc $\times$ 0.07 pc; mass $\sim$7 M$_{\odot}$) hosting IRS 1 is identified in the ALMA 1.14 mm continuum map, centered toward the base of the B-shaped feature. The IR and dense molecular rings are likely shaped by feedback from massive stars, driven by high pressure values between 10$^{-8}$-10$^{-10}$ dynes cm$^{-2}$, observed within a 1 pc range of the B0 ZAMS star powering the ultracompact HII region. Overall, these outcomes support that the Mon R2 HFS transitioned from IR-quiet to IR-bright, driven by the interaction between gas accretion and feedback from massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 221009A is one of the brightest transients ever observed with the highest peak gamma-ray flux for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). A type Ic-BL supernova (SN), SN 2022xiw, was definitively detected in late-time JWST spectroscopy (t = 195 days, observer-frame). However, photometric studies have found SN 2022xiw to be less luminous (10-70%) than the canonical GRB-SN, SN 1998bw. We present late-time Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam imaging of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 221009A at t ~ 185, 277, and 345 days post-trigger. Our joint archival ground, HST, and JWST light curve fits show strong support for a break in the light curve decay slope at t = 50 +/- 10 days (observer-frame) and a supernova at $1.4^{+0.37}_{-0.40} \times$ the optical/NIR flux of SN 1998bw. This break is consistent with an interpretation as a jet break when requiring slow-cooling electrons in a wind medium with the electron energy spectral index, p > 2, and $\nu_m < \nu_c$. Our light curve and joint HST/JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) also show evidence for the late-time emergence of a bluer component in addition to the fading afterglow and supernova. We find consistency with the interpretations that this source is either a young, massive, low-metallicity star cluster or a scattered light echo of the afterglow with a SED shape of $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{2.0\pm1.0}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the habitable zone of two different types of stars - a 5000 K white dwarf and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 with a similar effective temperature - and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously-rotating white dwarf planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously-rotating planet orbiting Kepler-62, due to its much faster (10-hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultra-fast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent build-up of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting Kepler-62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their habitable zones, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We report forecasted constraints on warm inflation in the light of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys, with data expected to be available in the coming decade. These observations could finally give us the missing information necessary to unveil the production of gravitational waves during inflation, reflected by detecting a non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio crucial to the B-mode power spectrum of the CMB. We consider the impact of three future surveys, namely the CMB-S4, Simons Observatory, and the space-borne $\textit{LiteBIRD}$, in restricting the parameter space of four typical warm inflationary models in the context of a quartic potential, which is well motivated theoretically. We find that all three surveys significantly improve the models' parameter space, compared to recent results obtained with current $\textit{Planck}$+BICEP/Keck Array data. Moreover, the combination of ground-based and space-borne (CMB-S4+$\textit{LiteBIRD}$) tightens the constraints so that we expect to distinguish even better warm inflation scenarios. This result becomes clear when we compare the models' predictions with a $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ forecast, compatible with $r=0$, in which one of them already becomes excluded by data.
