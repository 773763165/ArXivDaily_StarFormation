 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will observe mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) out to high redshift. Such IMBHs can form through runaway tidal encounters in the cores of dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we ask if the gravitational wave observation of a single merger event between two IMBHs, occurring in the aftermath of the coalescence of the clusters in which they formed, can be used to infer the properties of their host clusters, such as mass, redshift, and half-mass radius. We implement an astrophysically motivated analytic model for cluster evolution and IMBH growth, and we perform IMBH binary parameter estimation using a network of three next-generation detectors. We find that inferring the structural properties of clusters in this way is challenging due to model degeneracy. However, the posteriors on the cluster formation redshifts have relatively narrow peaks, and it may still be possible to infer the cluster formation history by measuring a whole population of IMBH binary merger events.

 - **Abstract**
 We report follow-up observations of three poorly studied AM CVn-type binaries: CRTS CSS150211 J091017-200813, NSV1440, and SDSSJ183131.63+420220.2. Analysing time-series photometry obtained with a range of ground-based facilities as well as with TESS, we determine the superhump period of CRTSJ0910-2008 as P_sh=29.700+-0.004min and the orbital period of NSV1440 as Porb=36.56+-0.03min. We also confirm a photometric period of P=23.026+-0.097min in SDSSJ1831+4202, which is most likely the superhump period. We also report the first optical spectroscopy of CRTSJ0910-2008 and NSV1440 which unambiguously confirms both as AM CVn systems. We briefly discuss the distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the currently known sample of 63 AM CVn stars with known periods and Gaia data.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs with known physical properties (e.g., age and mass) are essential for constraining models of the formation and evolution of substellar objects. We present new high-contrast imaging observations of the circumbinary brown dwarf HII 1348B $\mathord{-}$ one of the few known substellar companions in the Pleiades cluster. We observed the system in the infrared (IR) $L^\prime$ band with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) in dual-aperture direct imaging mode (i.e., with the two telescope apertures used separately) on 2019 September 18. The observations attained a high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR} > 150$) photometric detection and relative astrometry with uncertainties of ${\sim}5 \ \mathrm{mas}$. This work presents the first model of the companion's orbital motion using relative astrometry from five epochs across a total baseline of 23 years. Orbital fits to the compiled data show the companion's semimajor axis to be $a = 140 \substack{+130 \\ -30} \ \mathrm{au}$ with an eccentricity of $e = 0.78 \substack{+0.12 \\ -0.29}$. We infer that HII 1348B has a mass of $60\mathord{-}63 \pm 2 \ \mathrm{M_J}$ from comparison to brown dwarf evolutionary models given the well-constrained distance and age of the Pleiades. No other objects were detected in the HII 1348 system, and through synthetic planet injection and retrievals we establish detection limits at a cluster age of $112 \pm 5$ Myr down to ${\sim}10\mathord{-}30 \ \mathrm{M_J}$ for companions with projected separations of $21.5\mathord{-}280 \ \text{au}$. With this work, HII 1348B becomes the second directly imaged substellar companion in the Pleiades with measured orbital motion after HD 23514B.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids, the nearly empty regions nestled between walls and filaments, are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. However, a consensus on the definition of voids remains elusive, as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density based on the method that were used. In this paper, we introduce an innovative void identification method that utilizes Genetic Algorithm analysis. VEGA employs the Voronoi tessellation technique and the Convex Hull algorithm to partition the dataset plane into distinct regions and calculate the volume of each region. For the first time, VEGA integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with the luminosity density contrast function to identify and locate the possible void region candidates. This method utilizes a set of grid points, which enhances the implementation of Voronoi tessellation and enables VEGA to more effectively access the dataset space for the identification of void regions candidates, finding the center and the ultimate structure of voids. Finally, we applied the VEGA and Aikio-Mähönen (AM) methods to the same test dataset and compared the cosmic voids identified by VEGA with those identified by the AM method. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void-finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the afterglow signatures in NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) detector modules as part of the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) mission detector trade-study. BTO is a NASA Student Collaboration Project flying on the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) Small Explorer mission in 2027. The detectors utilized in this study are cylindrical in shape with a height and diameter of 5.1 cm and were read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). We conducted a radiation campaign at the HIMAC accelerator in Japan where the scintillators were irradiated with a 230 MeV/u helium beam (He beam) and 350 MeV/u carbon beam (C beam). We find that both the CsI and NaI scintillators exhibit afterglow signatures when irradiated with the C and He beams. The CsI crystal exhibits a stronger afterglow intensity with afterglow pulses occurring for an average 2.40 ms for C and 0.9 ms for He after the initial particle pulse. The duration of afterglow pulses in CsI is 8.6x and 5.6x the afterglow signal duration in NaI for C and He (0.28 ms and 0.16 ms, respectively). Although CsI has advantages such as a higher light yield and radiation hardness, the stronger afterglows in the CsI detector increase the complexity of the electronics and lead to a ~7x larger dead time per afterglow event or a ~3x higher energy threshold value. We use the measured dead times to predict the amount of observing time lost to afterglow-inducing events for an instrument like BTO in low Earth orbit. We simulate the background rates in a BTO-like orbit and find a total value of 114 counts/s for the full two-detector system. Based on the particle energies in the HIMAC experiment, we then determine that an event with sufficient energy to produce an afterglow signal occurs once every ~70 s and ~1.4 s in NaI and CsI detectors, respectively. Thus, we conclude that NaI is the better choice for the BTO mission.

 - **Abstract**
 In the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a signal of astrophysical neutrinos is obscured by backgrounds from atmospheric neutrinos and muons produced in cosmic-ray interactions. IceCube event selections used to isolate the astrophysical neutrino signal often focus on t/he morphology of the light patterns recorded by the detector. The analyses presented here use the new IceCube Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection (ESTES), which identifies events likely generated by muon neutrino interactions within the detector geometry, focusing on neutrino energies of 1-500 TeV with a median angular resolution of 1.4°. Selecting for starting track events filters out not only the atmospheric-muon background, but also the atmospheric-neutrino background in the southern sky. This improves IceCube's muon neutrino sensitivity to southern-sky neutrino sources, especially for Galactic sources that are not expected to produce a substantial flux of neutrinos above 100 TeV. In this work, the ESTES sample was applied for the first time to searches for astrophysical sources of neutrinos, including a search for diffuse neutrino emission from the Galactic plane. No significant excesses were identified from any of the analyses; however, constraining limits are set on the hadronic emission from TeV gamma-ray Galactic plane objects and models of the diffuse Galactic plane neutrino flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the role of pressure in the structure, stability and confinement of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in light of recently published observations and analysis of the GMCs in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). That analysis showed, that in the absence of any external pressure, most GMCs (57\% by number) in M31 would be gravitationally unbound. Here, after a more detailed examination of the global measurements of surface densities and velocity dispersions, we find that GMCs in M31, when they can be traced to their outermost boundaries, require external pressures for confinement that are consistent with estimates for the mid-plane pressure of this galaxy. We introduce and apply a novel methodology to measure the radial profile of internal pressure within any GMC that is spatially resolved by the CO observations. We show that for the best resolved examples in M31 the internal pressures increase steeply with surface density in a power-law fashion with $p_{int} \sim \Sigma^2$. At high surface densities many of these extragalactic GMCs break from the single power-law and exhibit upward curvature. Both these characteristics of the variation of internal pressure with surface density are in agreement with theoretical expectations for hydrostatic equilibrium at each radial surface of a GMC, including the outermost boundary.

          JWST Reveals Varied Origins Between Jupiter's Irregular Satellites

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of eight Jovian irregular satellites with JWST's NIRSpec instrument: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Sinope, Lysithea, Carme, Ananke, and Themisto. Irregular satellite families, which are presumed to have formed via collisions, contain various Trojan-like and C-type-asteroid-like surfaces. We sample the three largest members of the Himalia satellite family, detecting the presence of complexed CO$_2$ and a unique absorption band from $\sim2.7-3.6\ \mu m$ whose character correlates with satellite size. The two largest irregular satellites, Himalia family members Himalia and Elara, contain ammoniated phyllosilicates that are not seen in the meteorite inventory. We propose that the Himalia parent body was heterogeneous and formed with materials similar to Ceres-like ammonium-bearing asteroids. Several small ($D\sim 10km$) irregular satellites closely track the colors and absorption bands of ``red'' Jovian Trojans, demonstrating that these compositions are retained amongst the products of collisions that occurred after Jovian capture. We report the first detection of aqueous alteration products in the retrograde satellite swarm, finding Ananke's 3 micron band to closely match phyllosilicates seen in C2 chondrites. Notably, objects with OH absorption features similar to the Trojan asteroid Eurybates are found in both the retrograde Pasiphae family and the prograde Himalia family, confounding a simple link between such materials and a single surface type. The irregular satellites appear consistent with some materials that experienced alteration from liquid water and others that did not. Consequently, Jupiter may have captured bodies that formed from different initial compositions, or bodies that experienced different levels of heating, driving differential alteration processes.

          Cosmic Bulk Flow Analysis in Modified Gravity Theories: $f(R)$ and Perturbed $f(R)$ Models with Neutrino Coupling

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the characteristics of bulk flow across various redshift ranges within the frameworks of $f(R)$ gravity, perturbed $f(R)$ gravity, and perturbed $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos. Our investigation reveals profound insights into large-scale cosmic flows and their interactions with major cosmic structures, such as the Sloan Great Wall (SGW) and the King Ghidorah Supercluster (KGSc). We find that incorporating neutrinos into the perturbed $f(R)$ gravity model results in a substantial increase in bulk flow velocities across all redshifts, with notable enhancements in the higher redshift ranges, where velocities can exceed $3000 \, \mathrm{km/s}$ in the $0.8 < z < 1.4$ range. Moreover, the direction of the bulk flow in this model closely aligns with the dark energy dipole, especially at redshifts $z > 0.4$, showing near-perfect congruence with cosmic superclusters. This suggests a significant interaction between neutrinos and cosmic structures, influencing cosmic acceleration. At lower redshifts, such as $0.1 < z < 0.2$, the bulk flow aligns with the SGW, while in the $0.4 < z < 0.6$ range, it aligns with the KGSc. In the low redshift range $0.001 < z < 0.016$, although velocities are lower, neutrinos still subtly increase the bulk flow velocity and maintain alignment with nearby cosmic structures, like the Local Supercluster. Our results underscore the critical role of neutrinos in shaping cosmic flows and offer new insights into the interplay between dark energy, neutrinos, and modified gravity models.

          Gaia-ESO Survey: massive stars in the Carina Nebula. II. The spectroscopic analysis of the O-star population

 - **Abstract**
 The new census of massive stars in the Carina nebula reveals the presence of 54 apparently single O-type stars in the Car OB1 association, an extremely active star-forming region which hosts some of the most luminous stars of the Milky Way. A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the currently most complete sample of O-type stars in the association can be used to inspect the main physical properties of cluster members and test evolutionary and stellar atmospheres models. We perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis for the most complete sample of apparently single O-type stars in Car OB1 with available spectroscopic data. From the high-resolution GES and OWN spectra we obtain a reliable distribution of rotational velocities for a sample of 37 O-type stars. It shows a bimodal structure with a low velocity peak at 60 km s$^{-1}$ and a short tail of fast rotators reaching 320 km s$^{-1}$. We also perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis and derive effective temperature, surface gravity and He abundance for a sample of 47 O-type stars, now including further stars from GOSSS database. Radii, luminosities, and spectroscopic masses were also determined using $Gaia$ astrometry. We create the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to inspect the evolutionary status of the region and confirm the lack of stars close to the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) between $\sim$35 -- 55 M$_\odot$. We confirm a very young population with an age distribution peaking at 1 Myr, some stars close or even on the ZAMS, and a secondary peak at 4 -- 5 Myr in the age distribution. We confirm the youth of Trumpler 14, which is also the only cluster not showing the secondary peak. We also find a clear trend to evolutionary masses higher than derived spectroscopic masses for stars with evolutionary mass below 40 M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern time-domain astronomical surveys produce high throughput data streams which require tools for processing and analysis. This will be critical for programs making full use of the alert stream from the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO), where spectroscopic labels will only be available for a small subset of all transients. In this context, the AMPEL toolset can work as a code-to-data platform for the development of efficient, reproducible and flexible workflows for real-time astronomical application. We here introduce three different AMPEL channels constructed to highlight different uses of alert streams: to rapidly find infant transients (SNGuess), to provide unbiased transient samples for follow-up (FollowMe) and to deliver final transient classifications (FinalBet). These pipelines already contain placeholders for mechanisms which will be essential for the optimal usage of VRO alerts: combining different classifiers, including host galaxy information, population priors and sampling non-gaussian photometric redshift distributions. Based on the ELAsTiCC simulation, all three channels are already working at a high level: SNGuess correctly tags 99% of all young supernovae, FollowMe illustrates how an unbiased subset of alerts can be selected for spectroscopic follow-up in the context of cosmological probes and FinalBet includes priors to achieve successful classifications for >~80% of all extragalactic transients. The fully functional workflows presented here are all public and can be used as starting points for any group wishing to optimize pipelines for their specific VRO science programs. AMPEL is designed to allow this to be done in accordance with FAIR principles: both software and results can be easily shared and results reproduced. The code-to-data environment ensures that models developed this way can be directly applied to the real-time LSST stream parsed by AMPEL.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs bridge the gap between stars and planets, providing valuable insight into both planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Yet the census of transiting brown dwarf companions, in particular around M dwarf stars, remains incomplete. We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs around low-mass hosts using a combination of space- and ground-based photometry along with near-infrared radial velocities. We characterize TOI-5389Ab ($68.0^{+2.2}_{-2.2} \ \mj$) and TOI-5610b ($40.4^{+1.0}_{-1.0} \ \mj$), two moderately massive brown dwarfs orbiting early M dwarf hosts ($\teff = 3569 \pm 59 \ K$ and $3618 \pm 59 \ K$, respectively). For TOI-5389Ab, the best fitting parameters are period $P=10.40046 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.824^{+0.033}_{-0.031}$~\rj, and low eccentricity $e=0.0962^{+0.0027}_{-0.0046}$. In particular, this constitutes one of the most extreme substellar-stellar companion-to-host mass ratios of $q=0.150$. For TOI-5610b, the best fitting parameters are period $P=7.95346 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.887^{+0.031}_{-0.031}$ \rj, and moderate eccentricity $e=0.354^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$. Both targets are expected to have shallow but potentially observable secondary transits: $\lesssim 500$ ppm in Johnson K band for both. A statistical analysis of M-dwarf/BD systems reveals for the first time that those at short orbital periods ($P < 13$ days) exhibit a dearth of $13 \mj < M_{\rm BD} < 40 \mj$ companions ($q$ $<$ 0.1) compared to those at slightly wider separations.

 - **Abstract**
 The concentration of dark matter haloes is closely linked to their mass accretion history. We utilize the halo mass accretion histories from large cosmological N-body simulations as inputs for our neural networks, which we train to predict the concentration of individual haloes at a given redshift. The trained model performs effectively in other cosmological simulations, achieving the root mean square error between the actual and predicted concentrations that significantly lower than that of the model by Zhao et al. and Giocoli et al. at any redshift. This model serves as a valuable tool for rapidly predicting halo concentrations at specified redshifts in large cosmological simulations.

          ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of massive Star-forming regions -XX. Probability distribution function of integrated intensity for dense molecular gas tracers

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observations of J=1-0 of HCN, HCO+, H13CO+, and H13CN, HC3N (J=11-10) emission towards 135 massive star-forming clumps, as part of the ATOMS (ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions) Survey. We present the integrated intensity probability distribution function for these molecular tracers, modeled as a combination of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. The molecular line luminosities for the power-law tail segment, Lmol(p), have been calculated. We have investigated the correlation between the bolometric luminosity, Lbol, and the power-law part of the molecular line luminosity, Lmol(p). Our findings suggest that the scaling relationships between Lbol and Lmol(p) for HCN and HCO+ are sublinear, indicating that these molecules might not be the most effective tracers for the dense gas. In contrast, H13CN and HC3N exhibit a nearly linear relationship between Lbol and Lmol(p), indicating that they can well trace gravitationally bound dense gas. The ratios of Lbol-to-Lmol(p), serving as indicators of star formation efficiency within massive star-forming clumps, exhibit a weak anti-correlation with the power-law index in the I-PDF. In addition, the star formation efficiency is also weakly anti-correlated with the exponent U of the corresponding equivalent density distribution. Our results implie that clumps with substantial gas accumulation may still display low star formation efficiencies.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamo theory has always been one of the biggest mysteries in stellar physics. One key reason for its uncertainty is poor knowledge of the dynamo process on stars except the Sun. The most important observation feature of solar dynamo is that active regions only appear at low latitudes, which provides a crucial constraint to the dynamo theory, while Doppler imaging, the current technique to spatially resolve stellar hemisphere, is difficult to distinguish the equatorial region . Hence, the latitudinal distribution of active regions (LDAR) of stars is ambiguous and controversial, mainly due to the limit of the current technique for spatially resolving the stellar surface. Fast rotating stars, which are young and active, are thought to operate with a different dynamo process than the Sun. We study their LDAR and compare them with the Sun to reveal the underlying dynamo process. Flares are drastic and observational activity events, which occur in active regions. Here, we propose a new method to study how the apparent flaring activity varies with respect to the inclination to determine the LDAR of fast rotating this http URL find that the LDAR of fast rotating stars is consistent with that of the Sun, contrary to expectations. Our results provide a crucial constraint to stellar dynamo, indicating that the solar-like dynamo also applies to fast rotating stars, even spanning different stages of their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The probability distribution, $p(\mathrm{DM})$ of cosmic dispersion measures (DM) measured in fast radio bursts (FRBs) encodes information about both cosmology and galaxy feedback. In this work, we study the effect of feedback parameters in the $p(\mathrm{DM})$ calculated from the full Latin Hypercube of parameters sampled by the CAMELS hydrodynamical simulation suite, building a neural network (NN) model that performs well in emulating the effect of feedback on $p(\mathrm{DM})$ at arbitrary redshifts at $z\leq1$. Using this NN model, we further study the parameter $F\equiv \sigma_{\rm DM} \, z^{1/2}$, which is commonly used to summarize the scatter on $p(\mathrm{DM})$. We find that $F$ does not depend monotonically on every feedback parameter; instead each feedback mechanism jointly influences the final feedback strength in non-trivial ways. Even the largest values of $F$ that we find in our entire parameter space are small compared to the current constraints from observed FRB DMs by Baptista et al. 2024, pointing at the limitations of the CAMELS suite due to the small simulation box sizes. In the future, with larger box-sizes from CAMELS-like suites, similar models can be used to constrain the parameters governing galaxy feedback in the increasing observational samples of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for radio occultation measurements (RO) among small satellites, which are expected to be useful for future Venus missions. The effectiveness of the observations based on realistic orbit calculations was evaluated by reproduction of the "cold collar", a unique thermal structure in the polar atmosphere of Venus. Pseudo-temperature observations for the OSSEs were provided from the Venus atmospheric GCM in which the cold collar was reproduced by the thermal forcing. The vertical temperature distributions between 40 and 90 km altitudes at observation points were assimilated. The result showed that the cold collar was most clearly reproduced in the case where the temperature field in high-latitudes was observed twice a day, suggesting that the proposed observation is quite effective to improve the polar atmospheric structure at least. Although the cold collar was also reproduced in the OSSEs for Longwave Infrared Camera (LIR) observations, the result seemed unrealistic and inefficient compared to that obtained in the RO OSSEs. The present study shows that the OSSEs can be used to evaluate observation plans and instruments in terms of reproducibility of specific atmospheric phenomena, and applied to future missions targeting planetary atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present results from our spectroscopic follow-up of SDSS J2320+0024, a candidate binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a suspected sub-pc separation, identified by a 278-day periodicity observed in its multi-band optical light curves. We investigate the dramatic variability of the complex Mg II emission line profile aiming to test the alignments of the observed photometric light curves and the spectroscopic signatures in the context of the binary SMBH system. We extract the pure broad Mg II line from the newly obtained Gemini and Magellan spectra and measure the emission line parameters to reveal fundamental dynamical parameters of the SMBHs binary system. We adopt the PoSKI sub-pc binary SMBH model, which includes broad-line region (BLR) around less massive component and a circumbinary BLR, to interpret the observed variability in the spectral profile. We find that the Mg II line profile has a distinctive complex shape with the asymmetry and two peaks present which is varying across recent and archival observations. The temporal variability of the Mg II line profile may be associated with the emission from the binary SMBH system consisting of components with masses $M_1 = 2 \times 10^7 \, M_{\odot}$ and $M_2 = 2 \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, and eccentricity e = 0.1. With an total estimated mass of $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a subannual orbital period, this system may be a rare example of high-mass compact candidate of SMBH binary, thus important for further investigations of the evolution of the binary system. This study is a prototype of synergies of spectroscopic follow-up and future massive time-domain photometric surveys like Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 We reanalyze the Chandra/HETGS observations of NGC 3783 from the campaign in the year 2001, identifying significant spectral variations in the Fe unresolved transition array (UTA) over timescales of weeks to months. These changes correlate with a $1.4-2$ fold increase in the ionizing continuum and exceed $10 \, \sigma$ significance. The variations primarily originate from a low-ionization state ($\rm log \xi = 1.65$) component of the warm absorber. Time-dependent photoionization modelling confirms the sensitivity of this low-ionization component to continuum variations within the Fe UTA band. Local fitting indicates a lower density limit of $>10^{12.3} \, \rm m^{-3}$ at $3 \, \sigma$ statistical uncertainty, with the component located within $0.27 \, \rm pc$. Our findings suggest that this low-ionization component is a potential failed wind candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Sterile neutrinos with masses on the $\mathrm{eV}$ scale are promising candidates to account for the origin of neutrino mass and the reactor neutrino anomalies. The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos in the early universe could result in a large abundance of relic sterile neutrinos, which depends on not only their physical mass $m_{\rm eff}$ but also their degree of thermalization, characterized by the extra effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm off}$. Using neutrino-involved N-body simulations, we investigate the effects of sterile neutrinos on the matter power spectrum, halo pairwise velocity, and halo mass and velocity functions. We find that the presence of sterile neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum and halo mass and velocity functions, but enhance the halo pairwise velocity. We also provide fitting formulae to quantify these effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) G206.7+5.9 was recently discovered in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The remnant spans about 3.5 in diameter and exhibits bilateral shells. In this work, we present optical spectra of G206.7+5.9 with the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and narrow-band (H$\alpha$ and [SII]) images with the 1-m T100 telescope. The filamentary structure seen in H$\alpha$ image shows a clear correlation with the radio emission. We use optical line ratios to determine the physical parameters of G206.7+5.9. The LAMOST spectra reveal large ratios of [SII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.61-1.78) and [NII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.63-1.92) consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The emission lines [OI] $\lambda$6300, $\lambda$6363 detected in the spectra also support the presence of shocks. Electron density ($n_{\rm e}$) measurements based on the [SII] $\lambda$6716/$\lambda$6731 ratio suggest densities between 117 and 597 cm$^{-3}$. We estimate the pre-shock cloud density ($n_{\rm c}$) to be approximately 2.6$-$13.3 cm$^{-3}$. We also investigate the archival HI data and have newly identified an expanding gas motion of the HI, whose velocity span is approximately 10 km s$^{-1}$. We conclude that G206.7+5.9 is an SNR exhibiting properties remarkably similar to those seen in Galactic SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a peculiar set of old super-metal-rich dwarf stars with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic plane between $\sim$ 0.5-1.5 kpc observed by the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. These stars show lithium (Li) depletion, which is anti-correlated with their [Fe/H]. To investigate these stars' chemo-dynamical properties, we used data from the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. We applied hierarchical clustering to group the stars based on their abundances (excluding Li). Orbits were integrated using \emph{Gaia} astrometry and radial velocities from \emph{Gaia}-ESO. Our analysis suggests that the high metallicity of these stars is incompatible with their formation in the solar neighbourhood. We also found that their Li envelope abundance is below the benchmark meteoritic value, in agreement with previous works. This result supports the idea that the Li abundance in old, super-metal-rich dwarf stars should not be considered a proxy for the local interstellar medium Li.

 - **Abstract**
 This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets, successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into their potential and limitations. This work sets the stage for future investigations to fully realize the advantages of QCNNs in astrophysical data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 More than half of all stars are part of binaries, and many form in a common circumbinary disc. The interaction with the binary shapes the disc to feature a large eccentric inner cavity and spirals in the inner disc. The shape of the cavities is linked to binary and disc properties like viscosity and scale height, and the disc and cavity shape influences the orbital evolution of the binary stars. This is the second part of the study in which we use 2D hydrodynamic long-term simulations for a range of viscous parameters relevant to protoplanetary discs to understand the interaction between young stars and the circumbinary disc. The long-term simulations allow us to study how disc shape and exchange of mass, momentum and energy between binary and disc depend on the precession angle between disc and binary orbit on time scales of thousands of binary orbits. We find a considerable, periodic interaction between the precession of the disc and the binary eccentricity that can significantly exceed the precession-averaged change in eccentricity. We further confirm that thin discs ($H/R<0.05$) lead to shrinking binary orbits, also in the regime of low viscosity, $\alpha=10^{-3}$. In general, the disc can excite eccentricity in binaries with initial eccentricities in the range of $e_\mathrm{bin}=0.05-0.4$. In most cases, the terms aiding shrinking or expansion and circularisation or excitation are nearly balanced, and the evolution of the binary semi-major axis and eccentricity will be sensitive to the ratio of mass accretion between the secondary and primary components.

 Eclipses and pulsations are the two primary ways in which the physical properties of stars can be deduced and used to improve our understanding of stellar theory. An obvious idea is to combine these two analyses into the study of pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries. This is the aim of the SWIPE project. This paper summarises the scientific arguments, current status and future plans of the project.

 We present the discovery of twelve metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates in the dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)~968 kpc away, at a present-day metallicity of [Fe/H] around $-$0.9. These candidates have masses between 1.25-5 M$_{\odot}$, with ages <10 Myr, and exhibit significant near-infrared excesses at 2.5 and 4.3 $\mu$m. They are concentrated within a cluster roughly 10 pc (2'') across situated in the HII region [HM95]-9. These are the most distant and metal-poor PMS stars known, and can offer new quantitative insights into star formation at low-metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 A group of newly observed extreme trans-Neptunian objects exhibit unexpected orbital confinement, characterized by the alignment of orbital angular momentum vectors and apsidal lines. It is proposed that an undiscovered giant planet, named Planet-9, exists in the solar system's outer regions and causes this clustering. Initial studies suggested Planet-9 could have a mass of 15 Earth masses. However, such a massive planet strongly interacts with scattered disk objects (SDOs; 50 < a < 1000 au) and influences the orbits of short-period comets, resulting in orbital inclinations inconsistent with observations. This study models the formation and long-term evolution of trans-Neptunian object populations and the Oort cloud during the solar system's dynamical instability, using revised parameters for Planet-9. Simulations assume Planet-9 has a mass of 7.5 Earth masses, an inclination of ~20 degrees, a semi-major axis of ~600 au, and an eccentricity of ~0.3. Results suggest a less massive Planet-9 aligns with observed trans-Neptunian object inclinations and the number of ecliptic comets (D > 10 km). Distant Kuiper belt objects with 40 < q < 100 au and 200 < a < 500 au, particularly with significant inclinations, are more likely to align apsidally with Planet-9, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 0.5-0.7. Lower inclination objects (<20 degrees) exhibit significant apsidal anti-alignment, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 2-4. These findings offer a new observational direction to refine the search for Planet-9.

 We present the first contemporaneous NICER and NuSTAR analysis of the low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 obtained in June 2023, performing broadband X-ray spectral analysis modeling of the reprocessed emission with RELXILLNS from $0.4-30$ keV. We test various continuum and background estimation models to ensure that our results do not hinge on the choice of model used and found that the detection of reflection features is independent of the choice of both continuum and background model. The position of the inner accretion disk is consistent with the last stable circular orbit ($R_{\rm in} \leq 1.2$~$R_{ISCO}$) and a low inclination of $i\leq 8.3 ^{\circ}$. Additionally, we investigate the presence of the low energy ($\sim$ 1 keV) Fe L complex in the data from NICER and the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on XMM-Newton that was previously reported in the literature. We find that the line is at most a 2% feature relative to the reprocessed continuum and are unable to claim a definitive detection for the current dataset. However, we discuss plausible conditions and systems that would increase the likelihood of detecting this feature in the future.

          A new approximation for heavy-lepton neutrino pair processes in simulations of core-collapse supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a new approximation for efficiently and effectively including heavy-lepton neutrino pair-production processes in neutrino transport simulations of core-collapse supernovae. In the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism, the electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the main players in transporting the energy of the cooling PNS to the matter behind the shock. While heavy-lepton neutrinos, $\nu_x$, play a smaller role in the heating of the gain region, they dominate the cooling of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and therefore still play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. In this study, we explore the impacts of modifications in the transport and formalisms of pair ($\nu_x\bar{\nu}_x$) emission and absorption processes. We quantify the impact in terms of the emergent neutrino signal and the nature of the PNS convection and early cooling. For this, we perform a set of simulations, spherically symmetric and axisymmetric, of a 20 M$_\odot$ progenitor using two different state-of-the-art equations of state (EOS). First and foremost, we show that our new efficient approximation for neutrino pair production matches the results of a full treatment very well. Furthermore, for this progenitor, we show that the impact of the modifications is dependent on the EOS used, as the EOS drives the PNS evolution. The variations we explore, including variations due to the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung formalism, have a comparatively smaller impact than the EOS has as a whole.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-earth asteroid (NEA) 1998 KY$_{26}$ is a target of the $Hayabusa2\#$ spacecraft, which it will rendezvous with in July 2031. The asteroid has been noted to rotate rapidly and has a large out-of-plane nongravitational acceleration. We present observations consisting of deep g and R band imaging obtained with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and visible spectroscopy from Gemini North /Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (Gemini N/GMOS) taken of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on 2024 June 8-9 when the asteroid was $\sim$0.037 au from the Earth. The asteroid lacks the appearance of a dust coma and has a surface brightness profile similar to nearby background stars in the deep images. The spectrum of 1998 KY$_{26}$ from the combined LRIS/GMOS observations most closely resembles Xe-types possessing a spectral slope of 6.71$\pm$0.43 $\%$ 100 nm$^{-1}$, and color indices: g-r = 0.63$\pm$0.03, r-i = 0.15$\pm$0.03, i-z = 0.05$\pm$0.04. From our deep image stacks, we compute a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the dust production of 1998 KY$_{26}$ of $<$10$^{-5}$ kg s$^{-1}$, $<$10$^{-2}$ kg s$^{-1}$, and $<$10$^{-1}$ kg s$^{-1}$ assuming $\mathrm{\mu}$m, mm, and cm size dust particles. In addition, we compare the orbit of 1998 KY$_{26}$ and other known asteroids with large nongravitational parameters with NEA population models, finding the majority, including 1998 KY$_{26}$, likely originated from the inner Main Belt, while the second most numerous group originates from the outer Main Belt, followed by a third group possibly originating from the Jupiter Family Comet population. Given its inner Main Belt origin, its Xe-type, and rapid rotation, we hypothesize that the nongravitational acceleration of 1998 KY$_{26}$ may be caused by the shedding of large dust grains from its surface due to its rotation rather than H$_2$O vapor outgassing.

          Nonlinear fitting of undersampled discrete datasets in astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 Data analysis and interpretation often relies on an approximation of an empirical dataset by some analytic functions or models. Actual implementations usually rely on a non-linear multi-dimensional optimization algorithm, typically Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) or other flavors of Newtonian gradient methods. A vast majority of datasets in optical and infrared astronomy are represented by values on a discrete grid because the actual signal is sampled by regularly shaped pixels in the light detectors. Here we come to the main problem of nearly all widely used implementations of nonlinear optimization methods: the function that is being fitted is evaluated at central pixel positions rather than integrated over the pixel areas. Therefore, the best-fitting set of parameters returned by the minimization routine might not be the best representation of the observed dataset, especially if a dataset is undersampled. For example, a central pixel of a 1D Gaussian with a dispersion of 1 pix (2.36 pix FWHM; so not too strongly undersampled) will be about 4.2% lower than its central evaluated value if integrated. To handle this effect properly, one needs to perform numerical or analytic integration of a model within the pixel boundaries. We will discuss possible computationally efficient solutions and test our preliminary implementation of a nonlinear fitting using LM minimization that correctly accounts for the discrete nature of the data.
