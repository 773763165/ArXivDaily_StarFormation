#### Maximal Mass Neutron Star as a Key to Superdense Matter Physics

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a universal approximation of the equation of state of superdense matter in neutron star (NS) interiors. It contains only two parameters, the pressure and the density at the center of the maximally massive neutron star. We demonstrate the validity of this approximation for a wide range of different types of equations of state, including both baryonic and hybrid models. Combined with recently discovered correlations of internal (density, pressure, and speed of sound at the center) and external (mass, radius) properties of a maximally massive neutron star, this approximation turns out to be an effective tool for determining the equation of state of superdense matter using astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate position and posture measurements of the freely-falling test mass are crucial for the success of spaceborne gravitational wave detection missions. This paper presents a novel laboratory-developed test mass motion readout that utilizes quadrant photodetectors to measure the translation and tilt of a test mass. Departing from conventional methods like Zeeman effect or AOM frequency shift modulation, the readout system employs the phase locking of two lasers to generate the dual-frequency heterodyne source. Notably, the out-of-loop sensitivity of the phase locking reaches below 30 pm/Hz1/2 within the frequency band of 1 mHz and 10 Hz. The system comprises three measurement interferometers and one reference interferometer, featuring a symmetric design that enables measurements of up to six degrees of freedom based on polarization-multiplexing and differential wavefront sensing. Ground-simulated experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has achieved a measurement sensitivity of 4 pm/Hz1/2 and 2 nrad/Hz1/2 at 1 Hz, a resolution of 5 nm and 0.1 urad, a range of 200 um and 600 urad, respectively. These findings showcase the system's potential as an alternative method for precisely monitoring the motion of test masses in spaceborne gravitational wave detection missions and other applications requiring accurate positioning and multi-degrees-of-freedom sensing.

 - **Abstract**
 The project CAESAR (Comprehensive spAce wEather Studies for the ASPIS prototype Realization) is aimed to tackle all the relevant aspects of Space Weather (SWE) and realize the prototype of the scientific data centre for Space Weather of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) called ASPIS (ASI SPace Weather InfraStructure). This contribution is meant to bring attention upon the first steps in the development of the CAESAR prototype for ASPIS and will focus on the activities of the Node 2000 of CAESAR, the set of Work Packages dedicated to the technical design and implementation of the CAESAR ASPIS archive prototype. The product specifications of the intended resources that will form the archive, functional and system requirements gathered as first steps to seed the design of the prototype infrastructure, and evaluation of existing frameworks, tools and standards, will be presented as well as the status of the project in its initial stage.
#### Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS):  HD 34700 A unveils an inner ring

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The study of protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understand their evolution and interaction with the surrounding environment, and to constrain planet formation mechanisms. Aims. We aim at characterising the young binary system HD 34700 A, which shows a wealth of structures. Methods. Taking advantage of the high-contrast imaging instruments SPHERE at the VLT, LMIRCam at the LBT, and of ALMA observations, we analyse this system at multiple wavelengths. We study the rings and spiral arms morphology and the scattering properties of the dust. We discuss the possible causes of all the observed features. Results. We detect for the first time, in the H${\alpha}$ band, a ring extending from $\sim$65 au to ${\sim}$120 au, inside the ring already known from recent studies. These two have different physical and geometrical properties. Based on the scattering properties, the outer ring may consist of grains of typical size $a_{out} > 4 {\mu}m$, while the inner ring of smaller grains ($a_{in} <= 0.4 {\mu m}$). Two extended logarithmic spiral arms stem from opposite sides of the disk. The outer ring appears as a spiral arm itself, with a variable radial distance from the centre and extended substructures. ALMA data confirm the presence of a millimetric dust substructure centred just outside the outer ring, and detect misaligned gas rotation patterns for HD 34700 A and B. Conclusions. The complexity of HD 34700 A, revealed by the variety of observed features, suggests the existence of one or more disk-shaping physical mechanisms. Possible scenarios, compatible with our findings, involve the presence inside the disk of a yet undetected planet of several Jupiter masses and the system interaction with the surroundings by means of gas cloudlet capture or flybys. Further observations with JWST/MIRI or ALMA (gas kinematics) could shed more light on these.
#### Gravitational wave triggered searches for high-energy neutrinos from  binary neutron star mergers: prospects for next generation detectors

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors - Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), will have distance horizons up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Gpc for detecting binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This will make them ideal for triggering high-energy neutrino searches from BNS mergers at the next generation neutrino detectors, such as IceCube-Gen2. We calculate the distance limits as a function of the time window of neutrino analysis, up to which meaningful triggers from the GW detectors can be used to minimize backgrounds and collect a good sample of high-energy neutrino events at the neutrino detectors, using the sky localization capabilities of the GW detectors. We then discuss the prospects of the next generation detectors to work in synergy to facilitate coincident neutrino detections or to constrain the parameter space in the case of non-detection of neutrinos. We show that good localization of GW events, which can be achieved by multiple third generation GW detectors, is necessary to detect a GW-associated neutrino event or put a meaningful constraint ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level) on neutrino emission models. Such a model independent analysis can also help constrain physical models and hence provide insights into neutrino production mechanisms in binary neutron star mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 34 normal SNe II detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, with multi-band UV light-curves starting at $t \leq 4$ days after explosion, as well as X-ray detections and upper limits. We characterize the early UV-optical colors and provide prescriptions for empirical host-extinction corrections. We show that the $t > 2\,$days UV-optical colors and the blackbody evolution of the sample are consistent with the predictions of spherical phase shock-cooling (SC), independently of the presence of `flash ionization" features. We present a framework for fitting SC models which can reproduce the parameters of a set of multi-group simulations without a significant bias up to 20% in radius and velocity. Observations of about half of the SNe II in the sample are well-fit by models with breakout radii $<10^{14}\,$cm. The other half are typically more luminous, with observations from day 1 onward that are better fit by a model with a large $>10^{14}\,$cm breakout radius. However, these fits predict an early rise during the first day that is too slow. We suggest these large-breakout events are explosions of stars with an inflated envelope or a confined CSM with a steep density profile, at which breakout occurs. Using the X-ray data, we derive constraints on the extended ($\sim10^{15}$ cm) CSM density independent of spectral modeling, and find most SNe II progenitors lose $<10^{-4} M_{\odot}\, \rm yr^{-1}$ a few years before explosion. This provides independent evidence the CSM around many SNe II progenitors is confined. We show that the overall observed breakout radius distribution is skewed to higher radii due to a luminosity bias. We argue that the $66^{+11}_{-22}\%$ of red supergiants (RSG) explode as SNe II with breakout radii consistent with the observed distribution of field RSG, with a tail extending to large radii, likely due to the presence of CSM.

 - **Abstract**
 Short-period giant planets are frequently found to be solitary compared to other classes of exoplanets. Small inner companions to giant planets with $P \lesssim$ 15 days are known only in five compact systems: WASP-47, Kepler-730, WASP-132, TOI-1130, and TOI-2000. Here, we report the confirmation of TOI-5398, the youngest compact multi-planet system composed of a hot sub-Neptune (TOI-5398 c, $P_{\rm c}$ = 4.77271 days) orbiting interior to a short-period Saturn (TOI-5398 b, $P_{\rm b}$ = 10.590547 days) planet, both transiting around a 650 $\pm$ 150 Myr G-type star. As part of the GAPS Young Object project, we confirmed and characterised this compact system, measuring the radius and mass of both planets, thus constraining their bulk composition. Using multidimensional Gaussian processes, we simultaneously modelled stellar activity and planetary signals from TESS Sector 48 light curve and our HARPS-N radial velocity time series. We have confirmed the planetary nature of both planets, TOI-5398 b and TOI-5398 c, alongside a precise estimation of stellar parameters. Through the use of astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic observations, our findings indicate that TOI-5398 is a young, active G dwarf star (650 $\pm$ 150 Myr), with a rotational period of $P_{\rm rot}$ = 7.34 days. The transit photometry and radial velocity measurements enabled us to measure both the radius and mass of planets b, $R_b = 10.30\pm0.40 R_{\oplus}$, $M_b = 58.7\pm5.7 M_{\oplus}$, and c, $R_c = 3.52 \pm 0.19 R_{\oplus}$, $M_c = 11.8\pm4.8 M_{\oplus}$. TESS observed TOI-5398 during sector 48 and no further observations are planned in the current Extended Mission, making our ground-based light curves crucial for ephemeris improvement. With a Transmission Spectroscopy Metric value of around 300, TOI-5398 b is the most amenable warm giant (10 < $P$ < 100 days) for JWST atmospheric characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy, provides unique opportunities to study black hole accretion, jet formation, and gravitational physics. The rapid structural changes in Sgr A*'s emission pose a significant challenge for traditional imaging techniques. We present dynamic reconstructions of Sgr A* using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data from April 6th and 7th, 2017, analyzed with a one-minute temporal resolution with the Resolve framework. This Bayesian approach employs adaptive Gaussian Processes and Variational Inference for data-driven self-regularization. Our results not only fully confirm the initial findings by the EHT Collaboration for a time-averaged source but also reveal intricate details about the temporal dynamics within the black hole environment. We find an intriguing dynamic feature on April 6th that propagates in a clock-wise direction. Geometric modelling with ray-tracing, although not fully conclusive, indicates compatibility with high-inclination configurations of about $\theta_o = 160^\circ$, as seen in other studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia (TESS) is expected to resolve ~700-1500 (~100-400) detached BH-LC binaries depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. We find that ~369 BH-LC binaries would be common both in Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~80-270 (~70-290) of these BH-LC binaries can be further characterised using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry) measurements.
#### A massive multiphase plume of gas in Abell 2390's brightest cluster  galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present new ALMA CO(2-1) observations tracing $2.2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in Abell 2390's brightest cluster galaxy, where half the gas is located in a one-sided plume extending 15 kpc out from the galaxy centre. This molecular gas has a smooth and positive velocity gradient, and is receding 250 km/s faster at its farthest point than at the galaxy centre. To constrain the plume's origin, we analyse our new observations alongside existing X-ray, optical and radio data. We consider the possibility that the plume is jet-driven with lifting aided by jet inflated X-ray bubbles. Alternatively, it may have formed following a gravitational disturbance. In this case, the plume may either be a trail of gas stripped from the main galaxy by ram pressure, or more recently cooled and infalling gas. The galaxy's star formation and gas cooling rate suggest the lifespan of its molecular gas may be low compared with the plume's age -- which would favour a recently cooled plume. Molecular gas in close proximity to the active galactic nucleus is also indicated by 250 km/s wide CO(2-1) absorption against the radio core, as well as previously detected CO(1-0) and HI absorption. This absorption is optically thick and has a line of sight velocity towards the galaxy centre of 200 km/s. We discuss simple models to explain its origin.

 - **Abstract**
 $\phi$CDM models provide an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, while being physically better motivated. These models lead to a time-dependent speed of sound for dark energy that is difficult to replicate by $w$CDM parametrizations. We review the most up-to-date status of observational evidence for the $\phi$CDM models in this paper. We start with an overview of the motivation behind these classes of models, the basic mathematical formalism, and the different classes of models. We then present a compilation of recent results of applying different observational probes to constraining $\phi$CDM model parameters. Over the last twenty years, the precision of observational data has increased immensely, leading to ever tighter constraints. A combination of the recent measurements favors the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but a large class of $\phi$CDM models is still not ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Three principal concepts regarding lunar formation have been examined: the accretion hypothesis, the mega-impact theory, and the multi-impact model. The multi-impact model amalgamates the salient facets of the mega-impact theory and the accretion hypothesis. As per this model, fragments of the terrestrial crust are ejected into space during collisions with numerous planetesimals (proto-asteroids) with diameters around 10-100 kilometers. This ejecta interacts with the accretion disk, augmenting its mass. Different models of lunar formation yield varied conclusions regarding the quantity of lunar water, its subsurface distribution, and isotopic composition. Geomorphological structures in the lunar polar regions (smoothed craters, landslides, regular patterns) suggest the presence of a substantial permafrost layer with an approximate thickness of a kilometer.

 - **Abstract**
 The temporal analysis of stellar activity evolution is usually dominated by a complex trade-off between model complexity and interpretability, often by neglecting the non-stationary nature of the process. Recent studies appear to indicate that the presence of multiple coexisting cycles in a single star is more common than previously thought. The correct identification of physically meaningful cyclic components in spectroscopic time series is therefore a crucial task, which cannot overlook local behaviors. Here we propose a decomposition technique which adaptively recovers amplitude- and frequency-varying components. We present our results for the solar activity as measured both by the sunspot number and the $K$-line emission index, and we consistently recover the Schwabe and Gleissberg cycles as well as the Gnevyshev-Ohl pattern probably related to the Hale cycle. We also recover the known 8-year cycle for 61 Cygni A, in addition to evidence of a three-cycles long pattern reminiscent of the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule. This is particularly interesting as we cannot discard the possibility of a relationship between the measured field polarity reversals and this Hale-like periodicity.
#### SPLUS J142445.34-254247.1: An R-Process Enhanced, Actinide-Boost,  Extremely Metal-Poor star observed with GHOST

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the chemo-dynamical analysis of SPLUS J142445.34-254247.1, an extremely metal-poor halo star enhanced in elements formed by the rapid neutron-capture process. This star was first selected as a metal-poor candidate from its narrow-band S-PLUS photometry and followed up spectroscopically in medium-resolution with Gemini South/GMOS, which confirmed its low-metallicity status. High-resolution spectroscopy was gathered with GHOST at Gemini South, allowing for the determination of chemical abundances for 36 elements, from carbon to thorium. At [Fe/H]=-3.39, SPLUS J1424-2542 is one of the lowest metallicity stars with measured Th and has the highest logeps(Th/Eu) observed to date, making it part of the "actinide-boost" category of r-process enhanced stars. The analysis presented here suggests that the gas cloud from which SPLUS J1424-2542 was formed must have been enriched by at least two progenitor populations. The light-element (Z<=30) abundance pattern is consistent with the yields from a supernova explosion of metal-free stars with 11.3-13.4 Msun, and the heavy-element (Z>=38) abundance pattern can be reproduced by the yields from a neutron star merger (1.66Msun and 1.27Msun) event. A kinematical analysis also reveals that SPLUS J1424-2542 is a low-mass, old halo star with a likely in-situ origin, not associated with any known early merger events in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 AU Mic is an active 24 Myr pre-main sequence M dwarf in the stellar neighborhood (d$=$9.7 pc) with a rotation period of 4.86 days. The two transiting planets orbiting AU Mic, AU Mic b and c, are warm sub-Neptunes on 8.5 and 18.9 day periods and are targets of interest for atmospheric observations of young planets. Here we study AU Mic's unocculted starspots using ground-based photometry and spectra in order to complement current and future transmission spectroscopy of its planets. We gathered multi-color LCO 0.4m SBIG photometry to study the star's rotational modulations and LCO NRES high-resolution spectra to measure the different spectral components within the integrated spectrum of the star, parameterized by 3 spectral components and their coverage fractions. We find AU Mic's surface has at least 2 spectral components, a $4000\pm15$ K ambient photosphere with cool spots that have a temperature of $3000\pm70$ K and cover $39\pm4\%$ percent of the surface, increasing and decreasing by 5$\%$ from the average throughout a rotation. We also detect a third flux component with a filling factor less than 0.5$\%$ and a largely uncertain temperature that we attribute to flare flux not entirely omitted in the time-averaged spectra. We include measurements of spot temperature and coverage fraction from both 2- and 3- temperature models, which we find agree with each other strongly. Our expanded use of various techniques to study starspots will help us better understand this system and may have applications for interpreting the transmission spectra for exoplanets transiting stars of a wide range of activity levels.
#### Introducing the Condor Array Telescope: IV. A possible nova  super-remnant surrounding the putative recurrent nova KT Eridani

 - **Abstract**
 Just 10 recurrent novae (RNe) - which erupt repeatedly on timescales shorter than one century - are known in our Galaxy. The most extreme RN known (located in the Andromeda galaxy), M31N 2008-12a, undergoes a nova eruption every year, and is surrounded by a vast nova "super-remnant", 134 pc in extent. Simulations predict that all RNe should be surrounded by similar vast shells, but previous searches have failed to detect them. KT Eri has recently been suggested to be a RN, and we have used the Condor Array Telescope to image its environs through multiple narrowband filters. We report the existence of a large ($\sim$ 50 pc diameter), H$\,\alpha$-bright shell centered on KT Eri, exactly as predicted. This strongly supports the claim that KT Eri is the 11th Galactic recurrent nova, and only the second nova known to be surrounded by a super-remnant. SALT spectra of the super-remnant demonstrate that its velocity width is consistent with that of M31-2008-12a.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs that have accreted planetary materials provide a powerful tool to probe the interiors and formation of exoplanets. In particular, the high Fe/Si ratio of some white dwarf pollutants suggests that they are fragments of bodies that were heated enough to undergo large-scale melting and iron core formation. In the solar system, this phenomenon is associated with bodies that formed early and so had short-lived radionuclides to power their melting, and/or grew large. However, if the planetary bodies accreted by white dwarfs formed during the (pre)-main sequence lifetime of the host star, they will have potentially been exposed to a second era of heating during the star's giant branches. This work aims to quantify the effect of stellar irradiation during the giant branches on planetary bodies by coupling stellar evolution to thermal and orbital evolution of planetesimals. We find that large-scale melting, sufficient to form an iron core, can be induced by stellar irradiation, but only in close-in small bodies: planetesimals with radii $\lesssim$ 30 km originally within $\sim$ 2 AU orbiting a 1$-$3$\,M_{\odot}$ host star with solar metallicity. Most of the observed white dwarf pollutants are too massive to be explained by the accretion of these small planetesimals that are melted during the giant branches. Therefore, we conclude that those white dwarfs that have accreted large masses of materials with enhanced or reduced Fe/Si remain an indicator of planetesimal's differentiation shortly after formation, potentially linked to radiogenic heating.

 - **Abstract**
 For decades, supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered the prime sources of Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs). But whether SNRs can accelerate CR protons to PeV energies and thus dominate CR flux up to the knee is currently under intensive theoretical and phenomenological debate. The direct test of the ability of SNRs to operate as CR PeVatrons can be provided by ultrahigh-energy (UHE; $E_\gamma \geq 100$~TeV) $\gamma$-rays. In this context, the historical SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is considered one of the most promising target for UHE observations. This paper presents the observation of Cas A and its vicinity by the LHAASO KM2A detector. The exceptional sensitivity of LHAASO KM2A in the UHE band, combined with the young age of Cas A, enabled us to derive stringent model-independent limits on the energy budget of UHE protons and nuclei accelerated by Cas A at any epoch after the explosion. The results challenge the prevailing paradigm that Cas A-type SNRs are major suppliers of PeV CRs in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Fullerenes, including \ce{C60} and \ce{C70}, have been detected in various astronomical environments. Understanding how their structures evolve over time is essential for gaining insights into their life cycle and making further observations. To address this, we conducted reactive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the evolution of fullerenes in the circumstellar envelopes surrounding carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations employed a bottom-up chemistry scheme, wherein fullerenes grow by absorbing and condensing small carbon-based molecules. The results revealed the formation of different structures through heterogeneous reactions based on hydrogen concentration, leading to the emergence of onion-like nanostructures or single-layer fullerenes. To examine the impact of these structural changes on the infrared emission characteristics of fullerenes, we performed quantum chemical calculations. The results indicate that as fullerenes grow larger, additional emission features are introduced in the infrared spectrum. Moreover, two-layered fullerenes show noticeable blue-shift or weakening effects on the bands associated with out-of-plane vibration modes.
#### Reconstructing the early-universe expansion and thermal history

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model-independent reconstruction of the early expansion and thermal histories of the universe, obtained from light element abundance measurements. The expansion history is tightly constrained around the onset of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The temperature of photons is additionally constrained around the time of neutrino decoupling. Allowing for perturbations to the standard expansion rate, we find that the radiation energy density is constrained to within 15% of its $\Lambda$CDM value, and only 1% extra matter energy density is allowed around the epoch of BBN. We introduce a new and general analytic fitting formula for the temperature variation, which is flexible enough to reproduce the signal of large classes of beyond-CDM particle models that can alter the temperature through early-time energy injection. We present its constraints from BBN data and from the measurements of effective number of relativistic species and helium-4 abundance probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy. Our results provide clarity on the most fundamental properties of the early universe, reconstructed with minimal assumptions about the unknown physics that can occur at keV--MeV energy scales and can be mapped to broad classes of models of interest to cosmology.
#### Cold molecules in HI 21-cm absorbers across redshifts 0.1-4

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption lines at high redshift in front of quasars are rare in the mm domain. Only five associated and five intervening systems are known. These bring very useful information complementary to emission lines, for instance, to distinguish between inflows and outflows. They are also good candidates to study the variations of the fundamental constants. We report here the search for molecules in emission and absorption in front of a sample of 30 targets, comprising 16 associated and 14 intervening HI 21-cm absorbers. The observations have been done with the IRAM-30m telescope, simultaneously at 3mm and 2mm, exploring CO ladder and HCO+ lines. Eight targets have been detected in emission, of which five are new. Their molecular gas masses range from 10^9 to 7 10^11 Mo. We also report four new detections in absorption. Two of the associated CO absorption line detections at high redshift (z=1.211 and 1.275) resulted from the high spatial resolution follow-up with NOEMA. The disparity between the mm molecular and HI 21-cm absorption lines for these and another intervening system detected in HNC at z = 1.275, is attributable to radio and mm sight lines tracing different media. Comparing HI and H2 in the 14 known high redshift molecular absorbers, associated HI absorption lines are broad, with multiple components and the molecular absorption corresponds to the broader and weaker 21-cm absorption component. This indicates two distinct phases: one near galaxy centers with a larger CO-to-HI abundance ratio, and another with lower molecular abundance in the outer regions of the galaxy. The comparison of interferometric and single dish observations shows that the detection of absorption requires sufficient spatial resolution to overcome the dilution by emission, and will be an important criterion for mm follow-up of 21-cm absorbers from ongoing large-scale surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Many hot Jupiters may experience orbital decays, which are manifested as long-term transit timing variations. We have analyzed 7068 transits from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for a sample of 326 hot Jupiters. These new mid-transit time data allow us to update ephemerides for these systems. By combining the new TESS transit timing data with archival data, we search for possible long-term orbital period variations in these hot Jupiters using a linear and a quadratic ephemeris model. We identified 26 candidates that exhibit possible long-term orbital period variations, including 18 candidates with decreasing orbital periods and 8 candidates with increasing orbital periods. Among them, 12 candidates have failed in our leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) test and thus should be considered as marginal candidates. In addition to tidal interaction, alternative mechanisms such as apsidal precession, R{\o}mer effect, and Applegate effect could also contribute to the observed period variations. The ephemerides derived in this work are useful for scheduling follow-up observations for these hot Jupiters in the future. The Python code used to generate the ephemerides is made available online.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) offer insights into extreme gravitational environments and the testing of general relativity. The X-ray spectrum collected by NICER offers valuable information on the properties and behaviour of BHBs through spectral fitting. However, traditional spectral fitting methods are slow and scale poorly with model complexity. This paper presents a new semi-supervised autoencoder neural network for parameter prediction and spectral reconstruction of BHBs, showing an improvement of up to a factor of 2,700 in speed while maintaining comparable accuracy. The approach maps the spectral features from the numerous outbursts catalogued by NICER and generalises them to new systems for efficient and accurate spectral fitting. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in the spectral fitting of BHBs and holds promise for use in other areas of astronomy and physics for categorising large datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 A nova super-remnant (NSR) is an immense structure associated with a nova that forms when frequent and recurrent nova eruptions sweep up surrounding interstellar material (ISM) into a high density and distant shell. The prototypical NSR, measuring over 100 pc across, was discovered in 2014 around the annually erupting nova M31N 2008-12a. Hydrodynamical simulations demonstrated that the creation of a dynamic NSR by repeated eruptions transporting large quantities of ISM is not only feasible but that these structures should exist around all novae, whether the white dwarf (WD) is increasing or decreasing in mass. But it is only the recurrent nova (RNe) with the highest WD masses and accretion rates that should host observable NSRs. KT Eridani is, potentially, the eleventh RNe recorded in the Galaxy and is also surrounded by a recently unveiled H{\alpha} shell tens of parsecs across, consistent with a NSR. Through modelling the nova ejecta from KT Eri, we demonstrate that such an observable NSR could form in approximately 50,000 years, which fits with the proper motion history of the nova. We compute the expected H{\alpha} emission from the KT Eri NSR and predict that the structure might be accessible to wide-field X-ray facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Discovering transiting exoplanets with long orbital periods allows us to study warm and cool planetary systems with temperatures similar to the planets in our own Solar system. The TESS mission has photometrically surveyed the entire Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere in Cycle 1 (August 2018 - July 2019), Cycle 3 (July 2020 - June 2021) and Cycle 5 (September 2022 - September 2023). We use the observations from Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 to search for exoplanet systems that show a single transit event in each year - which we call duotransits. The periods of these planet candidates are typically in excess of 20 days, with the lower limit determined by the duration of individual TESS observations. We find 85 duotransit candidates, which span a range of host star brightnesses between 8 < $T_{mag}$ < 14, transit depths between 0.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent, and transit durations between 2 and 10 hours with the upper limit determined by our normalisation function. Of these candidates, 25 are already known, and 60 are new. We present these candidates along with the status of photometric and spectroscopic follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 Among highly irradiated exoplanets, some have been found to undergo significant hydrodynamic expansion traced by atmospheric escape. To better understand these processes in the context of planetary evolution, we propose NIGHT (the Near-Infrared Gatherer of Helium Transits). NIGHT is a high-resolution spectrograph dedicated to surveying and temporally monitoring He I triplet absorption at 1083nm in stellar and planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we outline our scientific objectives, requirements, and cost-efficient design. Our simulations, based on previous detections and modelling using the current exoplanet population, determine our requirements and survey targets. With a spectral resolution of 70,000 on a 2-meter telescope, NIGHT can accurately resolve the helium triplet and detect 1% peak absorption in 118 known exoplanets in a single transit. Additionally, it can search for three-sigma temporal variations of 0.4% in 66 exoplanets in-between two transits. These are conservative estimates considering the ongoing detections of transiting planets amenable to atmospheric characterisation. We find that instrumental stability at 40m/s, less stringent than for radial velocity monitoring, is sufficient for transmission spectroscopy in He I. As such, NIGHT can utilize mostly off-the-shelf components, ensuring cost-efficiency. A fibre-fed system allows for flexibility as a visitor instrument on a variety of telescopes, making it ideal for follow-up observations after JWST or ground-based detections. Over a few years of surveying, NIGHT could offer detailed insights into the mechanisms shaping the hot Neptune desert and close-in planet population by significantly expanding the statistical sample of planets with known evaporating atmospheres. First light is expected in 2024.

 - **Abstract**
 The Auger Collaboration has recently published the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 1 EeV, which exhibits interesting features. These spectrum features provide an opportunity to investigate the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). In this study, we have developed a model that incorporates the dip model for UHECRs in the extragalactic propagation, while accounting for the suppression due to diffusion and interactions within the galaxy. Our model demonstrates excellent agreement with the energy spectrum measured by Auger and supports a spectral index of 2 for the diffusion coefficient in the galaxy starting from $5\times10^{18}$eV.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the impact of satellite glints -- rapid flashes produced by reflections of a sunlight from flat surfaces of rotating satellites -- on current and future deep sky surveys such as the ones conducted by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In addition to producing a large number of streaks polluting the images, artificial satellites and space debris also generate great amount of false point-source alerts hindering the search for new rapid astrophysical transients. To investigate the extent of this problem, we perform an analysis of isolated single frame events detected by ZTF in more than three years of its operation, and, using three different methods, assess the fraction of them related to artificial satellites to be at least 20\%. The satellites causing them occupy all kinds of orbits around the Earth, and the duration of flashes produced by their rotation is from a fraction of a second down to milliseconds, with mean all-sky rate of up to 80,000 per hour.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the optical counterpart, along with the gravitational waves from GW170817, of the first binary neutron star merger, opened up a new era for multi-messenger astrophysics. Combining the GW data with the optical counterpart, also known as AT2017gfo, classified as a kilonova, has revealed the nature of compact binary merging systems by extracting enriched information about the total binary mass, the mass ratio, the system geometry, and the equation of state. Even though the detection of kilonova brought about a revolution in the domain of multi-messenger astronomy, since there has been only one kilonova from a gravitational wave detected binary neutron star merger event so far, this limits the exact understanding of the origin and propagation of the kilonova. Here, we use a conditional variational autoencoder trained on light curve data from two kilonova models having different temporal lengths, and consequently, generate kilonova light curves rapidly based on physical parameters of our choice with good accuracy. Once trained, the time scale for light curve generation is of the order of a few milliseconds, thus speeding up generating light curves by $1000$ times compared to the simulation. The mean squared error between the generated and original light curves is typically $0.015$ with a maximum of $0.08$ for each set of considered physical parameter; while having a maximum of $\approx0.6$ error across the whole parameter space. Hence, implementing this technique provides fast and reliably accurate results.

 We present a multi-frequency, multi-epoch catalog of extragalactic sources. The catalog is based on 150, 220 and 280 GHz observations carried out in 2008, 2009 and 2010 using the Millimeter Bolometric Array Camera on the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We also present and release 280 GHz maps from 2008 and 2010. The catalog contains 695 sources, found in a sky area of ${\sim}600$ square degrees. It is obtained by cross-matching sources found in 11 sub-catalogs, one for each season and frequency band. Also include are co-added data from ${\sim}150$ and ${\sim}160$ square degrees using 2 and 3 years of overlapping observations. We divide the sources into two populations, synchrotron and dusty emitters, based on their spectral behavior in the 150-220 GHz frequency range. We find 374 synchrotron sources and 321 dusty source candidates. Cross-matching with catalogs from radio to X-ray results in 264 synchrotron sources (71%) and 89 dusty sources (28%) with counterparts, suggesting that 232 dusty candidates are not in existing catalogs. We study the variability and number counts of each population. In the case of synchrotron sources, we find year-to-year variability up to 60%, with a mean value around 35%. As expected, we find no evidence of dusty source variability. Our number counts generally agree with previous measurements and models, except for dusty sources at 280 GHz where some models overestimate our results. We also characterize the spectral energy distribution of a dusty star-forming galaxy, ACT-S J065207-551605, using our data and higher frequency observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) provides near-ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry for ~250 million unique stars. By combining BDBS photometry with the latest Gaia astrometry, we characterize the chemo-dynamics of red clump stars across the BDBS footprint, using an unprecedented sample size and sky coverage. We construct a sample of ~2.3 million red clump giants in the bulge with photometric metallicities, BDBS photometric distances, and proper motions. We study the kinematics of the red clump stars as a function of sky position and metallicity, by investigating proper motion rotation curves, velocity dispersions, and proper motion correlations across the southern Galactic bulge. We find that metal-poor red clump stars exhibit lower rotation amplitudes, at ~29 km s$^{-1}$ kpc^{-1}. The peak of the angular velocity is ~39 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1} for [Fe/H] ~ -0.2 dex, exhibiting declining rotation at higher [Fe/H]. The velocity dispersion is higher for metal-poor stars, while metal-rich stars show a steeper gradient with Galactic latitude, with a maximum dispersion at low latitudes along the bulge minor axis. Only metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] >~ -0.5 dex) show clear signatures of the bar in their kinematics, while the metal-poor population exhibits isotropic motions with an axisymmetric pattern around Galactic longitude l = 0. This work reports the largest sample of bulge stars with distance, metallicity, and astrometry and shows clear kinematic differences with metallicity. The global kinematics over the bulge agrees with earlier studies. However, we see striking changes with increasing metallicity and for the first time, see kinematic differences for stars with [Fe/H]>-0.5, suggesting that the bar itself may have kinematics that depends on metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 Beyond-two-point statistics contain additional information on cosmological as well as astrophysical and observational (systematics) parameters. In this methodology paper we provide an end-to-end simulation-based analysis of a set of Gaussian and non-Gaussian weak lensing statistics using detailed mock catalogues of the Dark Energy Survey. We implement: 1) second and third moments; 2) wavelet phase harmonics (WPH); 3) the scattering transform (ST). Our analysis is fully based on simulations, it spans a space of seven $\nu w$CDM cosmological parameters, and it forward models the most relevant sources of systematics of the data (masks, noise variations, clustering of the sources, intrinsic alignments, and shear and redshift calibration). We implement a neural network compression of the summary statistics, and we estimate the parameter posteriors using a likelihood-free-inference approach. We validate the pipeline extensively, and we find that WPH exhibits the strongest performance when combined with second moments, followed by ST. and then by third moments. The combination of all the different statistics further enhances constraints with respect to second moments, up to 25 per cent, 15 per cent, and 90 per cent for $S_8$, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and the Figure-Of-Merit ${\rm FoM_{S_8,\Omega_{\rm m}}}$, respectively. We further find that non-Gaussian statistics improve constraints on $w$ and on the amplitude of intrinsic alignment with respect to second moments constraints. The methodological advances presented here are suitable for application to Stage IV surveys from Euclid, Rubin-LSST, and Roman with additional validation on mock catalogues for each survey. In a companion paper we present an application to DES Year 3 data.

 - **Abstract**
 We outline some of the highlights of the scientific case for the advancement of stellar high energy physics using the Line Emission Mapper X-ray Probe ({\it LEM}). The key to advancements with LEM lie in its large effective area -- up to 100 times that of the {\it Chandra} MEG -- and 1~eV spectral resolution. The large effective area opens up for the first time the ability to study time-dependent phenomena on their natural timescales at high resolution, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, and also opens the sky to much fainter targets than available to {\it Chandra} or {\it XMM-Newton}.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of two interstellar objects passing through the Solar System, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, implies that a galactic population exists with a spatial number density of order $\sim0.1$ au$^{-3}$. The forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) has been predicted to detect more asteroidal interstellar objects like 1I/`Oumuamua. We apply recently developed methods to simulate a suite of galactic populations of interstellar objects with a range of assumed kinematics, albedos and size-frequency distributions (SFD). We incorporate these populations into the objectsInField (OIF) algorithm, which simulates detections of moving objects by an arbitrary survey. We find that the LSST should detect between $\sim 0-70$ asteroidal interstellar objects every year (assuming the implied number density), with sensitive dependence on the SFD slope and characteristic albedo of the host population. The apparent rate of motion on the sky -- along with the associated trailing loss -- appears to be the largest barrier to detecting interstellar objects. Specifically, a relatively large number of synthetic objects would be detectable by the LSST if not for their rapid sky-motion ($>0.5^\circ$ d$^{-1}$). Therefore, algorithms that could successfully link and detect rapidly moving objects would significantly increase the number of interstellar object discoveries with the LSST (and in general). The mean diameter of detectable, inactive interstellar objects ranges from $\sim50 - 600$ m and depends sensitively on the SFD slope and albedo.
#### Simulation-based Inference of Reionization Parameters from 3D  Tomographic 21 cm Light-cone Images -- II: Application of Solid Harmonic  Wavelet Scattering Transform

 - **Abstract**
 The information regarding how the intergalactic medium is reionized by astrophysical sources is contained in the tomographic three-dimensional 21 cm images from the epoch of reionization. In Zhao et al. (2022a) ("Paper I"), we demonstrated for the first time that density estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) can be applied efficiently to perform a Bayesian inference of the reionization parameters from the 21 cm images. Nevertheless, the 3D image data needs to be compressed into informative summaries as the input of DELFI by, e.g., a trained 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) as in Paper I (DELFI-3D CNN). Here in this paper, we introduce an alternative data compressor, the solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform (WST), which has a similar, yet fixed (i.e. no training), architecture to CNN, but we show that this approach (i.e. solid harmonic WST with DELFI) outperforms earlier analyses based on 3D 21 cm images using DELFI-3D CNN in terms of credible regions of parameters. Realistic effects, including thermal noise and residual foreground after removal, are also applied to the mock observations from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We show that under the same inference strategy using DELFI, the 21 cm image analysis with solid harmonic WST outperforms the 21 cm power spectrum analysis. This research serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential to harness the strengths of WST and simulation-based inference to derive insights from future 21 cm light-cone image data.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that damped superimposed oscillations at large scales in the primordial power spectrum can be generated in both single field and two field models. In single field inflationary models, these features typically arise due to deviations from the slow roll regime. On the other hand, in two field models, these features are generated due to a turn in the background trajectory in the field space. In this work, we demonstrate that both single field and two field models can produce identical features at large scales in the primordial power spectrum. To achieve this, we utilize the generalized slow roll approximation and successfully reconstruct single field models based on the featured power spectrum typically generated in two field models. To validate our methodology, we numerically calculate the power spectrum from the reconstructed potential and find a remarkable agreement with the power spectrum which is obtained from the two field model.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy is now allowing for the study of compact binary merger demographics throughout the Universe. This information can be leveraged as tools for understanding massive stars, their environments, and their evolution. One active question is the nature of compact binary formation: the environmental and chemical conditions required for black hole birth and the time delays experienced by binaries before they merge. Gravitational-wave events detected today, however, primarily occur at low or moderate redshifts due to current interferometer sensitivity, therefore limiting our ability to probe the high redshift behavior of these quantities. In this work, we circumvent this limitation by using an additional source of information: observational limits on the gravitational-wave background from unresolved binaries in the distant Universe. Using current gravitational-wave data from the first three observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, we combine catalogs of directly detected binaries and limits on the stochastic background to constrain the time-delay distribution and metallicity dependence of binary black hole evolution. Looking to the future, we also explore how these constraints will be improved at the Advanced LIGO A+ sensitivity. We conclude that, although binary black hole formation cannot be strongly constrained with today's data, the future detection (or a non-detection) of the gravitational-wave background with Advanced LIGO A+ will carry strong implications for the evolution of binary black holes.
