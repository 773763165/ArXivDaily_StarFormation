 - **Abstract**
 4U 1210-64 is a peculiar X-ray binary that was first discovered in 1978 by the Uhuru satellite. The analysis of the X-ray data revealed a 6.7-day orbital period and an additional long-term modulation that is manifested as low and high flux states. Based on the previous classification of the donor star from the analysis of its optical spectra, the system has been suggested to be a high-mass X-ray binary. We re-visit the optical classification where, based on the spectra from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), we conclude that the donor star is of spectral class A8 III-IV, making it a member of the rare intermediate-mass X-ray binaries. We perform radial velocity analysis using the SALT spectra where we consider circular and eccentric orbits. From the mass function derived and the mass constraints of the donor star, we demonstrate that a neutron star is favoured as the compact object in the binary system. We show, for the first time, the folded optical lightcurves, whose shape is interpreted to be due to a combination of ellipsoidal variations, irradiation of the donor star, and mutual eclipses of the star and accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a model independent, robust method for determining galaxy rotation velocities across a 2D array of spaxels from an integral field spectrograph. Simulations demonstrate the method is accurate down to lower spectral signal-to-noise than standard methods: 99\% accurate when median $S/N=4$. We apply it to MaNGA data to construct the galaxy velocity map and galaxy rotation curve. We also develop a highly efficient cubic smoothing approach that is $25\times$ faster computationally and only slightly less accurate. Such model independent methods could be useful in studying dark matter properties without assuming a galaxy model.
#### Neutrino trapping and out-of-equilibrium effects in binary neutron star  merger remnants

 - **Abstract**
 We study out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium effects in neutron star mergers with 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation large-eddy simulations. During merger, the cores of the neutron stars remain cold ($T \sim$ a few MeV) and out of thermodynamic equilibrium with trapped neutrinos originating from the hot collisional interface between the stars. However, within ${\sim}2{-}3$ milliseconds matter and neutrinos reach equilibrium everywhere in the remnant. Our results show that dissipative effects, such as bulk viscosity, if present, are only active for a short window of time after the merger.

 - **Abstract**
 A key event in the history of the Milky Way is the formation of the bar. This event affects the subsequent structural and dynamical evolution of the entire Galaxy. When the bar formed, gas was likely rapidly funnelled to the centre of the Galaxy settling in a star-forming nuclear disc. The Milky Way bar formation can then be dated by considering the oldest stars in the formed nuclear stellar disc. In this highly obscured and crowded region, reliable age tracers are limited, but bright, high-amplitude Mira variables make useful age indicators as they follow a period--age relation. We fit dynamical models to the proper motions of a sample of Mira variables in the Milky Way's nuclear stellar disc region. Weak evidence for inside-out growth and both radial and vertical dynamical heating with time of the nuclear stellar disc is presented suggesting the nuclear stellar disc is dynamically well-mixed. Furthermore, for Mira variables around a $\sim350$ day period, there is a clear transition from nuclear stellar disc-dominated kinematics to background bar-bulge-dominated kinematics. Using a Mira variable period-age relation calibrated in the solar neighbourhood, this suggests the nuclear stellar disc formed in a significant burst in star formation $(8\pm 1)\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ ago, although the data are also weakly consistent with a more gradual formation of the nuclear stellar disc at even earlier epochs. This implies a relatively early formation time for the Milky Way bar ($\gtrsim8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$), which has implications for the growth and state of the young Milky Way and its subsequent history.
#### Wavelet Based Statistics for Enhanced 21cm EoR Parameter Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new approach to improve the precision of astrophysical parameter constraints for the 21cm signal from Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Our method introduces new sets of summary statistics, hereafter evolution compressed statistics, that quantify the spectral evolution of the 2D spatial statistics computed a fixed redshift. We defined such compressed statistics for Power Spectrum (PS), as well as Reduced Wavelet Scattering Transform (RWST) and Wavelet Moments (WM), which also characterise non-Gaussian features. To compare these different statistics with fiducial 3D power spectrum, we estimate their Fisher information on three cosmological parameters from an ensemble of simulations of 21cm EoR data, both in noiseless and noisy scenarios using Square Kilometre Array (SKA) noise levels equivalent to 100 and 1000 hours of observations. For the noiseless case, the compressed wavelet statistics give constraints up to five times higher precision than the 3D isotropic power spectrum, while for 100h SKA noise, for which non-Gaussian features are hard to extract, they still give constraints which are 30% better. From this study, we demonstrate that evolution-compressed statistics extract more information than usual 3D isotropic approaches and that our wavelet-based statistics can consistently outmatch power spectrum-based statistics. When constructing such wavelet-based statistics, we also emphasise the need to choose a set of wavelets with an appropriate spectral resolution concerning the astrophysical process studied.
#### Chemical evolution models: the role of type Ia supernovae in the  $α$-elements over Iron relative abundances and their variations in time  and space

 - **Abstract**
 The role of type Ia supernovae, mainly the Delay Time Distributions (DTDs) determined by the binary systems, and the yields of elements created by different explosion mechanisms, are studied by using the {\sc MulChem} chemical evolution model, applied to our Galaxy. We explored 15 DTDs, and 12 tables of elemental yields produced by different SN Ia explosion mechanisms, doing a total of 180 models. Chemical abundances for $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca) and Fe derived from these models, are compared with recent observational data of $\alpha$-elements over Iron relative abundances, [X/Fe]. These data have been compiled and binned in 13 datasets. By using a $\chi^2$-technique, no model is able to fit simultaneously these datasets. A model computed with the 13 individual best models is good enough to reproduce them. Thus, a power law with a logarithmic slope $\sim -1.1$ and a delay in the range $\Delta \tau=40 --350$ Myr is a possible DTD, but a combination of several channels is more probable. Results of this average model for other disc regions show a high dispersion, as observed, which might be explained by the stellar migration. The dispersion might also come from a combination of DTDs or of explosion channels. The stellar migration joined to a combination of scenarios for SNIa is the probable cause of the observed dispersion.
#### SuperCAM CO(3-2) APEX survey at 6 pc resolution in the Small Magellanic  Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We present the CO(3-2) APEX survey at 6 pc resolution of the bar of the SMC. We aboard the CO analysis in the SMC-Bar comparing the CO(3-2) survey with that of the CO(2-1) of similar resolution. We study the CO(3-2)-to-CO(2-1) ratio (R32) that is very sensitive to the environment properties (e.g., star-forming regions). We analyzed the correlation of this ratio with observational quantities that trace the star formation as the local CO emission, the Spitzer color [70/160], and the total IR surface brightness measured from the Spitzer and Herschel bands. For the identification of the CO(3-2) clouds, we used the CPROPS algorithm, which allowed us to measure the physical properties of the clouds. We analyzed the scaling relationships of such physical properties. We obtained an R32 of 0.65 as a median value for the SMC, with a standard deviation of 0.3. We found that R32 varies from region to region, depending on the star formation activity. In regions dominated by HII and photo-dissociated regions (e.g., N22, N66), R32 tends to be higher than the median values. Meanwhile, lower values were found toward quiescent clouds. We also found that R32 correlates positively with the IR color [70/160] and the total IR surface brightness. This finding indicates that R32 increases with environmental properties like the dust temperature, the total gas density, and the radiation field. We have identified 225 molecular clouds with sizes R > 1.5 pc and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio > 3 and only 17 well-resolved CO(3-2) clouds increasing the S/N ratio to > 5. These 17 clouds follow consistent scaling relationships to the inner Milky Way clouds but with some departure. The CO(3-2) tends to be less turbulent and less luminous than the inner Milky Way clouds of similar size. Finally, we estimated a median virial-based CO-to-H2 conversion factor of 12.6_{-7}^{+10} Msun/(K km s^{-1} pc^{2}) for the total sample.
#### Mass and Angular Momentum Transport in a Gravitationally Unstable  Protoplanetary Disk with Improved 3D Radiative Hydrodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 During early phases of a protoplanetary disks's life, gravitational instabilities can produce significant mass transport, can dramatically alter disk structure, can mix and shock-process gas and solids, and may be instrumental in planet formation. We present a 3D grid-based radiative hydrodynamics study with varied resolutions of a 0.07 M$_\odot$ disk orbiting a 0.5 M$_\odot$ star as it settles over most of its radial extent into a quasi-steady asymptotic state that maintains approximate balance between heating produced by GIs and radiative cooling governed by realistic dust opacities. We assess disk stability criteria, thermodynamic properties, strengths of GIs, characteristics of density waves and torques produced by GIs, radial mass transport arising from these torques, and the level to which transport can be represented as local or nonlocal processes. Physical and thermal processes display distinct differences between inner optically thick and outer optically thin regions of the disk. In the inner region, gravitational torques are dominated by low-order Fourier components of the azimuthal mass distribution. These torques are strongly variable on the local dynamical time and are subject to rapid flaring presumably driven by recurrent swing amplification. In the outer region, m=1 torques dominate. Ring-like structures exhibiting strong noncircular motions, and vortices develop near the inner edge between 8 and 14 au. We find that GI-induced spiral modes erupt in a chaotic manner over the whole low-Q part of the disk, with many spiral modes appearing and disappearing, producing gravitoturbulence, but dominated by fluctuating large-scale modes, very different from a simple $\alpha$-disk.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00234
 - **Abstract**
 A coherently oscillating ultra-light axion can behave as dark matter. In particular, its coherently oscillating pressure perturbations can source an oscillating scalar metric perturbation, with a characteristic oscillation frequency which is twice the axion Compton frequency. A candidate in the mass range $10^{(-24,-21)}{\rm eV}$ can provide a signal in the frequency range tested by current and future Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) programs. Involving the pressure perturbations in a highly nonlinear environment, such an analysis demands a relativistic and nonlinear treatment. Here, we provide a rigorous derivation of the effect assuming weak gravity and slow-motion limit of Einstein's gravity in zero-shear gauge and show that dark matter's velocity potential determines the oscillation phase and frequency change. A monochromatic PTA signal correlated with the velocity field would confirm the prediction, for example, by cross-correlating the PTA results with the future local velocity flow measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new catalog of Kepler planet candidates that prioritizes accuracy of planetary dispositions and properties over uniformity. This catalog contains 4376 transiting planet candidates, including 1791 residing within 709 multi-planet systems, and provides the best parameters available for a large sample of Kepler planet candidates. We also provide a second set of stellar and planetary properties for transiting candidates that are uniformly-derived for use in occurrence rates studies. Estimates of orbital periods have been improved, but as in previous catalogs, our tabulated values for period uncertainties do not fully account for transit timing variations (TTVs). We show that many planets are likely to have TTVs with long periodicities caused by various processes, including orbital precession, and that such TTVs imply that ephemerides of Kepler planets are not as accurate on multi-decadal timescales as predicted by the small formal errors (typically 1 part in $10^6$ and rarely $ > 10^{-5}$) in the planets' measured mean orbital periods during the Kepler epoch. Analysis of normalized transit durations implies that eccentricities of planets are anti-correlated with the number of companion transiting planets. Our primary catalog lists all known Kepler planet candidates that orbit and transit only one star; for completeness, we also provide an abbreviated listing of the properties of the two dozen non-transiting planets that have been identified around stars that host transiting planets discovered by Kepler.

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation with Weyl scaling symmetry provides a viable scenario that can generate both the nearly scaling invariant primordial density fluctuation and a dark matter candidate. Here we point out that, in additional to the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) from quantum fluctuations, the production of high-frequency GWs from preheating in such inflation models can provide an another probe of the inflationary dynamics. We conduct both linear analytical analysis and nonlinear numerical lattice simulation in a typical model. We find that significant stochastic GWs can be produced and the frequency band is located around $10^8$ Hz $\sim$ $10^9$ Hz, which might be probed by future resonance-cavity experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The possible formation histories of neutron star binaries remain unresolved by current gravitational-wave catalogs. The detection of an eccentric binary system could be vital in constraining compact binary formation models. We present the first search for aligned spin eccentric neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH) and the most sensitive search for aligned-spin eccentric binary neutron star (BNS) systems using data from the third observing run of the advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors. No new statistically significant candidates are found; we constrain the local merger rate to be less than 150 $\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{Yr}^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars in the field, and, 50, 100, and 70 $\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{Yr}^{-1}$ for neutron star-black hole binaries in globular clusters, hierarchical triples and nuclear clusters, respectively, at the 90$\%$ confidence level if we assume that no sources have been observed from these populations. We predict the capabilities of upcoming and next-generation observatory networks; we investigate the ability of three LIGO ($\text{A}^{#}$) detectors and Cosmic Explorer CE (20km) + CE (40km) to use eccentric binary observations for determining the formation history of neutron star binaries. We find that 2 -- 100 years of observation with three $\text{A}^{#}$ observatories are required before we observe clearly eccentric NSBH binaries; this reduces to only 10 days -- 1 year with the CE detector network. CE will observe tens to hundreds of measurably eccentric binaries from each of the formation models we consider.
#### The origin of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos: new results and  prospects

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy neutrino astrophysics is rapidly developing, and in the last two years, new and exciting results have been obtained. Among them are the confirmation of the existence of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux by the new independent Baikal-GVD experiment, the discovery of the neutrino emission of our Galaxy, new confirmations of the origin of a part of astrophysical neutrinos in blazars, and much more. This brief review, based on the author's presentation at the session of the RAS Physical Science Division "Gamma quanta and neutrinos from space: what we can see now and what we need to see more", summarizes the results obtained since the publication of the review arXiv:2112.09611, and can be considered as a companion to it.

 - **Abstract**
 Be X-ray binaries (Be XRBs) are high-mass X-ray binaries, with a neutron star or black hole orbiting and accreting material from a non-supergiant B-star that is rotating at a near critical rate. These objects are prime targets to understand past binary interactions as the neutron star or black hole progenitor likely experienced Roche lobe overflow to spin up the Be star we observe now. The stellar variability can then allow us to explore the stellar structure of these objects. It was recently demonstrated that the high-mass X-ray binary CPD -29 2176 descended from an ultra-stripped supernova and is a prime target to evolve into an eventual binary neutron star and kilonova. We present the photometric variability from both TESS and ASAS along with the spectral properties and disk variability of the system in this paper. All of the optical lines are contaminated with disk emission except for the He II $\lambda$4686 absorption line. The disk variability time-scales are not the same as the orbital time scale, but could be related to the X-ray outbursts that have been recorded by Swift. We end our study with a discussion comparing CPD -29 2176 to classical Be stars and other Be X-ray binaries, finding the stellar rotation to be near a frequency of 1.5 cycles d$^{-1}$, and exhibiting incoherent variability in three frequency groups.
#### Planets Across Space and Time (PAST). V. The evolution of hot Jupiters  revealed by the age distribution of their host stars

 - **Abstract**
 The unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters challenged the classical theory of planet formation inspired by our solar system. Until now, the origin and evolution of hot Jupiters are still uncertain. Determining their age distribution and temporal evolution can provide more clues into the mechanism of their formation and subsequent evolution. Using a sample of 383 giant planets around Sun-like stars collected from the kinematic catalogs of the Planets Across Space and Time (PAST) project, we find that hot Jupiters are preferentially hosted by relatively younger stars in the Galactic thin disk. We subsequently find that the frequency of hot Jupiters declines with age. In contrast, the frequency of warm/cold Jupiters shows no significant dependence on age. Such a trend is expected from the tidal evolution of hot Jupiters' orbits, and our result offers supporting evidence using a large sample. We also perform a joint analysis on the planet frequencies in the stellar age-metallicity plane. The result suggests that the frequencies of hot Jupiters and warm/cold Jupiters, after removing the age dependence are both correlated with stellar metallicities. Moreover, we show that the above correlations can explain the bulk of the discrepancy in hot Jupiter frequencies inferred from the transit and radial velocity (RV) surveys, given that RV targets tend to be more metal-rich and younger than transits.
#### Probing the Physics of Reionization Using kSZ Power Spectrum from  Current and Upcoming CMB Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 The patchiness in the reionization process alters the statistics of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect in the CMB temperature power spectrum being a notable consequence. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of future kSZ power spectrum measurements in inferring the details of the reionization process. In this pursuit, we capitalize on the recent developments in foreground mitigation techniques using the Cross-Internal Linear Combination (Cross-ILC) technique, which enables robust detection of the kSZ power spectrum with signal-to-noise ($S/N$) roughly $20-30\sigma$ in this decade by SPT-3G and Simons Observatory (SO); and $\geq 80\sigma$ by CMB-S4, substantially improving on the marginal evidence for kSZ binned at $\ell=3000$ using SPT data (Reichardt et al. 2021). We use a fiducial kSZ power spectrum along with realistic error bars expected from the above technique for SPT-3G, SO, and CMB-S4 to constrain the parameter space for a physical model of reionization. We find that with the improved error bars it will be possible to place stringent constraints on reionization using solely the Cross-ILC recovered SPT-3G kSZ without imposing any prior on $\tau$ in the Bayesian inference. Notably, high-fidelity kSZ measurements from CMB-S4 coupled with $\tau$ measurements through LiteBIRD will enable unprecedented constraint on the midpoint of reionization with an error bar of $\sim 0.25$ and the duration of reionization with an error bar at $\sim 0.21$ exclusively using CMB data. This study highlights the need to capture kSZ power on a broad range of multipoles to gain insights into the inhomogeneous reionization era.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing is an invaluable tool for understanding fundamental cosmological physics. An unresolved issue in weak lensing cosmology is to accurately reconstruct the lensing convergence $\kappa$ maps from discrete shear catalog with survey masks, which the seminal Kaiser-Squire (KS) method is not designed to address. We present the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog (AKRA) to address the issue of mask. AKRA is built upon the prior-free maximum likelihood mapmaking method (or the unbiased minimum variance linear estimator). It is mathematically robust in dealing with mask, numerically stable to implement, and practically effective in improving the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulated maps with mask fractions ranging from 10\% to 50\% and various mask shapes, we demonstrate that AKRA outperforms KS at both the map level and summary statistics such as the auto power spectrum $C_\kappa$ of the reconstructed map, its cross-correlation coefficient $r_\ell$ with the true $\kappa $ map, the scatter plot and the localization measure. Unlike the Wiener filter method, it adopts no priors on the signal power spectrum, and therefore avoids the Wiener filter related biases at both the map level and cross-correlation statistics. If we only use the reconstructed map in the unmasked regions, the reconstructed $C_\kappa$ is accurate to $1\%$ or better and $1-r_\ell \lesssim 1\%$ (excluding $\ell$ at the smallest scales investigated), even for extreme cases of mask fraction and shape. As the first step, the current version of AKRA only addresses the mask issue and therefore ignores complexities such as curved sky and inhomogeneous shape measurement noise. AKRA is capable of dealing with these issues straightfowrardly, and will be addressed in the next version.
#### Discovery of five pulsars in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic  latitudes with FAST

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and timing results of five pulsars discovered in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes with the Five-hundred Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Among these pulsars, two belong to the category of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with spin periods of less than 20\,ms. Two others fall under the classification of `mildly recycled' pulsars, with massive white dwarfs as companions. Remarkably, this small survey, covering an area of 4.7 square degrees, led to the discovery of five pulsars, including four recycled pulsars. Such success underscores the immense potential of future surveys at intermediate Galactic latitudes. In order to assess the potential yield of MSPs, we conducted population simulations and found that both FAST and Parkes new Phased Array Feed surveys, focusing on intermediate Galactic latitudes, have the capacity to uncover several hundred new MSPs.
#### Estimating distances from parallaxes. VI: A method for inferring  distances and transverse velocities from parallaxes and proper motions  demonstrated on Gaia Data Release 3

 - **Abstract**
 The accuracy of stellar distances inferred purely from parallaxes degrades rapidly with distance. Proper motion measurements, when combined with some idea of typical velocities, provide independent information on stellar distances. Here I build a direction- and distance-dependent model of the distribution of stellar velocities in the Galaxy, then use this together with parallaxes and proper motions to infer kinegeometric distances and transverse velocities for stars in Gaia DR3. Using noisy simulations I assess the performance of the method and compare its accuracy to purely parallax-based (geometric) distances. Over the whole Gaia catalogue, kinegeometric distances are on average 1.25 times more accurate than geometric ones. This average masks a large variation in the relative performance, however. Kinegeometric distances are considerably better than geometric ones beyond several kpc, for example. On average, kinegeometric distances can be measured to an accuracy of 19% and velocities (sqrt[vra^2 + vdec^2]) to 16 km/s (median absolute deviations). In Gaia DR3, kinegeometric distances are smaller than geometric ones on average for distant stars, but the pattern is more complex in the bulge and disk. With the much more accurate proper motions expected in Gaia DR5, a further improvement in the distance accuracy by a factor of (only) 1.35 on average is predicted (with kinegeometric distances still 1.25 times more accurate than geometric ones). The improvement from proper motions is limited by the width of the velocity prior, in a way that the improvement from better parallaxes is not limited by the width of the distance prior.

 - **Abstract**
 Ejecta from Dimorphos following the DART mission impact, significantly increased the brightness of the Didymos-Dimorphos system, allowing us to examine sub-surface material. We report daily near-IR spectroscopic observations of the Didymos system using NASA's IRTF, that follow the evolution of the spectral signature of the ejecta cloud over one week, from one day before the impact. Overall, the spectral features remained fixed (S-type classification) while the ejecta dissipated, confirming both Didymos and Dimorphos are constructed from the same silicate material. This novel result strongly supports binary asteroid formation models that include breaking up of a single body, due to rotational breakup of km-wide bodies. At impact time +14 and +38 hours, the spectral slope decreased, but following nights presented increasing spectral slope that almost returned to the pre-impact slope. However, the parameters of the $1~\mu m$ band remained fixed, and no "fresh" / Q-type-like spectrum was measured. We interpret these as follow: 1. The ejecta cloud is the main contributor ($60-70\%$) to the overall light during the $\sim40$ hours after impact. 2. Coarser debris ($\geq 100~\mu m$) dominated the ejecta cloud, decreasing the spectral slope (after radiation pressure removed the fine grains at $\leq10$ hours after impact); 3. after approximately one week, the ejecta cloud dispersed enough to make the fine grains on Didymos surface the dominating part of the light, increasing the spectral slope to pre-impact level. 4. a negligible amount of non-weathered material was ejected from Dimorphos' sub-surface, suggesting Dimorphos was accumulated from weathered material, ejected from Didymos surface.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiwavelength investigation of the hub-filament system RCW 117 (IRAS 17059-4132), which shows intricate filamentary features in the far-infrared, mapped using Herschel images. We obtain the column density and dust temperature maps for the region using the Herschel images, and identify 88 cores and 12 filaments from the column density map of the region ($18'\times18'$). We employ the ThrUMMS $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) data for probing the kinematics in RCW 117, and find velocity gradients ($\sim 0.3-1$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) with hints of matter inflow along the filamentary structures. Ionised gas emission from the associated HII region is examined using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 610 and 1280 MHz, and is found to be of extent $5 \times 3$ pc$^2$ with intensity being brightest towards the hub. We estimate the peak electron density towards the hub to be $\sim 750$ cm$^{-3}$. Thirty four Class 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified in the region using the Spitzer GLIMPSE colour-colour diagram, with many lying along the filamentary structures. Based on the (i) presence of filamentary structures, (ii) distribution of cores across the region, with $\sim39$% found along the filamentary structures, (iii) massive star-formation tracers in the hub, and (iv) the kinematics, we believe that global hierarchical collapse can plausibly explain the observed features in RCW 117.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning (DL) has recently been proposed as a novel approach for 21cm foreground removal. Before applying DL to real observations, it is essential to assess its consistency with established methods, its performance across various simulation models and its robustness against instrumental systematics. This study develops a commonly used U-Net and evaluates its performance for post-reionisation foreground removal across three distinct sky simulation models based on pure Gaussian realisations, the Lagrangian perturbation theory, and the Planck sky model. Stable outcomes across the models are achieved provided that training and testing data align with the same model. On average, the residual foreground in the U-Net reconstructed data is $\sim$10% of the signal across angular scales at the considered redshift range. Comparable results are found with traditional approaches. However, blindly using a network trained on one model for data from another model yields inaccurate reconstructions, emphasising the need for consistent training data. The study then introduces frequency-dependent Gaussian beams and gain drifts to the test data. The network struggles to denoise data affected by "unexpected" systematics without prior information. However, after re-training consistently with systematics-contaminated data, the network effectively restores its reconstruction accuracy. This highlights the importance of incorporating prior systematics knowledge during training for successful denoising. Our work provides critical guidelines for using DL for 21cm foreground removal, tailored to specific data attributes. Notably, it is the first time that DL has been applied to the Planck sky model being most realistic foregrounds at present.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust (ISD) particles penetrate the solar system due to the relative motion of the Sun and the local interstellar cloud. Before entering the heliosphere, they pass through the heliospheric interface - the region of the solar wind interaction with the interstellar plasma. The size distribution and number density of dust grains are modified in the interface essentially. The modification depends on the charging of the dust particles along their trajectories. In this paper, we present modeling results of the charging of ISD particles passing through the heliospheric interface. The main physical processes responsible for the charging within the heliospheric conditions are the sticking of primary plasma particles, secondary electron emission, photoemission, and the effects of cosmic ray electrons. We consider two methods to calculate the electric charge of ISD particles based on (1) the classic steady-state assumption that the charge depends only on local plasma and radiation conditions and (2) the dynamical computation of charge along the particle trajectory. We demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is quite justified to model trajectories and number density distributions of relatively big ISD grains (radius of 100 nm and larger) penetrating the heliosphere. The estimates show that ISD grains of these sizes require less than 0.25 years (distance of ~ 1 au) after transition from the LISM into the heliosphere to reach an equilibrium. For small particles (radius of 10 nm), the dynamical computation of charge influences the trajectories and modifies the number density substantially. The dust density accumulations are distributed within a more elongated region along the heliopause in case of dynamically changed charge as compared with the use of a steady-state charge approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 The final sizes, composition, and angular momenta of solid planetary bodies depend on the outcomes of collisions between planetary embryos. The most common numerical method for simulating embryo collisions is to combine a gravity solver with a hydrodynamic solver, allowing pressure gradients, shock waves, and gravitational torques to loft material into orbit. Here, we perform the first direct comparison between hydrodynamic methods and a simplified method employing only gravity and a quadratic repulsive force. The formation of Earth's Moon, perhaps the most heavily simulated planetary collision, is used as a test case. Many of the main features of a collision between two planetary embryos, including collisions in which an orbiting disc of material and/or intact moons are formed, are controlled solely by gravitational forces. Comparison of the methods shows that the mass and orbit of the satellite, as well as the extent of physical mixing between the protoearth and impactor, are similar regardless of the inclusion of the inclusion of hydrodynamic effects or the equation of state employed. The study of thermal and chemical effects of the impact, and determining the time scale for lunar accretion, still require a full hydrodynamic calculation. The simplified gravity plus quadratic repulsive force approach allows rapid testing of various initial conditions to identify cases for further detailed study.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like early dark energy (EDE) as an extension to $\Lambda$CDM has been proposed as a possible solution to the 'Hubble tension'. We revisit this model using a new cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization likelihood constructed from the {\it Planck} NPIPE data release. In a Bayesian analysis, we find that the maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the total energy density is $f_{\rm EDE} < 0.061$ (without SH0ES) over the redshift range $z\in[10^3,10^4]$ and that the Hubble constant is constrained to lie within the range $ 66.9 < H_0 < 69.5$ km/s/Mpc (both at 95 \% C.L.). The data therefore favour a model close to $\Lambda$CDM, leaving a residual tension of $3.7\sigma$ with the SH$0$ES Cepheid-based measurement of $H_0$. A comparison with the likelihood profile shows that our conclusions are robust to prior-volume effects. Our new CMB likelihood provides no evidence in favour of a significant EDE component.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the relative amount of ejecta from high-mass versus intermediate-mass stars and to trace the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, we have performed with the IRAM 30m and the SMT 10m telescopes a systematic study of Galactic interstellar 18O/17O ratios toward a sample of 421 molecular clouds, covering a galactocentric distance range of 1-22 kpc. The results presented in this paper are based on the J=2-1 transition and encompass 364 sources showing both C18O and C17O detections. The previously suggested 18O/17O gradient is confirmed. For the 41 sources detected with both facilities, good agreement is obtained. A correlation of 18O/17O ratios with heliocentric distance is not found, indicating that beam dilution and linear beam sizes are not relevant. For the subsample of IRAM 30 m high-mass star-forming regions with accurate parallax distances, an unweighted fit gives 18O/17O = (0.12+-0.02)R_GC+(2.38+-0.13) with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.67. While the slope is consistent with our J=1-0 measurement, ratios are systematically lower. This should be caused by larger optical depths of C18O 2-1 lines, w.r.t the corresponding 1-0 transitions, which is supported by RADEX calculations and the fact that C18O/C17O is positively correlated with 13CO/C18O. After considering optical depth effects with C18O J=2-1 reaching typically an optical depth of 0.5, corrected 18O/17O ratios from the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines become consistent. A good numerical fit to the data is provided by the MWG-12 model, including both rotating stars and novae.

 - **Abstract**
 Photonics offer numerous functionalities that can be used to realize astrophotonic instruments. The most spectacular example to date is the ESO Gravity instrument at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Integrated astrophotonic devices stand to offer critical advantages for instrument development, including extreme miniaturization, as well as integration, superior thermal and mechanical stabilization owing to the small footprint, and high replicability offering cost savings. Numerous astrophotonic technologies have been developed to address shortcomings of conventional instruments to date, including for example the development of photonic lanterns, complex aperiodic fiber Bragg gratings, complex beam combiners to enable long baseline interferometry, and laser frequency combs for high precision spectral calibration of spectrometers. Despite these successes, the facility implementation of photonic solutions in astronomical instrumentation is currently limited because of (1) low throughputs from coupling to fibers, coupling fibers to chips, propagation and bend losses, device losses, etc, (2) difficulties with scaling to large channel count devices needed for large bandwidths and high resolutions, and (3) efficient integration of photonics with detectors, to name a few. In this roadmap, we identify 24 areas that need further development. We outline the challenges and advances needed across those areas covering design tools, simulation capabilities, fabrication processes, the need for entirely new components, integration and hybridization and the characterization of devices. To realize these advances the astrophotonics community will have to work cooperatively with industrial partners who have more advanced manufacturing capabilities. With the advances described herein, multi-functional instruments will be realized leading to novel observing capabilities for both ground and space platforms.
#### Keck and Hubble Observations Show That MOA-2008-BLG-379Lb Is a  Super-Jupiter Orbiting an M Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 We present high angular resolution imaging that reveals the MOA-2008-BLG-379L exoplanet host star using both adaptive optics with the Keck NIRC2 instrument and the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations reveal that the host star and planet masses are $M_{\rm host} = 0.434\pm 0.065 M_\odot$, and $m_p = 2.44 \pm 0.49 M_{\rm Jupiter}$. Their projected separation is $2.70\pm 0.42\,$AU, and they are located at a distance of $D_L = 3.44\pm 0.53\,$kpc toward the Galactic center. These results contribute to our effort to measure the masses of the exoplanet host stars in the \citet{suzuki16} statistical sample. When this program is completed, it will provide a measurement of the dependence of the planet occurrence rate on the mass and Galactocentric distance of the host stars. Our analysis also reveals the importance of including higher order effects, like microlensing parallax and planetary orbital motion even when the light curve data does not provide significant constraints on these effects. The inclusion of these effects is needed to obtain accurate estimates of the uncertainty of other microlensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius crossing time and planetary mass ratio. This will be particularly important for the exoplanet microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope, which will employ the same mass measurement method used in our analysis, using its own high angular resolution observations to determine the properties of most of its exoplanet host stars. Roman should also provide a large enough sample of exoplanetary microlens systems so that biases introduced by ignoring these higher order microlensing effects are likely to be significant.
#### Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XV. The B-type supergiant  system V1765 Cygni

 - **Abstract**
 V1765 Cyg is a detached eclipsing binary containing a B0.5 supergiant and a B1 main-sequence star, with an orbital period of 13.37 d and an eccentricity of 0.315. The system shows apsidal motion and the supergiant exhibits strong stochastic variability. V1765 Cyg was observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite over four sectors. We analyse these data to obtain the first determinate light curve model for the system. To this we add published spectroscopic orbits to infer masses of 23 +/- 2 Msun and 11.9 +/- 0.7 Msun, and radii of 20.6 +/- 0.8 Rsun and 6.2 +/- 0.3 Rsun. These properties are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for a solar chemical composition and an age around 7 Myr. We also present two epochs of blue-optical spectroscopy that confirm the luminosity classification of the primary star and appear to show absorption lines from the secondary star. Extensive spectroscopy and further analysis of the system is recommended.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's all-sky survey mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is specifically designed to detect transiting exoplanets orbiting bright stars. TESS has already identified about 400 transiting exoplanets, as well as approximately 6000 candidates awaiting validation. In this work, we present the outcomes of the project Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST), an ongoing endeavor dedicated to validating and characterizing new exoplanets using statistical validation tools. We have validated eight potential super-Earths using a combination of ground-based telescope data, high-resolution imaging, and the statistical validation tool known as \texttt{TRICERATOPS}. These validated planets bear the designations: TOI-238b (1.61$^{+0.09} _{-0.10}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-771b (1.42$^{+0.11} _{-0.09}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-871b (1.66$^{+0.11} _{-0.11}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-1467b (1.83$^{+0.16} _{-0.15}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-1739b (1.69$^{+0.10} _{-0.08}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-2068b (1.82$^{+0.16} _{-0.15}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-4559b (1.42$^{+0.13} _{-0.11}$ R$_\oplus$), and TOI-5799b (1.62$^{+0.19} _{-0.13}$ R$_\oplus$). We also studied the synthetic transmission spectra of all eight validated planets in the HST and JWST band-pass using \texttt{PLATON} and \texttt{PandExo}. Among all these validated planets, six of them fall within the region known as 'keystone planets,' which makes them particularly interesting for study. Based on the location of TOI-771b and TOI-4559b below the radius valley we characterized them as likely super-Earths, though radial velocity mass measurements for these planets will provide more details about their characterization. It is noteworthy that planets within the size range investigated herein are absent from our own solar system, making their study crucial for gaining insights into the evolutionary stages between Earth and Neptune.
