 - **Abstract**
 Obtaining reliable distance estimates to gas clouds within the Milky Way is challenging in the absence of certain tracers. The kinematic distance approach has been used as an alternative, derived from the assumption of circular trajectories around the Galactic centre. Consequently, significant errors are expected in regions where gas flow deviates from purely circular motions. We aim to quantify the systematic errors that arise from the kinematic distance method in the presence of a Galactic potential that is non-axisymmetric. We investigate how these errors differ in certain regions of the Galaxy and how they relate to the underlying dynamics. We perform 2D isothermal hydrodynamical simulation of the gas disk with the moving-mesh code Arepo, adding the capability of using an external potential provided by the Agama library for galactic dynamics. We introduce a new analytic potential of the Milky Way, taking elements from existing models and adjusting parameters to match recent observational constraints. We find significant errors in the kinematic distance estimate for gas close to the Sun, along sight lines towards the Galactic centre and anti-centre, and significant deviations associated with the Galactic bar. Kinematic distance errors are low within the spiral arms as gas resides close to local potential minima and the resulting line-of-sight velocity is close to what is expected for an axisymmetric potential. Interarm regions exhibit large deviations at any given Galactic radius. This is caused by the gas being sped up or slowed down as it travels into or out of the spiral arm. We are able to define 'zones of avoidance' in the lv-diagram, where the kinematic distance method is particularly unreliable and should only be used with caution. We report a power law relation between the kinematic distance error and the deviation of the project line-of-sight velocity from circular motion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a search for ammonia maser emission in 119 Galactic high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) known to host 22 GHz H$_2$O maser emission. Our survey has led to the discovery of non-metastable NH$_3$ inversion line masers toward 14 of these sources. This doubles the number of known non-metastable ammonia masers in our Galaxy, including nine new very high excitation ($J,K$)~=~(9,6) maser sources. These maser lines, including NH$_3$ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,8), (10,8), and (11,9), arise from energy levels of 342 K, 513 K, 465 K, 606 K, 834 K, 1090 K, 942 K, 1226 K, and 1449 K above the ground state. Additionally, we tentatively report a new metastable NH$_3$ (3,3) maser in G048.49 and an NH$_3$ (7,7) maser in G029.95. Our observations reveal that all of the newly detected NH$_3$ maser lines exhibit either blueshifted or redshifted velocities with respect to the source systemic velocities. Among the non-metastable ammonia maser lines, larger velocity distributions, offset from the source systemic velocities, are found in the ortho-NH$_3$ ($K=3n$) than in the para-NH$_3$ ($K\neq3n$) transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lac object 3C 371 has been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) for approximately a year, between July 2019 and July 2020, with an unmatched 2-minute observing cadence. In parallel, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration organized an extensive observing campaign, providing three years of continuous optical monitoring between 2018 and 2020. These datasets allow for a thorough investigation of the variability of the source. The goal of this study is evaluating the optical variability of 3C 371. Taking advantage of the remarkable cadence of \textit{TESS} data, we aim to characterize the intra-day variability (IDV) displayed by the source and identify its shortest variability timescale. With this estimate, constraints on the size of the emitting region and black hole mass can be calculated. Moreover, WEBT data is used to investigate long-term variability (LTV), including understanding spectral behaviour of the source and the polarization variability. Based on the derived characteristics, information on the origin of the variability on different timescales is extracted. We evaluated the variability applying the variability amplitude tool that quantifies how variable the emission is. Moreover, we employed common tools like ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAariance) tests, wavelet and power spectral density (PSD) analyses to characterize the shortest variability timescales present in the emission and the underlying noise affecting the data. Short- and long-term colour behaviours have been evaluated to understand the spectral behaviour of the source. The polarized emission was analyzed, studying its variability and possible rotation patterns of the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Flux distributions of IDV and LTV were also studied with the aim of linking the flux variations to turbulent and/or accretion disc related processes.

 - **Abstract**
 The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the chemical diversity observed around low-mass protostars probably resides in the earliest history of these systems. We aim to investigate the impact of protostellar feedback on the chemistry and grain growth in the circumstellar medium of multiple stellar systems. In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present high-resolution (50 au) observations of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and SiO and continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm towards the Corona Australis star cluster. Methanol emission reveals an arc-like structure at $\sim$1800 au from the protostellar system IRS7B along the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the disc. The arc is located at the edge of two elongated continuum structures that define a cone emerging from IRS7B. The region inside the cone is probed by H$_2$CO, while the eastern wall of the arc shows bright emission in SiO, a typical shock tracer. Taking into account the association with a previously detected radio jet imaged with JVLA at 6 cm, the molecular arc reveals for the first time a bow shock driven by IRS7B and a two-sided dust cavity opened by the mass-loss process. For each cavity wall, we derive an average H$_2$ column density of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a mass of $\sim$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, and a lower limit on the dust spectral index of $1.4$. These observations provide the first evidence of a shock and a conical dust cavity opened by the jet driven by IRS7B, with important implications for the chemical enrichment and grain growth in the envelope of Solar System analogues.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of cosmic microwave background polarisation, essential for probing a potential phase of inflation in the early universe, suffer from contamination by polarised emission from the Galactic interstellar medium. This work combines existing observations from the WMAP and Planck space missions to make a low-noise map of polarised synchrotron emission that can be used to clean forthcoming CMB observations. We combine WMAP K, Ka and Q maps with Planck LFI 30~GHz and 44~GHz maps using weights that near-optimally combine the observations as a function of sky direction, angular scale, and polarisation orientation. We publish well-characterised maps of synchrotron Q and U Stokes parameters at nu = 30GHz and 1 degree angular resolution. A statistical description of uncertainties is provided with Monte-Carlo simulations of additive and multiplicative errors. Our maps are the most sensitive full-sky maps of synchrotron polarisation to date, and are made available to the scientific community on a dedicated web site.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background instrumentation suite in the Atacama Desert of Chile. More than 65,000 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers will be fielded in the frequency range spanning 27 to 280 GHz, with three separate dichroic designs. The mid-frequency 90/150 GHz and ultra-high-frequency 220/280 GHz detector arrays, fabricated at NIST, account for 39 of 49 total detector modules and implement the feedhorn-fed orthomode transducer (OMT)-coupled TES bolometer architecture. A robust production-level fabrication framework for these detector arrays and the monolithic DC/RF routing wafers has been developed, which includes single device prototyping, process monitoring techniques, in-process metrology, and cryogenic measurements of critical film properties. Application of this framework has resulted in timely delivery of nearly 100 total superconducting focal plane components to SO with 88% of detector wafers meeting nominal criteria for integration into a detector module: a channel yield > 95% and Tc in the targeted range.

 - **Abstract**
 While substantial progress has been made in studying the pre-reconstruction galaxy bispectrum, investigations of the post-reconstruction bispectrum are still in nascent stages. In this paper, we present a bispectrum model that incorporates one-loop corrections in the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), while simultaneously addressing infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction density fluctuations in a non-perturbative approach. This model accurately captures the nonlinear behavior of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal within the post-reconstruction bispectrum framework. Furthermore, the incorporation of the one-loop correction extends its applicability to smaller scales. Given that the approach to addressing IR effects remains invariant before and after the reconstruction process, the resulting IR-resummed bispectrum model exhibits uniformity across both scenarios. Throughout this analysis, we achieve a comprehensive and unified description of the bispectrum that seamlessly spans the pre- and post-reconstruction phases.

#### Recovery of High-energy Low-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations from  Black Hole X-ray Binary MAXI J1535-571 with a Hilbert-Huang Transform Method

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a method based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to recover the high-energy waveform of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs). Based on the method, we successfully obtain the modulation of the phase-folded light curve above 170 keV using the QPO phase reconstructed at lower energies in MAXI J1535-571 with Insight-HXMT observations. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to demonstrate that such modulation indeed originates from the QPO. Thus the highest energies turn out to significantly exceed the upper limit of ~100 keV for QPOs reported previously using the Fourier method, marking the first opportunity to study QPO properties above 100 keV in this source. Detailed analyses of these high-energy QPO profiles reveal different QPO properties between the 30-100 keV and 100-200 keV energy ranges: the phase lag remains relatively stable, and the amplitude slightly increases below ~100 keV, whereas above this threshold, soft phase lags and a decrease in amplitude are observed. Given the reports of a hard tail detection in broad spectroscopy, we propose that the newly discovered QPO properties above 100 keV are dominated by the hard tail component, possibly stemming from a relativistic jet. Our findings also indicate a strong correlation between the QPOs originating from the jet and corona, supporting the scenario of jet-corona coupling precssion. We emphasize that our proposed HHT-based method can serve as an efficient manner in expanding the high energy band for studying QPOs, thereby enhancing our understanding of their origin.
#### Cepheids with giant companions: A new, abundant source of Cepheid  astrophysics

 - **Abstract**
 We present a progress report of our project aiming to increase the number of known Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to 100 or more. This will allow us, among other goals, to accurately measure masses for a large sample of Cepheids. Currently, only six accurate Cepheid masses are available, which hinders our understanding of their physical properties and renders the Cepheid mass--luminosity relation poorly constrained. At the same time, Cepheids are widely used for essential measurements (e.g., extragalactic distances, the Hubble constant). To examine Cepheid period--luminosity relations, we selected as binary candidates Cepheids that are too bright for their periods. To date, we have confirmed 56 SB2 systems, including the detection of significant orbital motions of the components for 32. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest reported period to date, as well as systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past merger events). Both features are essential to understand how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and what effect this has on global Cepheid properties. We also present eight new systems composed of two Cepheids (only one such system was known before). Among confirmed SB2 Cepheids, there are also several wide-orbit systems. In the future, these may facilitate independent accurate geometric distance measurements to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
#### Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of The Milky Way  Galaxy

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18474
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18474
 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.
#### On the properties of free floating planets originating in circumbinary  planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planets are a new class of planets recently discovered. These planets don't orbit within stellar systems, instead living a nomadic life within the galaxy. How such objects formed remains elusive. Numerous works have explored mechanisms to form such objects, but have not yet provided predictions on their distributions that could differentiate between formation mechanisms. In this work we form these objects within circumbinary systems, where these planets are readily formed and ejected through interactions with the central binary stars. We find significant differences between planets ejected through planet-planet interactions and those by the binary stars. The main differences that arise are in the distributions of excess velocity, where binary stars eject planets with faster velocities. These differences should be observable amongst known free-floating planets in nearby star-forming regions. We predict that targeted observations of directly imaged free-floating planets in these regions should be able to determine their preferred formation pathway, either by planet formation in single or multiple stellar systems, or through processes akin to star formation. Additionally the mass distributions of free-floating planets can yield important insights into the underlying planet populations. We find that for planets more massive than 20 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, their frequencies are similar to those planets remaining bound and orbiting near the central binaries. This similarity allows for effective and informative comparisons between mass distributions from microlensing surveys, to those of transit and radial velocities. Ultimately, by observing the velocity dispersion and mass distribution of free-floating planets, it will be possible to effectively compare with predictions from planet formation models, and to further understand the formation and evolution of these exotic worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 This research note concerns the application of deep-learning-based multi-view-imaging techniques to data from the H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope array. We find that the earlier the fusion of layer information from different views takes place in the neural network, the better our model performs with this data. Our analysis shows that the point in the network where the information from the different views is combined is far more important for the model performance than the method used to combine the information.

 - **Abstract**
 Future observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect promise ever improving measurements in terms of both sensitivity and angular resolution. As such, it is increasingly relevant to model `higher-order' contributions to the SZ effect. This work examines the effects of high-energy non-thermal electron distributions and those of anisotropic electron and photon distributions on the SZ signals. Analytic forms of the anisotropic scattering kernels for photons and electrons have been derived and investigated. We present a method for determining the anisotropic contributions through a spherical harmonic decomposition to arbitrary angular multipoles, and discuss the behaviour of these scattering kernels. We then carry out an exploration of various simplistic models of high energy non-thermal electron distributions, and examine their anisotropic behaviour. The kinematic SZ in the relativistic regime is studied using the kernel formulation allowing us to clarifying the role of kinematic corrections to the scattering optical depth. We finally present a release of an updated and refined version of SZpack including a new integrated Python interface and new modules for the calculation of various SZ signals, including those described in this paper.
#### The Distribution of Highly Red-sloped Asteroids in the Middle and Outer  Main Belt

 - **Abstract**
 Red (S > 10%/0.1 micron) spectral slopes are common among Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the outer solar system. Interior to and co-orbital with Jupiter, the red (S approx. = 10%/0.1 micron) slopes of D-type main-belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids are thought to reflect their hypothesized shared origin with TNOs beyond the orbit of Jupiter. In order to quantify the abundance of red-sloped asteroids within the main belt, we conducted a survey using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Lowell Discovery Telescope. We followed up on 32 candidate red objects identified via spectrophotometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Moving Object Catalog to confirm their steep spectral slopes and determine their taxonomic classifications. We find that our criteria for identifying candidate red objects from the Moving Object Catalog result in an approx. 50% confirmation rate for steeply red-sloped asteroids. We also compare our observations of main-belt asteroids to existing literature spectra of the Jupiter Trojans and steeply red-sloped main-belt asteroids. We show that some red-sloped asteroids have linearly increasing reflectance with increasing wavelength, while other red-sloped asteroids show a flattening in slope at longer near-infrared wavelengths, indicating a diversity among the population of spectrally red main-belt asteroids suggestive of a variety of origins among the population of steep-sloped asteroids.
#### The effect of Relativistic Aberration on Cosmological Distances

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18567
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18567
 - **Abstract**
 Aims: we propose that the condition of relative motion between us and the objects that we observe in the Universe should generate relativistic aberration on the photons that such objects emit, varying the observed flux similarly to the cases of blazars and neutron stars, with instead a decrease of this radiative flux. Methods: we follow some important papers and textbook used in modern cosmology, adding the effects of relativistic aberration in the theoretical description of the Cosmos. Results: New definitions for the luminosity distance and the angular distance arise, with the consequence of changing the cosmological parameters measured in the last years. A qualitative description of all of this is also performed on the multipole analysis of the CMB.
#### Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 2: benchmarking  and predictions

 - **Abstract**
 In the companion paper ("Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics", this issue) an equation was developed for the rate that lunar soil erodes under the exhaust of a landing rocket. That equation has only one parameter that is not calibrated from first principles, so here it is calibrated by the blowing soil's optical density curve during an Apollo landing. An excellent fit is obtained, helping validate the equation. However, when extrapolating the erosion rate all the way to touchdown on the lunar surface, a soil model is needed to handle the increased resistance to erosion as the deeper, more compacted soil is exposed. Relying on models derived from Apollo measurements and from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner thermal inertia measurements, only one additional soil parameter is unknown: the scale of increasing cohesive energy with soil compaction. Treating this as an additional fitting parameter results in some degeneracy in the solutions, but the depth of erosion scour in the post-landing imagery provides an additional constraint on the solution. The results show that about 4 to 10 times more soil was blown in each Apollo landing than previously believed, so the potential for sandblasting damage is worse than prior estimates. This also shows that, with further development, instruments to measure the soil erosion during lunar landings can constrain the soil column's density profile complementary to the thermal inertia measurements, providing insight into the landing site's geology.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes long-lived enough to be the dark matter have temperatures below the MeV. Since Hawking evaporation is a quasi-thermal process, no GeV emission is predicted to be produced by black holes if they are part, or all, of the cosmological dark matter. However, black holes could be ``spawned'' at late times with masses that correspond to short lifetimes, and as such be significantly hotter and produce particles well in excess of the GeV. Here, we show that such late-forming black holes could, at once, explain the tantalizing excesses found in the gamma radiation from the Galactic center, in the flux of cosmic-ray antiproton, and in the few tentative antihelium events reported by the anti-matter spectrometer AMS-02. We compute accurate predictions for the anti-deuteron, high-energy neutrino, and positron fluxes if this scenario is realized in nature. We find that while the neutrino and positron fluxes are too small compared to the expected background, a significant number of anti-deuteron events is expected both at AMS-02 and at the future General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS).

 Supernovae are responsible for the elemental enrichment of the galaxy and some are postulated to leave behind a black hole. In a stellar binary system the supernova pollutes its companion, and the black hole can accrete back its own debris and emit X-rays. In this sequence of events, which is only poorly understood, winds are ejected, and observed through X-ray absorption lines. Measuring abundances of elements in the wind can lead to inferences about the historical explosion and possibly identify the long-gone progenitor of the compact object. Here, we re-analyze the uniquely rich X-ray spectrum of the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40. We reconstruct the absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the wind, and find that it increases sharply with ionization from H-like O up to H-like Ca, and then flattens out. The AMD is then used to measure relative abundances of 18 different elements. The present abundances are in partial agreement with a previous work with discrepancies mostly for low-Z elements. The overabundance of odd-Z elements hints at a high-metallicity, high-mass ($\simeq25\,M_\odot$) progenitor. Interestingly, the abundances are different from those measured in the companion atmosphere, indicating that the wind entrains lingering ambient supernova debris. This can be expected since the current total stellar mass of the binary ($<10\,M_\odot$) is much less than the progenitor mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Capturing high resolution imagery of the Earth's surface often calls for a telescope of considerable size, even from Low Earth Orbits (LEO). A large aperture often requires large and expensive platforms. For instance, achieving a resolution of 1m at visible wavelengths from LEO typically requires an aperture diameter of at least 30cm. Additionally, ensuring high revisit times often prompts the use of multiple satellites. In light of these challenges, a small, segmented, deployable CubeSat telescope was recently proposed creating the additional need of phasing the telescope's mirrors. Phasing methods on compact platforms are constrained by the limited volume and power available, excluding solutions that rely on dedicated hardware or demand substantial computational resources. Neural Network (NN) are known for their computationally efficient inference and reduced on board requirements. Therefore we developed a NN based method to measure co phasing errors inherent to a deployable telescope. The proposed technique demonstrates its ability to detect phasing error at the targeted performance level (typically a wavefront error (WFE) below 15 nm RMS for a visible imager operating at the diffraction limit) using a point source. The robustness of the NN method is verified in presence of high order aberrations or noise and the results are compared against existing state of the art techniques. The developed NN model ensures its feasibility and provides a realistic pathway towards achieving diffraction limited images.

 Context. The complexity and variety exhibited by the light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) enclose a wealth of information that still awaits being fully deciphered. Despite the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the energetics, structure, and composition of the relativistic jet that results from the core collapse of the progenitor star, the nature of the inner engine, how it powers the relativistic outflow, and the dissipation mechanisms remain open issues. Aims. A promising way to gain insights is describing GRB light curves as the result of a common stochastic process. In the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) era, a stochastic pulse avalanche model was proposed and tested through the comparison of ensemble-average properties of simulated and real light curves. Here we aim to revive and further test this model. Methods. We apply it to two independent data sets, BATSE and Swift/BAT, through a machine learning approach: the model parameters are optimised using a genetic algorithm. Results. The average properties are successfully reproduced. Notwithstanding the different populations and passbands of both data sets, the corresponding optimal parameters are interestingly similar. In particular, for both sets the dynamics appears to be close to a critical state, which is key to reproduce the observed variety of time profiles. Conclusions. Our results propel the avalanche character in a critical regime as a key trait of the energy release in GRB engines, which underpins some kind of instability.
