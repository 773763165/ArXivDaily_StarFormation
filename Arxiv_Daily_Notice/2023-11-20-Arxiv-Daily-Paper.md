#### The Age Distribution of Stellar Orbit Space Clumps

 - **Abstract**
 The orbit distribution of young stars in the Galactic disk is highly structured, from well-defined clusters to streams of stars that may be widely dispersed across the sky, but are compact in orbital action-angle space. The age distribution of such groups can constrain the timescales over which co-natal groups of stars disperse into the `field'. Gaia data have proven powerful to identify such groups in action-angle space, but the resulting member samples are often too small and have too narrow a CMD coverage to allow robust age determinations. Here, we develop and illustrate a new approach that can estimate robust stellar population ages for such groups of stars. This first entails projecting the predetermined action-angle distribution into the 5D space of positions, parallaxes and proper motions, where much larger samples of likely members can be identified over a much wider range of the CMD. It then entails isochrone fitting that accounts for a) widely varying distances and reddenings; b) outliers and binaries; c) sparsely populated main sequence turn-offs, by incorporating the age information of the low-mass main sequence; and d) the possible presence of an intrinsic age spread in the stellar population. When we apply this approach to 92 nearby stellar groups identified in 6D orbit space, we find that they are predominately young ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr), mono-age populations. Many groups are established (known) localized clusters with possible tidal tails, others tend to be widely dispersed and manifestly unbound. This new age-dating tool offers a stringent approach to understanding on which orbits stars form in the solar neighborhood and how quickly they disperse into the field.
#### Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1: the darkest galaxy ever discovered?

 - **Abstract**
 The recently-discovered stellar system Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest known Milky Way satellite to date. With a stellar mass of $16^{+6}_{-5}\,\rm M_\odot$ and a half-light radius of $3\pm1$ pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for more than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the centre of a ~$10^9\rm M_\odot$ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order ~1 km/s. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places $\sigma_{\rm los}$ in the range 1 to 4 km/s. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is in all likelihood the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models, and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology.
#### Why are Mountaintops Cold? The Transition of Surface Lapse Rate on Dry  Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding surface temperature is important for habitability. Recent work on Mars has found that the dependence of surface temperature on elevation (surface lapse rate) converges to zero in the limit of a thin CO2 atmosphere. However, the mechanisms that control the surface lapse rate are still not fully understood. It remains unclear how the surface lapse rate depends on both greenhouse effect and surface pressure. Here, we use climate models to study when and why "mountaintops are cold". We find the tropical surface lapse rate increases with the greenhouse effect and with surface pressure. The greenhouse effect dominates the surface lapse rate transition and is robust across latitudes. The pressure effect is important at low latitudes in moderately opaque atmospheres. A simple model provides insights into the mechanisms of the transition. Our results suggest that topographic cold-trapping may be important for the climate of arid planets.
#### Mergers of black hole binaries driven by misaligned circumbinary discs

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10160
 - **Abstract**
 With hydrodynamical simulations we examine the evolution of a highly misaligned circumbinary disc around a black hole binary including the effects of general relativity. We show that a disc mass of just a few percent of the binary mass can significantly increase the binary eccentricity through von-Zeipel--Kozai-Lidov (ZKL) like oscillations provided that the disc lifetime is longer than the ZKL oscillation timescale. The disc begins as a relatively narrow ring of material far from the binary and spreads radially. When the binary becomes highly eccentric, disc breaking forms an inner disc ring that quickly aligns to polar. The polar ring drives fast retrograde apsidal precession of the binary that weakens the ZKL effect. This allows the binary eccentricity to remain at a high level and may significantly shorten the black hole merger time. The mechanism requires the initial disc inclination relative to the binary to be closer to retrograde than to prograde.
#### The 23.01 release of Cloudy

 - **Abstract**
 We announce the C23.01 update of Cloudy. This corrects a simple coding error, present since $\sim$ 1990, in one routine that required a conversion from the line-center to the mean normalization of the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth. This affects the destruction of H I Ly$\alpha$ by background opacities. Its largest effect is upon the Ly$\alpha$ intensity in high-ionization dusty clouds, where the predicted intensity is now up to three times stronger. Other properties that depend on Ly$\alpha$ destruction, such as grain infrared emission, change in response.
#### Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring, and Localization of Gamma-Ray Burst  GRB221009A

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10168
 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray burst GRB221009A was of unprecedented brightness in gamma-rays and X-rays, and through to the far ultraviolet, allowing for identification within a host galaxy at redshift z=0.151 by multiple space and ground-based optical/near-infrared telescopes and enabling a first association - via cosmic-ray air-shower events - with a photon of 251 TeV. That is in direct tension with a potentially observable phenomenon of quantum gravity (QG), where spacetime "foaminess" accumulates in wavefronts propagating cosmological distances, and at high-enough energy could render distant yet bright pointlike objects invisible, by effectively spreading their photons out over the whole sky. But this effect would not result in photon loss, so it remains distinct from any absorption by extragalactic background light. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. When scaled within the fields of view for the Fermi and Swift instruments, it fits all z<5 GRB angular-resolution data of 10 MeV or any lesser peak energy and can still be consistent with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A: a limiting bound of about 1 degree is in agreement with a holographic QG-favored formulation.
#### An automated procedure for the detection of the Yarkovsky effect and  results from the ESA NEO Coordination Centre

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The measurement of the Yarkovsky effect on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is common practice in orbit determination today, and the number of detections will increase with the developments of new and more accurate telescopic surveys. However, the process of finding new detections and identifying spurious ones is not yet automated, and it often relies on personal judgment. Aims: We aim to introduce a more automated procedure that can search for NEA candidates to measure the Yarkovsky effect, and that can identify spurious detections. Methods: The expected semi-major axis drift on an NEA caused by the Yarkovsky effect was computed with a Monte Carlo method on a statistical model of the physical parameters of the asteroid that relies on the most recent NEA population models and data. The expected drift was used to select candidates in which the Yarkovsky effect might be detected, according to the current knowledge of their orbit and the length of their observational arc. Then, a nongravitational acceleration along the transverse direction was estimated through orbit determination for each candidate. If the detected acceleration was statistically significant, we performed a statistical test to determine whether it was compatible with the Yarkovsky effect model. Finally, we determined the dependence on an isolated tracklet. Results: Among the known NEAs, our procedure automatically found 348 detections of the Yarkovsky effect that were accepted. The results are overall compatible with the predicted trend with the the inverse of the diameter, and the procedure appears to be efficient in identifying and rejecting spurious detections. This algorithm is now adopted by the ESA NEO Coordination Centre to periodically update the catalogue of NEAs with a measurable Yarkovsky effect, and the results are automatically posted on the web portal.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of this paper, microlenses present as oblate clusters of dark matter structures called massive astrophysical compact halo object(MACHO) in the galactic halo are considered. The NFW density profile [1] is derived from the observational data and works best in the halo region of the exterior part of the galaxy. Hence this profile is used to plot the potential, deflection angle, and critical and caustic curves for the aforementioned microlenses using numerical methods. Moreover, this model is compared with an older density profile model [2], and the differences in their caustic and critical curves are pointed out. This leads to the conclusion that the NFW model produces caustic and critical curves that occupy a smaller region than portrayed by the caustic and critical curves produced by the older density profile model. However, the differences are not that significant to these structures act as microlenses as they are so small and beyond the scope of modern telescopes, and thus only the light curves can be detected from these structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale exoplanet surveys like the TESS mission are powerful tools for discovering large numbers of exoplanet candidates. Single-transit events are commonplace within the resulting candidate list due to the unavoidable limitation of observing baseline. These single-transit planets often remain unverified due to their unknown orbital period and consequent difficulty in scheduling follow up observations. In some cases, radial velocity (RV) follow up can constrain the period enough to enable a future targeted transit detection. We present the confirmation of one such planet: TOI-2010 b. Nearly three years of RV coverage determined the period to a level where a broad window search could be undertaken with the Near-Earth Object Surveillance Satellite (NEOSSat), detecting an additional transit. An additional detection in a much later TESS sector solidified our final parameter estimation. We find TOI-2010 b to be a Jovian planet ($M_P = 1.29 \ M_{\rm Jup}$, $R_P = 1.05 \ R_{\rm Jup}$) on a mildly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.21$) with a period of $P = 141.83403$ days. Assuming a simple model with no albedo and perfect heat redistribution, the equilibrium temperature ranges from about 360 K to 450 K from apoastron to periastron. Its wide orbit and bright host star ($V=9.85$) make TOI-2010 b a valuable test-bed for future low-insolation atmospheric analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The latest generation of high-resolution spectrograph instruments on 10m-class telescopes continue to pursue challenging science cases. Consequently, ever more precise calibration methods are necessary to enable trail-blazing science methodology. We present the High-resolution Infrared SPectrograph for Exoplanet Characterization (HISPEC) Calibration Unit (CAL), designed to facilitate challenging science cases such as Doppler imaging of exoplanet atmospheres, precision radial velocity, and high-contrast high-resolution spectroscopy of nearby exoplanets. CAL builds upon the heritage from the pathfinder instrument Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) and utilizes four near-infrared (NIR) light sources encoded with wavelength information that are coupled into single-mode fibers. They can be used synchronously during science observations or asynchronously during daytime calibrations. A hollow cathode lamp (HCL) and a series of gas absorption cells provide absolute calibration from 0.98 {\mu}m to 2.5 {\mu}m. A laser frequency comb (LFC) provides stable, time-independent wavelength information during observation and CAL implements a lower finesse astro-etalon as a backup for the LFC. Design lessons from instrumentation like HISPEC will serve to inform the requirements for similar instruments for the ELTs in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Ionized nebulae are key to understanding the chemical composition and evolution of the Universe. Among these nebulae, H~{\sc ii} regions and planetary nebulae are particularly important as they provide insights into the present and past chemical composition of the interstellar medium, along with the nucleosynthetic processes involved in the chemical evolution of the gas. However, the heavy-element abundances derived from collisional excited lines (CELs) and recombination lines (RLs) do not align. This longstanding abundance-discrepancy problem calls into question our absolute abundance determinations. Which of the lines (if any) provides the correct heavy-element abundances? Recently, it has been shown that there are temperature inhomogeneities concentrated within the highly ionized gas of the H~{\sc ii} regions, causing the reported discrepancy. However, planetary nebulae do not exhibit the same trends as the H~{\sc ii} regions, suggesting a different origin for the abundance discrepancy. In this proceedings, we briefly discuss the state-of-the-art of the abundance discrepancy problem in both H~{\sc ii} regions and planetary nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 Millimter (mm) frequencies are primarily sensitive to thermal emission from layers across the stellar chromosphere up to the transition region, while metrewave (radio) frequencies probe the coronal heights. Together the mm and radio band spectroscopic snapshot imaging enables the tomographic exploration of the active atmospheric layers of the cool main-sequence stars (spectral type: FGKM), including our Sun. Sensitive modern mm and radio interferometers let us explore solar/stellar activity covering a range of energy scales at sub-second and sub-MHz resolution over wide operational bandwidths. The superior uv-coverage of these instruments facilitate high dynamic range imaging, letting us explore the morphological evolution of even energetically weak events on the Sun at fine spectro-temporal cadence. This article will introduce the current advancements, the data analysis challenges and available tools. The impact of these tools and novel data in field of solar/stellar research will be summarised with future prospects.
#### Forming Giant Planets Around Late-M Dwarfs: Pebble Accretion and  Planet-Planet Collision

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a pebble-driven core accretion scenario to explain the formation of giant planets around the late-M dwarfs of $M_{\star}{=}0.1{-}0.2 \ M_{\odot}$. In order to explore the optimal disk conditions for giant planet, we perform N-body simulations to investigate the growth and dynamical evolution of both single and multiple protoplanets in the disks with both inner viscously heated and outer stellar irradiated regions. The initial masses of the protoplanets are either assumed to be equal to $0.01 \ M_{\oplus}$ or calculated based on the formula derived from streaming instability simulations. Our findings indicate that massive planets are more likely to form in disks with longer lifetimes, higher solid masses, moderate to high levels of disk turbulence, and larger initial masses of protoplanets. In the single protoplanet growth cases, the highest planet core mass that can be reached is generally lower than the threshold necessary to trigger rapid gas accretion, which impedes the formation of giant planets. Nonetheless, in multi-protoplanet cases, the cores can exceed the pebble isolation mass barrier aided by frequent planet-planet collisions. This consequently speeds up their gas accretion and promotes giant planet formation, making the optimal parameter space to grow giant planets substantially wider. Taken together, our results suggest that even around very low-mass stellar hosts, the giant planets with orbital periods of ${\lesssim}100$ days are still likely to form when lunar-mass protoplanets first emerge from planetesimal accretion and then grow rapidly by a combination of pebble accretion and planet-planet collisions in disks with a high supply of pebble reservoir ${>}50 \ M_{\oplus}$ and turbulent level of $\alpha_{\rm t} {\sim} 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extensive recent multi-band optical photometric observations of the blazar S5 0716+714 carried out over 53 nights with two telescopes in India, two in Bulgaria, one in Serbia, and one in Egypt during 2019 November -- 2022 December. We collected 1401, 689, 14726, and 165 photometric image frames in B, V, R, and I bands, respectively. We montiored the blazar quasi-simultaneously during 3 nights in B, V, R, and I bands; 4 nights in B, V, and R; 2 nights in V, R, and I; 5 nights in B and R; and 2 nights in V and R bands. We also took 37 nights of data only in R band. Single band data are used to study intraday flux variability and two or more bands quasi-simultaneous observations allow us to search for colour variation in the source. We employ the power-enhanced F-test and the nested ANOVA test to search for genuine flux and color variations in the light curves of the blazar on intraday timescales. Out of 12, 11, 53, and 5 nights observations, intraday variations with amplitudes between ~3% and ~20% are detected in 9, 8, 31 and 3 nights in B, V, R, and I bands, respectively, corresponding to duty cycles of 75%, 73%, 58% and 60%. These duty cycles are lower than those typically measured at earlier times. On these timescales color variations with both bluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter are seen, though nights with no measurable colour variation are also present. We briefly discuss possible explanations for this observed intraday variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 2023ixf was discovered on May 19th, 2023. The host galaxy, M101, was observed by the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) collaboration over the period April 30, 2020 -- July 10, 2020, using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS; $3470\lesssim\lambda\lesssim5540$ \r{A}) on the 10-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). The fiber filling factor within $\pm$ 30 arcsec of SN 2023ixf is 80% with a spatial resolution of 1 arcsec. The r<5.5 arcsec surroundings are 100% covered. This allows us to analyze the spatially resolved pre-explosion local environments of SN 2023ixf with nebular emission lines. The 2-dimensional (2D) maps of the extinction and the star-formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) show weak increasing trends in the radial distributions within the r<5.5 arcsec regions, suggesting lower values of extinction and SFR in the vicinity of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. The median extinction and that of the surface density of SFR within r<3 arcsec are $E(B-V)=0.06\pm0.14$, and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}=10^{-5.44\pm0.66}~\rm M_{\odot}\cdot yr^{-1}\cdot arcsec^{-2}$. There is no significant change in extinction before and after the explosion. The gas metallicity does not change significantly with the separation from SN 2023ixf. The metal-rich branch of the $R_{23}$ calculations indicates that the gas metallicity around SN 2023ixf is similar to the solar metallicity ($\sim Z_{\odot}$). The archival deep images from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) show a clear detection of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf in the $z$-band at $22.778\pm0.063$ mag, but non-detections in the remaining four bands of CFHTLS ($u,g,r,i$). The results suggest a massive progenitor of $\approx$ 22 $M_\odot$.
#### Numerical study of non-toroidal inertial modes with l=m+1 radial  vorticity in the Sun's convection zone

 - **Abstract**
 Various types of inertial modes have been observed and identified on the Sun, including the equatorial Rossby modes, critical-latitude modes, and high-latitude modes. Recent observations further report a detection of equatorially-antisymmetric radial vorticity modes which propagate in a retrograde direction about three times faster than those of the equatorial Rossby modes when seen in the corotating frame with the Sun. Here, we study the properties of these equatorially-antisymmetric vorticity modes using a realistic linear model of the Sun's convection zone. We find that they are essentially non-toroidal, involving a substantial radial flow at the equator. Thus, the background density stratification plays a critical role in determining their dispersion relation. The solar differential rotation is also found to have a significant impact by introducing the viscous critical layers and confining the modes near the base of the convection zone. Furthermore, we find that their propagation frequencies are strikingly sensitive to the background superadiabaticity $\delta$ because the buoyancy force acts as an additional restoring force for these non-toroidal modes. The observed frequencies are compatible with the linear model only when the bulk of the convection zone is weakly subadiabatic ($-5\times 10^{-7} \lesssim \delta \lesssim -2.5\times 10^{-7}$). Our result is consistent with but tighter than the constraint independently derived in a previous study ($\delta<2 \times 10^{-7}$) employing the high-latitude inertial mode. It is implied that, below the strongly superadiabatic near-surface layer, the bulk of the Sun's convection zone might be much closer to adiabatic than typically assumed and may even be weakly subadiabatic.
#### Increasing planet-stirring efficiency of debris disks by "projectile  stirring" and "resonant stirring"

 - **Abstract**
 Extrasolar debris disks are detected by observing dust, which is thought to be released during planetesimal collisions. This implies that planetesimals are dynamically excited ("stirred"), such that collisions are sufficiently common and violent. The most frequently considered stirring mechanisms are self-stirring by disk self-gravity, and planet-stirring via secular interactions. However, these models face problems when considering disk mass, self-gravity, and planet eccentricity, leading to the possibility that other, unexplored mechanisms instead stir debris. We hypothesize that planet-stirring could be more efficient than the traditional secular model implies, due to two additional mechanisms. First, a planet at the inner edge of a debris disk can scatter massive bodies onto eccentric, disk-crossing orbits, which then excite debris ("projectile stirring"). Second, a planet can stir debris over a wide region via broad mean-motion resonances, both at and between nominal resonance locations ("resonant stirring"). Both mechanisms can be effective even for low-eccentricity planets, unlike secular-planet-stirring. We run N-body simulations across a broad parameter space, to determine the viability of these new stirring mechanisms. We quantify stirring levels using a bespoke program for assessing Rebound debris simulations, which we make publicly available. We find that even low-mass projectiles can stir disks, and verify this with a simple analytic criterion. We also show that resonant stirring is effective for planets above ~0.5 MJup. By proving that these mechanisms can increase planet-stirring efficiency, we demonstrate that planets could still be stirring debris disks even in cases where conventional (secular) planet-stirring is insufficient.

 - **Abstract**
 Current observations do not rule out the possibility that the Universe might end up in an abrupt event. Different such scenarios may be explored through suitable parameterizations of the dark energy and then confronted to cosmological background data. Here we parameterize a pseudorip scenario using a particular sigmoid function and carry an in-depth multifaceted examination of its evolutionary features and statistical performance. This depiction of a non violent final fate of our cosmos seems to be arguably statistically favoured over the consensus {\Lambda}CDM model according to some Bayesian discriminators.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive for the first time observational constraints on the extended Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (eMTMG) framework in light of Planck-CMB data, geometrical measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Type Ia supernovae from the recent Pantheon+ samples, and also using the auto and cross-correlations cosmic shear measurements from KIDS-1000 survey. Given the great freedom of dynamics choice for the theory, we consider an observationally motivated subclass in which the background evolution of the Universe goes through a transition from a (positive or negative) value of the effective cosmological constant to another value. From the statistical point of view, we did not find evidence of such a transition, i.e. deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM behavior, and from the joint analysis using Planck + BAO + Pantheon+ data, we constrain the graviton mass to $< 6.6 \times 10^{-34}$ eV at 95% CL. We use KIDS-1000 survey data to constrain the evolution of the scalar perturbations of the model and its limits for the growth of structure predicted by the eMTMG scenario. In this case, we find small evidence at 95% CL for a non-zero graviton mass. We interpret and discuss these results in light of the current tension on the $S_8$ parameter. We conclude that, within the subclass considered, the current data are only able to impose upper bounds on the eMTMG dynamics. Given its potentialities beyond the subclass, eMTMG can be classified as a good candidate for modified gravity, serving as a framework in which observational data can effectively constrain (or confirm) the graviton mass and deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Electronically Assisted Astronomy consists in capturing deep sky images with a digital camera coupled to a telescope to display views of celestial objects that would have been invisible through direct observation. This practice generates a large quantity of data, which may then be enhanced with dedicated image editing software after observation sessions. In this study, we show how Image Quality Assessment can be useful for automatically rating astronomical images, and we also develop a dedicated model by using Automated Machine Learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the surface porosity of icy moons and its evolution with depth remains limited, including the precise scale at which ice compaction occurs under self-weight pressure. This parameter is of crucial interest for the correct interpretation of current remote sensing data (spectroscopy in the visible, infrared to passive microwave) but also for planetary exploration when designing a lander, a rover or a cryobot. In situ exploration of the ice crust would require knowledge about subsurface porosity. This study employs a compaction model solely driven by overburden pressure based on prior research. The formulation for density as a function of depth, incorporates an essential parameter: the ice compaction coefficient. To determine this coefficient, we fit our depth-dependent density model to existing data obtained from Earth-based measurements of ice cores in Antarctica and North Greenland. Our results yield a typical lengthscale for ice compaction on Earth of approximately 20.1 $\pm$ 0.6 m , consistent with the existing literature. We apply the model to Europa, which due to its lower gravity, has a typical ice compaction scale of 150 $\pm$ 4 m. We compare it with the depths scanned by current spaceborne data and find that porosity can be considered constant when accounting only for gravity-induced compaction.

 - **Abstract**
 We present LinearResponse.jl, an efficient, versatile public library written in julia to compute the linear response of self-gravitating (3D spherically symmetric) stellar spheres and (2D axisymmetric razor-thin) discs. LinearResponse.jl can scan the whole complex frequency plane, probing unstable, neutral and (weakly) damped modes. Given a potential model and a distribution function, this numerical toolbox estimates the modal frequencies as well as the shapes of individual modes. The libraries are validated against a combination of previous results for the spherical isochrone model and Mestel discs, and new simulations for the spherical Plummer model. Beyond linear response theory, the realm of applications of LinearResponse.jl also extends to the kinetic theory of self-gravitating systems through a modular interface.

 - **Abstract**
 An ESO internal ALMA development study, BRAIN, is addressing the ill-posed inverse problem of synthesis image analysis employing astrostatistics and astroinformatics. These emerging fields of research offer interdisciplinary approaches at the intersection of observational astronomy, statistics, algorithm development, and data science. In this study, we provide evidence of the benefits of employing these approaches to ALMA imaging for operational and scientific purposes. We show the potential of two techniques, RESOLVE and DeepFocus, applied to ALMA calibrated science data. Significant advantages are provided with the prospect to improve the quality and completeness of the data products stored in the science archive and overall processing time for operations. Both approaches evidence the logical pathway to address the incoming revolution in data rates dictated by the planned electronic upgrades. Moreover, we bring to the community additional products through a new package, ALMASim, to promote advancements in these fields, providing a refined ALMA simulator usable by a large community for training and/or testing new algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent improvements in the sensitivity and precision of the radial velocity (RV) method for exoplanets has brought it close, but not quite to, the threshold ($\sim$10 cm/s) required to detect Earth-mass and other potentially habitable planets around Sun-like stars. Stellar activity-driven noise in RV measurements remains a significant hurdle to achieving this goal. While various efforts have been made to disentangle this noise from real planetary signals, a greater understanding of the relationship between spectra and stellar activity is crucial to informing stellar activity mitigation. We use a partially automated method to analyze spectral lines in a set of observations of the young, active star $\epsilon$ Eridani from the high-precision spectrograph NEID, correlate their features (depth, full width at half maximum, and integrated flux) with known activity indicators, and filter and curate for well-behaved lines whose shape changes are sensitive to certain types of stellar activity. We then present a list of 9 lines correlated with the S-index in all three line features, including 4 newly-identified activity-sensitive lines; as well additional lines correlated with S-index in at least one feature, and discuss the possible implications of the behavior observed in these lines. Our line lists represent a step forward in the empirical understanding of the complex relationships between stellar activity and spectra, and illustrate the importance of studying the time evolution of line morphologies with stabilized spectrographs, in the overall effort to mitigate activity in the search for small, potentially Earth-like exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The terrestrial detection of a neutrino burst from the next galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) will provide profound insight into stellar astrophysics, as well as fundamental neutrino physics. Using Time-Of-Flight (ToF) effects, a CCSN signal can be used to constrain the absolute neutrino mass. In this work, we study the case where a black hole forms during core-collapse, abruptly truncating the neutrino signal. This sharp cutoff is a feature that can be leveraged in a ToF study, enabling strict limits to be set on the neutrino mass which are largely model-independent. If supernova neutrinos are detected on Earth in liquid scintillator detectors, the exceptional energy resolution would allow an energy-dependent sampling of the ToF effects at low neutrino energies. One promising experimental program is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a next-generation liquid scintillator detector currently under construction in China. Using three-dimensional black hole-forming core-collapse supernova simulations, the sensitivity of a JUNO-like detector to the absolute neutrino mass is conservatively estimated to be $m_\nu < 0.39^{+0.06}_{-0.01}$ eV for a 95% CL bound. A future-generation liquid scintillator observatory like THEIA-100 could even achieve sub-0.2 eV sensitivity.
#### A Method for Obtaining Cosmological Models Consistency Relations and  Gaussian Processes Testing

 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we apply consistency relation tests to several cosmological models, including the flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM models, as well as the flat XCDM model. The analysis uses a non-parametric Gaussian Processes method to reconstruct various cosmological quantities of interest, such as the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivatives from $H(z)$ data, as well as the comoving distance and its derivatives from SNe Ia data. We construct consistency relations from these quantities which should be valid only in the context of each model and test them with the current data. We were able to find a general method of constructing such consistency relations in the context of $H(z)$ reconstruction. In the case of comoving distance reconstruction, there were not a general method of constructing such relations and this work had to write an specific consistency relation for each model. From $H(z)$ data, we have analyzed consistency relations for all the three above mentioned models, while for SNe Ia data we have analyzed consistency relations only for flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM models. Concerning the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, some inconsistency was found, at more than $2\sigma$ c.l., with the $H(z)$ data in the interval $1.8\lesssim z\lesssim2.4$, while the other models were all consistent at this c.l. Concerning the SNe Ia data, the flat $\Lambda$CDM model was consistent in the $0<z<2.5$ interval, at $1\sigma$ c.l., while the nonflat $\Lambda$CDM model was consistent in the same interval, at 2$\sigma$ c.l.
#### Collection, Collation, and Comparison of 3D Coronal CME Reconstructions

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the impacts of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a major focus of current space weather forecasting efforts. Typically, CME properties are reconstructed from stereoscopic coronal images and then used to forward model a CME's interplanetary evolution. Knowing the uncertainty in the coronal reconstructions is then a critical factor in determining the uncertainty of any predictions. A growing number of catalogs of coronal CME reconstructions exist, but no extensive comparison between these catalogs has yet been performed. Here we develop a Living List of Attributes Measured in Any Coronal Reconstruction (LLAMACoRe), an online collection of individual catalogs, which we intend to continually update. In this first version, we use results from 24 different catalogs with 3D reconstructions using STEREO observations between 2007--2014. We have collated the individual catalogs, determining which reconstructions correspond to the same events. LLAMACoRe contains 2954 reconstructions for 1863 CMEs. Of these, 510 CMEs contain multiple reconstructions from different catalogs. Using the best-constrained values for each CME, we find that the combined catalog reproduces the generally known solar cycle trends. We determine the typical difference we would expect between two independent reconstructions of the same event and find values of 4.0 deg in the latitude, 8.0 deg in the longitude, 24.0 deg in the tilt, 9.5 deg in the angular width, 0.1 in the shape parameter kappa, 115 km/s in the velocity, and 2.5e15 g in the mass. These remain the most probable values over the solar cycle, though we find more extreme outliers in the deviation toward solar maximum.
