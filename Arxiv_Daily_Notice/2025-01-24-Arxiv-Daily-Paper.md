          Two decades of optical variability of Small Magellanic Cloud high-mass X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the long-term optical/IR behavior of 111 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud based on data from the OGLE collaboration. Most systems exhibit variability on a range of time scales. This variability regulates the mass transfer to the compact object, while the compact object can, in turn, affect the donor star's behavior. To better understand this complex interaction and the resulting X-ray properties in these systems, we define a new taxonomy for the observed super-orbital variability. This taxonomy connects to the color changes, orbital periods, and X-ray behavior of the sources. In most cases, these properties can be explained by differences between the flux of the disk around the Be star and the flux from the star itself. We also refine and present new potential orbital periods and sub-orbital variability in the sources.

 - **Abstract**
 A wide range of stellar explosions, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption events (TDE), and fast blue optical transients (FBOT), can occur in dusty environments initially opaque to the transient's optical/UV light, becoming visible only once the dust is destroyed by the transient's rising luminosity. We present axisymmetric time-dependent radiation transport simulations of dust-shrouded transients with \texttt{Athena++} and tabulated gray opacities, which predict the light-curves of the dust-reprocessed infrared (IR) radiation. The luminosity and timescale of the IR light-curve depends on whether the transient rises rapidly or slowly compared to the light crossing-time of the photosphere, $t_{\rm lc}$. For slow-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \gg t_{\rm lc}$) such as SNe, the reprocessed IR radiation diffuses outwards through the dust shell faster than the sublimation front expands; the IR light-curve therefore begins rising prior to the escape of UV/optical light, but peaks on a timescale $\sim t_{\rm rise}$ shorter than the transient duration. By contrast, for fast-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \ll t_{\rm lc}$) such as FBOTs and some TDEs, the finite light-travel time results in the reprocessed radiation arriving as an ``echo'' lasting much longer than the transient itself (despite the dust photosphere having already being destroyed by peak light). We explore the effects of the system geometry by considering a torus-shaped distribution of dust. The IR light-curves seen by observers in the equatorial plane of the torus resemble those for a spherical dust shell, while polar observers see faster-rising, brighter and shorter-lived emission. We successfully model the IR excess seen in AT2018cow as a dust echo, supporting the presence of an opaque dusty medium surrounding FBOTs prior to explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.

          Spectro-temporal Investigation of Quasi-periodic Oscillations From Black Hole X-ray Binary 4U 1630-472 Using $\textit{NICER}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectro-temporal characteristics of the X-ray variabilities from black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472 during its three outbursts (2018, 2020, and 2021) as observed by $\textit{NICER}$. We detected 27 Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs), out of which 25 were observed during the 2021 outburst. In this study, we specifically focus on the relationship between spectral and timing parameters and the frequency of type-C QPOs in the 2021 outburst of the black hole binary 4U 1630-472 during its rising phase. We found strong correlations between the photon index of the non-thermal emission and the QPO frequency. We also observed a critical frequency at $\sim$ 2.31 Hz, above which the behavior of the Q-factor of the QPO changed significantly with the QPO frequency. We further identified two events characterized by a surge in the total flux, corresponding to the disappearance of type-C QPOs. Although the first event appeared like an X-ray flare, during the second event, the source reached a state with a total flux higher than 10$^{-8}$ erg/cm$^{2}$/s and exhibited a different type of QPO with lower frequencies and weaker amplitudes. We compare our results with the previously reported QPO characteristics for black hole outbursts and discuss the various models that could interpret the critical frequency and potentially explain the origin and evolution of these type-C QPOs.

          Properties of Free Floating Planets Ejected through Planet-Planet Scattering

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple studies have shown that planet-planet scattering plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. For instance, it has been shown that planet-planet scattering can reproduce the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets. It can also contribute to the current census of free floating planets. In this work we run an ensemble of N-body simulations of planetary systems, and record the properties of planets which are ejected from the system. In our simulations we sample a wide range of orbital and physical properties of the planets. We find that in general $40-80\%$ of the planets are ejected from the system depending on the number of planets initially in the system. Most of the planets are ejected over a timescale of $\sim 10^8-10^9$ years. The ejected planets have a mean excess velocity in the range of 2-6 km/sec with respect to the host star. The excess velocities of the planets ejected from the system strongly depends on the semi-major axis of the inner most planet. We find that irrespective of their initial location in the planetary system, all planets are equally likely to be ejected from the system. Also, bound and ejected planets have distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive than ejected planets. In addition, increasing the radii of the planets reduces the ejection fraction. The properties of the ejected planets do not strongly depend on the initial spacing between the planets. The timescale over which ejections happen does increase with the initial separation between the planets. We also find that the ejection fraction does not strongly depend on the distance from the host star beyond which the planets are considered unbound. Finally, we compared our results with observed populations of free floating planets. We conclude that on average 5-10 planets should form around each star to reproduce the observations.

          Global Turbulent Solar Convection: a Numerical Path Investigating Key Force Balances in the context of the Convective Conundrum

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding solar turbulent convection and its influence on differential rotation has been a challenge over the past two decades. Current models often overestimate giant convection cells amplitude, leading to an effective Rossby number too large and a shift towards an anti-solar rotation regime. This Convective Conundrum, underscores the need for improved comprehension of solar convective dynamics. We propose a numerical experiment in the parameter space that controls $Ro$ while increasing the Reynolds number ($Re$) and maintaining solar parameters. By controlling the Nusselt number ($Nu$), we limit the energy transport by convection while reducing viscous dissipation. This approach enabled us to construct a Sun-like rotating model (SBR97n035) with strong turbulence ($Re \sim 800$) that exhibits prograde equatorial rotation and aligns with observational data from helioseismology. We compare this model with an anti-solar rotating counterpart, and provide an in-depth spectral analysis to investigate the changes in convective dynamics. We also find the appearance of vorticity rings near the poles, which existence on the Sun could be probed in the future. The Sun-like model shows reduced buoyancy over the spectrum, as well as an extended quasi-geostrophic equilibrium towards smaller scales. This promotes a Coriolis-Inertia (CI) balance rather than a Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedes (CIA) balance, in order to favor the establishment of a prograde equator. The presence of convective columns in the bulk of the convection zone, with limited surface manifestations, also hints at such structures potentially occurring in the Sun.

          Non-equilibrium ionization in the multiphase circumgalactic medium -- impact on quasar absorption-line analyses

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an updated framework for studying the ionizing conditions and elemental abundances of photoionized, metal-enriched quasar absorption systems. The standard assumption of ionization equilibrium invoked in absorption line analyses requires gas to cool on longer timescales than ionic recombination (t_cool >> t_rec). However, this assumption may not be valid at high metallicities due to enhanced cooling losses. This work presents a suite of time-dependent photoionization (TDP) models that self-consistently solve for the ionization state of rapidly cooling gas irradiated by the extragalactic ultraviolet background (UVB). The updated framework explores various revised UVBs from recent studies, a range of initial temperatures, and different elemental abundance patterns to quantify the effects of TDP on the observed ion fractions. A metal-enriched ($\mathrm{[\alpha/H]}=0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$) C IV absorption system at z ~ 1 previously studied using photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models is re-examined under the TDP framework. The main findings are as follows: (1) varying prescriptions for the underlying UVB or adopting initial temperatures T_0 < 1e6 K change TDP ion fractions by up to a factor of three, but the adopted relative elemental abundance pattern affects ion fractions by at most 40%; (2) the inferred gas densities are consistent between PIE and TDP, but under TDP solar metallicity cannot be ruled out at more than 2-$\sigma$ significance and a modest non-solar $\mathrm{[C/\alpha]} = 0.2$ is needed to explain the observed relative ion abundances. Extending the TDP analyses to a larger sample of super-solar absorption components with high signal-to-noise absorption spectra is needed to quantify the fraction of metal absorbers originating in rapid cooling gas.

          Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.

          A Detailed Look at a Trio of Changing-Look Quasars: Spectral Energy Distributions and the Dust Extinction Test

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look quasars exhibit dramatic variability in broad emission-line fluxes on short timescales. This behavior is challenging to many models of the quasar broad line region, due in large part to the short transition times between high and low states. In order to constrain the cause of the dramatic variability, we obtained contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope UV and Hobby Eberly Telescope optical spectra of three changing-look quasars caught in their low state. We use these spectra, along with archival spectra taken during both the high and low states, to investigate potential scenarios for the change in state. Our data strongly disfavor a variable dust obscuration scenario for these three CLQs, and instead suggest that the observed transformation reflects a change in the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine. We also find that the low-state spectral energy distributions of all three quasars are reminiscent of those of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which suggests that the transition may result from a change in accretion flow structure caused by a reduced Eddington ratio.

          Resolution Dependence of Cloud-Wind Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Using a set of wind-tunnel simulations, we investigate the effect that numerical resolution has on cloud evolution and acceleration. We also consider the role of wind speed in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes, using adiabatic simulations with wind speeds of 100 km/s and 1000 km/s, respectively. For each setup, we explore five numerical resolutions. We find that the fate of the cloud is significantly affected by the resolution, but the trend is surprisingly non-monotonic. In the subsonic case, we find that a resolution of 16 cells per cloud radius is a turning point in the cloud evolution. In the supersonic case the trend is more monotonic, consistent with the difference in timescales for which ram pressure acceleration dominates over mixing in the early acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider DHOST inflationary models with a shift symmetry leading to a de Sitter space-time at the background cosmological level. Deviations from scale invariance of the scalar and tensor perturbations follow from the breaking of the shift symmetry by quadratic and quartic operators. These models show a strong violation of the consistency relation of single-field inflationary models with a very flat spectrum of tensor perturbations. This opens up the prospects of future detection of primordial gravitational waves by mHz experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets dominate the mass of many planetary systems, including the Solar System, and represent the best-characterized class of extrasolar planets. Understanding the formation of giant planets bridges the high mass end of the planet formation process and the low mass end of processes that produce stellar and brown dwarf companions. This review examines the latest evidence supporting the formation of Solar System giant planets and most extrasolar giant planets by core accretion. Key elements of this theory and recent advances are discussed, along with the role of gravitational fragmentation of gas disks -- a mechanism more likely to produce brown dwarfs and/or similarly massive binary companions.

 - **Abstract**
 The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.

          The BVRcIc sky brightness of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of MSU

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we analyse the measurements of the brightness of the night sky above the CMO SAI MSU in the visible and near-infrared range made in 2019-2014. In 2023-2024 the median zenith brightness of the moonless night sky was 21.31 mag in the B band, 20.63 mag in the V band, 20.15 mag in the Rc band, and 19.11 mag in the Ic band. In 5 years the sky brightness had increased by 0.7 mag in B and V, by 0.45 mag in Rc, and ~0.1 mag in Ic. We found that the brightness growth is mostly (up to ~85%) due to the increasing light pollution from nearby cities, while the remainder can be attributed to the increase of solar activity after the 2019 minimum. We discuss how the sky brightness is influenced by such factors as the airmass and the location of the Sun and the Moon in the sky. A qualitative analysis of the sky emission spectrum has demonstrated the growing role of LED lamps in light pollution. These changes in sky brightness which are only going to get harder favour observations that are less sensitive to the degree of light pollution - IR photometry and spectroscopy and high-resolution optical spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Lanthanides play most important roles in the opacities for kilonova, ultraviolet-optical-infrared emission from neutron star mergers. Although several efforts have been made to construct atomic data, the accuracy in the opacity is not fully assessed and understood. In this paper, we perform atomic calculations for singly ionized lanthanides with improved strategies, aiming at understanding the physics of the lanthanide opacities in kilonova ejecta and necessary accuracy in atomic data. Our results show systematically lower energy level distributions as compared with our previous study (Paper I). As a result, the opacities evaluated with our new results are higher by a factor of up to 3 - 10, depending on the element and wavelength range. For a lanthanide-rich element mixture, our results give a higher opacity than that in Paper I by a factor of about 1.5. We also present opacities by using the results of ab-initio atomic calculations by using Grasp2K code. In general, our new opacities show good agreements with those with ab-initio calculations. We identify that structure of the lanthanide opacities are controlled by transition arrays among several configurations, for which derivation of accurate energy level distribution is important to obtain reliable opacities.

          Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters: Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to study their detectability. Furthermore, we model the Brownian motion of the IMRIs induced by weak interactions with the surrounding field of stars and include its effect on the GW's phase through Doppler and aberrational phase shift. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($<10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected by TianQin, LISA, and AION. However, for all sources detected the SNR is high enough to discern the Brownian motion of the IMRI. More precisely, we find that the match between the signal containing the effect of the Brownian motion and a waveform model without this effect is in most cases low ($<0.5$). These results highlight the importance of including the interaction of IMRIs with the surrounding field of stars to obtain proper detection but also show the possibility of studying the environment of the source using GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are often referred to as the most luminous explosions in the Universe, due to their short and highly luminous prompt emission. This apparent luminosity, however, does not reflect the true energy budget of the prompt emission, which is strongly beamed. Accurate estimations of the energy radiated during the prompt phase require taking into account the geometry of GRB jets, which remains poorly known. Nevertheless, one may establish the distribution of well measured quantities, like Eiso, the GRB isotropic equivalent energy, which encrypts crucial information about GRB jets, with the aim of providing constraints on the jets radiated energy. In this work, we study the bright end of the GRB isotropic equivalent energy distribution (hereafter called "apparent energy"), using an updated sample of 185 apparently energetic GRBs with Eiso $\geq 10^{53}$ erg. This new sample includes GRB 221009A, allowing to discuss this apparently super-energetic GRB in the context of the general Eiso distribution of long GRBs. We describe the construction of the sample and compare fits of the Eiso distribution with a simple power law, a cutoff power law and a broken power law. Our study confirms the existence of a cutoff around Eiso = $4\times10^{54}$ erg, even when GRB 221009A is included in the sample. Based on this finding, we discuss the possible reasons behind the rapid decrease of the number of apparently energetic gamma-ray bursts beyond Eiso = $4\times10^{54}$ erg and the interpretation of GRB 221009A, the most apparently energetic GRB detected to date, in this context.

          What is Inside the Double-Double Structure of the Radio Galaxy J0028+0035?

 - **Abstract**
 The radio source J0028+0035 is a recently discovered double--double radio galaxy at redshift z=0.398. Its relic outer lobes are separated by about 3' in the sky, corresponding to ~1 Mpc projected linear size. Inside this large-scale structure, the inner pair of collinear lobes span about 100 kpc. In the arcsec-resolution radio images of J0028+0035, there is a central radio feature that offers the intriguing possibility of being resolved into a pc-scale, third pair of innermost lobes. This would make this radio galaxy a rare triple-double source where traces of three distinct episodes of radio activity could be observed. To reveal the compact radio structure of the central component, we conducted observation with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer Network and the enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network. Our 1.66 GHz image with high (~5 milliarcsec) resolution shows a compact central radio core with no indication of a third, innermost double feature. The observation performed in multi-phase-centre mode also revealed that the physically unrelated but in projection closely separated background source 5BZU J0028+0035 has a single weak, somewhat resolved radio feature, at odds with its blazar classification.

 - **Abstract**
 AU Mic is a very active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk and two transiting sub-Neptunes with a possible third planetary companion. The two transiting planets exhibit significant transit-timing variations (TTVs) that are caused by the gravitational interaction between the bodies in the system. Using photometrical observations taken with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), our goal is to constrain the planetary radii, the orbital distances and periods of AU Mic b and c. We aim to determine the superperiod of the TTVs for AU Mic b and to update the transit ephemeris for both planets. Based on the observed TTVs, we study the possible presence of a third planet in the system. We conducted high precision photometric observations with CHEOPS in 2022 and 2023. We used Allesfitter to fit the planetary transits and to constrain the planetary and orbital parameters. We combined our new measurements with results from previous years to determine the periods and amplitudes of the TTVs. We applied dynamical modelling based on TTV measurements from the 2018-2023 period to reconstruct the perceived variations. The orbital distances and periods for AU Mic b and c agree with the results from previous works. However, the values for the planetary radii deviate slightly from previous values, which we attribute to the effect of stellar spots. AU Mic c showed very strong TTVs, with transits that occurred ~80 minutes later in 2023 than in 2021. Through dynamical analysis of the system, we found that the observed TTVs can be explained by a third planet with an orbital period of ~12.6 days and a mass of 0.203+0.022-0.024 M_E. We explored the orbital geometry of the system and found that AU Mic c has a misaligned retrograde orbit. Due limited number of observations the exact configuration and planetary parameters could not be determined. Further monitoring with CHEOPS may improve these results.

 - **Abstract**
 There is evidence for interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and massive circumstellar material (CSM) in various types of SNe. The mass-ejection mechanisms that produce massive CSM are unclear, and studying interacting SNe and their CSM can shed light on these mechanisms and the final stages of stellar evolution. We aim to study the properties of the CSM in the bright, long-lived, hydrogen-rich (Type II) SN 2021irp, which is interacting with a massive aspherical CSM. We present imaging- and spectro-polarimetric observations of SN 2021irp. By modelling its polarisation and bolometric light curve, we derive the mass and distribution of the CSM. SN 2021irp shows a high intrinsic polarisation of $\sim0.8$%. This high continuum polarisation suggests an aspherical photosphere created by an aspherical CSM interaction. Based on the bolometric light curve evolution and the high polarization, SN 2021irp can be explained as a typical Type II SN interacting with a CSM disk with a corresponding mass-loss rate and half-opening angle of $\sim0.035$ - $0.1$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim30$ - $50^{\circ}$, respectively. The total CSM mass derived is $\gtrsim 2$ M$_{\odot}$. We suggest that this CSM disk was created by some process related to binary interaction, and that SN 2021irp is the end product of a typical massive star (i.e. with Zero-Age-Main-Sequence mass of $\sim 8-18$ M$_{\odot}$) that has a separation and/or mass ratio with its companion star that led to an extreme mass ejection within decades of explosion. Based on the observational properties of SN 2021irp and similar SNe, we propose a general picture for the spectroscopic properties of Type II SNe interacting with a massive disk CSM.

 - **Abstract**
 The {\it TESS} periodograms of the SALT survey catalogue of hydrogen-deficient stars were searched for evidence of short-period variability. Periodic light curve variations were identified in 16 stars out of 153 catalogue objects, of which 10 were false positives. From the remaining 6 identified variables, Ton S 415 is a known close binary system and the sixth close binary containing a hydrogen-deficient hot subdwarf. Radial velocity and SED analyses ruled out the remaining 5 as close binary systems; the causes of their variability remain uncertain. With one or more K-type companions, BPS CS 22956-0094 may be a wide binary or triple. From this SALT+{\it TESS} sample, the fraction of close binaries stands at $ 1/29 \approx 3.5\%$ for intermediate helium hot subdwarfs and $0/124 = 0\%$ for extreme helium subdwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of pulsations in ultra-massive white dwarfs can help to probe their interiors and unveil their core composition and crystallized mass fraction through asteroseismic techniques. To date, the richest pulsating ultra-massive white dwarf known is BPM 37093 with 8 modes detected, for which detailed asteroseismic analysis has been performed in the past. In this work, we report the discovery of 19 pulsation modes in the ultra-massive white dwarf star WD~J0135+5722, making it the richest pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere ultramassive white dwarf known to date. %In this work, we report the discovery of pulsations in WD~J0135+5722, a hydrogen-rich ultra-massive white dwarf observed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. This object exhibits multi-periodic luminosity variations with periods ranging from 137 to 1345 s, typical of pulsating white dwarfs in the ZZ Ceti instability strip, which is centered at $T_{\rm eff} \sim 12\,000$ K. We estimate the stellar mass of WD J0135+5722 by different methods, resulting in $M_{\star} \sim 1.12-1.14 M_{\odot}$ if the star's core is made of oxygen and neon, or $M_{\star} \sim 1.14-1.15 M_{\odot}$ if the star hosts a carbon oxygen core. Future analysis of the star periods could shed light on the core chemical composition through asteroseismology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerically efficient and accurate implementation of the Passaglia-Hu effective fluid approximation for ultralight axions (ULAs) within the Boltzmann code CAMB. This method is specifically designed to evolve the axion field accurately across cosmological timescales, mitigating the challenges associated with its rapid oscillations. Our implementation is based on the latest version of CAMB, ensuring compatibility with other cosmological codes., e.g. for calculating cosmological parameter constraints. Compared to exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, our method achieves sub-percent accuracy in the CMB power spectrum across a broad range of axion masses, from $10^{-28}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-24}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses incorporating our implementation, and find improved constraints on the axion mass and abundance compared to previous, simpler fluid-based approximations. For example, using \Planck\ PR4 and DESI BAO data, we find $2\sigma$ upper limits on the axion fraction $f_{\rm ax} < 0.0082$ and physical density $\Omega_{\rm ax}h^2 < 0.0010$ for $m=10^{-28}$ eV. The code is publicly available at \url{this https URL}.

          Estimating the Poynting flux of Alfv\'enic waves in polar coronal holes across Solar Cycle 24

 - **Abstract**
 Alfvénic waves are known to be prevalent throughout the corona and solar wind. Determining the Poynting flux supplied by the waves is required for constraining their role in plasma heating and acceleration, as well as providing a constraint for Alfvén wave driven models that aim to predict coronal and solar wind properties. Previous studies of the Alfvénic waves in polar coronal holes have been able to provide a measure of energy flux for arbitrary case studies. Here we build upon previous work and take a more systematic approach, examining if there is evidence for any variation in vertical Poynting flux over the course of the solar cycle. We use imaging data from SDO/AIA to measure the displacements of the fine-scale structure present in coronal holes. It is found that the measure for vertical Poynting flux is broadly similar over the solar cycle, implying a consistent contribution from waves to the energy budget of the solar wind. There is variation in energy flux across the measurements (around 30\%), but this is suggested to be due to differences in the individual coronal holes rather than a feature of the solar cycle. Our direct estimates are in agreement with recent studies by \cite{Huang_2023,Huang2024} who constrain the vertical Poynting flux through comparison of predicted wind properties from Alfvénic wave driven turbulence models to those observed with OMNI at 1~AU. Taken together, both sets of results points towards a lack of correlation between the coronal Poynting flux from waves and the solar cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics, but gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit. This approach provides a unified framework for both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, enhancing theoretical predictions and observational signatures of early universe physics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we discuss a scenario of a micro-Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) associated with high-speed white dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. It happens at galactic centers, where a white dwarf orbiting around the massive black hole scatters with a stellar-mass black hole in its early extreme mass-ratio inspiral stage. We estimate the formation rate, perform a series of hydro simulations to investigate the amount of accreted and unbound mass as a function of impact radius and speed, and discuss the main EM signatures: an X-ray flare (micro-TDE) followed by a relatively faint (TDE-type) optical flare. The properties of some of the transient X-ray bursts found by Einstein Probe are consistent with the micro-TDE scenario considered here.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the global linear theory of the vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary discs with an imposed radial temperature gradient. We focus on the regime in which the VSI has the form of a travelling inertial wave that grows in amplitude as it propagates outwards. Building on previous work describing travelling waves in thin astrophysical discs, we develop a quantitative theory of the wave motion, its spatial structure and the physical mechanism by which the wave is amplified. We find that this viewpoint provides a useful description of the large-scale development of the VSI in global numerical simulations, which involves corrugation and breathing motions of the disc. We contrast this behaviour with that of perturbations of smaller scale, in which the VSI grows into a nonlinear regime in place without significant radial propagation.

 (Abridged) Massive stellar embryos are embedded in warm envelopes that provide mass reservoirs for the accretion process onto final stars. Feedback from star formation activities in return impacts the properties of the envelopes, offering us a unique opportunity to investigate star formation processes. We aim to characterise the warm envelopes of proto- or young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages based on the morphology and kinematics of the $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission and to examine their relations with star formation processes. Using the APEX telescope, we obtained maps of the mid-$J$ $^{13}$CO emission with an angular size of 80" x 80" towards 99 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Our maps are classified based on morphological complexities, and the radial structure of the emission is characterised for simple single-core sources. The velocity centroids of the emission are compared to small- and large-scale gas kinematics, aiming to shed light on the origin of envelope kinematics. $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is detected towards sources in all stages of high-mass star formation, with a detection rate of 83% for the whole sample. The detection rate, line width, and line peak increase with evolution, and the line luminosity is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{clump}}$, indicating that the excitation of $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is closely related to star formation processes. In addition, the radial distributions of the emission for single-core sources can be well fitted by power-law functions, suggesting a relatively simple envelope structure for many sources. As for the envelope kinematics, linear velocity gradients are common among the single-core sources. Our comparison of kinematics on different scales suggests that the origin of the linear velocity gradients in the warm envelopes is complex and unclear for many sources.

 - **Abstract**
 IRAS source 19312+1950 (hereafter I19312) is an infrared point source with maser emissions of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH molecules. Although initial observations suggested that I19312 might be an evolved star, its characteristics are not fully consistent with this classification. This study aims to further investigate the nature of I19312 by conducting long-term monitoring of its maser emissions and comparing the results with other known astrophysical objects. We conducted long-term monitoring of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH maser emissions using single-dish radio telescopes. The results were then compared with historical maser data and the characteristics of similar objects to infer the possible origin of I19312. The SiO maser emissions from I19312 were detected over a wide velocity range and exhibited significant time variability. The OH maser lines suggest characteristics of an evolved star, while the H$_2$O maser lines indicate molecular outflows. These features suggest that I19312 could be a candidate for a Water Fountain (WF) star, though there are inconsistencies, such as the large molecular gas mass, that challenge this hypothesis. The possibility of I19312 being a Red Nova Remnant (RNR) is also considered, but this remains speculative due to the lack of direct evidence. The evolutionary stage of I19312 remains unclear, but it shares multiple characteristics with both evolved stars with peculiar properties and RNRs. Further long-term monitoring and high-resolution interferometric observations are required to better constrain the nature of this object.

 - **Abstract**
 We present compelling evidence that Dark Matter (DM)-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing (WL) surveys and leveraging an emulator based on true $N$-body simulations to account for nonlinear corrections, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with DES Y3 cosmic shear data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ detection of non-zero DM-neutrino interactions, marking a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure exoplanet occurrence rate as a function of isochrone and gyrochronology ages using confirmed and candidate planets identified in Q1-17 DR25 Kepler data. We employ Kepler's pipeline detection efficiency to correct for the expected number of planets in each age bin. We examine the occurrence rates for planets with radii $0.2 \leq Rp \leq 20$ R$_\oplus$ and orbital periods $0.2 \leq P \leq 100$ days for FGK stars with ages between $1.5-8$ Gyr using the inverse detection efficiency method. We find no significant trend between occurrence rate and stellar ages; a slight, decreasing trend (within $1.5-2.5$ $\sigma$) only emerges for low-mass and metal-rich stars that dominate our sample. We isolate the effects of mass and metallicity on the occurrence rate trend with age, but find the results to be inconclusive due to weak trends and small sample size. Our results hint that the exoplanet occurrence rate may decrease over time due to dynamical instability from planet-planet scattering or planet ejection, but accurate ages and larger sample sizes are needed to resolve a clear relation between occurrence rate and age.

          Inflaton Self Resonance, Oscillons, and Gravitational Waves in Small Field Polynomial Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the post-inflationary dynamics of a simple single-field model with a renormalizable inflaton potential featuring a near-inflection point at a field value $\phi_0$. Due to the concave shape of the scalar potential, the effective mass of the inflaton becomes imaginary during as well as for some period after slow-roll inflation. As a result, in the initial reheating phase, where the inflaton oscillates around its minimum with a large amplitude, some field fluctuations grow exponentially; this effect becomes stronger at smaller $\phi_0$. This aspect can be analyzed using the Floquet theorem. We also analytically estimate the backreaction time after which the perturbations affect the evolution of the average inflaton field. In order to fully analyze this non-perturbative regime, we perform a (classical) lattice simulation, which reveals that the exponential growth of field fluctuations can fragment the system. This leads to a large amount of non-Gaussianity at very small scales, but the equation of state remains close to matter-like. The evolution of the background field throughout the fragmentation phase can be understood using the Hartree approximation. For sufficiently small $\phi_0$ soliton-like objects, called oscillons in the literature, are formed. This leads to areas with high local over-density, $\delta \rho \gg \bar\rho$ where $\bar\rho$ is the average energy density. We speculate that this could lead to the formation of light primordial black holes, with lifetime $\gtrsim 10^{-19} \text{sec}$. Other possibly observational consequences, in particular gravitational waves in the $\text{MHz} - \text{GHz}$ range, are discussed as well. Although a complete analytical study is difficult in our case, we obtain a power law scaling for the potential observables on $\phi_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to explain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 21 pc (48') resolution. Of the 30 deg^2 surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273alpha emission from 24 deg^2 and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs. The morphology of the C273alpha emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission and likely transitioning from HI-to-H_2. The typical angular separation of C273alpha and 13CO emission is 12 pc, and we estimate C273alpha gas densities of n_H ~ 40 - 400 cm^3. The C273alpha line profiles are Gaussian and likely turbulent broadened, spanning a large range of FWHM from 2 to 20 km/s with a median of 10.6 km/s. Mach numbers fall within 10--30. The turbulent timescale is relatively short, 2.6 Myr, and we deduce that the turbulent pressure likely dominates the evolution of the C273alpha gas. Velocity offsets between C273alpha and 13CO components are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km/s. Two regimes have emerged from the data: one regime in which C273alpha and 13CO are strongly related (at N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2), and a second, in which C273alpha emits independently of the 13CO intensity. In the former regime, C273alpha may arise from the the envelopes of massive clouds (filaments), and in the latter, C273alpha emits from cold clumps in a more-diffuse mix of HI and H_2 gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB), the relic radiation from the early Universe, offers a unique window into both primordial conditions and the intervening large-scale structure (LSS) it traverses. Interactions between CMB photons and the evolving Universe imprint secondary anisotropies -- modifications to the CMB's intensity and polarization caused by gravitational effects and scattering processes. These anisotropies serve as a powerful probe of fundamental physics while also revealing astrophysical processes governing the thermodynamics and distribution of baryonic matter. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the physical mechanisms underlying secondary anisotropies, their observational status, and their potential to advance precision cosmology. With the increasing sensitivity of CMB experiments and synergy with LSS surveys, secondary anisotropies are poised to unveil unprecedented insights into the Universe's composition, evolution, and dynamics.

 We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $>8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $>4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.

We compute the tidal evolution for binaries as their primary stars evolve along the red giant branch, under dissipation of dynamical tides in the convective envelope. We then compare this evolution with a sample of $\sim30,000$ red giant binaries reported by Gaia DR3. These binaries clearly show the expected gradual advance of tidal circularization, as the primary expands. But some tension with theory remains. While our calculations always predict a critical separation for tidal circularization at about $3-4$ times the stellar radii, binaries with less evolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far. They also exhibit an overly extended `cool island', a collection of circular orbits that reach a couple times beyond the circularization limit. These discrepancies are reminiscent of, but less severe than, the situation for main-sequence binaries. We also find that tides can spin giant stars up to rotation rates that should affect their mass-loss. Additionally, many binaries may begin mass transfer while still eccentric.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for potential ``birthmarks'' left from the formation of filamentary molecular clouds in the Ophiuchus complex. We use high dynamic-range column density and temperature maps derived from \textit{Herschel}, \textit{Planck}, and \textit{2MASS/NICEST} extinction data. We find two distinct types of filaments based on their orientation relative to nearby massive stars: radial (R-type) and tangential (T-type). R-type filaments exhibit decreasing mass profiles away from massive stars, while T-type filaments show flat but structured profiles. We propose a scenario where both filament types originate from the dynamic interplay of compression and stretching forces exerted by a fast outflow emanating from the OB association. The two formation mechanisms leave distinct observable ``birthmarks'' (namely, filament orientation, mass distribution, and star formation location) on each filament type. Our results illustrate a complex phase in molecular cloud evolution with two simultaneous yet contrasting processes: the formation of filaments and stars via the dispersal of residual gas from a previous massive star formation event. Our approach highlights the importance of taking into account the wider context of a star-forming complex, rather than concentrating exclusively on particular subregions.
