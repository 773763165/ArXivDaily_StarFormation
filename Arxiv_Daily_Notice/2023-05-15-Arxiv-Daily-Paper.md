 - **Abstract**
 Stars in the Galactic disc, including the Solar system, have deviated from their birth orbits and have experienced radial mixing and vertical heating. By performing hydrodynamical simulations of a galactic disc, we investigate how much tracer particles, which are initially located in the disc to mimic newborn stars and the thin and thick disc stars, are displaced from initial near-circular orbits by gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). To exclude the influence of other perturbers that can change the stellar orbits, such as spiral arms and the bar, we use an axisymmetric form for the entire galactic potential. First, we investigate the time evolution of the radial and vertical velocity dispersion $\sigma_R$ and $\sigma_z$ by comparing them with a power law relation of $\sigma \propto t^{\beta}$. Although the exponents $\beta$ decrease with time, they keep large values of 0.3 $\sim$ 0.6 for 1 Gyr, indicating fast and efficient disc heating. Next, we find that the efficient stellar scattering by GMCs also causes a change in angular momentum for each star and, therefore, radial migration. This effect is more pronounced in newborn stars than old disc stars; nearly 30 per cent of stars initially located on the galactic mid-plane move more than 1 kpc in the radial direction for 1 Gyr. The dynamical heating and radial migration drastically occur in the first several hundred Myr. As the amplitude of the vertical oscillation increases, the time spent in the galactic plane, where most GMCs are distributed, decreases, and the rate of an increase in the heating and migration slows down.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the H$_2$ column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) based on molecular emission lines using the Nobeyama 45-m Cygnus X CO survey data. Using the DENDROGRAM and SCIMES algorithms, we identified 124 molecular clouds in the $^{13}$CO data. From these identified molecular clouds, an N-PDF was constructed for 11 molecular clouds with an extent of more than 0.4 deg$^2$. From the fitting of the N-PDF, we found that the N-PDF could be well-fitted with one or two log-normal distributions. These fitting results provided an alternative density structure for molecular clouds from a conventional picture. We investigated the column density, dense molecular cloud cores, and radio continuum source distributions in each cloud and found that the N-PDF shape was less correlated with the star-forming activity over a whole cloud. Furthermore, we found that the log-normal N-PDF parameters obtained from the fitting showed two impressive features. First, the log-normal distribution at the low-density part had the same mean column density ($\sim$ 10$^{21.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) for almost all the molecular clouds. Second, the width of the log-normal distribution tended to decrease with an increasing mean density of the structures. These correlations suggest that the shape of the N-PDF reflects the relationship between the density and turbulent structure of the whole molecular cloud but is less affected by star-forming activities.
#### First detection of deuterated methylidyne (CD) in the interstellar  medium

 - **Abstract**
 While the abundance of elemental deuterium is relatively low (D/H ~ a few 1E-5), orders of magnitude higher D/H abundance ratios have been found for many interstellar molecules, enhanced by deuterium fractionation. In cold molecular clouds (T < 20K) deuterium fractionation is driven by the H2D+ ion, whereas at higher temperatures (T > 20-30K) gas-phase deuteration is controlled by reactions with CH2D+ and C2HD+. While the role of H2D+ in driving cold interstellar deuterium chemistry is well understood, thanks to observational constraints from direct measurements of H2D+, deuteration stemming from CH2D+ is far less understood, caused by the absence of direct observational constraints of its key ions. Therefore, making use of chemical surrogates is imperative for exploring deuterium chemistry at intermediate temperatures. Formed at an early stage of ion-molecule chemistry, directly from the dissociative recombination of CH3+ (CH2D+), CH (CD) is an ideal tracer for investigating deuterium substitution initiated by reactions with CH2D+. This paper reports the first detection of CD in the interstellar medium, carried out using the APEX 12m telescope toward the widely studied low-mass protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. Gas-phase chemical models reproducing the observed CD/CH abundance ratio of 0.016 suggests that it reflects `warm deuterium chemistry' (which ensues in moderately warm conditions of the interstellar medium) and illustrates the potential use of the CD/CH ratio in constraining the gas temperatures of the envelope gas clouds it probes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun and other solar-type stars have magnetic fields that permeate their interior and surface, extends through the interplanetary medium, and is the main driver of stellar activity. Stellar magnetic activity affects physical processes and conditions of the interplanetary medium and orbiting planets. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most impacting of these phenomena in near-Earth space weather, and consist of plasma clouds, with magnetic field, ejected from the solar corona. Precisely predicting the trajectory of CMEs is crucial in determining whether a CME will hit a planet and impact its magnetosphere and atmosphere. Despite the rapid developments in the search for stellar CMEs, their detection is still very incipient. In this work we aim to better understand the propagation of CMEs by analysing the influence of initial parameters on CME trajectories, such as position, velocities, and stellar magnetic field's configuration. We reconstruct magnetograms for Kepler-63 (KIC 11554435) and Kepler-411 (KIC 11551692) from spot transit mapping, and use a CME deflection model, ForeCAT, to simulate trajectories of hypothetical CMEs launched into the interplanetary medium from Kepler-63 and Kepler-411. We apply the same methodology to the Sun, for comparison. Our results show that in general, deflections and rotations of CMEs decrease with their radial velocity, and increase with ejection latitude. Moreover, magnetic fields stronger than the Sun's, such as Kepler-63's, tend to cause greater CME deflections.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Filamentary structures in the interstellar medium are closely related to star formation. Dense gas mass fraction (DGMF) or clump formation efficiency in large-scale filaments possibly determine their hosting star formation activities. Aims. We aim to automatically identify large-scale filaments, characterize them, investigate their association with Galactic structures, and study their DGMFs. Methods. We use a modified minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm to chain parsec-scale 13CO clumps previously extracted from the SEDIGISM (Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic InterStellar Medium) survey. The MST connects nodes in a graph such that the sum of edge lengths is minimum. Modified MST also ensures velocity coherence between nodes, so the identified filaments are coherent in position-position-velocity (PPV) space. Results. We generate a catalog of 88 large-scale ($>10pc$) filaments in the inner Galactic plane (with $-60^\circ < l < 18^\circ and $|b| < 0.5^\circ$). These SEDIGISM filaments are larger and less dense than MST filaments previously identified from the BGPS and ATLASGAL surveys. We find that eight of the filaments run along spiral arms and can be regarded as "bones" of the Milky Way. We also find three bones associated with the Local Spur in PPV space. By compiling 168 large-scale filaments with available DGMF across the Galaxy, an order of magnitude more than previously investigated, we find that DGMFs do not correlate with Galactic location, but bones have higher DGMFs than other filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) inject $\sim 10^{51}$ erg in the interstellar medium, thereby shocking and heating the gas. A substantial fraction of this energy is later lost via radiative cooling. We present a post-processing module for the FLASH code to calculate the cooling radiation from shock-heated gas using collisional excitation data from MAPPINGS V. When applying this tool to a simulated SN remnant (SNR), we find that most energy is emitted in the EUV. However, optical emission lines ($[$O III$]$, $[$N II$]$, $[$S II$]$, H${\alpha}$, H${\beta}$) are usually best observable. Our shock detection scheme shows that [S II] and [N II] emissions arise from the thin shell surrounding the SNR, while [O III], H$\rm \alpha$, and H$\rm \beta$ originate from the volume-filling hot gas inside the SNR bubble. We find that the optical emission lines are affected by the SNR's complex structure and its projection onto the plane of the sky because the escaping line luminosity can be reduced by 10 -- 80\% due to absorption along the line-of-sight. Additionally, the subtraction of contaminating background radiation is required for the correct classification of an SNR on the oxygen or sulphur BPT diagrams. The electron temperature and density obtained from our synthetic observations match well with the simulation but are very sensitive to the assumed metallicity.
