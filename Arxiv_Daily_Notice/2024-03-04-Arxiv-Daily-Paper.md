#### Dynamics and potential origins of decimeter-sized particles around comet  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko

 - **Abstract**
 Methods. We algorithmically tracked thousands of individual particles through four OSIRIS/NAC image sequences of 67P's near-nucleus coma. We then traced concentrated particle groups back to the nucleus surface, and estimated their potential source regions, size distributions, and projected dynamical parameters. Finally, we compared the observed activity to dust coma simulations. Results. We traced back 409 decimeter-sized particles to four suspected source regions. The regions strongly overlap and are mostly confined to the Khonsu-Atum-Anubis area. The activity may be linked to rugged terrain, and the erosion of fine dust and the ejection of large boulders may be mutually exclusive. Power-law indices fitted to the particle size--frequency distributions range from $3.4 \pm 0.3$ to $3.8 \pm 0.4$. Gas drag fits to the radial particle accelerations provide an estimate for the local gas production rates ($Q_\text{g} = 3.6 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$), which is several times higher than our model predictions based on purely insolation-driven water ice sublimation. Our observational results and our modeling results both reveal that our particles were likely ejected with substantial nonzero initial velocities of around 0.5$-$0.6 m s$^{-1}$. Conclusions. Our findings strongly suggest that the observed ejection of decimeter-sized particles cannot be explained by water ice sublimation and favorable illumination conditions alone. Instead, the local structures and compositions of the source regions likely play a major role. In line with current ejection models of decimeter-sized particles, we deem an overabundance of CO$_2$ ice and its sublimation to be the most probable driver. In addition, because of the significant initial velocities, we suspect the ejection events to be considerably more energetic than gradual liftoffs.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of radio emission in different populations of radio-quiet quasars is relatively unknown, but recent work has uncovered various drivers of increased radio-detection fraction. In this work, we pull together three known factors: optical colour ($g-i$), \CIV Distance (a proxy for $L/L_{Edd}$) and whether or not the quasar contains broad absorption lines (BALQSOs) which signify an outflow. We use SDSS DR14 spectra along with the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 and find that each of these properties have an independent effect. BALQSOs are marginally more likely to be radio-detected than non-BALQSOs at similar colours and $L/L_{Edd}$, moderate reddening significantly increases the radio-detection fraction and the radio-detection increases with $L/L_{Edd}$ above a threshold for all populations. We test a widely used simple model for radio wind shock emission and calculate energetic efficiencies that would be required to reproduce the observed radio properties. We discuss interpretations of these results concerning radio-quiet quasars more generally. We suggest that radio emission in BALQSOs is connected to a different physical origin than the general quasar population since they show different radio properties independent of colour and \CIV distance.

 - **Abstract**
 Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths can reveal a vast range of objects and phenomena that are either too cold, too distant, or too hot and energetic to be measured at visible wavelengths. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput submm single dish that can map statistically significant portions of the sky with sufficient surface brightness sensitivity and angular and spectral resolution to probe truly representative source populations. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the full design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU-funded project. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of submm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the mechanical structure and subsystems. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms. AtLAST will be capable of $3^\circ\,\rm s^{-1}$ scanning and $1^\circ\,\rm s^{-2}$ acceleration, and will feature a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m half wavefront error allowing observations up to $\approx 950$~GHz. Further, AtLAST will be a sustainable, visionary facility that will allow upgrades for decades to come. The demanding design requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, were met by combining novel concepts with lessons learned from past experience. While some aspects require further testing, prototyping, and field demonstrations, we estimate that the design will be construction-ready this decade.
#### The Role of a Neutron Component in the Photospheric Emission of  Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Jets

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), thought to be produced during core-collapse supernovae, may have a prominent neutron component in the outflow material. If present, neutrons can change how photons scatter in the outflow by reducing its opacity, thereby allowing the photons to decouple sooner than if there were no neutrons present. Understanding the details of this process could therefore allow us to probe the central engine of LGRBs, which is otherwise hidden. Here, we present results of the photospheric emission from an LGRB jet, using a combination of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer post-processing using the Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer (MCRaT) code. We control the size of the neutron component in the jet material by varying the equilibrium electron fraction $Y_{e}$, and we find that the presence of neutrons in the GRB fireball affects the Band parameters $\alpha$ and $E_{0}$, while the picture with the $\beta$ parameter is less clear. In particular, the break energy $E_{0}$ is shifted to higher energies. Additionally, we find that increasing the size of the neutron component also increases the total radiated energy of the outflow across multiple viewing angles. Our results not only shed light on LGRBs, but are also relevant to short-duration gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron star mergers, due to the likelihood of a prominent neutron component in such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments, the most prominent features of the cosmic web, possibly hold untapped potential for cosmological inference. While it is natural to expect the structure of filaments to show universality similar to that seen in dark matter halos, the lack of agreement between different filament finders on what constitutes a filament has hampered progress on this topic. We initiate a programme to systematically investigate and uncover possible universal features in the phase space structure of cosmic filaments, by generating particle realizations of mock filaments with $\textit{a priori}$ known properties. Using these, we identify an important source of bias in the extraction of radial density profiles, which occurs when the local curvature $\kappa$ of the spine exceeds a threshold determined by the filament thickness. This bias exists even for perfectly determined spines, thus affecting $\textit{all}$ filament finders. We show that this bias can be nearly eliminated by simply discarding the regions with the highest $\kappa$, with little loss of precision. An additional source of bias is the noise generated by the filament finder when identifying the spine, which depends on both the finder algorithm as well as intrinsic properties of the individual filament. We find that, to mitigate this bias, it is essential not only to smooth the estimated spine, but to $\textit{optimize}$ this smoothing separately for each filament. We propose a novel optimization based on minimizing the estimated filament thickness, along with Fourier space smoothing. We implement these techniques using two tools, $\texttt{FilGen}$ which generates mock filaments and $\texttt{FilAPT}$ which analyses and processes them. We expect these tools to be useful in calibrating the performance of filament finders, thereby enabling searches for filament universality.
#### QRIS: A Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System for the Pristine Sample  of Asteroid Bennu

 - **Abstract**
 The Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System (QRIS) is a laboratory-based spectral imaging system constructed to image the sample of asteroid Bennu delivered to Earth by the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft. The system was installed in the OSIRIS-REx cleanroom at NASA's Johnson Space Center to collect data during preliminary examination of the Bennu sample. QRIS uses a 12-bit machine vision camera to measure reflectance over wavelength bands spanning the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Raw data are processed by a calibration pipeline that generates a series of monochromatic, high-dynamic-range reflectance images, as well as band ratio maps, band depth maps, and 3-channel color images. The purpose of these spectral reflectance data is to help characterize lithologies in the sample and compare them to lithologies observed on Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. This initial assessment of lithological diversity was intended to help select the subsamples that will be used to address mission science questions about the early solar system and the origins of life and to provide important context for the selection of representative subsamples for preservation and distribution to international partners. When QRIS imaged the Bennu sample, unexpected calibration issues arose that had not been evident at imaging rehearsals and negatively impacted the quality of QRIS data. These issues were caused by stray light within the lens and reflections off the glovebox window and interior, and were exacerbated by the sample's extremely low reflectance. QRIS data were useful for confirming conclusions drawn from other data, but reflectance and spectral data from QRIS alone unfortunately have limited utility.

 - **Abstract**
 Icy moons with subsurface oceans of liquid water rank among the most promising astrobiological targets in our Solar System. In this work, we assess the feasibility of deploying laser sail technology in precursor life-detection missions. We investigate such laser sail missions to Enceladus and Europa, as these two moons emit plumes that seem accessible to in situ sampling. Our study suggests that GigaWatt laser technology could accelerate a $100$ kg probe to a speed of $\sim{30}\, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$, thereupon reaching Europa on timescales of $1$-$4$ years and Enceladus with flight times of $3$-$6$ years. Although the ideal latitudes for the laser array vary, placing the requisite infrastructure close to either the Antarctic or Arctic Circles might represent technically viable options for an Enceladus mission. Crucially, we determine that the minimum encounter velocities with these moons (about ${6}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) may be near-optimal for detecting biomolecular building blocks (e.g., amino acids) in the plumes by means of a mass spectrometer akin to the Surface Dust Analyzer onboard the \emph{Europa Clipper} mission. In summary, icy moons in the Solar System are potentially well-suited for exploration via the laser sail architecture approach, especially where low encounter speeds and/or multiple missions are desirable.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dark matter (DM) within neutron stars (NSs) can be introduced by different accumulation scenarios in which DM and baryonic matter (BM) may interact only through the gravitational force. In this work, we consider asymmetric self-interacting bosonic DM which can reside as a dense core inside the NS or form an extended halo around it. It is seen that depending on the boson mass ($m_{\chi}$), self-coupling constant ($\lambda$) and DM fraction ($F_{\chi}$), the maximum mass, radius and tidal deformability of NSs with DM admixture will be altered significantly. The impact of DM causes some modifications in the observable features induced solely by the BM component. Here, we focus on the widely used nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) called DD2 for describing NS matter. We show that by involving DM in NSs, the corresponding observational parameters will be changed to be consistent with the latest multi-messenger observations of NSs. It is seen that for $m_{\chi}\gtrsim200$ MeV and $\lambda\lesssim2\pi$, DM admixed NSs with $4\%\lesssim F_{\chi}\lesssim20\%$ are consistent with the maximum mass and tidal deformability constraints.
#### Small and Large Dust Cavities in Disks around mid-M Stars in Taurus

 - **Abstract**
 High-angular resolution imaging by ALMA has revealed the near-universality and diversity of substructures in protoplanetary disks. However, disks around M-type pre-main-sequence stars are still poorly sampled, despite the prevalence of M-dwarfs in the galaxy. Here we present high-resolution (~50 mas, 8 au) ALMA Band 6 observations of six disks around mid-M stars in Taurus. We detect dust continuum emission in all six disks, 12CO in five disks, and 13CO line in two disks. The size ratios between gas and dust disks range from 1.6 to 5.1. The ratio of about 5 for 2M0436 and 2M0450 indicates efficient dust radial drift. Four disks show rings and cavities and two disks are smooth. The cavity sizes occupy a wide range: 60 au for 2M0412, and ~10 au for 2M0434, 2M0436 and 2M0508. Detailed visibility modeling indicates that small cavities of 1.7 and 5.7 au may hide in the two smooth disks 2M0450 and CIDA 12. We perform radiative transfer fitting of the infrared SEDs to constrain the cavity sizes, finding that micron-sized dust grains may have smaller cavities than millimeter grains. Planet-disk interactions are the preferred explanation to produce the large 60 au cavity, while other physics could be responsible for the three ~10 au cavities under current observations and theories. Currently, disks around mid-to-late M stars in Taurus show a higher detection frequency of cavities than earlier type stars, although a more complete sample is needed to evaluate any dependence of substructure on stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamics of Langmuir modes - Langmuir waves (LW) and shear Langmuir vortices (SLV) - in kinematically complex astrophysical plasma flows is studied. It is found that they exhibit a number of peculiar, velocity shear induced, asymptotically persistent phenomena: efficient energy exchange with the background flow, various kinds of instabilities, leading to their exponential growth; echoing solutions with persistent wave-vortex-wave conversions. Remarkable similarity of these phenomena with ones happening with compressible acoustic modes, revealed in (Mahajan and Rogava 1999) is pointed out. The relevance and possible importance of these phenomena for different types of astrophysical plasma flow patterns with kinematic complexity is discussed. In particular, we argue that these physical processes may account for the persistent appearance of plasma oscillations in the heliosphere and in interstellar plasma flows. In particular, we believe that kinematically complex motion of plasma may naturally lead to asymptotically persistent appearance of Langmuir modes born, grown, fed, sustained and maintained by these flows.
#### Perturbed $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos: exploring cosmological  implications

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a thorough examination of cosmological parameters within the context of $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos, leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon supernova data. Our analysis unveils compelling constraints on pivotal parameters such as the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the interaction strength parameter ($\Gamma$), sound speed ($c_s$), Jean's wavenumbers ($k_J$), redshift of non-relativistic matter ($z_{\rm nr}$), and the redshift of the Deceleration-Acceleration phase transition ($z_{\rm DA}$). The incorporation of neutrinos within the $f(R)$ gravity framework emerges as a key factor significantly influencing cosmic evolution, intricately shaping the formation of large-scale structures and the dynamics of cosmic expansion. Additionally, a detailed analysis of bulk flow direction and amplitude across various redshifts provides valuable insights into the nature of large-scale structures. A notable aspect of our model is the nuanced integration of $f(R)$ gravity theory with neutrinos, representing a distinctive approach to unraveling cosmological phenomena. This framework, unlike previous models, explicitly considers the impact of neutrinos on gravitational interactions, the formation of large-scale structures, and the overarching dynamics of cosmic expansion within the $f(R)$ gravity paradigm. Furthermore, our study addresses the Hubble tension problem by comparing $H_0$ measurements within our model, offering a potential avenue for reconciling discrepancies. Our findings not only align with existing research but also contribute novel perspectives to our understanding of dark energy, gravitational interactions, and the intricate challenges posed by the Hubble tension.

 We propose a spectropolarimeter a covering wavelength range of 3200--7000 {\AA} [3200{\AA} chosen as lower limit to go to the atmospheric cut-off. It's ``needed" for some Serkowski curves and would make the instrument even more unique] for a 2-4~m class telescope. In this article, we discuss the science cases which will be covered with this proposed instrument. The technical requirements and analysis plan for each science case is also discussed. This spectropolarimeter targeting exciting galactic and extra-galactic research, will be unique instrument on a 2-4~m facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Many instruments for astroparticle physics are primarily geared towards multi-messenger astrophysics, to study the origin of cosmic rays (CR) and to understand high-energy astrophysical processes. Since these instruments observe the Universe at extreme energies and in kinematic ranges not accessible at accelerators these experiments provide also unique and complementary opportunities to search for particles and physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. In particular, the reach of IceCube, Fermi and KATRIN to search for and constrain Dark Matter, Axions, heavy Big Bang relics, sterile neutrinos and Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) will be discussed. The contents of this article are based on material presented at the Humboldt-Kolleg "Clues to a mysterious Universe - exploring the interface of particle, gravity and quantum physics" in June 2022.
#### Induced Gravitational Wave interpretation of PTA data: a complete study  for general equation of state

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18965
 - **Abstract**
 We thoroughly study the induced gravitational wave interpretation of the possible gravitational wave background reported by PTA collaborations, considering the unknown equation of state $w$ of the early universe. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the NANOGrav data using the publicly available \textsc{PTArcade} code together with \textsc{SIGWfast} for the numerical integration of the induced gravitational wave spectrum. We focus on two cases: a monochromatic and a log-normal primordial spectrum of fluctuations. For the log-normal spectrum, we show that, while the results are not very sensitive to $w$ when the GW peak is close to the PTA window, radiation domination is out of the $2\sigma$ contours when only the infra-red power-law tail contributes. For the monochromatic spectrum, the $2\sigma$ bounds yield $0.1\lesssim w\lesssim0.9$ so that radiation domination is close to the central value. We also investigate the primordial black hole (PBH) counterpart using the peak formalism. We show that, in general terms, a larger width and stiffer equation of state alleviates the overproduction of PBHs. No PBH overproduction requires $w\gtrsim0.42$ up to 2-$\sigma$ level for the monochromatic spectrum. Furthermore, including bounds from the cosmic microwave background, we find in general that the mass range of the PBH counterpart is bounded by $10^{-5} M_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{-1} M_\odot$. Lastly, we find that the PTA signal can explain the microlensing events reported by OGLE for $0.42\lesssim w\lesssim 0.50$. Our work showcases a complete treatment of induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes for general $w$ for future data analysis.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18967
 - **Abstract**
 The redshift $z_t$ and the jerk parameter $j_t$ of the transition epoch are constrained by using two model-independent approaches involving the direct expansion of the Hubble rate and the expansion of the deceleration parameter around $z=z_t$. To extend our analysis to high-redshifts, we employ the \emph{Amati}, \emph{Combo}, \emph{Yonetoku} and \emph{Dainotti} gamma-ray burst correlations. The \textit{circularity problem} is prevented by calibrating these correlations through the B\'ezier interpolation of the updated observational Hubble data. Each gamma-ray burst data set is jointly fit with type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations through a Monte Carlo analysis, based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to obtain $z_t$, $j_t$ and the correlation parameters. The overall results are compatible with the concordance model with some exceptions. We also focus on the behaviors of the dark energy, verifying its compatibility with a cosmological constant, and the matter density $\Omega_m$ and compare them with the expectations of the concordance paradigm.
#### Spectroscopic survey of faint planetary-nebula nuclei III. A [WC]  central star and two new PG1159 nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopy of three hydrogen-deficient central stars of faint planetary nebulae, with effective temperatures ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) in excess of 100,000 K. The nucleus of RaMul 2 is a Population II Wolf-Rayet star of spectral type [WC], and the central stars of Abell 25 and StDr 138 are two new members of the PG1159 class. Our spectral analyses reveal that their atmospheres have a similar chemical composition. They are dominated by helium and carbon, which was probably caused by a late helium-shell flash. Coincidentally, the three stars have similar masses of about $M=0.53\,M_\odot$ and, hence, form a post-AGB evolutionary sequence of an initially early-K type main-sequence star with $M=0.8\,M_\odot$. The central stars cover the period during which the luminosity fades from about $3000$ to $250\,L_\odot$ and the radius shrinks from about $0.15$ to $0.03\,R_\odot$. The concurrent increase of the surface gravity during this interval from $\log g$ = 5.8 to 7.2 causes the shutdown of the stellar wind from an initial mass-loss rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_\odot\,$${\rm yr}^{-1}) = -6.4$, as measured for the [WC] star. Along the contraction phase, we observe an increase of $T_\mathrm{eff}$ from 112,000 K, marked by the [WC] star, to the maximum value of 140,000 K and a subsequent cooling to 130,000 K, marked by the two PG1159 stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allows for solar observations in the wavelength range of 0.3$-$10 mm, giving us a new view of the chromosphere. The measured brightness temperature at various frequencies can be fitted with theoretical models of density and temperature versus height. We use the available ALMA and Mets\"ahovi measurements of selected solar structures (quiet sun (QS), active regions (AR) devoid of sunspots, and coronal holes (CH)). The measured QS brightness temperature in the ALMA wavelength range agrees well with the predictions of the semiempirical Avrett$-$Tian$-$Landi$-$Curdt$-$W\"ulser (ATLCW) model, better than previous models such as the Avrett$-$Loeser (AL) or Fontenla$-$Avrett$-$Loeser model (FAL). We scaled the ATLCW model in density and temperature to fit the observations of the other structures. For ARs, the fitted models require 9%$-$13% higher electron densities and 9%$-$10% higher electron temperatures, consistent with expectations. The CH fitted models require electron densities 2%$-$40% lower than the QS level, while the predicted electron temperatures, although somewhat lower, do not deviate significantly from the QS model. Despite the limitations of the one-dimensional ATLCW model, we confirm that this model and its appropriate adaptations are sufficient for describing the basic physical properties of the solar structures.

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces an approach to detecting exocomet transits in the dataset of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), specifically within its Sector 1. Given the limited number of exocomet transits detected in the observed light curves, creating a sufficient training sample for the machine learning method was challenging. We developed a unique training sample by encapsulating simulated asymmetric transit profiles into observed light curves, thereby creating realistic data for the model training. To analyze these light curves, we employed the TSFresh software, which was a tool for extracting key features that were then used to refine our Random Forest model training. Considering that cometary transits typically exhibit a small depth, less than 1% of the star's brightness, we chose to limit our sample to the CDPP parameter. Our study focused on two target samples: light curves with a CDPP of less than 40 ppm and light curves with a CDPP of up to 150 ppm. Each sample was accompanied by a corresponding training set. This methodology achieved an accuracy of approximately 96%, with both precision and recall rates exceeding 95% and a balanced F1-score of around 96%. This level of accuracy was effective in distinguishing between 'exocomet candidate' and 'non-candidate' classifications for light curves with a CDPP of less than 40 ppm, and our model identified 12 potential exocomet candidates. However, when applying machine learning to less accurate light curves (CDPP up to 150 ppm), we noticed a significant increase in curves that could not be confidently classified, but even in this case, our model identified 20 potential exocomet candidates. These promising results within Sector 1 motivate us to extend our analysis across all TESS sectors to detect and study comet-like activity in the extrasolar planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Using long-term X-ray observations, we present the short-term and long-term X-ray variability analysis of the ultra-fast rotating active star AB Dor. Flaring events are common in X-ray observations of AB Dor and occupy a substantial portion of the total observation time, averaging around 57$\pm$23\%. The flare-free X-ray light curves show rotational modulation, indicating the presence of highly active regions in its corona. We have developed a light curve inversion code to image the corona of active fast rotating stars. The results of coronal imaging reveal the presence of two active regions of different brightness that are separated by $\sim$180\deg in longitude. These active regions are also found to migrate along the longitude and also show variation in their brightness. Our analysis of long-term X-ray data spanning from 1979 to 2022 shows multiple periodicities. The existence of a $\sim$19.2 yr cycle and its first harmonic indicates the presence of a Solar-like, long-term pattern. In comparison, the periodicities of $\sim$3.6 and $\sim$5.4 yr are possibly due to the presence of a flip-flop cycle in X-rays, which is also supported by similar periods findings from the optical data in the earlier studies. Further confirmation of the existence of the X-ray flip-flop cycle requires long-term observations at regular intervals in the quiescent state.

 - **Abstract**
 Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3mm and 7mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of $\sim0.04$ pc is located north with a distance of $\sim 20,500$ au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this north region which is the origin of the streamer. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ($n_{\rm {H}_2} \approx 1.9 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\rm {kin}} = 10$ K), which are similar to those of early stage starless cores. By comparisons with the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC$_3$N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be $24-34$ M$_{\odot}$. If all of the gas in the reservoir will accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer has been estimated at ($1.1 - 3.2$)$\times10^{5}$ yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Tensions between cosmological parameters derived through different channels can be a genuine signature of new physics that $\Lambda$CDM as the standard model is not able to reproduce, in particular in the missing consistency between parameter estimates from measurements the early and late Universe. Or, they could be caused by yet to be understood systematics in the measurements as a more mundane explanation. Commonly, cosmological tensions are stated in terms of mismatches of the posterior parameter distributions, often assuming Gaussian statistics. More importantly, though, would be a quantification if two data sets are consistent to each other before combining them into a joint measurement, ideally isolating hints at individual data points that have a strong influence in generating the tension. For this purpose, we start with statistical divergences applied to posterior distributions following from different data sets and develop the theory of a Fisher metric between two data sets, in analogy to the Fisher metric for different parameter choices. As a topical example, we consider the tension in the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ from supernova and measurements of the cosmic microwave background, derive a ranking of data points in order of their influence on the tension on $H_0$. For this particular example, we compute Bayesian distance measures and show that in the light of CMB data, supernovae are commonly too bright, whereas the low-$\ell$ CMB spectrum is too high, in agreement with intuition about the parameter sensitivity.
#### The effect of nonlocal disk processes on the volatile CHNOS budgets of  planetesimal-forming material

 - **Abstract**
 The abundances of volatile CHNOS have a profound effect on the interior structure and evolution of a planet. Therefore, it is key to investigate the behavior of the abundances of these elements in the solid phase in the earliest stages of planet formation. However, the processes in planet-forming disks that shape these abundances are highly coupled and nonlocal. We aim to quantify the effects of the interplay between dynamical, collision, ice processing on the abundances of CHNOS in local disk solids as a function of position throughout the planet-forming region. We used SHAMPOO (StocHAstic Monomer PrOcessOr), which tracks the ice budgets of CHNOS-bearing molecules of a dust monomer as it undergoes nonlocal disk processing in a Class I disk. We used a large set of individual monomer evolutionary trajectories to make inferences about the properties of the local dust populations. We find that spatially, monomers can travel larger distances farther out in the disk, leading to a larger spread in positions of origin for a dust population at, for example, r=50 AU compared to r=2 AU. However, chemically, the inner disk (r<10 AU) is more nonlocal due to the closer spacing of ice lines in this disk region. We find that the ice mass associated with individual chemical species can change significantly. The largest differences with local dust were found near ice lines where the collisional timescale is comparable to the adsorption and desorption timescales. Here, aggregates may become significantly depleted in ice as a consequence of microscopic collisional mixing, a previously unknown effect where monomers are stored away in aggregate interiors through rapid cycles of coagulation and fragmentation. This suggests that ice processing is highly coupled to collisional processing in this disk region, which implies that the interiors of dust aggregates must be considered and not just their surfaces.
#### Distribution Properties of the 6.7 GHz Methanol Masers and Their  Surrounding Gases in the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 An updated catalog consisting of 1092 6.7-GHz methanol maser sources was reported in this work. Additionally, the NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), and NH3 (3, 3) transitions were observed towards 214 star forming regions using the Shanghai Tianma radio telescope (TMRT) in order to examine the differences in physical environments, such as excitation temperature and column density of molecular clouds associated with methanol masers on the Galactic scale. Statistical results reveal that the number of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the Perseus arm is significantly lower than that in the other three main spiral arms. In addition, the Perseus arm also has the lowest gas column density among the main spiral arms traced by the NH3 observations. Both of these findings suggest that the Perseus arm has the lowest rate of high-mass star formation compared to the other three main spiral arms. We also observed a trend in which both the luminosity of 6.7 GHz methanol masers and the ammonia gas column density decreased as the galactocentric distances. This finding indicates that the density of material in the inner Milky Way is generally higher than that in the outer Milky Way. It further suggests that high-mass stars are more easily formed at the head of spiral arms. Furthermore, we found that the column density of ammonia gas is higher in the regions on the arms than that in the inter-arm regions, supporting that the former is more likely to be the birthplace of high-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) of neutrinos, which can occur in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), are multiangle effects. They depend on the angular distribution of the neutrino's electron lepton number (ELN). In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the FFCs by solving the multienergy and multiangle quantum kinetic equations with an extended set of collisional weak processes based on a static and spherically symmetric CCSN matter background profile. We investigate the emergence and evolution of FFCs in models featuring different ELN angular distributions, considering scenarios with two and three neutrino flavors. The spectrogram method is utilized to illustrate the small-scale spatial structure, and we show that this structure of neutrino flavor coherence and number densities in the nonlinear regime is qualitatively consistent with the dispersion relation analysis. On the coarse-grained level, we find that different asymptotic states can be achieved following the FFCs depending on the locations and shapes of the ELN distributions, despite sharing a common feature of the elimination of the ELN angular crossing. While equilibration among different neutrino flavors may be achieved immediately after the prompt FFCs, it is not a general outcome of the asymptotic state, as subsequent feedback effects from collisional neutrino-matter interactions come into play, particularly for cases where FFCs occur inside the neutrinosphere. The impacts of FFCs and the feedback effect on the net neutrino heating rates, the equilibrium electron fraction of CCSN matter, and the free-streaming neutrino energy spectra are quantitatively assessed. Other aspects including the impact of the vacuum term and the coexistence with other type of flavor instabilities are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The luminosity of Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) primarily arises from the recombination of hydrogen ionized by the explosion shock and the radioactive decay of \Co. However, the physical connections between SNe IIP and their progenitor stars remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive grid of stellar evolution models and their corresponding supernova light curves (LCs) to investigate the physical properties of observed SNe IIP. The study employs the one-dimensional stellar evolution code, \texttt{MESA}. Our models consider the effects of stellar metallicity, mass, and rotation in the evolution of massive stars, as well as explosion energy and \Ni\ production in modeling supernovae. To elucidate the observed LCs of SNe IIP and to probe their progenitor stars, we fit the observed SNe IIP with our multi-color LCs and discuss their physical origins. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of stellar parameters on LCs. Factors such as the progenitor star's mass, rotation, metallicity, explosion energy, and \Ni\ production influence the light curve's shape and duration. We find that higher-mass stars exhibit longer plateaus due to increased photon diffusion time caused by massive ejecta, impacting the duration of the light curve. Rapid rotation affects internal stellar structures, enhancing convective mixing and mass loss, potentially affecting the plateau's brightness and duration. Higher metallicity leads to increased opacity, altering energy transport and luminosity. Higher explosion energy results in brighter but shorter plateaus due to faster ejecta. \Ni\ production affects late-time luminosity and plateau duration, with larger masses leading to slower declines.

 - **Abstract**
 Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection. This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical anomalies in planet-hosting stars (PHSs) are studied in order to assess how the planetary nature and multiplicity affect the atmospheric chemical abundances of their host stars. We employ APOGEE DR17 to select thin-disk stars of the Milky Way, and cross-match them with the Kepler Input Catalog to identify confirmed PHSs, which results in 227 PHSs with available chemical-abundance ratios for six refractory elements. We also examine an ensemble of stars without planet signals, which are equivalent to the selected PHSs in terms of evolutionary stage and stellar parameters, to correct for Galactic chemical-evolution effects, and derive the abundance gradient of refractory elements over the condensation temperature for the PHSs. Using the Galactic chemical-evolution corrected abundances, we found that PHSs do not show a significant difference in abundance slope from the stars without planets. Furthermore, we examine the depletion trends of refractory elements of PHSs depending on total number of planets and their types, and find that the PHSs with giant planets are more depleted in refractory elements than those with rocky planets. Among the PHSs with rocky planets, the refractory-depletion trends are potentially correlated with the terrestrial planets' radii and multiplicity. In the cases of PHSs with giant planets, sub-Jovian PHSs demonstrated more depleted refractory trends than stars hosting Jovian-mass planets, raising questions on different planetary-formation processes for Neptune-like and Jupiter-like planets.
#### Integral field spectroscopy supports atmospheric optics to reveal the  finite outer scale of the turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial coherence wavefront outer scale (L_0) characterizes the size of the largest turbulence eddies in Earth's atmosphere, determining low spatial frequency perturbations in the wavefront of the light captured by ground-based telescopes. The motivation of this work is to introduce a novel technique for estimating L_0 from seeing-limited integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data. This approach is based on the impact of a finite L_0 on the light collected by the pupil entrance of a ground-based telescope. We take advantage of the homogeneity of IFS to generate band filter images spanning a wide wavelength range, enabling the assessment of image quality (IQ) at the telescope's focal plane. Comparing the measured wavelength-dependent IQ variation with predictions from Tokovinin (2002) analytical approach offers valuable insights into the prevailing L_0 parameter during the observations. We applied the proposed technique to observations from MUSE in the Wide Field Mode obtained at the Paranal Observatory. Our analysis successfully validates Tokovinin's analytical expression, which combines the seeing (E_0) and the L_0 parameters, to predict the IQ variations with the wavelength in ground-based astronomical data. However, we observed some discrepancies between the measured and predictions of the IQ that are analyzed in terms of uncertainties in the estimated E_0 and dome-induced turbulence contributions. This work constitutes the empirical validation of the analytical expression for estimating IQ at the focal plane of ground-based telescopes under specific E_0 and finite L_0 conditions. Additionally, we provide a simple methodology to characterize the L_0 and dome-seeing (E_d) as by-products of IFS observations routinely conducted at major ground-based astronomical observatories.
#### Searching for NLTE effects in the high-resolution transmission spectrum  of WASP-121 b with Cloudy for Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) undergo intense irradiation by their host stars and are expected to experience non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in their atmospheres. Such effects are computationally intensive to model but, at the low pressures probed by high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS), can significantly impact the formation of spectral lines. The UHJ WASP-121 b exhibits a highly inflated atmosphere, making it ideal for investigating the impact of NLTE effects on its transmission spectrum. Here, we formally introduce Cloudy for Exoplanets, a Cloudy-based modelling code, and use it to generate 1-D LTE and NLTE atmospheric models and spectra to analyse archival HARPS WASP-121 b transmission spectra. We assessed the models using two HRCCS methods: i) Pearson cross-correlation, and ii) a method that aims to match the average observed line depth for given atmospheric species. All models result in strong detections of Fe I ($7.5<S/N<10.5$). However, the highest S/N model (LTE) does not agree with the best-matching model of the average line depth (NLTE). We also find degeneracy, such that increasing the isothermal temperature and metallicity of the LTE models can produce average line depths similar to cooler, less metal rich NLTE models. Thus, we are unable to conclusively remark on the presence of NLTE effects in the atmosphere of WASP-121 b. We instead highlight the need for standardised metrics in HRCCS that enable robust statistical assessment of complex physical models, e.g. NLTE or 3-D effects, that are currently too computationally intensive to include in HRCCS atmospheric retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray Burst afterglows are emissions from ultra-relativistic blastwaves produced by a narrow jet interacting with surrounding matter. Since the first multi-messenger observation of a neutron star merger, hydrodynamic modeling of GRB afterglows for structured jets with smoothly varying angular energy distributions has gained increased interest. While the evolution of a jet is well described by self-similar solutions in both ultra-relativistic and Newtonian limits, modeling the transitional phase remains challenging. This is due to the non-linear spreading of a narrow jet to a spherical configuration and the breakdown of self-similar solutions. Analytical models are limited in capturing these non-linear effects, while relativistic hydrodynamic simulations are computationally expensive which restricts the exploration of various initial conditions. In this work, we introduce a reduced hydrodynamic model that approximates the blastwave as an infinitely thin two-dimensional surface. Further assuming axial-symmetry, this model simplifies the simulation to one dimension and drastically reduces the computational costs. We have compared our modeling to relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, semi-analytic methods, and applied it to fit the light curve and flux centroid motion of GW170817. These comparisons demonstrate a high level of agreement and validate our approach. We have developed this method into a numerical tool, jetsimpy, which models the synchrotron GRB afterglow emission from a blastwave with arbitrary angular energy and Lorentz factor distribution. Although the code is built for GRB afterglow in mind, it is applicable to any relativistic jets. This tool is particularly useful in Markov Chain Monte Carlo studies and is provided to the community.

 The dynamic spectra of pulsars frequently exhibit diverse interference patterns, often associated with parabolic arcs in the Fourier-transformed (secondary) spectra. In our approach, we extend beyond the traditional Fresnel-Kirchhoff method by using the Green's function of the Helmholtz equation. Through advanced numerical techniques, we model both the dynamic and secondary spectra, providing a comprehensive framework that describes all components of the latter spectra in terms of physical quantities. Additionally, we provide a thorough analytical explanation of the secondary spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We are interested in the influence of cloudy atmospheres on the thermal radius evolution of warm exoplanets from an interior modelling perspective. By applying a physically motivated but simple parameterized cloud model, we obtain the atmospheric $P$-$T$ structure that is connected to the adiabatic interior at the self-consistently calculated radiative-convective boundary. We investigate the impact of cloud gradients, with the possibility of inhibiting superadiabatic clouds. Furthermore, we explore the impact on the radius evolution for a cloud base fixed at a certain pressure versus a subsiding cloud base during the planets' thermal evolution. We find that deep clouds clearly alter the evolution tracks of warm giants, leading to either slower/faster cooling than in the cloudless case (depending on the cloud model used). When comparing the fixed versus dynamic cloud base during evolution, we see an enhanced behaviour resulting in a faster or slower cooling in the case of the dynamic cloud base. We show that atmospheric models including deep clouds can lead to degeneracy in predicting the bulk metallicity of planets, $Z_\mathrm{P}$. For WASP-10b, we find a possible span of $\approx {Z_\mathrm{P}}_{-0.06}^{+0.10}$. For TOI-1268b, it is $\approx {Z_\mathrm{P}}_{-0.05}^{+0.10}$. Further work on cloud properties during the long-term evolution of gas giants is needed to better estimate the influence on the radius evolution.
