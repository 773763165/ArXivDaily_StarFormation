 - **Abstract**
 Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation: in particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude by discussing the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.

 - **Abstract**
 The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) is a proposed dual-satellite mission to observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), increasing the statistics at the highest energies, and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs), following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events throughout the universe such as gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the POEMMA design, adapted to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital Super Pressure Balloons (SPBs) circling over the Southern Ocean for up to 100 days after a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. This overview will provide a summary of the mission with its science goals, the instruments, and the current status of PBR.

          Inferring the density, spin-temperature and neutral-fraction fields of HI from its 21-cm brightness temperature field using machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm brightness-temperature field of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn is a rich source of cosmological and astrophysical information, primarily due to its significant non-Gaussian features. However, the complex, nonlinear nature of the underlying physical processes makes analytical modelling of this signal challenging. Consequently, studies often resort to semi-numerical simulations. Traditional analysis methods, which rely on a limited set of summary statistics, may not adequately capture the non-Gaussian content of the data, as the most informative statistics are not predetermined. This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) to surpass the limitations of summary statistics by leveraging the inherent non-Gaussian characteristics of the 21-cm signal. We demonstrate that a well-trained neural network can independently reconstruct the hydrogen density, spin-temperature, and neutral-fraction fields with cross-coherence values exceeding 0.95 for $k$-modes below $0.5$ Mpc h$^{-1}$, based on a representative simulation at a redshift of $z \approx 15$. To achieve this, the neural network utilises the non-Gaussian information in brightness temperature images over many scales. We discuss how these reconstructed fields, which vary in their sensitivity to model parameters, can be employed for parameter inference, offering more direct insights into underlying cosmological and astrophysical processes only using limited summary statistics of the brightness temperature field, such as its power spectrum.

          Design, scientific goals, and performance of the SCExAO survey for planets around accelerating stars

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the motivation, design, and early results for our 42-night, 125 star Subaru/SCExAO direct imaging survey for planets around accelerating stars. Unlike prior large surveys, ours focuses only on stars showing evidence for an astrometric acceleration plausibly due to the dynamical pull of an unseen planet or brown dwarf. Our program is motivated by results from a recent pilot program that found the first planet jointly discovered from direct imaging and astrometry and resulted in a planet and brown dwarf discovery rate substantially higher than previous unbiased surveys like GPIES. The first preliminary results from our program reveal multiple new companions; discovered planets and brown dwarfs can be further characterized with follow-up data, including higher-resolution spectra. Finally, we describe the critical role this program plays in supporting the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraphic Instrument, providing a currently-missing list of targets suitable for the CGI technological demonstration without which the CGI tech demo risks failure.

          JWST imaging of the closest globular clusters -- IV. Chemistry, luminosity, and mass functions of the lowest-mass members in the NIRISS parallel fields

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the two closest globular clusters, NGC 6121 and NGC 6397, taken with the NIRISS detector of JWST. The combination of our new JWST data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images allows us to compute proper motions, disentangle cluster members from field objects, and probe the main sequence (MS) of the clusters down to <0.1 $M_\odot$ as well as the brighter part of the white-dwarf sequence. We show that theoretical isochrones fall short in modeling the low-mass MS and discuss possible explanations for the observed discrepancies. Our analysis suggests that the lowest-mass members of both clusters are significantly more metal-rich and oxygen-poor than their higher-mass counterparts. It is unclear whether the difference is caused by a genuine mass-dependent chemical heterogeneity, low-temperature atmospheric processes altering the observed abundances, or systematic shortcomings in the models. We computed the present-day local luminosity and mass functions of the two clusters; our data reveal a strong flattening of the mass function indicative of a significant preferential loss of low-mass stars in agreement with previous dynamical models for these two clusters. We have made our NIRISS astro-photometric catalogs and stacked images publicly available to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like scalar fields can induce temporary deviations from the standard expansion history of the universe. The scalar field's contribution to the energy density of the universe grows while the field is held constant by Hubble friction, but when the scalar field starts to evolve, its energy density decreases faster than the radiation density for some potentials. We explore the observational signatures of such a scalar field that becomes dynamical between big bang nucleosynthesis and matter-radiation equality, which we call very Early Dark Energy (vEDE). If vEDE momentarily dominates the energy density of the universe, it generates a distinctive feature in the matter power spectrum that includes a bump on scales that enter the horizon just after the scalar field starts to evolve. For $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, the amplitude of this bump can exceed the amplitude of the standard matter spectrum. The power on scales on either side of this peak is suppressed relative to the standard power spectrum, but only scales that are within the horizon while the scalar field makes a significant contribution to the total energy density are affected. We determine how vEDE scenarios are constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background, measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance, and probes of the late-time expansion history. We find that current observations are consistent with vEDE scenarios that enhance power on scales $k \gtrsim 30\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and nearly double the amplitude of the matter power spectrum around $200\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. These scenarios also suppress power on scales between $0.3\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $30\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution, and is best studied in our Sun or giant evolved stars. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars. Also for lower mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial for the production of strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disc with prominent small scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disc is $0.72\pm0.05$ astronomical units (au). We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between $-18$ and $+20$ km s$^{-1}$, which means the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the sky-projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$ for HD 191939 b, the innermost planet in a 6 planet system, using Keck/KPF to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Planet b is a sub-Neptune with radius 3.4 $\pm$ 0.8 R$_{\oplus}$ and mass 10.0 $\pm$ 0.7 M$_{\oplus}$ with an RM amplitude $<$1 ms$^{-1}$. We find the planet is consistent with a well-aligned orbit, measuring $\lambda= \, $ 3.7 $\pm$ 5.0 degrees. Additionally, we place new constraints on the mass and period of the distant super-Jupiter, planet f, finding it to be 2.88 $\pm$ 0.26 $M_J$ on a 2898 $\pm$ 152 day orbit. With these new orbital parameters, we perform a dynamical analysis of the system and constrain the mutual inclination of the non-transiting planet e to be smaller than 12 degrees relative to the plane shared by the inner three transiting planets. Additionally, the further planet f is inclined off this shared plane, the greater the amplitude of precession for the entire inner system, making it increasingly unlikely to measure an aligned orbit for planet b. Through this analysis, we show that this system's wide variety of planets are all well-aligned with the star and nearly co-planar, suggesting that the system formed dynamically cold and flat out of a well-aligned proto-planetary disk, similar to our own solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the detection of phosphine PH3 in the Solar System gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, a direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at Solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at Solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times Solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a bow-shock nebula around the cataclysmic variable (CV) SY Cancri. In addition, SY Cnc lies near the edge of a faint Halpha-emitting nebula with a diameter of about 15'. The orientation of the bow shock is consistent with the direction of SY Cnc's proper motion. Nebulae are extremely rare around CVs, apart from those known to have undergone classical-nova (CN) outbursts; bow shocks and off-center nebulae are even more unusual. Nevertheless, the properties of SY Cnc and its nebulosity are strikingly similar to those of V341 Ara, another CV that is also associated with a bow shock and is likewise off-center with respect to its faint Halpha nebula. Both stars are binaries with optically thick accretion disks, belonging to the classes of Z Cam CVs or nova-like variables. We discuss three scenarios to explain the properties of the nebulae. They may have resulted from chance encounters with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes material that is recombining after being photoionized by UV radiation from the CVs. Alternatively, the large nebulae could be ejecta from unobserved CN outbursts in the recent past, which have been decelerated through collisions with the interstellar medium (ISM), while the stars continue to snowplow through the gas. Or the faint Halpha nebulae may be ambient ISM that was shock-ionized by a CN outburst in the past and is now recombining.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) suggest a complex composition with significant contributions from heavy nuclei at the highest energies. We systematically explore how the selection and number of primary nuclei included in the analysis impact the inferred UHECR mass composition. Introducing a distance measure in the space of $X_{\rm max}$ distribution moments, we demonstrate that limiting the analysis to a few primaries can introduce significant biases, particularly as observational data improves. We provide lists of primaries approximately equidistant in the new measure, which guaranty unbiased results at given statistical confidence. Additionally, we explore consistent inclusion of nuclei heavier than iron and up to plutonium, deriving first observational upper bounds on their contributions to UHECR with the Pierre Auger Open Data.

          The only inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary: WD1032+011B

 - **Abstract**
 Due to their short orbital periods and relatively high flux ratios, irradiated brown dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs offer better opportunities to study irradiated atmospheres than hot Jupiters, which have lower planet-to-star flux ratios. WD1032+011 is an eclipsing, tidally locked white dwarf-brown dwarf binary with a 9950 K white dwarf orbited by a 69.7 M$_{Jup}$ brown dwarf in a 0.09 day orbit. We present time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrophotometric data of WD1032+011. We isolate the phase-dependent spectra of WD1032+011B, finding a 210 K difference in brightness temperature between the dayside and nightside. The spectral type of the brown dwarf is identified as L1 peculiar, with atmospheric retrievals and comparison to field brown dwarfs showing evidence for a cloud-free atmosphere. The retrieved temperature of the dayside is $1748^{+66}_{-67}$ K, with a nightside temperature of $1555^{+76}_{-62}$ K, showing an irradiation-driven temperature contrast coupled with inefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. The brown dwarf radius is inflated, likely due to the constant irradiation from the white dwarf, making it the only known inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole demographics in different environments is critical in view of recent results on massive-stars binarity, and of the multi-messenger detectability of compact objects mergers. But the identification and characterization of non-interacting black holes is elusive, especially in the sparse field stellar population. A candidate non-interactive black hole (BH)+red giant (RG) binary system, 2MASSJ05215658+4359220, was identified by Thompson et al.(2019). We obtained Astrosat/UVIT Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV-optical imaging and spectroscopy of the source, to test possible scenarios for the optically-elusive companion. HST/STIS spectra from about 1,600 to 10,230Ang are best fit by the combination of two stellar sources, a red giant with Teff=4250 (uncertainty 150K), logg=2.0, Radius_RG=27.8Rsun (assuming a single-temperature atmosphere), and a subgiant companion with Teff=6,000K, Radius_comp=2.7Rsun, or Teff=5,270K, Radius_comp=4.2Rsun using models with one-tenth or one-third solar metallicity respectively, logg=3.0, extinction E(B-V)=0.50(uncertainty 0.2), adopting the DR3 Gaia distance D=2,463pc (uncertainty 120pc). No FUV data existed prior to our programs. STIS spectra give an upper limit of 10e-17ergs cm-2 s-1 Ang-1 shortward of 2300Ang; an upper limit of >25.7ABmag was obtained in two UVIT FUV broad-bands. The non-detection of FUV flux rules out a compact companion such as a hot WD. The STIS spectrum shows strong MgII lambda2800Ang emission, typical of chromospherically active red giants. The masses inferred by comparison with evolutionary tracks, about 1 Msun for the red giant and between 1.1 and 1.6Msun for the subgiant companion, suggest past mass transfer, although the red giant currently does not fill its Roche lobe. WFC3 imaging in F218W, F275W, F336W, F475W, and F606W shows an unresolved source in all filters.

          The young exoplanetary system TOI-4562: Confirming the presence of a third body in the system

 - **Abstract**
 Young planetary systems represent an opportunity to investigate the early stages of (exo)planetary formation because the gravitational interactions have not yet significantly changed the initial configuration of the system. TOI-4562 b is a highly eccentric temperate Jupiter analogue orbiting a young F7V-type star of $<700$ Myr in age with an orbital period of $P_{orb} \sim 225$ days and an eccentricity of $e=0.76$, and is one of the largest known exoplanets to have formed in situ. We observed a new transit of TOI-4562 b using the 0.6-m Zeiss telescope at the Pico dos Dias Observatory (OPD/LNA) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and combine our data with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and archive data, with the aim being to improve the ephemerides of this interesting system. The $O-C$ diagram for the new ephemeris is consistent with the presence of a giant planet in an outer orbit around TOI-4562. TOI-4562 c is a planet with a mass of $M=5.77 M_{Jup}$, an orbital period of $P_{orb}= 3990$ days, and a semi-major axis of $a = 5.219$ AU. We report the discovery of TOI-4562 c, the exoplanet with the longest orbital period discovered to date via the transit timing variation (TTV) method. The TOI-4562 system is in the process of violent evolution with intense dynamical changes - judging by its young age and high eccentricity - and is therefore a prime target for studies of formation and evolution of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Photonic lanterns are waveguide devices enabling high throughput single mode spectroscopy and high angular resolution. We aim to present the first on-sky demonstration of a photonic lantern (PL) operating in visible light, to measure its throughput and assess its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy of compact objects. We used the SCExAO instrument (a double stage extreme AO system installed at the Subaru telescope) and FIRST mid-resolution spectrograph (R 3000) to test the visible capabilities of the PL on internal source and on-sky observations. The best averaged coupling efficiency over the PL field of view was measured at 51% +/- 10% with a peak at 80%. We also investigate the relationship between coupling efficiency and the Strehl ratio for a PL, comparing them with those of a single-mode fiber (SMF). Findings show that in the AO regime, a PL offers better coupling efficiency performance than a SMF, especially in the presence of low spatial frequency aberrations. We observed Ikiiki (alpha Leo - mR = 1.37) and `Aua (alpha Ori - mR = -1.17) at a frame rate of 200 Hz. Under median seeing conditions (about 1 arcsec measured in H band) and large tip/tilt residuals (over 20 mas), we estimated an average light coupling efficiency of 14.5% +/- 7.4%, with a maximum of 42.8% at 680 nm. We were able to reconstruct both star's spectra, containing various absorption lines. The successful demonstration of this device opens new possibilities in terms of high throughput single-mode fiber-fed spectroscopy in the Visible. The demonstrated on-sky coupling efficiency performance would not have been achievable with a single SMF injection setup under similar conditions, partly because the residual tip/tilt alone exceeded the field of view of a visible SMF (18 mas at 700 nm). Thus emphasizing the enhanced resilience of PL technology to such atmospheric disturbances. The additional

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 K2-2 b/HIP 116454 b, the first exoplanet discovery by K2 during its Two-Wheeled Concept Engineering Test, is a sub-Neptune (2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 $R_\oplus$, 9.7 $\pm$ 1.2 $M_\oplus$) orbiting a relatively bright (KS = 8.03) K-dwarf on a 9.1 day period. Unfortunately, due to a spurious follow-up transit detection and ephemeris degradation, the transit ephemeris for this planet was lost. In this work, we recover and refine the transit ephemeris for K2-2 b, showing a $\sim40{\sigma}$ discrepancy from the discovery results. To accurately measure the transit ephemeris and update the parameters of the system, we jointly fit space-based photometric observations from NASA's K2, TESS, and Spitzer missions with new photometric observations from the ground, as well as radial velocities from HARPS-N that are corrected for stellar activity using a new modeling technique. Ephemerides becoming lost or significantly degraded, as is the case for most transiting planets, highlights the importance of systematically updating transit ephemerides with upcoming large efforts expected to characterize hundreds of exoplanet atmospheres. K2-2 b sits at the high-mass peak of the known radius valley for sub-Neptunes, and is now well-suited for transmission spectroscopy with current and future facilities. Our updated transit ephemeris will ensure no more than a 13-minute uncertainty through 2030.

 - **Abstract**
 The compact object with a mass of $2.50-2.67~M_\odot$ observed by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations in GW190814, as well as the recent report of a light compact object with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, have posed a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. In the inner core region of the neutron star, the strangeness degrees of freedom, such as the hyperons, can be present, which is also named as a hyperonic star. In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars. We find that the maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-MEXY and DD-LZ1 sets can be around $2.5-2.6~M_\odot$ with quite stiff equations of state (EOSs) generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities. Moreover, by investigating the influence of the crust EOS and core EOS on the neutron stars, we find that the observational data from HESS J1731-347 suggest the requirement of a crust EOS with a higher $L$ parameter and a core EOS with a lower $L$ parameter, and the $M-R$ relations from the constructed EOSs can also be consistent with the observables of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451 from NICER and the GW170817 event. With the inclusion of hyperons, the hyperonic star matter becomes softer compared to the neutron star matter. But the massive hyperonic star can also be obtained with DDRMF parameter sets if the vector coupling constants are strong.

 We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent AMS-02 measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) deuteron fluxes suggest the presence of primary deuterons in quantities far exceeding predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This poses a significant challenge to modern astrophysics, as no known processes can account for such large amounts of deuterons without violating existing constraints~\cite{Epstein:1976hq}. In contrast, it is recently proposed that the AMS-02 measurements can be explained by a purely secondary origin when contributions from heavier nuclei are considered. In this study, we recalculate the secondary deuteron flux using production cross sections updated with the latest collider data. We find that some of the deuteron production cross sections are overestimated in the widely-used calculation tools for CR propagation, and a primary deuteron component is still necessary. We then propose a novel process for generating primary deuterons at CR sources through a fusion mechanism, which is naturally unique to deuterons. This model could explain the observed deuteron excess while maintaining consistency with other CR measurements.

 Computational chemistry plays a relevant role in many astrochemical research fields, either by complementing experimental measurements or by deriving parameters difficult to be reproduced by laboratories. While the role of computational spectroscopy in assisting new observations in space is described, the core of the chapter is the investigation of the collisional radiative transfer and the bimolecular reactive processes occurring in the gas-phase conditions of the interstellar medium, using as a guide the contributions presented by the authors at the "Second Italian National Congress on Proto(-planetary) Astrochemistry", held in Trieste in September 2023. In particular, the need for accurate datasets of collisional coefficients to model molecular abundances will be discussed. Then, the role of quantum chemistry in the investigation of interstellar-relevant potential energy surfaces will be described, focusing on accurate thermodynamic quantities for the estimate of rate coefficients.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteorites, and in particular primitive meteorites (chondrites), are irreplaceable probes of the solar protoplanetary disk. We review their essential properties and endeavour to place them in astrophysical context. The earliest solar system solids, refractory inclusions, may have formed over the innermost au of the disk and have been transported outward by its expansion or turbulent diffusion. The age spread of chondrite components may be reconciled with the tendency of drag-induced radial drift if they were captured in pressure maxima, which may account for the non-carbonaceous/carbonaceous meteorite isotopic dichotomy. The solid/gas ratio around unity witnessed by chondrules, if interpreted as nebular (non-impact) products, suggests efficient radial concentration and settling at such locations, conducive to planetesimal formation by the streaming instability. The cause of the pressure bumps, e.g. Jupiter or condensation lines, remains to be ascertained.

 - **Abstract**
 The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 Single-dish observations suggest that the abundances of organic species in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy, characterised by sub-Solar metallicities, are comparable to those found in the local Galaxy. To understand this counter-intuitive result, and avoid misleading interpretation due to beam dilution effects at such large distances, spatially resolved molecular emission maps are needed to link correctly measured abundances and local physical properties. We observed several organic molecules with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array towards WB89-671, the source with the largest Galactocentric distance (23.4~kpc) of the project "CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT), at a resolution of 15000~au. We compared the observed molecular abundances with chemical model predictions. We detected emission of c-C3H2, C4H, CH3OH, H2CO, HCO, H13CO+, HCS+, CS, HN13C, and SO. The emission morphology is complex, extended, and different in each tracer. The most intense emission in H13CO+, H2CO and c-C3H2 arises from two millimeter continuum, infrared-bright cores. The most intense CH3OH and SO emission arises predominantly from the part of the filament with no continuum sources. The narrow linewidths across the filament indicate quiescent gas, despite the two embedded protostars. Derived molecular column densities are comparable with those in local star-forming regions, and suggest anti-correlation between hydrocarbons, ions, HCO, and H2CO on one side, and CH3OH and SO on the other. Static chemical models that best match the observed column densities favour low energetic conditions, expected at large Galactocentric radii, but carbon elemental abundances 3 times higher than that derived extrapolating the [C/H] Galactocentric gradient at 23~kpc. This would indicate a flatter [C/H] trend at large Galactocentric radii, in line with a flat abundance of organics.

 - **Abstract**
 Energetic particles, in the form of stellar energetic particles and cosmic rays, can lead to disequilibrium chemical effects in exoplanetary atmospheres. In Earth-like atmospheres, energetic particles can drive the formation of prebiotic molecules, the building blocks of life. Here instead, I study the transport of energetic particles through a hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmosphere and calculate the resulting ionisation rate of molecular hydrogen using a Monte Carlo energetic particle transport model. I focus on a GJ436 b-like atmosphere at orbital distances between 0.01-0.2 au which includes the orbital distance of the exoplanet GJ436 b (0.028 au). I found that stellar energetic particles lead to high ionisation rates in a GJ436 b-like atmosphere between 0.01-0.2 au. These results motivate the use of chemical models of gas giant atmospheres including energetic particle ionisation to ultimately produce synthetic James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel transmission spectra in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Telescope missions are currently being designed which will make direct imaging of habitable exoplanets possible in the near future, and studies are needed to quantify the detectability of biosignature features in the planet's reflectance spectrum. We simulated the detectability of a NIR-absorbing surface biosignature feature with simulated observations of the nearby exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. We modeled a biosignature spectral feature with a reflectance spectrum based on an anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterial species that has strong absorption at 1 um, which could make it well suited for life on an M-dwarf hosted planet. We modeled the distribution of this organism across the planet's surface based on climate states from a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), which were Archean and Proterozoic-like exo-Earth analogues. We included the GCM runs' prognostically simulated water clouds and added organic haze into the Archean-like atmospheres. We simulated observations of these Proxima Centauri b scenarios with the LUVOIR-A and B telescope concepts, with LUVOIR-B serving as a proxy to the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We calculated integration times necessary to detect the biosignature, and found that it would be detectable on Proxima Centauri b if the organism is moderately abundant (greater than a 1-4% global surface area coverage), as long as the atmosphere is transmitting in the wavelength range under consideration. Small amounts of methane, clouds, and haze do not greatly impede detectability. We found preliminary evidence that such a biosignature would be detectable on exoplanets within 15 pc, but further investigations are needed to corroborate this.

 - **Abstract**
 Extending geodetic and astrometric Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations from traditional centimeter wavebands to millimeter wavebands offers numerous scientific potentials and benefits. However, it was considered quite challenging due to various factors, including the increased effects of atmospheric opacity and turbulence at millimeter wavelengths. Here, we present the results of the first geodetic-mode VLBI experiment, simultaneously observing 82 sources at 22/43/88/132 GHz (K/Q/W/D bands) using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). We introduced the frequency phase transfer (FPT) method to geodetic VLBI analysis, an approach for calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at higher frequencies by transferring phase solutions from lower frequencies. With a 2-minute scan, FPT improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of most fringes, some by over 100%, thereby enhancing the detection rate of weak sources at millimeter wavebands. Additionally, FPT reduced systematic errors in group delay and delay rate, with the weighted root-mean-squares (WRMS) of the post-fitting residuals decreasing from 25.0 ps to 20.5 ps at the W band and from 39.3 ps to 27.6 ps at the D band. There were no notable differences observed in calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at the K band (WRMS = 12.4 ps) and Q band (WRMS = 11.8 ps) with the KVN baselines. This experiment demonstrated that the millimeter waveband can be used for geodetic and astrometric applications with high precision.

 Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The TESS mission searches for transiting exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars across the entire sky. M-type planet hosts are ideal targets for this mission due to their smaller size and cooler temperatures, which makes it easier to detect smaller planets near or within their habitable zones. Additionally, M~dwarfs have a smaller contrast ratio between the planet and the star, making it easier to measure the planet's properties accurately. Here, we report the validation analysis of 13 TESS exoplanet candidates orbiting around M dwarfs. We studied the nature of these candidates through a multi-colour transit photometry transit analysis using several ground-based instruments (MuSCAT2, MuSCAT3, and LCO-SINISTRO), high-spatial resolution observations, and TESS light curves. We present the validation of five new planetary systems: TOI-1883b, TOI-2274b, TOI2768b, TOI-4438b, and TOI-5319b, along with compelling evidence of a planetary nature for TOIs 2781b and 5486b. We also present an empirical definition for the Neptune desert boundaries. The remaining six systems could not be validated due to large true radius values overlapping with the brown dwarf regime or, alternatively, the presence of chromaticity in the MuSCAT2 light curves.

 We present a kinematic and spectroscopic analysis of 40 red giant branch stars, in 9 fields, exquisitely delineating the lower segment of the North West Stream (NW-K2), which extends for $\sim$80 kpc from the centre of the Andromeda galaxy. We measure the stream's systemic velocity as -439.3$^{+4.1}_{-3.8}$ km/s with a velocity dispersion = 16.4$^{+5.6}_{-3.8}$ km/s that is in keeping with its progenitor being a dwarf galaxy. We find no detectable velocity gradient along the stream. We determine $-$1.3$\pm$0.1 $\le$ <[Fe/H]$_{\rm spec}$> $\le$ $-$1.2$\pm$0.8 but find no metallicity gradient along the stream. We are able to plausibly associate NW-K2 with the globular clusters PandAS-04, PandAS-09, PAndAS-10, PAndAS-11, PandAS-12 but not with PandAS-13 or PandAS-15 which we find to be superimposed on the stream but not kinematically associated with it.

 - **Abstract**
 The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft has transited the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud and detects impacts to the spacecraft body via its electric field instrument. Multiple dust populations have been proposed to explain the PSP dust impact rates. PSP's unique orbit allows us to identify a region where the impact rates are likely dominated by $\alpha$-meteoroids, small zodiacal grains on approximately circular, bound orbits. From the distribution of voltage signals generated by dust impacts to PSP in this region, we find the cumulative mass index for grains with radii of $\sim$0.6-1.4 $\mu$m (masses of $3\times10^{-15}$ to $3\times10^{-14}$ kg) to be $\alpha = 1.1 \pm 0.3$ from 0.1-0.25 $R_\odot$. $\alpha$ increases toward the Sun, with even smaller fragments generated closer to the Sun. The derived size distribution is steeper than previously estimated, and in contrast to expectations we find most of the dust mass resides in the smallest fragments and not in large grains inside 0.15 au. As the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud are likely collisionally evolved, these results place new constraints how the solar system's zodiacal cloud and by extension astrophysical debris disks are partitioned in mass.

 We present results of our dynamical stream modelling for the North West Stream in the outer halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Comprising two main segments, the North West Stream was thought to be a single structured arching around M31. However, recent evidence suggests that it is two separate, unrelated, streams. To test this hypothesis we use observational data from 6 fields associated with the upper segment of the North West Stream together with 8 fields and 5 globular clusters associated with the lower segment to constrain model orbits. We fit both segments of the stream using a fixed potential model for M31 and an orbit integrator to compare orbits with the observed streams. We measure the central tracks and predict proper motions for for the upper segment (lower segment) finding ${\mu^*_{\alpha}}$ = 0.078$^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ (0.085$^{+0.001}_{-0.002}$) mas/yr and ${\mu_{\delta}}$ = $-$0.05$^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$ ($-$0.095$^{+0.003}_{-0.005}$) mas/yr. Our results support the hypothesis that the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XXVII is the progenitor of the upper segment of the North West Stream and that the upper and lower segments do not comprise a single structure. We propose that the upper segment, which appears to be on an infall trajectory with M31, be renamed the "Andromeda XXVII Stream" and the lower segment, also apparently infalling towards M31, retain the name "North West Stream".
