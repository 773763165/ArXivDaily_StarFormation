 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino signals from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are expected to carry pronounced imprints of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). We investigate whether the correlation between the SASI signatures in the GW and neutrino signals could be exploited to enhance the detection efficiency of GWs. We rely on a benchmark full-scale three-dimensional CCSN simulation with zero-age main sequence mass of $27\ M_\odot$. Two search strategies are explored: 1.~the inference of the SASI frequency range and/or time window from the neutrino event rate detectable at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory; 2.~the use of the neutrino event rate to build a matched filter template. We find that incorporating information from the SASI modulations of the IceCube neutrino event rate can increase the detection efficiency compared to standard GW excess energy searches up to $30\%$ for nearby CCSNe. However, we do not find significant improvements in the overall GW detection efficiency for CCSNe more distant than $1.5$~kpc. We demonstrate that the matched filter approach performs better than the unmodeled search method, which relies on a frequency bandpass inferred from the neutrino signal. The improved detection efficiency provided by our matched filter method calls for additional work to outline the best strategy for the first GW detection from CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis (0.6-50 keV) of seven Compton-Thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGN; line-of-sight, l.o.s., column density $>10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) candidates selected from the Swift-BAT 100-month catalog, using archival NuSTAR data. This work is in continuation of the on-going research of the Clemson-INAF group to classify CT-AGN candidates at redshift $z<0.05$, using physically-motivated torus models. Our results confirm that three out of seven targets are \textit{bona-fide} CT-AGN. Adding our results to the previously analysed sources using NuSTAR data, we increase the population of bona-fide CT-AGN by $\sim9\%$, bringing the total number to 35 out of 414 AGN. We also performed a comparative study using MyTorus and borus02 on the spectra in our sample, finding that both physical models are strongly consistent in the parameter space of l.o.s. column density and photon index. Furthermore, the clumpiness of the torus clouds is also investigated by separately computing the line-of-sight and average torus column densities, in each of the seven sources. Adding our results to all the previous 48 CT-AGN candidates analysed by the Clemson-INAF research team having NuSTAR observations: we find $78\%$ of the sources are likely to have a clumpy distribution of the obscuring material surrounding the accreting supermassive black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding differences between sub-stellar spectral data and models has proven to be a major challenge, especially for self-consistent model grids that are necessary for a thorough investigation of brown dwarf atmospheres. Using the supervised machine learning method of the random forest, we study the information content of 14 previously published model grids of brown dwarfs (from 1997 to 2021). The random forest method allows us to analyze the predictive power of these model grids, as well as interpret data within the framework of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Our curated dataset includes 3 benchmark brown dwarfs (Gl 570D, {\epsilon} Indi Ba and Bb) as well as a sample of 19 L and T dwarfs; this sample was previously analyzed in Lueber et al. (2022) using traditional Bayesian methods (nested sampling). We find that the effective temperature of a brown dwarf can be robustly predicted independent of the model grid chosen for the interpretation. However, inference of the surface gravity is model-dependent. Specifically, the BT-Settl, Sonora Bobcat and Sonora Cholla model grids tend to predict logg ~3-4 (cgs units) even after data blueward of 1.2 {\mu}m have been disregarded to mitigate for our incomplete knowledge of the shapes of alkali lines. Two major, longstanding challenges associated with understanding the influence of clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres remain: our inability to model them from first principles and also to robustly validate these models.

 - **Abstract**
 The emission from shock breakouts (SBOs) represents the earliest electromagnetic (EM) signal emitted by cataclysmic events involving the formation or the merger of neutron stars (NSs). As such, SBOs carry unique information on the structure of their progenitors and on the explosion energy. The characteristic~SBO emission is expected in the UV range, and its detection is one of the key targets of~the ULTRASAT satellite. Among SBO sources, we focus on a specific class involving the formation of fast spinning magnetars in the core-collapse (CC) of massive stars. Fast spinning magnetars are expected to produce a specific signature in the early UV supernova light curve, powered by the extra spin energy quickly released by the NS. Moreover, they are considered as optimal candidates for the emission of long-transient gravitational wave (GW) signals, the detection of which requires early EM triggers to boost the sensitivity of dedicated GW search pipelines. We calculate early supernova UV light curves in the presence of a magnetar central engine, as a function of the explosion energy, ejecta mass and magnetar parameters. We then estimate the ULTRASAT detection horizon (z < 0.15) as a function of the same physical parameters, and the overall expected detection rate finding that magnetar-powered SBOs may represent up to 1/5 of the total events detected by ULTRASAT. Moreover, at the expected sensitivity of the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra O5 science run, one such event occurring within 5 Mpc will providean ideal trigger for a GW long transient search. Future GW detectors like the Einstein Telescope will push the horizon for joint EM-GW detections to 35-40 Mpc.
#### Unveiling the formation of the massive DR21 ridge

 - **Abstract**
 We present new $^{13}$CO(1-0), C$^{18}$O(1-0), HCO$^{+}$(1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$(1-0) maps from the IRAM 30m telescope, and a spectrally-resolved [CII] 158 $\mu$m map observed with the SOFIA telescope towards the massive DR21 cloud. This traces the kinematics from low- to high-density gas in the cloud which allows to constrain the formation scenario of the high-mass star forming DR21 ridge. The molecular line data reveals that the sub-filaments are systematically redshifted relative to the dense ridge. We demonstrate that [CII] unveils the surrounding CO-poor gas of the dense filaments in the DR21 cloud. We also show that this surrounding gas is organized in a flattened cloud with curved redshifted dynamics perpendicular to the ridge. The sub-filaments thus form in this curved and flattened mass reservoir. A virial analysis of the different lines indicates that self-gravity should drive the evolution of the ridge and surrounding cloud. Combining all results we propose that bending of the magnetic field, due to the interaction with a mostly atomic colliding cloud, explains the velocity field and resulting mass accretion on the ridge. This is remarkably similar to what was found for at least two nearby low-mass filaments. We tentatively propose that this scenario might be a widespread mechanism to initiate star formation in the Milky Way. However, in contrast to low-mass clouds, gravitational collapse plays a role on the pc scale of the DR21 ridge because of the higher density. This allows more effective mass collection at the centers of collapse and should facilitate massive cluster formation.
#### Identification of molecular clouds in emission maps: a comparison  between methods in the \ce{^{13}CO}/\ce{C^{18}O} ($J=3-2$) Heterodyne Inner  Milky Way Plane Survey

 - **Abstract**
 The growing range of automated algorithms for the identification of molecular clouds and clumps in large observational datasets has prompted the need for the direct comparison of these procedures. However, these methods are complex and testing for biases is often problematic: only a few of them have been applied to the same data set or calibrated against a common standard. We compare the Fellwalker method, a widely used watershed algorithm, to the more recent Spectral Clustering for Interstellar Molecular Emission Segmentation (SCIMES). SCIMES overcomes sensitivity and resolution biases that plague many friends-of-friends algorithms by recasting cloud segmentation as a clustering problem. Considering the \ce{^{13}CO}/\ce{C^{18}O} ($J = 3 - 2$) Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS) and the CO High-Resolution Survey (COHRS), we investigate how these two different approaches influence the final cloud decomposition. Although the two methods produce largely similar statistical results over the CHIMPS dataset, FW appears prone to over-segmentation, especially in crowded fields where gas envelopes around dense cores are identified as adjacent, distinct objects. FW catalogue also includes a number of fragmented clouds that appear as different objects in a line-of-sight projection. In addition, cross-correlating the physical properties of individual sources between catalogues is complicated by different definitions, numerical implementations, and design choices within each method, which make it very difficult to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events are common in the Universe, which may occur in various compact star systems and could account for many astrophysical phenomena. Depending on the separation between the central compact star and its companion, either a full disruption or a partial disruption may occur. The partial disruption of a rocky planet around a neutron star can produce kilometer-sized clumps, but the main portion of the planet can survive. The dynamical evolution of these clumps is still poorly understood. In this study, the characteristics of partial disruption of a rocky planet in a highly elliptical orbit around a neutron star is investigated. The periastron of the planet is assumed to be very close to the neutron star so that it would be partially disrupted by tidal force every time it passes through the periastron. It is found that the fragments generated in the process will change their orbits on a time scale of a few orbital periods due to the combined influence of the neutron star and the remnant planet, and will finally collide with the central neutron star. Possible outcomes of the collisions are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue stragglers are anomalously luminous core hydrogen-burning stars formed through mass-transfer in binary/triple systems and stellar collisions. Their physical and evolutionary properties are largely unknown and unconstrained. Here we analyze 320 high-resolution spectra of blue stragglers collected in eight galactic globular clusters with different structural characteristics and show evidence that the fraction of fast rotating blue stragglers (with rotational velocities larger than 40 km/s) increases for decreasing central density of the host system. This trend suggests that fast spinning blue stragglers prefer low-density environments and promises to open an unexplored route towards understanding the evolutionary processes of these stars. Since large rotation rates are expected in the early stages of both formation channels, our results provide direct evidence for recent blue straggler formation activity in low-density environments and put strong constraints on the timescale of the collisional blue straggler slow-down processes.
#### Full velocities and propagation directions of coronal mass ejections  inferred from simultaneous full-disk imaging and Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic  observations

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are violent ejections of magnetized plasma from the Sun, which can trigger geomagnetic storms, endanger satellite operations and destroy electrical infrastructures on the Earth. After systematically searching Sun-as-a-star spectra observed by the Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) from May 2010 to May 2022, we identified eight CMEs associated with flares and filament eruptions by analyzing the blue-wing asymmetry of the O III 52.58 nm line profiles. Combined with images simultaneously taken by the 30.4 nm channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO, the full velocity and propagation direction for each of the eight CMEs are derived. We find a strong correlation between geomagnetic indices (Kp and Dst) and the angle between the CME propagation direction and the Sun-Earth line, suggesting that Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic observations at EUV wavelengths can potentially help to improve the prediction accuracy of the geoeffectiveness of CMEs. Moreover, an analysis of synthesized long-exposure Sun-as-a-star spectra implies that it is possible to detect CMEs from other stars through blue-wing asymmetries or blueshifts of spectral lines.
#### Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Quiescent Coronal Rain over an Active  Region

 - **Abstract**
 The solar corona produces coronal rain, hundreds of times colder and denser material than the surroundings. Coronal rain is known to be deeply linked to coronal heating, but its origin, dynamics, and morphology are still not well understood. The leading theory for its origin is thermal instability (TI) occurring in coronal loops in a state of thermal non-equilibrium (TNE), the TNE-TI scenario. Under steady heating conditions, TNE-TI repeats in cycles, leading to long-period EUV intensity pulsations and periodic coronal rain. In this study, we investigate coronal rain on the large spatial scales of an active region (AR) and over the long temporal scales of EUV intensity pulsations to elucidate its distribution at such scales. We conduct a statistical study of coronal rain observed over an AR off-limb with IRIS and SDO imaging data, spanning chromospheric to transition region (TR) temperatures. The rain is widespread across the AR, irrespective of the loop inclination, and with minimal variation over the 5.45-hour duration of the observation. Most rain has a downward ($87.5\%$) trajectory; however, upward motions ($12.5\%$) are also ubiquitous. The rain dynamics are similar over the observed temperature range, suggesting that the TR and chromospheric emission are co-located on average. The average clump widths and lengths are similar in the SJI channels and wider in the AIA 304 channel. We find ubiquitous long-period EUV intensity pulsations in the AR. Short-term periodicity is found (16 min) linked to the rain appearance, which constitutes a challenge to explain under the TNE-TI scenario.
