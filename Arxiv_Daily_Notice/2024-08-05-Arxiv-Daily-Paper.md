          On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis

 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.

          Photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs with PLUTO+PRIZMO I. Lower X-ray-driven mass-loss rates due to enhanced cooling

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Photoevaporation is an important process for protoplanetary disc dispersal but there has so far been a lack of consensus from simulations over the mass-loss rates and the most important part of the high-energy spectrum for driving the wind. Aims: We aim to isolate the origins of these discrepancies through carefully-benchmarked hydrodynamic simulations of X-ray photoevaporation with time-dependent thermochemistry calculated on the fly. Methods: We conduct hydrodynamic simulations with pluto where the thermochemistry is calculated using prizmo. We explore the contribution of certain key microphysical processes and the impact of using different spectra used previously in literature studies. Results: We find that additional cooling results from the excitation of O by neutral H, which leads to dramatically reduced mass-loss across the disc compared to previous X-ray photoevaporation models, with an integrated rate of 10^-9 Msun/yr. Such rates would allow for longer-lived discs than previously expected from population synthesis. An alternative spectrum with less soft X-ray produces mass-loss rates around a factor of 2-3 times lower. The chemistry is significantly out of equilibrium, with the survival of H2 into the wind aided by advection. This leads to its role as the dominant coolant at 10s au - thus stabilising a larger radial temperature gradient across the wind - as well as providing a possible wind tracer.

 - **Abstract**
 We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map CO(3-2) emission from a galaxy, DLA-B1228g, associated with the high-metallicity damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber at $z \approx 2.1929$ towards the QSO PKS B1228-113. At an angular resolution of $\approx0.32''\times0.24''$, DLA-B1228g shows extended CO(3-2) emission with a deconvolved size of $\approx0.78''\times0.18''$, i.e. a spatial extent of $\approx6.4$ kpc. We detect extended stellar emission from DLA-B1228g in a Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 F160W image, and find that H$\alpha$ emission is detected in a Very Large Telescope SINFONI image from only one side of the galaxy. While the clumpy nature of the F160W emission and the offset between the kinematic and physical centers of the CO(3-2) emission are consistent with a merger scenario, this appears unlikely due to the lack of strong H$\alpha$ emission, the symmetric double-peaked CO(3-2) line profile, the high molecular gas depletion timescale, and the similar velocity dispersions in the two halves of the CO(3-2) image. Kinematic modelling reveals that the CO(3-2) emission is consistent with arising from an axisymmetric rotating disk, with an exponential profile, a rotation velocity of $v_{rot}=328\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$, and a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v}=62\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$. The high value of the ratio $v_{rot}/\sigma_v$, $\approx5.3$, implies that DLA-B1228g is a rotation-dominated cold disk galaxy, the second case of a high-$z$ HI-absorption-selected galaxy identified with a cold rotating disk. We obtain a dynamical mass of $M_{dyn}= (1.5\pm0.1)\times10^{11}~M_\odot$, similar to the molecular gas mass of $\approx10^{11} M_\odot$ inferred from earlier CO(1-0) studies; this implies that the galaxy is baryon-dominated in its inner regions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) in identifying and characterizing white dwarfs (WDs) within the Milky Way Galaxy. Leveraging the UVIT point source catalogue towards SMC and crossmatching with Gaia DR3 data, we identified 43 single WDs (37 new detections), 13 new WD+main sequence (MS) candidates and 161 UV bright MS stars by analysing their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED). Using the WD evolutionary models, we determine the masses, effective temperatures, and cooling ages of these identified WDs. Masses of these WDs range from 0.2 to 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ and effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) between 10000 K to 15000 K, with cooling ages spanning 0.1 to 2 Gyr. Notably, we detect hotter WDs compared to literature values, which is attributed to the sensitivity of UVIT. Furthermore, we report the detection of 20 new extremely low-mass (ELM) candidates from our analysis. Future spectroscopic studies of the ELM candidates will help us understand the formation scenarios of these exotic objects. Despite limitations in Gaia DR3 distance measurements for optically faint WDs, we provide a crude estimate of the WD space density within 1kpc as 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ pc$^{-3}$, which is higher than previous estimates in the literature. Our results underscore the instrumental capabilities of UVIT and anticipate the forthcoming UV missions like INSIST for systematic WD discovery. Our methodology sets a precedent for future analyses in other UVIT fields to find more WDs and perform spectroscopic studies to verify their candidacy.

          On the fate of the secondary white dwarf in double-degenerate double-detonation Type Ia supernovae -- II. 3D synthetic observables

 - **Abstract**
 A leading model for Type Ia supernovae involves the double-detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. Double-detonations arise when a surface helium shell detonation generates shockwaves that trigger a core detonation; this mechanism may be triggered via accretion or during the merger of binaries. Most previous double-detonation simulations only included the primary white dwarf; however, the fate of the secondary has significant observational consequences. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations accounted for the companion in double-degenerate double-detonation mergers. In the merger of a 1.05$\text{M}_{\odot}$ primary white dwarf and 0.7$\text{M}_{\odot}$ secondary white dwarf, the primary consistently detonates while the fate of the secondary remains uncertain. We consider two versions of this scenario, one in which the secondary survives and another in which it detonates. We present the first 3D radiative transfer calculations for these models and show that the synthetic observables for both models are similar and match properties of the peculiar 02es-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Our calculations show angle dependencies sensitive to the companion's fate, and we can obtain a closer spectroscopic match to normal Type Ia supernovae when the secondary detonates and the effects of helium detonation ash are minimised. The asymmetry in the width-luminosity relationship is comparable to previous double-detonation models, but the overall spread is increased with a secondary detonation. The secondary detonation has a meaningful impact on all synthetic observables; however, multidimensional nebular phase calculations are needed to support or rule out either model as a likely explanation for Type Ia supernovae.

          New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 We systematically investigate the variability of polarized X-rays on a timescale of a few seconds in the low/hard state of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1. The correlation between polarization degrees and angles with X-Ray intensity was analyzed using data collected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in June 2022. Given that X-Ray variability in the low/hard state of Cygnus X-1 is non-periodic, flux peaks were aggregated to suppress statistical fluctuations. We divided the temporal profiles of these aggregated flux peaks into seven time segments and evaluated the polarization for each segment. The results reveal that the polarization degree was 4.6\%$\pm$1.2 and 5.3\%$\pm$1.2 before and after the peak, respectively, but decreased to 3.4\%$\pm$1.1 and 2.7\%$\pm$1.1 in the segments including and immediately following the peak. Furthermore, the polarization angle exhibited a slight shift from approximately 30$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$40$^{\circ}$ before and after the peak. These findings suggest that the accretion disk contracts with increasing X-Ray luminosity, and the closer proximity of the X-Ray emitting gas to the black hole may lead to reduced polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 Heartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal astrophysical laboratories for studying the internal properties of the systems. In this paper, five new HBSs exhibiting TEOs are discovered using TESS photometric data. The orbital parameters are derived using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The TEOs in these objects are examined, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. The pulsation phases of the TEOs in TIC 266809405, TIC 266894805, and TIC 412881444 are consistent with the dominant $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$ spherical harmonic. For TIC 11619404, although the TEO phase is close to the $m=+2$ mode, the $m = 0$ mode cannot be excluded because of the low inclination in this system. The TEO phase in TIC 447927324 shows a large deviation ($>2\sigma$) from the adiabatic expectations, suggesting that it is expected to be a traveling wave rather than a standing wave. In addition, these TEOs occur at relatively low orbital harmonics, and we cautiously suggest that this may be an observational bias. These objects are valuable sources for studying the structure and evolution of eccentricity orbit binaries and extending the TESS HBS catalog with TEOs.

          Direct Method to Compute Doppler Beaming Factors in Binary Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at this http URL.

          Inverse Raman scattering and the diffuse interstellar bands: an exploration of the systemic interconnections between spontaneous and inverse Raman scattering and extended red emission, Red Rectangle bands, and diffuse interstellar bands

 - **Abstract**
 First identified in 1964, inverse Raman scattering (IRS) is a nonlinear stimulated phenomenon that induces Raman scattered absorptions where Raman emissions would be expected. While IRS is less well-known than stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), this study highlights its significance in analyzing the spectra of stars located in the distant background of HI interstellar clouds. Specifically, ultraviolet emission lines Raman scattered by atomic hydrogen, typically observed in emission at wide scattering angles in the optical spectra of symbiotic stars and nebulae, should appear as IRS absorption features in the optical spectra of the background stars. I show that all known interstellar Raman scattered emission lines in the H-alpha wavelength region are detected in absorption as diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the spectra of reddened stars, and conclude that IRS by atomic hydrogen resolves the longstanding puzzle of the processes involved in producing these bands, and perhaps also explains the equally mysterious 2200A bump of ultraviolet extinction curves. This identification of DIBs as IRS HI absorptions sheds new light on the perplexing relationship between DIBs and the Red Rectangle nebula emission bands (RRBs). The conditions under which DIBs are detected highlight the importance of considering the physical relationship between the observer, the HI medium, and the direction of the illuminating radiation field (i.e., the geometry of the observation) in observations of HI interstellar matter. Observing in the direction of the radiation field or on its side determines whether IRS, yielding DIBs and the 2200A bump, or spontaneous Raman scattering at wide scattering angles, resulting in ERE, Raman scattered emission lines (including RRBs), and the unidentified infrared bands, will be observed.

          Is quasar variability regulated by the close environment of accretion?

 - **Abstract**
 UV/optical variability in quasars is a well-observed phenomenon, yet its primeval origins remain unclear. This study investigates whether the accretion disk turbulence, which is responsible for UV/optical variability, is influenced by the close environment of the accretion by analyzing the correlation between variability and infrared emission for two luminous SDSS quasar samples. The first sample includes light curves from SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and ZTF $g$ band photometry, while the second sample utilizes SDSS Stripe 82 $g$ band light curves. We explore the correlation between the $g$ band excess variance ($\sigma_{rms}$) and the wavelength-dependent infrared covering factor ($L_{\rm IR}(\lambda)/L_{\rm bol}$), controlling for the effects of redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass. An anti-correlation between two variables is observed in both samples, which is strongest at wavelengths of 2-3$\mu$m but gradually weakens towards longer wavelength. This suggests the equatorial dusty torus (which dominates near-infrared emission) plays a significant role in influencing the UV/optical variability, while the cooler polar dust (which contributes significantly to mid-infrared emission) does not. The findings indicate that quasar variability may be connected to the physical conditions within the dusty torus which feeds the accretion, and support the notion that the close environment of the accretion plays an important role in regulating the accretion disk turbulence.

          A study of the dynamical structures in a Dark Matter Halo using UMAP

 - **Abstract**
 We use a dimension reduction algorithm, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to study dynamical structures inside a dark matter halo. We use a zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way mass dark matter halo, and apply UMAP on the 6 dimensional phase space in the dark matter field at z = 0. We find that particles in the field are mapped to distinct clusters in the lower dimensional space in a way that is closely related to their accretion history. The largest cluster in UMAP space does not contain the entire mass of the Milky Way virial region and neatly separates the older halo from the recently accreted matter. Particles within this cluster, which only comprise $\sim 70\%$ of the Milky Way particles, have had several pericenter passages and are, therefore, likely to be phase mixed, becoming dynamically uniform. The infall region and recently accreted particle and substructure, even up to splashback, form distinct components in the lower dimensional space; additionally, higher angular momentum particles also take longer times to mix. Our work shows that the current state of the Milky Way halo retains historical information, particularly about the recent accretion history, and even a relatively old structure is not dynamically uniform. We also explore UMAP as a pre-processing step to find coherent subhalos in dark matter simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory will deliver high-quality, temporally-sparse observations of millions of Solar System objects on an unprecedented scale. Such datasets will likely enable the precise estimation of small body properties on a population-wide basis. In this work, we consider the possible applications of photometric data points from the LSST to the characterisation of Jupiter-family comet (JFC) nuclei. We simulate sparse-in-time lightcurve points with an LSST-like cadence for the orbit of a JFC between 2024-2033. Convex lightcurve inversion is used to assess whether the simulation input parameters can be accurately reproduced for a sample of nucleus rotation periods, pole orientations, activity onsets, shapes and sizes. We find that the rotation period and pole direction can be reliably constrained across all nucleus variants tested, and that the convex shape models, while limited in their ability to describe complex or bilobed nuclei, are effective for correcting sparse photometry for rotational modulation to improve estimates of nucleus phase functions. Based on this analysis, we anticipate that LSST photometry will significantly enhance our present understanding of the spin-state and phase function distributions of JFC nuclei.

          Metrics of Astrometric Variability in the International Celestial Reference Frame: I. Statistical analysis and selection of the most variable sources

 - **Abstract**
 Using very long baseline interferometry data for the sources that comprise the third International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3), we examine the quality of the formal source position uncertainties of ICRF3 by determining the excess astrometric variability (unexplained variance) for each source as a function of time. We also quantify multiple qualitatively distinct aspects of astrometric variability seen in the data, using a variety of metrics. Average position offsets, statistical dispersion measures, and coherent trends over time as explored by smoothing the data are combined to characterize the most and least positionally stable ICRF3 sources. We find a notable dependence of the excess variance and statistical variability measures on declination, as is expected for unmodeled ionospheric delay errors and the northern hemisphere dominated network geometries of most astrometric and geodetic observing campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 The Big Fringe Telescope (BFT) is a facility concept under development for a next-generation, kilometer-scale optical interferometer. Observations over the past two decades from routinely operational facilities such as CHARA and VLTI have produced groundbreaking scientific results, reflecting the mature state of the techniques in optical interferometry. However, routine imaging of bright main sequence stars remains a surprisingly unexplored scientific realm. Additionally, the three-plus decade old technology infrastructure of these facilities leads to high operations \& maintenance costs, and limits performance. We are developing the BFT, based upon robust, modern, commercially-available, automated technologies with low capital construction and O\&M costs, in support of kilometer-scale optical interferometers that will open the door to regular `snapshot' imaging of main sequence stars. Focusing on extreme angular resolution for bright objects leads to substantial reductions in expected costs through use of COTS elements and simplified infrastructure.

          Hyperons during proto-neutron star deleptonization and the emission of dark flavored particles

 - **Abstract**
 Complementary to high-energy experimental efforts, indirect astrophysical searches of particles beyond the standard model have long been pursued. The present article follows the latter approach and considers, for the first time, the self-consistent treatment of the energy losses from dark flavored particles produced in the decay of hyperons during a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). To this end, general relativistic supernova simulations in spherical symmetry are performed, featuring six-species Boltzmann neutrino transport, and covering the long-term evolution of the nascent remnant proto-neutron star (PNS) deleptonization for several tens of seconds. A well-calibrated hyperon equation of state (EOS) is therefore implemented into the supernova simulations and tested against the corresponding nucleonic model. It is found that supernova observables, such as the neutrino signal, are robustly insensitive to the appearance of hyperons for the simulation times considered in the present study. The presence of hyperons enables an additional channel for the appearance of dark sector particles, which is considered at the level of the $\Lambda$ hyperon decay. Assuming massless particles that escape the PNS after being produced, these channels expedite the deleptonizing PNS and the cooling behaviour. This, in turn, shortens the neutrino emission timescale. The present study confirms the previously estimated upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios for low and high mass PNS, by effectively reducing the neutrino emission timescale by a factor of two. This is consistent with the classical argument deduced from the neutrino detection associated with SN1987A.
