#### The greatest GOES soft X-ray flares: Saturation and recalibration over  two Hale cycles

 - **Abstract**
 The solar soft X-ray observations from the GOES satellites provide one of the best quantitative records of solar activity, with nearly continuous flare records since 1975. We present a uniform analysis of the entire time series for 1975 to 2022 at NOAA class C1 level or above, to characterize the occurrence distribution function (ODF) of the flares observed in the 1-8 A spectral band. The analysis includes estimations of the peak fluxes of the 12 flares that saturated the 1-8 A time series. Our new estimates include NOAA's recently established correction factor (1.43) to adjust the GOES-1 through GOES-15 data covering 1975-2016. For each of the 12 saturated events we have made new estimates of peak fluxes based on fits to the rise and fall of the flare time profile, and have validated our extrapolation schemes by comparing with artificially truncated but unsaturated X10-class events. SOL2003-11-04 now has a peak flux of 4.32e-3 W/m^2. This corresponds to X43 on the new scale, or X30 on the old scale. We provide a list in the Appendix for peak fluxes of all 38 events above 10^-3 W/m^2, the GOES X10 level, including the 12 saturated events. The full list now gives us a first complete sample from which we obtain an occurrence distribution function (ODF) for peak energy flux , often represented as a power law dF/dE ~ E^-alpha, for which we find alpha = 1.973 +- 0.014 in the range M1 to X3. The power-law description fails at the high end, requiring a downward break in the ODF above the X10 level. We give a tapered powerlaw description of the resulting CCDF (complementary cumulative distribution function) and extrapolate it into the domain of "superflares," i.e. flares with bolometric energies > 10^33 erg. Extrapolation of this fit provides estimates of 100-yr and 1000-yr GOES peak fluxes that agree reasonably well with other such estimates using different data sets and methodology.

 - **Abstract**
 The two-body problem under the influence of both dark energy and post-Newtonian modifications is studied. In this unified framework, we demonstrate that dark energy plays the role of a critical period with $T_{\Lambda} = 2\pi/c \sqrt{\Lambda} \approx 60~\text{Gyr}$. We also show that the ratio between orbital and critical period naturally emerges from the Kretschmann scalar, which is a quadratic curvature invariant characterising all binary systems effectively represented by a de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. The suitability of a binary system to constrain dark energy is determined by the ratio between its Keplerian orbital period $T_\text{K}$ and the critical period $T_\Lambda$. Systems with $T_\text{K} \approx T_\Lambda$ are optimal for constraining the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, such as the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster. Systems with $T_{\text{K}} \ll T_\Lambda$ are dominated by attractive gravity (which are best suited for studying modified gravity corrections). Systems with $T_{\text{K}} \gg T_\Lambda$ are dominated by repulsive dark energy and can thus be used to constrain $\Lambda$ from below. We use our unified framework of post-Newtonian and dark-energy modifications to calculate the precession of bounded and unbounded astrophysical systems and infer constraints on $\Lambda$ from them. Pulsars, the solar system, S stars around Sgr A*, the Local Group, and the Virgo Cluster, having orbital periods of days to gigayears, are analysed. The results reveal that the upper bound on the cosmological constant decreases when the orbital period of the system increases, emphasising that $\Lambda$ is a critical period in binary motion.
#### Some stars fade quietly: Varied Supernova explosion outcomes and their  effects on the multi-phase interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from galaxy evolution simulations with a mutiphase Interstellar medium (ISM), a mass resolution of $4$ M$_{\odot}$ and a spatial resolution of 0.5 pc. These simulations include a stellar feedback model that includes the resolved feedback from individual massive stars and accounts for heating from the far UV-field, non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry and photoionization. In the default setting, individual supernova (SN) remnants are realized as thermal injections of $10^{51}$ erg; this is our reference simulation WLM-fid. Among the remaining seven simulations, there are two runs where we vary this number by fixing the energy at $10^{50}$ erg and $10^{52}$ erg (WLM-1e50 and WLM-1e52, respectively). We carry out three variations with variable SN-energy based on the data of Sukhbold et al. (2016) (WLM-variable, WLM-variable-lin, and WLM-variable-stoch). We run two simulations where only 10 or 60 percent of stars explode as SNe with $10^{51}$ erg, while the remaining stars do not explode (WLM-60prob and WLM-10prob). We find that the variation in the SN-energy, based on the tables of Sukhbold et al. (2016), has only minor effects: the star formation rate changes by roughly a factor of two compared to the fiducial run, and the strength of the galactic outflows in mass and energy only decreases by roughly 30 percent, with typical values of $\eta_m \sim 0.1$ and $\eta_e \sim 0.05$ (measured at a height of 3 kpc after the hot wind is fully decoupled from the galactic ISM). In contrast, the increase and decrease in the canonical SN-energy has a clear impact on the phase structure, with loading factors that are at least 10 times lower/higher and a clear change in the phase structure. We conclude that these slight modulations are driven not by the minor change in SN-energy but rather by the stochasticity of whether or not an event occurs when variable SN-energies are applied.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study S K-edge using high-resolution HETGS {\it Chandra} spectra of 36 low-mas X-ray binaries. For each source, we have estimated column densities for {\rm S}~{\sc i}, {\rm S}~{\sc ii}, {\rm S}~{\sc iii}, {\rm S}~{\sc xiv}, {\rm S}~{\sc xv} and {\rm S}~{\sc xvi} ionic species, which trace the neutral, warm and hot phases of the Galactic interstellar medium. We also estimated column densities for a sample of interstellar dust analogs. We measured their distribution as a function of Galactic latitude, longitude, and distances to the sources. While the cold-warm column densities tend to decrease with the Galactic latitude, we found no correlation with distances or Galactic longitude. This is the first detailed analysis of the sulfur K-edge absorption due to ISM using high-resolution X-ray spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a performance analysis for the aperture masking interferometry (AMI) mode on board the James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST/NIRISS). Thanks to self-calibrating observables, AMI accesses inner working angles down to and even within the classical diffraction limit. The scientific potential of this mode has recently been demonstrated by the Early Release Science (ERS) 1386 program with a deep search for close-in companions in the HIP 65426 exoplanetary system. As part of ERS 1386, we use the same dataset to explore the random, static, and calibration errors of NIRISS AMI observables. We compare the observed noise properties and achievable contrast to theoretical predictions. We explore possible sources of calibration errors, and show that differences in charge migration between the observations of HIP 65426 and point-spread function calibration stars can account for the achieved contrast curves. Lastly, we use self-calibration tests to demonstrate that with adequate calibration, NIRISS AMI can reach contrast levels of $\sim9-10$ mag. These tests lead us to observation planning recommendations and strongly motivate future studies aimed at producing sophisticated calibration strategies taking these systematic effects into account. This will unlock the unprecedented capabilities of JWST/NIRISS AMI, with sensitivity to significantly colder, lower mass exoplanets than ground-based setups at orbital separations inaccessible to JWST coronagraphy.
#### A Possible Third Body in the X-Ray System GRS 1747-312 and Models with  Higher-Order Multiplicity

 - **Abstract**
 GRS 1747-312 is a bright Low-Mass X-ray Binary in the globular cluster Terzan 6, located at a distance of 9.5 kpc from the Earth. It exhibits regular outbursts approximately every 4.5 months, during which periodic eclipses are known to occur. These eclipses have only been observed in the outburst phase, and are not clearly seen when the source is quiescent. Recent Chandra observations of the source were performed in June 2019 and April, June, and August of 2021. Two of these observations captured the source during its outburst, and showed clear flux decreases at the expected time of eclipse. The other two observations occurred when the source was quiescent. We present the discovery of a dip that occurred during the quiescent state. The dip is of longer duration and its time of occurrence does not fit the ephemeris of the shorter eclipses. We study the physical characteristics of the dip and determine that it has all the properties of an eclipse by an object with a well defined surface. We find that there are several possibilities for the nature of the object causing the 5.3 ks eclipse. First, GRS 1747-312 may be an X-ray triple, with an LMXB orbited by an outer third object, which could be an M-dwarf, brown dwarf, or planet. Second, there could be two LMXBs in close proximity to each other, likely bound together. Whatever the true nature of the eclipser, its presence suggests that the GRS 1747-312 system is unique.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming 21 cm intensity mapping experiments like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) hold significant potential to constrain the properties of dark matter. In this work, we model neutral hydrogen (HI) distributions using high-resolution hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of both cold dark matter (CDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies in the post-reionization redshift range of $z=3.42-4.94$. We show that the HI abundance and the HI column density distribution function decrease in FDM-like cosmologies. Extreme FDM models with $m\sim 10^{-22}$ eV are at odds with a range of measurements. Due to the increased halo bias, the HI bias increases, paralleled by the damped \Lya \ (DLA) bias which we infer from the cross-section of DLAs. The DLA cross-section distribution in extreme FDM models has a high median at the low-mass end, which can be traced to the high column density of cosmic filaments. We study the prospects of detecting the brightest HI peaks with SKA1-Low at $z=4.94$, indicating moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at angular resolution $\theta_A = 2^{\prime}$ with a rapidly declining SNR for lower values of $\theta_{A}$. After training the conditional normalizing flow network HIGlow on 2D HI maps, we interpolate its latent space of axion masses to predict the peak flux for a new, synthetic FDM cosmology, finding good agreement with expectations. This work thus underscores the potential of normalizing flows in capturing complex, non-linear structures within HI maps, offering a versatile tool for conditional sample generation and prediction tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 According to observations and numerical simulations, the Milky Way could exhibit several spiral arm modes with multiple pattern speeds, wherein the slower patterns are located at larger Galactocentric distances. Our aim is to quantify the effects of the spiral arms on the azimuthal variations of the chemical abundances for oxygen, iron and for the first time for neutron-capture elements (europium and barium) in the Galactic disc. We assume a model based on multiple spiral arm modes with different pattern speeds. The resulting model represents an updated version of previous 2D chemical evolution models. We apply new analytical prescriptions for the spiral arms in a 2D Galactic disc chemical evolution model, exploring the possibility that the spiral structure is formed by the overlap of chunks with different pattern speeds and spatial extent. The predicted azimuthal variations in abundance gradients are dependent on the considered chemical element. Elements synthesised on short time scales (i.e., oxygen and europium in this study) exhibit larger abundance fluctuations. In fact, for progenitors with short lifetimes, the chemical elements restored into the ISM perfectly trace the star formation perturbed by the passage of the spiral arms. The map of the star formation rate predicted by our chemical evolution model with multiple patterns of spiral arms presents arcs and arms compatible with those revealed by multiple tracers (young upper main sequence stars, Cepheids, and distribution of stars with low radial actions). Finally, our model predictions are in good agreement with the azimuthal variations that emerged from the analysis of Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec [M/H] abundance ratios, if at most recent times the pattern speeds match the Galactic rotational curve at all radii.
#### The \textit{JWST} Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations  of Exoplanetary Systems III: Aperture Masking Interferometric Observations of  the star HIP\,65426 at $\boldsymbol{3.8\,\rm{μm}}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of the star HIP 65426 at $3.8\,\rm{\mu m}$ as a part of the \textit{JWST} Direct Imaging Early Release Science (ERS) program obtained using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument. This mode provides access to very small inner working angles (even separations slightly below the Michelson limit of ${}0.5\lambda/D$ for an interferometer), which are inaccessible with the classical inner working angles of the \textit{JWST} coronagraphs. When combined with \textit{JWST}'s unprecedented infrared sensitivity, this mode has the potential to probe a new portion of parameter space across a wide array of astronomical observations. Using this mode, we are able to achieve a contrast of $\Delta m_{F380M}{\sim }7.8$\,mag relative to the host star at a separation of ${\sim}0.07\arcsec$ but detect no additional companions interior to the known companion HIP\,65426\,b. Our observations thus rule out companions more massive than $10{-}12\,\rm{M\textsubscript{Jup}}$ at separations ${\sim}10{-}20\,\rm{au}$ from HIP\,65426, a region out of reach of ground or space-based coronagraphic imaging. These observations confirm that the AMI mode on \textit{JWST} is sensitive to planetary mass companions orbiting at the water frost line, even for more distant stars at $\sim$100\,pc. This result will allow the planning and successful execution of future observations to probe the inner regions of nearby stellar systems, opening essentially unexplored parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the relationship between stellar surface density and gas surface density (the star-gas or S-G correlation) in a 20,000 M$_{\odot}$ simulation from the STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments (STARFORGE) Project. We create synthetic observations based on the Spitzer and Herschel telescopes by modeling active galactic nuclei contamination, smoothing based on angular resolution, cropping the field-of-view, and removing close neighbors and low-mass sources. We extract star-gas properties such as the dense gas mass fraction, the Class II:I ratio, and the S-G correlation ($\Sigma_{\rm YSO}/\Sigma_{\rm gas}$) from the simulation and compare them to observations of giant molecular clouds, young clusters, and star-forming regions, as well as to analytical models. We find that the simulation reproduces trends in the counts of young stellar objects and the median slope of the S-G correlation. This implies that the S-G correlation is not simply the result of observational biases but is in fact a real effect. However, other statistics, such as the Class II:I ratio and dense gas mass fraction, do not always match observed equivalents in nearby clouds. This motivates further observations covering the full simulation age range and more realistic modeling of cloud formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological perturbations, originating in the quantum fluctuations of the fields that drive inflation, are observed to be nearly scale invariant at the largest scales. At smaller scales, however, perturbations are not severely constrained and might be of particular importance if their amplitude is large. They can trigger the creation of primordial black holes (PBHs) or stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Small-scale perturbations are generated during the later stages of inflation, when possible strong features in the inflaton potential can break scale invariance and leave characteristic imprints on the spectrum. We focus on and review three types of features: inflection points and steep steps in the potential, as well as sharp turns in the inflationary trajectory in field space. We show that such features induce a strong enhancement of the curvature spectrum within a certain wavenumber range. In particular cases, they also generate characteristic oscillatory patterns that are transferred in the spectrum of secondary GWs, which are potentially observable by operating or designed experiments. We demonstrate these effects through the calculation of the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance in the context of $\alpha$-attractors and supergravity (SUGRA) models of inflation.
#### Dynamical evolution of second-generation circumstellar/protoplanetary  disks in evolved wide binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 In mass-transferring wide binary stellar systems, the companion star can capture some of the mass released in wind by the primary evolved star, and form an accretion disk. Such accretion disks could evolve to form disks of comparable properties to protoplanetary disks and may enable the formation of new planets and/or the interactions, re-growth, and re-migration of pre-existing planets in the newly formed disks. We study the formation and the dynamical evolution of such "second generation" (SG) protoplanetary disks in evolved wide binary systems, with primaries in the mass range of 1-8 Solar mass. We follow their evolution from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of the red giant stellar donor until its evolution to become a white dwarf. We perform 1D semi-analytical numerical simulations for several binary systems varying the mass of the evolved stellar donor and the initial orbital distance, taking into account the changing mass-loss rates and the binary orbital expansion due to mass-loss. We calculate the radial density profile of the formed SG accretion disk and its temperature profile, considering a non-stationary viscosity profile which depends on the radial temperature profile. We find that SG circumstellar disks evolve to form a long-lived stable structure over the lifetime of the donor star, and we show that we can consistently produce the observed conditions and accretion rate inferred for the Mira evolved wide-binary system. The quasi-steady state radial surface density profiles are comparable with the typical range of masses and densities of observed (regular "first-generation") protoplanetary disks. This suggests that realistic SG disks can give rise to a second phase of planet formation and dynamics in old wide binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 High-contrast imaging has been used to discover and characterize dozens of exoplanets to date. The primary limiting performance factor for these instruments is contrast, the ratio of exoplanet to host star brightness that an instrument can successfully resolve. Contrast is largely determined by wavefront error, consisting of uncorrected atmospheric turbulence and optical aberrations downstream of AO correction. Single-point diamond turning allows for high-precision optics to be manufactured for use in astronomical instrumentation, presenting a cheaper and more versatile alternative to conventional glass polishing. This work presents measurements of wavefront error for diamond-turned aluminum optics in the Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument, a 2-5 micron coronagraphic integral field spectrograph under construction for Keck Observatory. Wavefront error measurements for these optics are used to simulate SCALES' point spread function using physical optics propagation software poppy, showing that SCALES' contrast performance is not limited by wavefront error from internal instrument optics.
#### No Evidence for More Earth-sized Planets in the Habitable Zone of  Kepler's M versus FGK Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable detections of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone remain elusive in the Kepler sample, even for M dwarfs. The Kepler sample was once thought to contain a considerable number of M dwarf stars ($T_\mathrm{eff} < 4000$ K), which hosted enough Earth-sized ($[0.5,1.5]$ R$_\oplus$) planets to estimate their occurrence rate ($\eta_\oplus$) in the habitable zone. However, updated stellar properties from Gaia have shifted many Kepler stars to earlier spectral type classifications, with most stars (and their planets) now measured to be larger and hotter than previously believed. Today, only one partially-reliable Earth-sized candidate remains in the optimistic habitable zone, and zero in the conservative zone. Here we performed a new investigation of Kepler's Earth-sized planets orbiting M dwarf stars, using occurrence rate models with considerations of updated parameters and candidate reliability. Extrapolating our models to low instellations, we found an occurrence rate of $\eta_\oplus={8.58}_{-8.22}^{+17.94}\%$ for the conservative habitable zone (and ${14.22}_{-12.71}^{+24.96}\%$ for the optimistic), consistent with previous works when considering the large uncertainties. Comparing these estimates to those from similarly comprehensive studies of Sun-like stars, we found that the current Kepler sample does not offer evidence to support an increase in $\eta_\oplus$ from FGK to M stars. While the Kepler sample is too sparse to resolve an occurrence trend between early and mid-to-late M dwarfs for Earth-sized planets, studies including larger planets and/or data from the K2 and TESS missions are well-suited to this task.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers (BNS) produce high-energy emissions from several physically different sources, including a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its afterglow, a kilonova, and, at late times, a remnant many parsecs in size. Ionizing radiation from these sources can be dangerous for life on Earth-like planets when located too close. Work to date has explored the substantial danger posed by the GRB to on-axis observers: here we focus instead on the potential threats posed to nearby off-axis observers. Our analysis is based largely on observations of the GW 170817/GRB 170817A multi-messenger event, as well as theoretical predictions. For baseline kilonova parameters, we find that the X-ray emission from the afterglow may be lethal out to $\sim 5$ pc and the off-axis gamma-ray emission may threaten a range out to $\sim 4$ pc, whereas the greatest threat comes years after the explosion, from the cosmic rays accelerated by the kilonova blast, which can be lethal out to distances up to $\sim 11$ pc. The distances quoted here are typical, but the values have significant uncertainties and depend on the viewing angle, ejected mass, and explosion energy in ways we quantify. Assessing the overall threat to Earth-like planets, have a similar kill distance to supernovae, but are far less common. However, our results rely on the scant available kilonova data, and multi-messenger observations will clarify the danger posed by such events.

 We use an updated method for the detection of double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) using $v \sin{i}$ values from spectral fits. The method is applied to all spectra from LAMOST-MRS. Using this method, we detect 12426 SB2 candidates, where 4321 are already known and 8105 are new discoveries. We check their spectra manually to minimise possible false positives. We also detect several cases of contamination of the spectra by solar light. Additionally, for candidates with multiple observations we compute mass ratios with systemic velocities and determine Keplerian orbits. We present an updated catalogue of all SB2 candidates together with additional information for some of them in separate data tables.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological principle is fundamental to the standard cosmological model. It assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on very large scales. As the basic assumption, it must stand the test of various observations. In this paper, we map the all-sky distribution of cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{m}$ and $H_{0}$) and find that the distribution significantly deviates from isotropy by using the region fitting (RF) method. There exists a local matter underdensity region toward (${313.4^{\circ}}$$_{-18.2}^{+19.6}$, ${-16.8^{\circ}}$$_{-10.7}^{+11.1}$) and a preferred direction of the cosmic anisotropy (${308.4^{\circ}}$$_{-48.7}^{+47.6}$, ${-18.2^{\circ}}$$_{-28.8}^{+21.1}$) in galactic coordinates. Similar directions may imply that local matter density might be responsible for the anisotropy of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Results of statistical isotropy analyses including Isotropy and Isotropy with real-data positions (RP) show high confidence levels. For the local matter underdensity, the statistical significances are 2.78$\sigma$ (Isotropy) and 2.34$\sigma$ (Isotropy (RP)). For the cosmic anisotropy, the statistical significances are 3.96$\sigma$ (Isotropy) and 3.15$\sigma$ (Isotropy (RP)). The comparison of these two kinds of statistical isotropy analyses suggests that inhomogeneous spatial distribution of real sample can increase the deviation from isotropy. The similar results and findings are also found from reanalyses of the low-redshift sample (lp+) and the lower screening angle (\tm = 60$\degr$), but with a slight decrease in statistical significance. Overall, our results provide clear indications for a possible cosmic anisotropy. This possibility must be taken seriously. Further testing is needed to better understand this signal.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a close-in ($P_{\mathrm{orb}} = 3.349\:\mathrm{days}$) warm Neptune with clear transit timing variations (TTVs) orbiting the nearby ($d=47.3\:\mathrm{pc}$) active M4 star, TOI-2015. We characterize the planet's properties using TESS photometry, precise near-infrared radial velocities (RV) with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HP) Spectrograph, ground-based photometry, and high-contrast imaging. A joint photometry and RV fit yields a radius $R_p~=~3.37_{-0.20}^{+0.15} \:\mathrm{R_\oplus}$, mass $m_p~=~16.4_{-4.1}^{+4.1}\:\mathrm{M_\oplus}$, and density $\rho_p~=~2.32_{-0.37}^{+0.38} \:\mathrm{g cm^{-3}}$ for TOI-2015b, suggesting a likely volatile-rich planet. The young, active host star has a rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}}~=~8.7 \pm~0.9~\mathrm{days}$ and associated rotation-based age estimate of $1.1~\pm~0.1\:\mathrm{Gyr}$. Though no other transiting planets are seen in the TESS data, the system shows clear TTVs of super period $P_{\mathrm{sup}}~\approx~430\:\mathrm{days}$ and amplitude $\sim$$100\:\mathrm{minutes}$. After considering multiple likely period ratio models, we show an outer planet candidate near a 2:1 resonance can explain the observed TTVs while offering a dynamically stable solution. However, other possible two-planet solutions -- including 3:2 and 4:3 resonance -- cannot be conclusively excluded without further observations. Assuming a 2:1 resonance in the joint TTV-RV modeling suggests a mass of $m_b~=~13.3_{-4.5}^{+4.7}\:\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ for TOI-2015b and $m_c~=~6.8_{-2.3}^{+3.5}\:\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ for the outer candidate. Additional transit and RV observations will be beneficial to explicitly identify the resonance and further characterize the properties of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) identified 12 $\gamma$-ray sources emitting above 100 TeV gamma rays, making them potential PeV cosmic-ray accelerators (PeVatrons). Neutrino observations are crucial in determining whether the gamma-ray radiation process is due to hadronic or leptonic origin. In this paper, we study three detected sources, LHAASO J1908+0621, LHAASO J2018+3651, and LHAASO J2032+4102, which are also the most promising galactic high-energy neutrino candidate sources with the lowest pre-trial p-value based on the stacking searches testing for excess neutrino emission by IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We study the lepto-hadronic scenario for the observed multiband spectra of these LHAASO sources considering the possible counterpart source of the LHAASO sources. The very-high-energy gamma rays are entirely attributed to the hadronic contribution, therefore the most optimistic neutrino flux can be derived. Then, we evaluate the statistical significance (p-value) as the observational time of the IceCube and next-generation IceCube-Gen2 neutrino observatory respectively. We find that the origin of gamma rays totally from the hadronic process or at most partially from the hadronic process can be determined by IceCube-Gen2 for LHAASO J1908+0621 at a $5\sigma$ significance level with a running time of $\sim 10$ months. For LHAASO J2018+3651 and LHAASO J2032+4102, the required running time is $\sim 10$ years ($3\sigma$) and $\sim 4$ years ($5\sigma$), respectively. The future confirmation by the next-generation neutrino telescope will be crucial to understanding the particle acceleration and the radiation processes inside the sources.
#### The evolution of collision debris near the $ν_6$ secular resonance and  its role in the origin of terrestrial water

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents novel findings that broadens our understanding of the amount of water that can be transported to Earth. The key innovation lies in the combined usage of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and $N$-body codes to assess the role of collision fragments in water delivery. We also present a method for generating initial conditions that enables the projectile to impact at the designated location on the target's surface with the specified velocity. The primary objective of this study is to simulate giant collisions between two Ceres-sized bodies by SPH near the $\nu_6$ secular resonance and follow the evolution of the ejected debris by numerical $N$-body code. With our method 6 different initial conditions for the collision were determined and the corresponding impacts were simulated by SPH. Examining the orbital evolution of the debris ejected after collisions, we measured the amount of water delivered to Earth, which is broadly 0.001 ocean equivalents of water, except in one case where one large body transported 7\% oceans of water to the planet. Based on this, and taking into account the frequency of collisions, the amount of delivered water varies between 1.2 and 8.3 ocean's worth of water, depending on the primordial disk mass. According to our results, the prevailing external pollution model effectively accounts for the assumed water content on Earth, whether it's estimated at 1 or 10 ocean's worth of water.

 - **Abstract**
 Hera represents the European Space Agency's inaugural planetary defence space mission, and plays a pivotal role in the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment international collaboration with NASA DART mission that performed the first asteroid deflection experiment using the kinetic impactor techniques. With the primary objective of conducting a detailed post-impact survey of the Didymos binary asteroid following the DART impact on its small moon called Dimorphos, Hera aims to comprehensively assess and characterize the feasibility of the kinetic impactor technique in asteroid deflection while conducting in-depth investigation of the asteroid binary, including its physical and compositional properties as well as the effect of the impact on the surface and/or shape of Dimorphos. In this work we describe the Hera radio science experiment, which will allow us to precisely estimate key parameters, including the mass, which is required to determine the momentum enhancement resulting from the DART impact, mass distribution, rotational states, relative orbits, and dynamics of the asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos. Through a multi-arc covariance analysis we present the achievable accuracy for these parameters, which consider the full expected asteroid phase and are based on ground radiometric, Hera optical images, and Hera to CubeSats InterSatellite Link radiometric measurements. The expected formal uncertainties for Didymos and Dimorphos GM are better than 0.01% and 0.1%, respectively, while their J2 formal uncertainties are better than 0.1% and 10%, respectively. Regarding their rotational state, the absolute spin pole orientations of the bodies can be recovered to better than 1 degree, and Dimorphos spin rate to better than 10^-3%. Dimorphos reconstructed relative orbit can be estimated at the sub-m level [...]

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an application of artificial intelligence on mass spectrometry data for detecting habitability potential of ancient Mars. Although data was collected for planet Mars the same approach can be replicated for any terrestrial object of our solar system. Furthermore, proposed methodology can be adapted to any domain that uses mass spectrometry. This research is focused in data analysis of two mass spectrometry techniques, evolved gas analysis (EGA-MS) and gas chromatography (GC-MS), which are used to identify specific chemical compounds in geological material samples. The study demonstrates the applicability of EGA-MS and GC-MS data to extra-terrestrial material analysis. Most important features of proposed methodology includes square root transformation of mass spectrometry values, conversion of raw data to 2D sprectrograms and utilization of specific machine learning models and techniques to avoid overfitting on relative small datasets. Both EGA-MS and GC-MS datasets come from NASA and two machine learning competitions that the author participated and exploited. Complete running code for the GC-MS dataset/competition is available at GitHub.1 Raw training mass spectrometry data include [0, 1] labels of specific chemical compounds, selected to provide valuable insights and contribute to our understanding of the potential past habitability of Mars.
#### Constraining the formation history of the TOI-1338/BEBOP-1 circumbinary  planetary system

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of multiple planets in the circumbinary system TOI-1338/BEBOP-1 raises questions about how such a system formed. The formation of the system was briefly explored in the discovery paper, but only to answer the question do current pebble accretion models have the potential to explain the origin of the system? We use a global model of circumbinary planet formation that utilises N-body simulations, including prescriptions for planet migration, gas and pebble accretion, and interactions with a circumbinary disc, to explore the disc parameters that could have led to the formation of the TOI-1338/BEBOP-1 system. With the disc lifetime being the main factor in determining how planets form, we limit our parameter space to those that determine the disc lifetime. These are: the strength of turbulence in the disc, the initial disc mass, and the strength of the external radiation field that launches photoevaporative winds. When comparing the simulated systems to TOI-1338/BEBOP-1, we find that only discs with low levels of turbulence are able to produce similar systems. The radiation environment has a large effect on the types of planetary systems that form, whilst the initial disc mass only has limited impact since the majority of planetary growth occurs early in the disc lifetime. With the most TOI-1338/BEBOP-1 like systems all occupying similar regions of parameter space, our study shows that observed circumbinary planetary systems can potentially constrain the properties of planet forming discs.

 - **Abstract**
 The computational requirements of future large scale radio telescopes are expected to scale well beyond the capabilities of conventional digital resources. Current and planned telescopes are generally limited in their scientific potential by their ability to efficiently process the vast volumes of generated data. To mitigate this problem, we investigate the viability of emerging quantum computers for radio astronomy applications. In this a paper we demonstrate the potential use of variational quantum linear solvers in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers and combinatorial solvers in quantum annealers for a radio astronomy calibration pipeline. While we demonstrate that these approaches can lead to satisfying results when integrated in calibration pipelines, we show that current restrictions of quantum hardware limit their applicability and performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Adaptive Optics (AO) systems have become integral for ground-based astronomy. Based on the scientific case, there are various flavours of AO systems. Measuring the turbulence strength profile ($C_N^2(h)$) and other site characteristics is essential before selecting a site or implementing certain types of AO systems. We used an iterative deconvolution procedure on long-exposure H-$\alpha$ images of the Sun to determine the isoplanatic patch size during the daytime. Then, we determined the relationship between turbulence along different directions and also obtained an analytical estimate of the $C_N^2(h)$ profile.
#### A measurement of the dark energy equation of state with 40 strong lenses

 - **Abstract**
 Problems with the cosmological constant model of dark energy motivate the investigation of alternative scenarios. I make the first measurement of the dark energy equation of state using the hierarchical strong lensing time delay likelihood provided by TDCOSMO. I find that the combination of seven TDCOSMO lenses and 33 SLACS lenses is only able to provide an upper bound on the dark energy equation of state, $w < -1.75$, which nevertheless implies the presence of a phantom dark energy component. When the strong lensing time delay data is combined with a collection of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation and Type Ia supernova data, I find that the equation of state remains consistent with a cosmological constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We have considered both non-CHIME and CHIME FRBs in the present study. Our robust conclusion is that there are two categories of non-CHIME FRBs - high luminosity density and low luminosity density events, with majority of the repeaters falling in the latter category. In order to circumvent the non-availability of measured fluence and flux density of the CHIME FRBs, we have devised a novel dimensionless approach that utilizes the ratio of the estimated CHIME lower limits to the fluence as well as to the flux density to investigate the presence of trends and patterns in both non-CHIME as well as CHIME FRB population. We have introduced several physically meaningful dimensionless quantities, and one of the robust results is that the computed values of these are almost same for both CHIME and non-CHIME events. This universality is also seen in the distributions of the computed dimensionless quantities and the underlying trends. In the case of CHIME repeaters, distributions of few of the dimensionless quantities hint at the existence of two modes of repeating radio transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation of substructures in protoplanetary disks is vital for gaining insights into dust growth and the process of planet formation. Studying these substructures in highly embedded Class 0 objects using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), however, poses significant challenges. Nonetheless, it is imperative to do so to unravel the mechanisms and timing behind the formation of these substructures. In this study, we present high-resolution ALMA data at Bands 6 and 4 of the NGC1333 IRAS4A Class 0 protobinary system. This system consists of two components, A1 and A2, separated by 1.8" and located in the Perseus molecular cloud at $\sim$293 pc distance. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dust properties and formation of substructures in the early stages, we conducted a multi-wavelength analysis of IRAS4A1. Additionally, we sought to address whether the lack of observed substructures in very young disks, could be attributed to factors such as high degrees of disk flaring and large scale heights. To explore this phenomenon, we employed radiative transfer models using RADMC-3D. Our multi-wavelength analysis of A1 discovered characteristics such as high dust surface density, substantial dust mass within the disk, and elevated dust temperatures. These findings suggest the presence of large dust grains compared to the ones in the interstellar medium (ISM), greater than 100 microns in size within the region. Furthermore, while there's no direct detection of any substructure, our models indicate that some, such as a small gap, must be present. In summary, this result implies that disk substructures may be masked or obscured by a large scale height in combination with a high degree of flaring in Class 0 disks. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of the inner heliosphere by Parker Solar Probe has revealed a highly structured solar wind with ubiquitous deflections from the Parker spiral, known as switchbacks. Interchange reconnection (IR) may play an important role in generating these switchbacks by forming unstable particle distributions that generate wave activity that in turn may evolve to such structures. IR occurs in very low beta plasmas and in the presence of strong guiding fields. Although IR is unlikely to release enough energy to provide an important contribution to the heating and acceleration of the solar wind, it affects the way the solar wind is connected to its sources, connecting open field lines to regions of closed fields. This "switching on" provides a mechanism by which plasma near coronal hole boundaries can mix with that trapped inside the closed loops. This mixing can lead to a new energy balance. It may significantly change the characteristics of the solar wind because this plasma is already pre-heated and can potentially have quite different density and particle distributions. It not only replenishes the solar wind, but also affects the electric field, which in turn affects the energy balance. This interpenetration is manifested by the formation of a bimodal ion distribution, with a core and a beam-like population. Such distributions are indeed frequently observed by the Parker Solar Probe. Here we provide a first step towards assessing the role of such processes in accelerating and heating the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Six archival Chandra observations are matched with eight sets of radio data and studied in the context of the outflow method to measure and study the spin properties of $\rm{Sgr ~A^*}$. Three radio and X-ray data sets obtained simultaneously, or partially simultaneously, are identified as preferred for the purpose of measuring the spin properties of $\rm{Sgr ~A^*}$. Similar results are obtained with other data sets. Results obtained with the preferred data sets are combined and indicate a weighted mean value of the spin function of $\rm{F} = 0.62 \pm 0.10$ and dimensionless spin angular momentum of $\rm{a_*} = 0.90 \pm 0.06$. The spin function translates into measurements of the black hole rotational mass, $\rm{M_{rot}}$, irreducible mass, $\rm{M_{irr}}$, and spin mass-energy available for extraction, $\rm{M_{spin}}$, relative to the total black hole dynamical mass, $\rm{M_{dyn}}$. Weighted mean values of $\rm{(M_{rot}/M_{dyn}) = (0.53 \pm 0.06)}$, $\rm{({M_{irr}/M_{dyn})} = (0.85 \pm 0.04)}$, $\rm{({M_{spin}/M_{dyn})} = (0.15 \pm 0.04)}$, $\rm{{M_{rot}} = (2.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^6 ~M_{\odot}}$, $\rm{{M_{irr}} = (3.5 \pm 0.2) \times 10^6 ~M_{\odot}}$, and $\rm{{M_{spin}} = (6.2 \pm 1.6) \times 10^5 ~M_{\odot}}$ are obtained; of course $\rm{{(M_{rot}/M_{irr})} = (0.62 \pm 0.10)}$ since $\rm{{(M_{rot}/M_{irr})} = F}$. Values obtained for $\rm{Sgr ~A^*}$ are compared with those obtained for M87 based on the published spin function which indicate that M87 carries substantially more rotational energy and spin mass-energy relative to the total (i.e., dynamical) black hole mass, the irreducible black hole mass, and in absolute terms.

 - **Abstract**
 Determination of fundamental parameters of stars impacts all fields of astrophysics, from galaxy evolution to constraining the internal structure of exoplanets. This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard's star that compares an exceptionally high-quality (signal-to-noise ratio of $>$2500 in the $H$ band), high-resolution NIR spectrum taken with CFHT/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similar large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths, all of these can be a source of bias for abundance determination. Out of $>10^4$ observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature and overall metallicity of slowly-rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer $T_{\rm eff}$ = 3231 $\pm$ 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 $\pm$ 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide abundance measurements of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.
