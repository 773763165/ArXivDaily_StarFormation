 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a pivotal role in shaping their galactic surroundings due to their high luminosity and intense ionizing radiation. However, the precise mechanisms governing the formation of massive stars remain elusive. Complex organic molecules (COMs) offer an avenue for studying star formation across the low- to high-mass spectrum because COMs are found in every young stellar object phase and offer insight into the structure and temperature. We aim to unveil evolutionary patterns of COM chemistry in 41 massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) sourced from diverse catalogues, using ALMA Band 6 spectra. Previous line analysis of these sources showed the presence of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$CCH with diverse excitation temperatures and column densities, indicating a possible evolutionary path across sources. However, this analysis usually involves manual line extraction and rotational diagram fitting. Here, we improve upon this process by directly retrieving the physicochemical state of MYSOs from their dimensionally-reduced spectra. We use a Locally Linear Embedding to find a lower-dimensional projection for the physicochemical parameters obtained from individual line analysis. We identify clusters of similar MYSOs in this embedded space using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We find three groups of MYSOs with distinct physicochemical conditions: i) cold, COM-poor sources, ii) warm, medium-COM-abundance sources, and iii) hot, COM-rich sources. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the spectral sample, finding further evidence for an evolutionary path across MYSO groups. Finally, we find that the physicochemical state of our sample can be derived directly from the spectra by training a simple random forest model on the first few PCA components. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in obtaining clear physical insights directly from MYSO spectra.

          Timescales of Solar System Formation Based on Al-Ti Isotope Correlation by Supernova Ejecta

 - **Abstract**
 The radioactive decay of short-lived 26Al to 26Mg has been used to estimate the timescales over which 26Al was produced in a nearby star and the protosolar disk evolved. The chronology commonly assumes that 26Al was uniformly distributed in the protosolar disk; however, this assumption is challenged by the discordance between the timescales defined by the Al-Mg and assumption-free Pb-Pb chronometers. We find that the 26Al heterogeneity is correlated with the nucleosynthetic stable Ti isotope variation, which can be ascribed to the non-uniform distribution of ejecta from a core-collapse supernova in the disk. We use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to calibrate variable 26Al abundances in Al-Mg dating of early solar system processes. The calibrated Al-Mg chronometer indicates a >1 Myr gap between parent body accretion ages of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrites. We further use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to constrain the timing and location of the supernova explosion, indicating that the explosion occurred at 20-30 pc from the protosolar cloud, 0.94 +0.25/-0.21 Myr before the formation of the oldest solar system solids. Our results imply that the Sun was born in association with a ~25 solar mass star.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological implications of a generalized total equation of state (EoS) model by constraining its parameters using observational datasets to effectively characterize the universe's expansion history and its dynamic properties. We introduce three parameters: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $n$ to capture the EoS behavior across different evolutionary phases. Our analysis indicates that at high redshifts ($z \gg 1$), the EoS approaches a matter- or radiation-dominated regime, transitioning to a dark energy-dominated phase as $z \to -1$, where it tends towards a constant value $\alpha$. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we analyze a combined dataset that includes 31 data points from $H(z)$ and 1701 data points from the Pantheon+ dataset. The results reveal a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration in the universe's expansion, with current EoS values suggesting quintessence-like behavior. The model aligns with observations and indicates that dark energy is dynamically evolving rather than acting as a cosmological constant. Furthermore, energy conditions and stability analyses highlight the nature and future of dark energy. This parametrized EoS model thus offers a robust framework for understanding the complexities of dark energy and the evolution of the cosmos.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which are highly energetic bursts, have been detected at high redshifts (z = 9.4) and are pivotal for cosmological research and the study of Population III stars. To address these studies, it is important to identify correlations between the key GRB variables while minimizing uncertainties. This requires comprehensive coverage of GRB Light curves (LCs), which are challenging to obtain given the observational gaps and noise. This study explores the reconstruction of GRB LCs using three machine-learning models: Bi-LSTM, CGAN, and a Sarimax-based Kalman filter. To evaluate these approaches, we also include well-established functional form parametric methods such as the Willingale model (W07) and the non-parametric Gaussian Processes (GPs), expanding upon arXiv:2305.12126 by applying our techniques to a larger sample of 545 GRBs, covering four different GRB classifications. Our findings reveal that the LSTM model achieves the highest reductions in the uncertainties of the plateau parameters, with decreases of 29% in log Ta, 31% in log Fa and 40% in {\alpha}. In comparison, GPs show a slightly smaller reduction of 22% in both log Ta and log Fa, and 32% in {\alpha} while CGANs exhibit a decrease of 23% in log Ta, 24% in log Fa, and 31% in {\alpha}. The Sarimax-based Kalman filter performs well for well-sampled and flare-free GRBs, but it has problems with reconstruction in more complex cases. It shows a decrease of 14% in log Ta, 5% in log Fa and 6% in {\alpha}. [..] For the subset of 299 Good GRBs, namely with well-defined plateau emission with no flares and bumps, the LSTM model achieved a reduction of approximately 40%, with a percentage increase of 8% compared to the results observed in arXiv:2305.12126. [..] These advancements are essential for using GRBs as standard candles in cosmology and investigating theoretical models.[..]

          Neutron star stability beyond the mass peak: assessing the role of out-of-equilibrium perturbations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the radial stability of neutron stars under conditions where their composition may or may not remain in chemical equilibrium during oscillations. Using different equations of state that include nucleons, hyperons, and/or $\Delta$ resonances, we compute stellar configurations and examine their fundamental mode frequencies in two limiting scenarios. In one limit, nuclear reactions are fast enough to maintain chemical equilibrium throughout the pulsation, resulting in a lower effective adiabatic index, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{EQ}}$, and softer stellar responses. In the opposite limit, nuclear reactions are too slow to adjust particle abundances during oscillations, yielding a higher index, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{FR}}$, and stiffer stellar responses. We find that the equilibrium scenario triggers dynamic instability at the maximum mass configuration, whereas the frozen composition scenario allows stable solutions to persist beyond this mass, extending the stable branch. This effect is modest for simpler equations of state, but becomes increasingly pronounced for more complex compositions, where the emergence of new particle species at high densities leads to a significant disparity between $\Gamma_{\mathrm{EQ}}$ and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{FR}}$. Realistic conditions, in which different nuclear reactions have distinct timescales, will place the effective $\Gamma$ between these two extreme values. Short-timescale reactions push the star toward the equilibrium limit, potentially restricting the length of the stable branch. Conversely, slow reactions preserve a frozen composition, allowing the stable branch to grow. Thus, the actual extent of the stable configuration range depends critically on the interplay between nuclear-reaction timescales and the star's fundamental oscillation period.

          Orbital maneuvers for a space probe around Titania

 - **Abstract**
 For most space missions, it is interesting that the probe remains for a considerable time around the mission target. The longer the lifetime of a mission, the greater the chances of collecting information about the orbited body. In this work, we present orbital maneuvers that aim to show how to avoid a collision of a space probe with the surface of Titania. Through an expansion of the gravitational potential to the second order, the asymmetry of the gravitational field due to the coefficient $C_{22}$ of Titania, the zonal coefficient $J_2$, and the gravitational perturbation of Uranus are considered. Two models of coplanar bi-impulse maneuvers are presented. The first maneuver consists of transferring an initial elliptical orbit to a final circular orbit, and the second has the objective of transferring an initial elliptical orbit to a final orbit that is also elliptical. The lag in the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbits is investigated before performing the maneuvers. To point out the best scenarios for carrying out the maneuvers, a study is presented for different points of an orbit where transfers could be made. In addition, a maneuver strategy is presented to correct the variation of the periapsis argument. The results show that maneuvers performed a few days after integration are more economical than maneuvers performed later, a few days before the collision. The economy of the maneuvers is also demonstrated through an analysis of the ratio of the increase in speed to the lifetime.

          A Slowly Flattening Milky Way Stellar Disk: Investigating Galactic Warping through Dynamical Orbital Inclinations of Open Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 By evaluating angular momentum directions of open cluster (OC) samples across various Galactocentric radii, we assessed their orbital plane inclinations. Our findings reveal that, without considering the local tilt of the Galactic disk near the sun, our results are consistent with previous studies on Classical Cepheids (CCs). Notably, the warp precession derived from OCs closely mirror those of CCs. Nonetheless, we observed a systematic deviation between the geometric and dynamic warps, attributable to the tilt of the local disk. We identified a systematic vertical motion in the local region, associated with the warping feature near the solar vicinity. Ignoring this motion leads to underestimates of orbital plane inclinations compared to those derived from geometric positions. Our study indicates consistency between the inclinations derived from orbital dynamics and geometric positions at a vertical velocity of the sun relative to the Galactic mid-plane of Vz_sun = 9.4(0.2) km/s. This value is approximately 2 km/s higher than the historically estimated solar peculiar motion, W_sun, primarily due to an approximately 0.6-degree tilt of the local plane. Analysis suggests that previous estimates of the Galactic disk's warping precession rate may have been overestimated due to local warping influences. The findings indicate that the precession oscillates around zero and that the Galactic warp is progressively flattening. Additionally, the line of nodes tends to become consistent across various Galactocentric radii over a timescale of 100-200 million years.

          Uncovering the hidden physical structures and protostellar activities in the Low-Metallicity S284-RE region: results from ALMA and JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 HII region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass $\sim$2402 $M_{\odot}$, length $\sim$8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 $\mu$m/3.6 $\mu$m map traces the H$_{2}$ outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved, YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of non-thermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H$_{2}$ outflows, with four (olc1--olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1--ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, ALMA continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources, #2 and #3, from the $M$-$R_{\rm eff}$ plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. The ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas the ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within the continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by Br-$\alpha$ and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H$_{2}$ knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the $\sim$2.7 pc H$_{2}$ outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.

          Forecasts of effects of beam systematics and deprojection on the third generation ground-based CMB experiment

 - **Abstract**
 The ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background experiments are susceptible to various instrumental errors, especially for $B$-mode measurements. The difference between the response of two polarized detectors, referred to as the ``beam mismatch'', would induce a $T\rightarrow P$ leakage when differencing the detector pair to cancel the unpolarized signal. In this work, we apply the deprojection technique on the time-ordered mock data to mitigate the systematic contamination caused by beam mismatches, by assuming the third generation ground-based CMB experiment (S3). Our results show that the deprojection could effectively recover the input power spectra. We adopt the NILC and cILC methods to reconstruct the foreground-cleaned $TEB$ maps, and evaluate the level of residual systematic errors after the foreground cleaning pipeline by comparing the power spectra between the systematics-added data after deprojection and the systematics-free data. The results demonstrate that the residual beam systematics cleaned by deprojection would not bias the CMB measurements of $T$, $E$, and $B$ modes, as well as the CMB lensing reconstruction and the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio under the S3 sensitivity.

          Characterizing the equivalence between dark energy and radiation using gamma-ray bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Differently from the equivalence time between either matter and radiation or dark energy and matter, the equivalence between dark energy and radiation occurs between two subdominant fluids, since it takes place in the matter dominated epoch. However, dark energy--radiation equivalence may correspond to a \emph{cosmographic bound} since it strongly depends on how dark energy evolves. Accordingly, a possible model-independent bound on this time would give hints on how dark energy evolves in time. In this respect, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be used, in fact, as tracers to obtain cosmic constraints on this equivalence. Consequently, based on observed GR data from the $E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation, we here go beyond by simulating additional GRB data points and investigating two distinct equivalence epochs: 1) dark energy--radiation, and 2) dark energy--radiation with matter. We thus extract constraints on the corresponding two redshifts adopting Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations by means of two methods: the first performing the GRB calibration and the cosmological fit steps independently, and the second performing these steps simultaneously by resorting a hierarchical Bayesian regression. To keep the analysis model-independent, we consider a generic dark energy model, with the unique constraint to reduce to the $\Lambda$CDM at $z=0$. Our findings are thus compared to theoretical predictions, indicating that the $\Lambda$CDM model is statistically favored to predict such an equivalence time, though a slow evolution with time cannot be fully excluded. Finally, we critically re-examine the Hubble constant tension in view of our outcomes.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the analogy between graviton emission in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, where photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, describing the inflationary graviton state. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, we find secular growth in the graviton number, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis within approximately ten Hubble times after reheating. We also explore analogous effects in a Minkowski background. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of $O(10)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at $O(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a mechanism to amplify gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it points to potential advancements in gravitational wave measurements.

          Evolution of massive black hole in galactic nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a scenario for mass evolution of massive black holes (MBH) in galactic nuclei, to explain both the mass correlation of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with the bulge and the down-sizing behavior of the active galactic nuclei. Primordial gas structures to evolve galactic bulges are supposed to be formed at $z \sim$ 10 and the core region, called the nuclear region (NR) here, is considered to be a place for a MBH to grow to the SMBH. The down-sizing behavior requires the MBH to significantly increase the mass in a time $\sim$ 1 Gyr. The rapid mass increase is discussed to be realized only when the MBH stays in a very high density region such as a core of a molecular cloud throughout the period $\sim$ 1 Gyr. According to these arguments, the MBHs formed from the population III stars born in the mini halos at $z \sim$ 20 - 30 are excluded from the candidates for the seed black hole to the SMBH and only the MBHs from the population II stars born in the core of the central molecular cloud (CMC) in the NR remain as them. The MBHs in the dense core of the CMC started increasing the mass through mass-accretion and the most massive black hole (MMBH) got the most rapid evolution, possibly restraining relatively slow evolutions of the less massive black holes. Dynamical interactions of the MMBH with the ambient MCs induced the wandering motion and the further mass-increase. However, when the MMBH mass exceeded a boundary mass, the dynamical friction with the field stars brakes the MMBH wandering and the mass accretion. This scenario can semi-quantitatively reproduce both the down-sizing behavior and the SMBH mass - bulge mass correlation with reasonable parameter values.

 - **Abstract**
 (Invited Review) According to modern definition, a symbiotic nova is an otherwise normal nova (i.e. powered by explosive thermonuclear burning) that erupts within a symbiotic star, which is a binary where a WD accretes from a cool giant companion. Guided primarily by the very well observed eruptions of RS Oph in 2006 and 2021, and that of V407 Cyg in 2010, we investigate the main multi-wavelength properties of symbiotic novae and their relation to classical novae, and propose a 3D model structure that identifies the emitting source location for hard and supersoft X-rays, radio syncrothron and thermal, permitted and forbidden emission lines. Very few symbiotic novae are known in the Galaxy, and we compile a revised catalog based on firm astrometric identification. The exciting prospect of an imminent new outburst of T CrB is also discussed.

 We describe the result of our numerical orbit simulation which traces dynamical evolution of new comets coming from the Oort Cloud. We combine two dynamical models for this purpose. The first one is semi-analytic, and it models an evolving comet cloud under galactic tide and encounters with nearby stars. The second one numerically deals with planetary perturbation in the planetary this http URL our study does not include physical effects such as fading or disintegration of comets, we found that typical dynamical resident time of the comets in the planetary region is about $10^8$ years. We also found that the so-called planet barrier works when the initial orbital inclination of the comets is small. A numerical result concerning the temporary transition of the comets into other small body populations such as transneptunian objects or Centaurs is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work the observational constraints on interaction coupling parameter between dynamical dark energy and cold dark matter were obtained using CMB, BAO and SN Ia data. The dark energy in considered models is dynamical and evolution of its equation of state parameter depends on dark coupling and internal properties of the dark energy. Such model is believed to be more physically consistent than models of interacting dark energy considered in previous works. Constraints were made for three types of interaction. The first two are the types which are often considered in other works on interacting dark energy. The third type has the non-linear dependence on densities of dark components and is studied for the first time. Observational constraints on Hubble constant $H_{0}$ for the first two models are in strong disagreement with so called local measurements of $H_{0}$. And the third model is in better agreement with local measurements than $\Lambda$CDM model. Also for the last non-linear model existence of non-zero interaction was found at greater than $1\sigma$ significance level.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The C-19 stellar stream is the most metal-poor stream known to date. While its width and velocity dispersion indicate a dwarf galaxy origin, its metallicity spread and abundance patterns are more similar to those of globular clusters (GCs). If it is indeed of GC origin, its extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-3.4, estimated from giant stars) implies that these stellar systems can form out of gas that is as extremely poor in metals as this. Previously, only giant stream stars were observed spectroscopically, although the majority of stream stars are unevolved stars. Aims: We pushed the spectroscopic observations to the subgiant branch stars ($G\approx 20$) in order to consolidate the chemical and dynamical properties of C-19. Methods: We used the high-efficiency spectrograph X-shooter fed by the ESO 8.2 m VLT telescope to observe 15 candidate subgiant C-19 members. The spectra were used to measure radial velocities and to determine chemical abundances using the \mygi\ code. Results; We developed a likelihood model that takes metallicity and radial velocities into account. We conclude that 12 stars are likely members of C-19, while 3 stars (S05, S12, and S13) are likely contaminants. When these 3 stars are excluded, our model implies a mean metallicity $\rm \langle [Fe/H]\rangle = -3.1\pm 0.1$, the mean radial velocity is $\langle v_r\rangle = -192\pm3$ kms$^{-1}$, and the velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{vr} = 5.9^{+3.6}_{-5.9}$ kms$^{-1}$. This all agrees within errors with previous studies. The A(Mg) of a sample of 15 C-19 members, including 6 giant stars, shows a standard deviation of 0.44 dex, and the mean uncertainty on Mg is 0.25 dex. Conclusions: Our preferred interpretation of the current data is that C-19 is a disrupted GC. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that the GC could have belonged to a dwarf galaxy that contained more metal-rich stars, however. This scenario would explain the radial velocity members at higher metallicity, as well as the width and velocity dispersion of the stream. In either case, a GC formed out of gas as poor in metals as these stars seems necessary to explain the existence of C-19. The possibility that no GC was associated with C-19 cannot be ruled out either.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$ frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements, marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise, and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$ into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps particularly disruptive.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a re-discovery of G278.94+1.35 as possibly one of the largest known Galactic supernova remnants (SNR) - that we name Diprotodon. While previously established as a Galactic SNR, Diprotodon is visible in our new EMU and GLEAM radio continuum images at an angular size of 3.33x3.23 deg, much larger than previously measured. At the previously suggested distance of 2.7 kpc, this implies a diameter of 157x152 pc. This size would qualify Diprotodon as the largest known SNR and pushes our estimates of SNR sizes to the upper limits. We investigate the environment in which the SNR is located and examine various scenarios that might explain such a large and relatively bright SNR appearance. We find that Diprotodon is most likely at a much closer distance of $\sim$1 kpc, implying its diameter is 58x56 pc and it is in the radiative evolutionary phase. We also present a new Fermi-LAT data analysis that confirms the angular extent of the SNR in gamma-rays. The origin of the high-energy emission remains somewhat puzzling, and the scenarios we explore reveal new puzzles, given this unexpected and unique observation of a seemingly evolved SNR having a hard GeV spectrum with no breaks. We explore both leptonic and hadronic scenarios, as well as the possibility that the high-energy emission arises from the leftover particle population of a historic pulsar wind nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we analyzed multi-wavelength data of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 to investigate its emission mechanisms during a flaring state observed in early 2015. We examined the temporal behavior and broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during the flare. The size of the $\gamma$-ray emission region was estimated based on the variability timescale. To explore the multi-wavelength properties of S5 0716+714, we employed three one-zone models: the SSC model, the SSC plus EC model, and the SSC plus pp interactions model, to reproduce the SEDs. Our findings indicate that while the SSC model can describe the SEDs, it requires an extreme Doppler factor. In contrast, the SSC plus EC model successfully fits the SEDs under the assumption of weak external photon fields but requires a high Doppler factor. Additionally, the SSC plus interactions model also reproduces the SEDs, with $\gamma$-ray emission originating from $\pi^{0}$ decay. However, this model leads to a jet power that exceeds the Eddington luminosity, which remains plausible due to the flaring state or the presence of a highly collimated jet.

          Mergers of Binary Primordial Black Holes in Evolving Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 The influence of a dark matter halo around pair of primordial black holes on their orbit evolution and the black hole merger rate is considered. Because of the nonspherical (nonradial) contraction of DM shells, each shell upon the first contraction passes through the halo center in the direction of the radius vector corresponding to zero angular momentum. Since the shell contraction is a continuous process, at each instant of time there is a nonzero dark matter density at the halo center. This density is determined by the influence of the tidal gravitational forces from inflationary density perturbations and from other primordial black holes. The scattering of dark matter particles by a pair of black holes leads to a loss of the energy of its orbital motion and to an accelerated pair merger. In the case of primordial black holes with masses $\sim30M_\odot$, the black hole merger rate in the presence of a dark matter halo is several times higher than that without such a halo.

          Recovering 21cm global signal from 21cm power spectrum with artificial neural network

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover the 21cm global signal from the 21cm power spectrum using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The 21cm global signal is crucial for understanding cosmic evolution from the Dark Ages through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). While interferometers like LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA focus on detecting the 21cm power spectrum, single-dish experiments such as EDGES target the global signal. Our method utilizes ANNs to establish a connection between these two observables, providing a means to cross-validate independent 21cm line observations. This capability is significant as it allows different observational approaches to verify each other's results, ensuring greater reliability in 21cm cosmology. We demonstrate that our ANN-based approach can accurately recover the 21cm global signal across a wide redshift range (z=7.5-35) from simulated data, even when realistic thermal noise levels, such as those expected from SKA-1, are considered. This cross-validation process strengthens the robustness of 21cm signal analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Ristretto spectrograph is dedicated to the detection and analysis of exoplanetary atmospheres, with a primary focus on the temperate rocky world Proxima b. This scientific endeavor relies on the interplay of a high-contrast adaptive optics (AO) system and a high-resolution echelle spectrograph. In this work, I present a comprehensive simulation of Ristretto's output spectra, employing the Python package Pyechelle. Starting from realistic spectra of both exoplanets and their host stars, I generate synthetic 2D spectra to closely resemble those that will be produced by Ristretto itself. These synthetic spectra are subsequently treated as authentic data and therefore analyzed. These simulations facilitate not only the investigation of potential exoplanetary atmospheres but also an in-depth assessment of the inherent capabilities and limitations of the Ristretto spectrograph.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. However, in contrast to other primordial GW sources whose signal may be modeled by simple analytic expressions, computing the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the numerical evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This shortcoming motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a "pedestrian" perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The methoxy radical, CH$_3$O, has long been studied experimentally and theoretically by spectroscopists because it displays a weak Jahn-Teller effect in its electronic ground state, combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we report an extension of the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the radical in its vibrational ground state in the submillimeter-wave region (350$-$860 GHz). CH$_3$O was produced by H-abstraction from methanol using F-atoms, and its spectrum was probed in absorption using an association of source-frequency modulation and Zeeman modulation spectroscopy. All the observed transitions together with available literature data in $v = 0$ were combined and fit using an effective Hamiltonian allowing to reproduce the data at their experimental accuracy. The newly measured transitions involve significantly higher frequencies and rotational quantum numbers than those reported in the literature ($f < 860$ GHz and $N \leq 15$ instead of 272 GHz and 7, respectively) which results in significant improvements in the spectroscopic parameters determination. The present model is well constrained and allows a reliable calculation of the rotational spectrum of the radical over the entire microwave to submillimeter-wave domain. It can be used with confidence for future searches of CH$_3$O in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 With the emergence of new radio telescopes promising larger fields of view at lower observation frequencies (e.g., SKA), addressing direction-dependent effects (DDE) (e.g., direction-specific beam responses), polarisation leakage, and pointing errors has become all the more important. Be it through A-projection or otherwise, addressing said effects often requires reliable representations of antenna/station beams; yet, these require significant amounts of computational memory as they are baseline-, frequency-, time-, and polarisation-dependent. A novel prototype is reported here to approximate antenna beams suitable for SKA-MID using Zernike polynomials. It is shown that beam kernels can be well approximated, paving the way for future optimisations towards facilitating more efficient beam-dependent solutions and approaches to tackling the aforementioned challenges, all of which are essential for large-scale radio telescopes.

 In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.

          Investigating Temporal and Spatial Variation of Jupiter's Atmosphere with Radio Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spatial and temporal variability in Jupiter's atmosphere by comparing longitude-resolved brightness temperature maps from the Very Large Array (VLA) radio observatory and NASA's Juno spacecraft Microwave Radiometer (MWR) taken between 2013 and 2018. Spatial variations in brightness temperature, as observed at radio wavelengths, indicate dynamics in the atmosphere as they trace spatial fluctuations in radio-absorbing trace gases or physical temperature. We use four distinct frequency bands, probing the atmosphere from the water cloud region at the lowest frequency to the pressures above the ammonia cloud deck at the highest frequency. We visualize the brightness temperature anomalies and trace dynamics by analyzing the shapes of brightness temperature anomaly distributions as a function of frequency in Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB), Equatorial Zone (EZ), and South Equatorial Belt (SEB). The NEB has the greatest brightness temperature variability at all frequencies, indicating that more extreme processes are occurring there than in the SEB and EZ. In general, we find that the atmosphere at 5 and 22 GHz has the least variability of the frequencies considered, while observations at 10 and 15 GHz have the greatest variability. When comparing the size of the features corresponding to the anomalies, we find evidence for small-scale events primarily at the depths probed by the 10 and 15 GHz observations. In contrast, we find larger-scale structures deeper (5 GHz) and higher (22 GHz) in the atmosphere.
