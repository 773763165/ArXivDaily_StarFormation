          HST SHEL: Enabling Comparative Exoplanetology with HST/STIS

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been our most prolific tool to study exoplanet atmospheres. As the age of JWST begins, there is a wealth of HST archival data that is useful to strengthen our inferences from JWST. Notably, HST/STIS and its 0.3-1 $\mu$m wavelength coverage extends past JWST's 0.6 $\mu$m wavelength cutoff and holds an abundance of potential information: alkali (Na, K) and molecular (TiO, VO) species opacities, aerosol information, and the presence of stellar contamination. However, time series observations with HST suffer from significant instrumental systematics and can be highly dependent on choices made during the transit fitting process. This makes comparing transmission spectra of planets with different data reduction methodologies challenging, as it is difficult to discern if an observed trend is caused by differences in data reduction or underlying physical processes. Here, we present the Sculpting Hubble's Exoplanet Legacy (SHEL) program, which aims to build a consistent data reduction and light curve analysis methodology and associated database of transmission spectra from archival HST observations. In this paper, we present the SHEL analysis framework for HST/STIS and its low-resolution spectroscopy modes, G430L and G750L. We apply our methodology to four notable hot Jupiters: WASP-39 b, WASP-121 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-17 b, and use these examples to discuss nuances behind analysis with HST/STIS. Our results for WASP-39 b, WASP-121 b, and WASP-17 b are consistent with past publications, but our analysis of WASP-69 b differs and shows evidence of either a strong scattering slope or stellar contamination. The data reduction pipeline and tutorials are available on Github.

          Analytical models for secular descents in hierarchical triple systems

 - **Abstract**
 Triple body systems are prevalent in nature, from planetary to stellar to supermassive black hole scales. In a hierarchical triple system, oscillations of the inner orbit's eccentricity and inclination can be induced on secular timescales. Over many cycles, the octupole-level terms in the secular equations of motion can drive the system to extremely high eccentricities via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. The overall decrease in the inner orbit's pericenter distance has potentially dramatic effects for realistic systems, such as tidal disruption. We present an analytical approximation in the test particle limit to describe the step-wise eccentricity evolution of the inner orbit. We also integrate the equations of motion and present approximations in both the test particle limit and in the general case to describe the overall octupole-level time evolution of the eccentricity. The analytical approximations are compared to numerical simulations to show that the models accurately describe the form and timescale of the secular descent from large distances to a close-encounter distance (e.g., the Roche limit). By circumventing the need for numerical simulations to obtain the long-term behavior, these approximations can be used to readily estimate descent timescales for populations of systems. We demonstrate by calculating rates of EKL-driven migration for Hot Jupiters in stellar binaries.

          HOLISMOKES XIII: Strong-lens candidates at all mass scales and their environments from the Hyper-Suprime Cam and deep learning

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed a systematic search for galaxy-scale strong lenses using Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data, focusing on lenses in overdense environments. To identify these lens candidates, we exploit our neural network from HOLISMOKES VI, which is trained on realistic gri mock-images as positive examples, and real images as negative examples. Compared to our previous work, we lower the i-Kron radius limit to >0.5". This results in an increase by around 73 million sources to more than 135 million images. During our visual multi-stage grading of the network candidates, we now inspect simultaneously larger stamps (80"x80") to identify large, extended arcs cropped in the 10"x10" cutouts, and classify additionally their overall environment. Here we also reinspect our previous lens candidates and classify their environment. Using these 546 visually identified lens candidates, we further define various criteria by exploiting extensive and complementary photometric redshift catalogs, to select the candidates in overdensities. In total, we identified 24 grade-A and 138 grade-B candidates with either spatially-resolved multiple images or extended, distorted arcs in the new sample. Furthermore, with our different techniques, we identify in total 237/546 lens candidates in a cluster-like or overdense environment, containing only 49 group- or cluster-scale re-discoveries. These results demonstrate the feasibility of downloading and applying network classifiers to hundreds of million cutouts, necessary in the upcoming era of big data from deep, wide-field imaging surveys like Euclid and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, while leading to a sample size that can be inspected by humans. These networks, with false-positive rates of ~0.01%, are very powerful tools to identify such rare galaxy-scale strong lensing systems, while also aiding in the discovery of new strong lensing clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach is the default framework for performing precision tests of gravity in nearby astrophysical systems. In recent works we have extended this approach for cosmological applications, and in this paper we use observations of the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the time variation of the PPN parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ between last scattering and the present day. We find their time-averages over cosmological history should be within $\sim 20\%$ of their values in GR, with $\bar{\alpha}=0.89^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. We also constrain the time derivatives of these parameters, and find that their present-day values should be within a factor of two of the best Solar System constraints. Many of these results have no counter-part from Solar System observations, and are entirely new constraints on the gravitational interaction. In all cases, we find that the data strongly prefer $\bar{\alpha}\simeq \bar{\gamma}$, meaning that observers would typically find local gravitational physics to be compatible with GR, despite considerable variation of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ being allowed over cosmic history. This study lays the groundwork for future precision tests of gravity that combine observations made over all cosmological and astrophysical scales of length and time.

 - **Abstract**
 Large Language Models (LLMs) are shifting how scientific research is done. It is imperative to understand how researchers interact with these models and how scientific sub-communities like astronomy might benefit from them. However, there is currently no standard for evaluating the use of LLMs in astronomy. Therefore, we present the experimental design for an evaluation study on how astronomy researchers interact with LLMs. We deploy a Slack chatbot that can answer queries from users via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); these responses are grounded in astronomy papers from arXiv. We record and anonymize user questions and chatbot answers, user upvotes and downvotes to LLM responses, user feedback to the LLM, and retrieved documents and similarity scores with the query. Our data collection method will enable future dynamic evaluations of LLM tools for astronomy.

          Using the COSMIC Population Synthesis Code to Investigate How Metallicity Affects the Rates of Interacting Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We use COSMIC, a galaxy population synthesis code, to investigate how metallicity affects the rate of formation of massive stars with a closely orbiting compact object companion, the suggested progenitors of radio loud long gamma-ray bursts. We present the evolution time of these systems at different metallicities, and how the formation rates of these systems are anti-correlated with metallicity. In particular, these systems occur about 10 times more frequently in at metallicities between $Z = 2\times 10^{-4}$ and $2 \times 10^{-3}$, compared to those between $Z = 2\times 10^{-3}$ and $2 \times 10^{-2}$. This work serves as a prerequisite to predicting the global rates of these systems as a function of redshift, ultimately giving crucial insight into our understanding of the progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts and their evolution over cosmic time.

          The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE): Mission Design and Science Goals

 - **Abstract**
 The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission concept to measure the energy spectrum and linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A single cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer compares the sky to an external blackbody calibration target, measuring the Stokes I, Q, U parameters to levels ~200 Jy/sr in each 2.65 degree diameter beam over the full sky, in each of 300 frequency channels from 28 GHz to 6 THz. With sensitivity over 1000 times greater than COBE/FIRAS, PIXIE opens a broad discovery space for the origin, contents, and evolution of the universe. Measurements of small distortions from a CMB blackbody spectrum provide a robust determination of the mean electron pressure and temperature in the universe while constraining processes including dissipation of primordial density perturbations, black holes, and the decay or annihilation of dark matter. Full-sky maps of linear polarization measure the optical depth to reionization at nearly the cosmic variance limit and constrain models of primordial inflation. Spectra with sub-percent absolute calibration spanning microwave to far-IR wavelengths provide a legacy data set for analyses including line intensity mapping of extragalactic emission and the cosmic infrared background amplitude and anisotropy. We describe the PIXIE instrument sensitivity, foreground subtraction, and anticipated science return from both the baseline 2-year mission and a potential extended mission.

 - **Abstract**
 SNe Ia are used to determine the distance-redshift relation and build the Hubble diagram. Neglecting their host-galaxy peculiar velocities (PVs) may bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. The smaller the redshift, the larger the effect is. We use realistic simulations of SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to investigate the effect of different methods to take into account PVs. We study the impact of neglecting galaxy PVs and their correlations in an analysis of the SNe Ia Hubble diagram. We find that it is necessary to use the PV full covariance matrix computed from the velocity power spectrum to take into account the sample variance. Considering the results we have obtained using simulations, we determine the PV systematic effects in the context of the ZTF DR2 SNe Ia sample. We determine the PV impact on the intercept of the Hubble diagram, $a_B$, which is directly linked to the measurement of $H_0$. We show that not taking into account PVs and their correlations results in a shift of the $H_0$ value of about $1.0$km.s$^{-1}$.Mpc$^{-1}$ and a slight underestimation of the $H_0$ error bar.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the nearly 30,000 known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), only tens of them possess Earth co-orbital characteristics with semi-major axes $\sim$1 au. In particular, 469219 Kamo`oalewa (2016 HO3), upcoming target of China's Tianwen-2 asteroid sampling mission, exhibits a meta-stable 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth. Intriguingly, recent ground-based observations show that Kamo`oalewa has spectroscopic characteristics similar to space-weathered lunar silicates, hinting at a lunar origin instead of an asteroidal one like the vast majority of NEAs. Here we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that Kamo`oalewa's physical and orbital properties are compatible with a fragment from a crater larger than 10--20 km formed on the Moon in the last few million years. The impact could have ejected sufficiently large fragments into heliocentric orbits, some of which could be transferred to Earth 1:1 resonance and persist today. This leads us to suggest the young lunar crater Giordano Bruno (22 km diameter, 1--10 Ma age) as the most likely source, linking a specific asteroid in space to its source crater on the Moon. The hypothesis will be tested by the Tianwen-2 mission when it returns a sample of Kamo`oalewa. And the upcoming NEO Surveyor mission will possibly help us to identify such a lunar-derived NEA population.

 - **Abstract**
 New longwave HgCdTe detectors are critical to upcoming plans for ground-based infrared astronomy. These detectors, with fast-readouts and deep well-depths, will be key components of extremely large telescope instruments and therefore must be well understood prior to deployment. We analyze one such HgCdTe detector, a Teledyne Imaging Sensors GeoSnap, at the University of Michigan. We find that the properties of the GeoSnap are consistent with expectations from analysis of past devices. The GeoSnap has a well-depth of 2.75 million electrons per pixel, a read noise of 360 e-/pix, and a dark current of 330,000 e-/s/pix at 45 K. The device experiences 1/f noise which can be mitigated relative to half-well shot noise with modest frequency image differencing. The GeoSnap's quantum efficiency is calculated to be 79.7 +- 8.3 % at 10.6 microns. Although the GeoSnap's bad pixel fraction, on the order of 3%, is consistent with other GeoSnap devices, close to a third of the bad pixels in this detector are clustered in a series of 31 "leopard" spots spread across the detector plane. We report these properties and identify additional analyses that will be performed on future GeoSnap detectors.

          What makes a cosmic filament? The dynamical origin and identity of filaments I. fundamentals in 2D

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments are the main transport channels of matter in the Megaparsec universe, and represent the most prominent structural feature in the matter and galaxy distribution. Here we describe and define the physical and dynamical nature of cosmic filaments. It is based on the realization that the complex spatial pattern and connectivity of the cosmic web are already visible in the primordial random Gaussian density field, in the spatial pattern of the primordial tidal and deformation eigenvalue field. The filaments and other structural features in the cosmic web emerging from this are multistream features and structural singularities in phase-space. The caustic skeleton formalism allows a fully analytical classification, identification, and treatment of the nonlinear cosmic web. The caustic conditions yield the mathematical specification of weblike structures in terms of the primordial deformation tensor eigenvalue and eigenvector fields, in which filaments are identified -- in 2D -- with the so-called cusp caustics. These are centered around points that are maximally stretched as a result of the tidal force field. The resulting mathematical conditions represent a complete characterization of filaments in terms of their formation history, dynamics, and orientation. We illustrate the workings of the formalism on the basis of a set of constrained $N$-body simulations of protofilament realizations. These realizations are analyzed in terms of spatial structure, density profiles, and multistream structure and compared to simpler density or potential field saddle point specifications. The presented formalism, and its 3D generalization, will facilitate the mining of the rich cosmological information contained in the observed weblike galaxy distribution, and be of key significance for the analysis of cosmological surveys such as SDSS, DESI, and Euclid.

          Predicting gravitational wave signals from BPASS White Dwarf Binary and Black Hole Binary populations of a Milky Way-like galaxy model for LISA

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic white dwarf binaries (WDBs) and black hole binaries (BHBs) will be gravitational wave (GW) sources for LISA. Their detection will provide insights into binary evolution and the evolution of our Galaxy through cosmic history. Here, we make predictions of the expected WDB and BHB population within our Galaxy. We combine predictions of the compact remnant binary populations expected by stellar evolution by using the detailed Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS) with a Milky Way analogue galaxy model from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations. We use \textsc{PhenomA} and \textsc{LEGWORK} to simulate LISA observations. Both packages make similar predictions that on average four Galactic BHBs and 673 Galactic WDBs above the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 7 after a four-year mission. We compare these predictions to earlier results using the Binary Star Evolution (BSE) code with the same FIRE model galaxy. We find that BPASS predicts a few more LISA observable Galactic BHBs and a twentieth of the Galactic WDBs. The differences are due to the different physical assumptions that have gone into the binary evolution calculations. These results indicate that the expected population of compact binaries that LISA will detect depends very sensitively on the binary population synthesis models used and thus observations of the LISA population will provide tight constraints on our modelling of binary stars. Finally, from our synthetic populations we have created mock LISA signals that can be used to test and refine data processing methods of the eventual LISA observations.

          Isotopic variation of non-carbonaceous meteorites caused by dust leakage across the Jovian gap in the solar nebula

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision isotopic measurements of meteorites revealed that they are classified into non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites. One plausible scenario for achieving this grouping is the early formation of Jupiter because massive planets can create gaps that suppress the mixing of dust across the gap in protoplanetary disks. However, the efficiency of this suppression by the gaps depends on dust size and the strength of turbulent diffusion, allowing some fraction of the dust particles to leak across the Jovian gap. In this study, we investigate how isotopic ratios of NC and CC meteorites are varied by the dust leaking across the Jovian gap in the solar nebula. To do this, we constructed a model to simulate the evolution of the dust size distribution and the $^{54}$Cr-isotopic anomaly $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr in isotopically heterogeneous disks with Jupiter. Assuming that the parent bodies of NC and CC meteorites are formed in two dust-concentrated locations inside and outside Jupiter's orbit, referred to as the NC reservoir and CC reservoir, we derive the temporal variation of $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr at the NC and CC reservoir. Our results indicate that substantial contamination of CC materials occurs at the NC reservoir in the fiducial run. Nevertheless, the values of $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr at the NC reservoir and the CC reservoir in the run are still consistent with those of NC and CC meteorites formed around 2 Myrs after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions. Moreover, this dust leakage causes a positive correlation between the $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr value of NC meteorites and the accretion ages of their parent bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the fundamental interactions that determine its properties. However, Bayesian parameter estimation frameworks do not typically sample over microscopic nuclear-physics parameters that determine the EOS. One of the major hurdles in doing so is the computational cost involved in solving the neutron-star structure equations, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. In this paper, we explore approaches to emulating solutions for the TOV equations: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Gaussian Processes (GP), and a data-driven variant of the reduced basis method (RBM). We implement these emulators for three different parameterizations of the nuclear EOS, each with a different degree of complexity represented by the number of model parameters. We find that our MLP-based emulators are generally more accurate than the other two algorithms whereas the RBM results in the largest speedup with respect to the full, high-fidelity TOV solver. We employ these emulators for a simple parameter inference using a potentially loud BNS observation, and show that the posteriors predicted by our emulators are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full TOV solver.

          SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES). V. Confusion-limited Submillimeter Galaxy Number Counts at 450 $\mu$m and Data Release for the COSMOS Field

 - **Abstract**
 We present confusion-limited SCUBA-2 450-$\mu$m observations in the COSMOS-CANDELS region as part of the JCMT Large Program, SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES). Our maps at 450 and 850 $\mu$m cover an area of 450 arcmin$^2$. We achieved instrumental noise levels of $\sigma_{\mathrm{450}}=$ 0.59 mJy beam$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{850}}=$ 0.09 mJy beam$^{-1}$ in the deepest area of each map. The corresponding confusion noise levels are estimated to be 0.65 and 0.36 mJy beam$^{-1}$. Above the 4 (3.5) $\sigma$ threshold, we detected 360 (479) sources at 450 $\mu$m and 237 (314) sources at 850 $\mu$m. We derive the deepest blank-field number counts at 450 $\mu$m, covering the flux-density range of 2 to 43 mJy. These are in agreement with other SCUBA-2 blank-field and lensing-cluster observations, but are lower than various model counts. We compare the counts with those in other fields and find that the field-to-field variance observed at 450 $\mu$m at the $R=6^\prime$ scale is consistent with Poisson noise, so there is no evidence of strong 2-D clustering at this scale. Additionally, we derive the integrated surface brightness at 450 $\mu$m down to 2.1 mJy to be $57.3^{+1.0}_{-6.2}$~Jy deg$^{-2}$, contributing to (41$\pm$4)\% of the 450-$\mu$m extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by COBE and Planck. Our results suggest that the 450-$\mu$m EBL may be fully resolved at $0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$~mJy, which extremely deep lensing-cluster observations and next-generation submillimeter instruments with large aperture sizes may be able to achieve.

          Decoding the nature of Coherent radio emission in Pulsars I: Observational constraints

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations from normal pulsars indicate that the coherent radio emission is excited by curvature radiation from charge bunches. In this review we provide a systematic description of the various observational constraints on the radio emission mechanism. We have discussed the presence of highly polarized time samples where the polarization position angle follow two orthogonal well defined tracks across the profile, that closely match the rotating vector model in an identical manner. The observations also show the presence of circular polarization, with both the right and left handed circular polarization seen across the profile. Other constraints on the emission mechanism is provided by the detailed measurements of the spectral index variation across the profile window, where the central part of the profile, corresponding to the core component, has a steeper spectrum than the surrounding cones. Finally, the detailed measurements of the subpulse drifting behaviour can be explained by considering the presence of non-dipolar field on the stellar surface and the formation of the Partially screened Gap (PSG) above the polar cap region. The PSG gives rise to a non-stationary plasma flow, that has a multi-component nature, consisting of highly energetic primary particles, secondary pair plasma and iron ions discharged from the surface, with large fragmentation resulting is dense plasma clouds and lower density inter-cloud regions. The physical properties of the outflowing plasma and the observational constraints lead us to consider coherent curvature radiation as the most viable explanation for the emission mechanism in normal pulsars, where propagation effects due to adiabatic walking and refraction are largely inconsequential.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipse mapping uses the shape of the eclipse of an exoplanet to measure its two-dimensional structure. Light curves are mostly composed of longitudinal information, with the latitudinal information only contained in the brief ingress and egress of the eclipse. This imbalance can lead to a spuriously confident map, where the longitudinal structure is constrained by out-of-eclipse data and the latitudinal structure is wrongly determined by the priors on the map. We present a new method to address this issue. The method tests for the presence of an eclipse mapping signal by using k-fold cross-validation to compare the performance of a simple mapping model to the null hypothesis of a uniform disk. If a signal is found, the method fits a map with more degrees of freedom, optimising its information content. The information content is varied by penalising the model likelihood by a factor proportional to the spatial entropy of the map, optimised by cross-validation. We demonstrate this method for simulated datasets then apply it to three observational datasets. The method identifies an eclipse mapping signal for JWST MIRI/LRS observations of WASP-43b but does not identify a signal for JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of WASP-18b or Spitzer Space Telescope observations of HD 189733b. It is possible to fit eclipse maps to these datasets, but we suggest that these maps are overfitting the eclipse shape. We fit a new map with more spatial freedom to the WASP-43b dataset and show a flatter east-west structure than previously derived.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of carbon monoxide ice in the chemical evolution of prestellar cores using astrochemical rate equation models. We constrain the ratios of the binding energies on CO ice and H$_{2}$O ice for a series of adsorbates deemed important in diffusive chemistry on H$_{2}$O ices. We later include these ratios in our chemical reaction network model, where the binding and diffusion energies of icy species vary as a function of the surface composition. When the surface coverage of CO increases, the model shows an enhancement of O-bearing complex organic molecules, especially those formed from the intermediate products of CO hydrogenation (e.g. HCO) and CH$_{3}$/CH$_{2}$. Because the binding energy of CH$_{3}$/CH$_{2}$ is in the right range, its diffusion rate increases significantly with CO coverage. At $T>$14 K and with less influence, enhanced diffusion of HCO also contributes to the increase of the abundances of COM. We find, however, that chemistry is not always enhanced on CO ice and that the temperature and cosmic ray ionization rate of each astronomical object is crucial for this particular chemistry, revealing a highly non-trivial behavior that needs to be addressed on a per-case basis. Our results are highly relevant in the context of interstellar ice observations with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Ephemeral Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) must be powered by some of the most energetic processes in the Universe. That makes them highly interesting in their own right and as precise probes for estimating cosmological parameters. This field thus poses a unique challenge: FRBs must be detected promptly and immediately localised and studied based only on that single millisecond-duration flash. The problem is that the burst occurrence is highly unpredictable and that their distance strongly suppresses their brightness. Since the discovery of FRBs in single-dish archival data in 2007, detection software has evolved tremendously. Pipelines now detect bursts in real-time within a matter of seconds, operate on interferometers, buffer high-time and frequency resolution data, and issue real-time alerts to other observatories for rapid multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we review the components that comprise a FRB search software pipeline, we discuss the proven techniques that were adopted from pulsar searches, we highlight newer, more efficient techniques for detecting FRBs, and we conclude by discussing the proposed novel future methodologies that may power the search for FRBs in the era of big data astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: MATISSE, the mid-infrared spectro-imaging instrument of VLTI, was designed to deliver its advertised performance when paired with an external second generation fringe tracker. Science observation started in 2019, demonstrating imaging capabilities and faint science target observations. Now, The GRAVITY fringe tracker stabilizes the MATISSE fringes which allows using all spectroscopic modes and improves sensitivity and data accuracy. Aims: We present how the MATISSE and GRAVITY instruments were adapted to make the GRAVITY fringe tracker work with MATISSE, under the umbrella of the aptly-named GRA4MAT project, led by ESO in collaboration with the two instrument consortia. Methods: We detail the software modifications needed to implement an acquisition and observing sequence specific to GRA4MAT, including simultaneous fringe tracking and chopping and a narrow off-axis capability inspired by the galactic center and exoplanet capability of GRAVITY. We explain the modified data collection and reduction processes. We show how we leveraged the recent fringe tracker upgrade to implement features specific to its use with MATISSE, e.g. fringe jumps mitigation with an improved group delay control and simultaneous fringe tracking and chopping with a new state machine. Results: We successfully demonstrate significant improvements to the MATISSE instrument. Observations can now be performed at higher spectral resolutions of up to $R\sim3300$ and across the full LM bands at once. Long detector integration times, made possible with stabilized fringes, have improved the LM-bands sensitivity by a factor of 10. Low flux biases in coherently-reduced N-band data have been eliminated. The L-band transfer function is now higher and more stable. We finally illustrate the scientific potential of GRA4MAT with a preview of the first exoplanet observation made by MATISSE on $\beta$ Pictoris b.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 went through its third recorded giant outburst from June 2021 to early 2022. We present the results of both spectral and timing analysis based on NICER monitoring, covering the 2-10 keV flux range from 20 to 310 mCrab. Dense monitoring with observations carried out about every second day and a total exposure time of 160 ks allowed us to closely track the source evolution over the outburst. Changes in spectral shape and pulse profiles showed a stable luminosity dependence during the rise and decline. The same type of dependence has been seen in past outbursts. The pulse profile is characterized by several distinct peaks and dips. The profiles show a clear dependence on luminosity with a stark transition at a luminosity of 2x10^36 erg/s, indicating a change in the emission pattern. Using relativistic ray-tracing, we demonstrate how anisotropic beaming of emission from an accretion channel with constant geometrical configuration can give rise to the observed pulse profiles over a range of luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally hard to put robust constraints on progenitor masses of supernovae (SNe) and remnants (SNRs) observationally, while they offer tantalizing clues to understanding explosion mechanisms and mass distribution. Our recent study suggests that ``shell merger'', which is theoretically expected for stellar evolution, can appreciably affect final yields of inter-mediate mass elements (IMEs; such as Ne, Mg, and Si). In light of this, here we report results of X-ray spectral analysis of a Galactic SNR G359.0-0.9, whose abundance pattern may possibly be anomalous according to a previous study. Our spectroscopy using all the available data taken with XMM-Newton reveals that this remnant is classified as Mg-rich SNRs because of its high Mg-to-Ne ratio (Z_Mg/Z_Ne=1.90+0.27-0.19; mass ratio 0.66+0.09-0.07) and conclude that the result cannot be explained without the shell merger. By comparing the observation with theoretical calculations, we prefer the so-called Ne-burning shell intrusion and in this case the progenitor mass M_ZAMS is likely <15M_sun. We confirm the result also by our new molecular line observations with the NRO-45 m telescope: G359.0-0.9 is located in the Scutum-Centaurus arm (2.66--2.94 kpc) and in this case the resultant total ejecta mass ~6.8M_sun is indeed consistent with the above estimate. Our method using mass ratios of IMEs presented in this paper will become useful to distinguish the type of the shell merger, the Ne-burning shell intrusion and the O-burning shell merger, for future SNR studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. The early detection of highly-ionized flash features, rapid ascent in ultraviolet flux coupled with the blueward shift in near-ultraviolet colors and temperature provides compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radius, explosion energy of 2e51 erg, and 0.06 solar mass of 56Ni. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to 1e16 cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI] and red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, marking the onset of dust formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The treatment of convection remains a major weakness in the modelling of stellar evolution with one-dimensional (1D) codes. The ever increasing computing power makes now possible to simulate in 3D part of a star for a fraction of its life, allowing us to study the full complexity of convective zones with hydrodynamics codes. Here, we performed state-of-the-art hydrodynamics simulations of turbulence in a neon-burning convective zone, during the late stage of the life of a massive star. We produced a set of simulations varying the resolution of the computing domain (from 1283 to 10243 cells) and the efficiency of the nuclear reactions (by boosting the energy generation rate from nominal to a factor of 1000). We analysed our results by the mean of Fourier transform of the velocity field, and mean-field decomposition of the various transport equations. Our results are in line with previous studies, showing that the behaviour of the bulk of the convective zone is already well captured at a relatively low resolution (2563), while the details of the convective boundaries require higher resolutions. The different boosting factors used show how various quantities (velocity, buoyancy, abundances, abundance variances) depend on the energy generation rate. We found that for low boosting factors, convective zones are well mixed, validating the approach usually used in 1D stellar evolution codes. However, when nuclear burning and turbulent transport occur on the same timescale, a more sophisticated treatment would be needed. This is typically the case when shell mergers occur.

 - **Abstract**
 The Classical T Tauri Star (CTTS) stage is a critical phase of the star and planet formation process. In an effort to better understand the mass accretion process, which can dictate further stellar evolution and planet formation, a multi-epoch, multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was carried out in 2021 and 2022/2023 as part of the Outflows and Disks Around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULYSSES Spectra (ODYSSEUS) program. Here we focus on the HST UV spectra obtained by the HST Director's Discretionary Time UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. Using accretion shock modeling, we find that all targets exhibit accretion variability, varying from short increases in accretion rate by up to a factor of 3 within 48 hours, to longer decreases in accretion rate by a factor of 2.5 over the course of 1 year. This is despite the generally consistent accretion morphology within each target. Additionally, we test empirical relationships between accretion rate and UV luminosity and find stark differences, showing that these relationships should not be used to estimate the accretion rate for individual target. Our work reinforces that future multi-epoch and simultaneous multi-wavelength studies are critical in our understanding of the accretion process in low-mass star formation.

          Boil-off of red supergiants: mass loss and type II-P supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The mass loss mechanism of red supergiant stars is not well understood, even though it has crucial consequences for their stellar evolution and the appearance of supernovae that occur upon core-collapse. We argue that outgoing shock waves launched near the photosphere can support a dense chromosphere between the star's surface and the dust formation radius at several stellar radii. We derive analytic expressions for the time-averaged density profile of the chromosphere, and we use these to estimate mass loss rates due to winds launched by radiation pressure at the dust formation radius. These mass loss rates are similar to recent observations, possibly explaining the upward kink in mass loss rates of luminous red supergiants. Our models predict that low-mass red supergiants lose less mass than commonly assumed, while high-mass red supergiants lose more. The chromospheric mass of our models is $\sim$0.01 solar masses, most of which lies within a few stellar radii. This may explain the early light curves and spectra of type-II P supernovae without requiring extreme pre-supernova mass loss. We discuss implications for stellar evolution, type II-P supernovae, SN 2023ixf, and Betelgeuse.

 With stunning clarity, JWST has revealed the Universe's first billion years. The scientific community is analyzing a wealth of JWST imaging and spectroscopic data from that era, and is in the process of rewriting the astronomy textbooks. Here, 1.5 years into the JWST science mission, we provide a snapshot of the great progress made towards understanding the initial chapters of our cosmic history. We highlight discoveries and breakthroughs, topics and issues that are not yet understood, and questions that will be addressed in the coming years, as JWST continues its revolutionary observations of the Early Universe. While this compendium is written by a small number of authors, invited to ISSI Bern in March 2024 as part of the 2024 ISSI Breakthrough Workshop, we acknowledge the work of a large community that is advancing our collective understanding of the evolution of the Early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are young, low-mass stars which accrete material from their surrounding protoplanetary disk. To better understand accretion variability, we conducted a multi-epoch, multi-wavelength photometric monitoring campaign of four CTTSs: TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur, in 2021 and 2022, contemporaneous with HST UV and optical spectra. We find that all four targets display significant variability in their light curves, generally on days-long timescales (but in some cases year-to-year) often due to periodicity associated with stellar rotation and to stochastic accretion variability. Their is a strong connection between mass accretion and photometric variability in all bands, but the relationship varies per target and epoch. Thus, photometry should be used with caution as a direct measure of accretion in CTTSs.
