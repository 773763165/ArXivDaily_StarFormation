 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we presented a detailed single pulse and polarization study of PSR J0614+2229 based on the archived data observed on 2019 August 15 (MJD 58710) and September 12 (MJD 58738) using the Ultra-wideband Low-frequency Receiver on the Parkes radio telescope. The single-pulse sequences show that this pulsar switches between two emission states, in which the emission of state A occurs earlier than that of state B in pulse longitude. We found that the variation in relative brightness between the two states is related to time and both states follow a simple power law very well. Based on the phase-aligned multi-frequency profiles, we found that there is a significant difference in the distributions of spectral index across the emission regions of the two states. Furthermore, we obtained the emission height evolution for the two emission states and found that, at a fixed frequency, the emission height of state A is higher than that of state B. What is even more interesting is that the emission heights of both states A and B have not changed with frequency. Our results suggest that the mode switching of this pulsar is possibly caused by changes in the emission heights that alter the distributions of spectral index across the emission regions of states A and B resulting in the frequency-dependent behaviors, i.e., intensity and pulse width.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we analyze the reconstruction of inflation in the framework of a non-canonical theory. In this sense, we study the viability of reconstructing the background variables assuming a non-lineal kinetic term given by $K(X,\phi)=X+g(\phi)X^2$, with $X$ the standard kinetic term associated to the scalar field $\phi$ and $g(\phi)$ an arbitrary coupling function. In order to achieve this reconstruction in the context of inflation, we assume the slow-roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of the number of $e-$folds $N$. By assuming the simplest parametrizations for $n_s-1=-2/N$ and $c_s\propto N^{-\beta}$ with $\beta$ a constant, we find the reconstruction of the effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling function $g(\phi)$ in terms of the scalar field. Besides, we study the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, where we determine the temperature and number of $e-$folds during the reheating epoch in terms of the reconstructed variables and the observational parameters. In this way, the parameter-space related to the reconstructed inflationary model are constrained during the epochs of inflation and reheating by assuming the current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectra of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 6$) quasars contain valuable information on the progression of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At redshifts $z<6$, the observed Lyman-series forest shows that the intergalactic medium (IGM) is nearly ionized, while at $z>7$ the observed quasar damping wings indicate high neutral gas fractions. However, there remains a gap in neutral gas fraction constraints at $6\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ where the Lyman series forest becomes saturated but damping wings have yet to fully emerge. In this work, we use a sample of 18 quasar spectra at redshifts $6.0<z<7.1$ to close this gap. We apply neural networks to reconstruct the quasars' continuum emission around the partially absorbed Lyman $\alpha$ line to normalize their spectra, and stack these continuum-normalized spectra in three redshift bins. To increase the robustness of our results, we compare the stacks to a grid of models from two hydrodynamical simulations, ATON and CROC, and we measure the volume-averaged neutral gas fraction, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$, while jointly fitting for the mean quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$, for each stacked spectrum. We chronicle the evolution of neutral gas fraction using the ATON (CROC) models as follows: $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.10_{<10^{-4}}^{+0.73}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.10$, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.33}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.47}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.46$, and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.21}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.87$. At the same time we constrain the average quasar lifetime to be $t_{\rm Q} \lesssim 7\ {\rm Myr}$ across all redshift bins, in good agreement with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Early studies of the AMS-02 antiproton ratio identified a possible excess over the expected astrophysical background that could be fit by the annihilation of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). However, recent efforts have shown that uncertainties in cosmic-ray propagation, the antiproton production cross-section, and correlated systematic uncertainties in the AMS-02 data, may combine to decrease or eliminate the significance of this feature. We produce an advanced analysis using the DRAGON2 code which, for the first time, simultaneously fits the antiproton ratio along with multiple secondary cosmic-ray flux measurements to constrain astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties. Compared to previous work, our analysis benefits from a combination of: (1) recently released AMS-02 antiproton data, (2) updated nuclear fragmentation cross-section fits, (3) a rigorous Bayesian parameter space scan that constrains cosmic-ray propagation parameters. We find no statistically significant preference for a dark matter signal and set strong constraints on WIMP annihilation to $b\bar{b}$, ruling out annihilation at the thermal cross-section for dark matter masses below $\sim200$~GeV. We do find a positive residual that is consistent with previous work, and can be explained by a $\sim70$~GeV WIMP annihilating below the thermal cross-section. However, our default analysis finds this excess to have a local significance of only 2.8$\sigma$, which is decreased to 1.8$\sigma$ when the look-elsewhere effect is taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Heller & Hippke argued that the exomoon candidates Kepler-1625 b-i and Kepler-1708 b-i were allegedly 'refuted'. In this Matters Arising, we address these claims. For Kepler-1625 b, we show that their Hubble light curve is identical to that previously published by the same lead author, in which the moon-like dip was recovered. Indeed, our fits of their data again recover the moon-like dip with improved residuals than that obtained by Heller & Hippke. Their fits therefore appear to have somehow missed this deeper likelihood maximum, as well producing apparently unconverged posteriors. Consequently, their best-fitting moon is the same radius as the planet, Kepler-1625 b; a radically different signal from that which was originally claimed. The authors then inject this solution into the Kepler data and remark, as a point of concern, how retrievals obtain much higher significances than originally reported. However, this issue stems from the injection of a fundamentally different signal. We demonstrate that their Hubble light curve exhibits ~20% higher noise and discards 11% of the useful data, which compromises its ability to recover the subtle signal of Kepler-1625 b-i. For Kepler-1708 b-i it was claimed that the exomoon model's Bayes factor is highly sensitive to detrending choices, yielding reduced evidence with a biweight filter versus the original claim. We use their own i) detrended light curve and ii) biweight filter code to investigate these claims. For both, we recover the original moon signal, to even higher confidence than before. The discrepancy is explained by comparing to their quoted fit metrics, where we again demonstrate that the Heller & Hippke regression definitively missed the deeper likelihood maximum corresponding to Kepler-1708 b-i. We conclude that both candidates remain viable but certainly demand further observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbonaceous chondrites are among the most important meteorite types and have played a vital role in deciphering the origin and evolution of our solar system. They have been linked to low-albedo C-type asteroids, but due to subdued absorption bands, definitive asteroid-meteorite linkages remain elusive. A majority of these existing linkages rely on fine-grained (typically < 45 micron) powders across a limited wavelength range in the visible to near-infrared (0.35-2.5 microns). While this is useful in interpreting the fine-grained regolith of larger main-belt objects like Ceres, recent spacecraft missions to smaller near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), such as Bennu and Ryugu, have shown that their surfaces are dominated by larger grain size material. To better interpret the surfaces of these smaller, carbonaceous NEAs, we obtained laboratory reflectance spectra of seven carbonaceous chondrite meteorite groups (CI, CM, CO, CV, CR, CK, C2-ungrouped) over the ultraviolet to mid-infrared range (0.2-14 microns). Each meteorite contained five grain size bins (45-1000 microns) to help constrain spectral grain size effects. We find a correlation between grain size and absolute reflectance, spectral slope, band depth, and the Christiansen feature band center. Principal component analysis of grain size variation illustrates a similar trend to lunar-style space weathering. We also show that the Bus-DeMeo asteroid taxonomic classification of our samples is affected by grain size, specifically shifting CM2 Aguas Zarcas from a Ch-type to B-type with increasing grain size. This has implications for the parent body of the OSIRIS-REx target, Bennu. With Aguas Zarcas, we present results from Hapke modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Elongated trails of infalling gas, often referred to as "streamers," have recently been observed around young stellar objects (YSOs) at different evolutionary stages. This asymmetric infall of material can significantly alter star and planet formation processes, especially in the more evolved YSOs. Aims. In order to ascertain the infalling nature of observed streamer-like structures and then systematically characterize their dynamics, we developed the code TIPSY (Trajectory of Infalling Particles in Streamers around Young stars). Methods. Using TIPSY, the streamer molecular line emission is first isolated from the disk emission. Then the streamer emission, which is effectively a point cloud in three-dimensional (3D) position-position-velocity space, is simplified to a curve-like representation. The observed streamer curve is then compared to the theoretical trajectories of infalling material. The best-fit trajectories are used to constrain streamer features, such as the specific energy, the specific angular momenta, the infall timescale, and the 3D morphology. Results. We used TIPSY to fit molecular-line ALMA observations of streamers around a Class II binary system, S CrA, and a Class I/II protostar, HL Tau. Our results indicate that both of the streamers are consistent with infalling motion. TIPSY results and mass estimates suggest that S CrA and HL Tau are accreting material at a rate of $\gtrsim27$ M$_{jupiter}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and $\gtrsim5$ M$_{jupiter}$ Myr$^{-1}$, respectively, which can significantly increase the mass budget available to form planets. Conclusions. TIPSY can be used to assess whether the morphology and kinematics of observed streamers are consistent with infalling motion and to characterize their dynamics, which is crucial for quantifying their impact on the protostellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we propose an improved cosmological model-independent method to measure cosmic curvature, combining the recent measurements of transverse and line-of-sight directions in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) with cosmic chronometers (CC) datasets. Considering that the CC dataset is discrete and includes only 32 $H(z)$ measurements, we apply Gaussian process (GP) regression to fit the CC dataset and reconstruct them. Our methodology, which does not need the calibration or selection of any cosmological model, provide multiple measurements of spatial curvature ($\Omega_K$) at different redshifts (depending on the redshift coverage of BAO dataset). For combination of all BAO data, we find that the constraint result on cosmic curvature is $\Omega_K=-0.096^{+0.190}_{-0.195}$ with $1\sigma$ observational uncertainty. Although the measured $\Omega_K$ is in good agreement with zero cosmic curvature within 1$\sigma$ confidence level, our result revels the fact of a closed universe. More importantly, our results show that the obtained $\Omega_K$ measurements are almost unaffected by different priors of the Hubble constant. This could help solve the issue of the Hubble tension that may be caused by inconsistencies in the spatial curvature between the early and late universes.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are the brightest and most abundant persistent sources in the extragalactic gamma-ray sky. Due to their significance, they are often observed across various energy bands to explore potential correlations between emissions at different energies, yielding valuable insights into the emission processes of their powerful jets. In this study we utilised infrared (IR) data at 3.4 and 4.6 microns from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation Mission (NEOWISE), spanning eight years of observations, Swift X-ray data collected throughout the satellite lifetime, and twelve years of gamma-ray measurements from the Fermi Large Area Telescope's all-sky survey. Our analysis reveals that the IR spectral slope reliably predicts the peak frequency and maximum intensity of the synchrotron component of blazars spectral energy distributions, provided it is uncontaminated by radiation unrelated to the jet. A notable correlation between the IR and gamma-ray fluxes was observed, with the BL Lac subclass of blazars displaying a strong correlation coefficient of r = 0.80. Infrared band variability is more pronounced in flat spectrum radio quasars than in BL Lacs, with mean fractional variability values of 0.65 and 0.35, respectively. We also observed that the synchrotron peak intensity of intermediate-high-energy-peaked objects blazars can forecast their detectability at very high energy gamma-ray, energies. We used this predicting power to identify objects in current catalogues that could meet the detection threshold of the Cerenkov telescope array extragalactic survey, which should encompass approximately 180 blazars.
#### Reflecting on naked singularities: iron line fitting as a probe of the  cosmic censorship conjecture

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10565
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10565
 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the X-ray iron line fitting technique can be leveraged as a powerful probe of the cosmic censorship conjecture. We do this by extending existing emission line models to arbitrary spin parameters of the Kerr metric, no longer restricted to black hole metrics with $|a_\bullet |< 1$. We show that the emission lines from naked singularity metrics ($|a_\bullet| > 1$) show significant differences to their black hole counterparts, even for those metrics with identical locations of the innermost stable circular orbit, i.e., emission line fitting does not suffer from the degeneracy which affects continuum fitting approaches. These differences are entirely attributable to the disappearance of the event horizon for $|a_\bullet| > 1$. We highlight some novel emission line features of naked singularity metrics, such as ``inverted'' emission lines (with sharp red wings and extended blue wings) and ``triple lines''. The lack of detection of any of these novel features provides support of the cosmic censorship conjecture. We publicly release {\tt XSPEC} packages {\tt skline} and {\tt skconv} which can now be used to probe the cosmic censorship conjecture in Galactic X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei. The inclusion of super-extremal spacetimes can be alternatively posed as a way of stress-testing conventional models of accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent local measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$, indicate a significant discrepancy of over 5$\sigma$ compared to the value inferred from \textit{Planck} observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this paper, we try to understand the origin of this tension by testing the consistency of early and late cosmological parameters in the same observed data. In practice, we simultaneously derive the early and late parameters using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, which provide both low and high-redshift information. To resolve parameter degeneracy, the complementary data from CMB observations are included in the analysis. By using the parameter $\omega_m = \Omega_mh^2$, we introduce ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$, defined as the ratio of $\omega_m$ which are constrained from high and low-redshift measurements respectively, to quantify the consistency between early and late parameters. We obtained a value of ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m) = 1.0069\pm0.0070$, indicating there is no tension between early parameters and late parameters in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, the Hubble tension may arise from the differences of datasets or unknown systematic errors in the current data. In addition, we forecast the future BAO measurements of ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$, using several galaxy redshift surveys and 21 cm intensity mapping surveys, and find that these measurements can significantly improve the precision of cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 This project is focused on evaluating the slowly-varying ground layer seeing component at the optical telescopes of ARIES. To achieve this, we assembled the instrument, consisting of a filter wheel, a CCD camera, and a tip-tilt enabled transparent glass plate integrated within an off-the-shelf unit termed as the AO (Adaptive Optics) unit. The instrument developed by us was deployed on the 1.04-m f/13 Sampurnanand telescope at Manora Peak and the 1.3-m f/4 telescope at Devasthal. This instrument measures the average instantaneous slope (tip/tilt) of the incoming wavefront over the telescope aperture via a fast (within the atmospheric coherence time) sampled image and corrects it via a software-controlled oscillating (tipping/tilting) single thin glass plate. The night observations revealed that the slowly-varying seeing component is significant at both observatories and can be effectively controlled to enhance the sharpness of the celestial images at the two sites. The most significant improvement was measured from 5 arcsec of uncorrected FWHM of a star to 3.4 arcsec of corrected FWHM in the 1.04-m telescope. in the evening hours.

 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence of the first significant digits from real world sources is usually not equally distributed, but is consistent with a logarithmic distribution instead, known as Benford's law. In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation on the first digit distributions of the duration, fluence, and energy flux of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for the first time. For a complete GRB sample, we find that the first digits of the duration and fluence adhere to Benford's law. However, the energy flux shows a significant departure from this law, which may be due to the fact that a considerable part of the energy flux measurements are restricted by lack of spectral information. Based on the conventional duration classification scheme, we also check if the durations and fluences of long and short GRBs (with duration $T_{90}>2$ s and $T_{90}\leq2$ s, respectively) obey Benford's law. We find that the fluences of both long and short GRBs still agree with the Benford distribution, but their durations do not follow Benford's law. Our results hint that the long--short GRB classification scheme does not directly represent the intrinsic physical classification scheme.
#### Theoretical modelling of the adsorption of neutral and charged  sulphur-bearing species on to olivine nanoclusters

 - **Abstract**
 Sulphur depletion in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a long-standing issue, as only 1% of its cosmic abundance is detected in dense molecular clouds (MCs), while it does not appear to be depleted in other environments. In addition to gas phase species, MCs also contain interstellar dust grains, which are irregular, micron-sized, solid aggregates of carbonaceous materials and/or silicates. Grains provide a surface where species can meet, accrete, and react. Although freeze-out of sulphur onto dust grains could explain its depletion, only OCS and, tentatively, SO$_2$ were observed on their surfaces. Therefore, it is our aim to investigate the interaction between sulphur-containing species and the exposed mineral core of the grains at a stage prior to when sulphur depletion is observed. Here, the grain core is represented by olivine nanoclusters, one of the most abundant minerals in the ISM, with composition Mg$_4$Si$_2$O$_8$ and Mg$_3$FeSi$_2$O$_8$. We performed a series of quantum mechanical calculations to characterize the adsorption of 9 S-bearing species, both neutral and charged, onto the nanoclusters. Our calculations reveal that the Fe-S interaction is preferred to Mg-S, causing sometimes the chemisorption of the adsorbate. These species are more strongly adsorbed on the bare dust grain silicate cores than on water ice mantles, and hence therefore likely sticking on the surface of grains forming part of the grain core. This demonstrates that the interaction of bare grains with sulphur species in cloud envelopes can determine the S-depletion observed in dense molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The 2nd generation VLTI instrument GRAVITY is a two-field infrared interferometer operating in the K band between 1.97 and 2.43 $\mu$m with either the four 8 m or the four 1.8 m telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Beams collected by the telescopes are corrected with adaptive optics systems and the fringes are stabilized with a fringe-tracking system. A metrology system allows the measurement of internal path lengths in order to achieve high-accuracy astrometry. High sensitivity and high interferometric accuracy are achieved thanks to (i) correction of the turbulent phase, (ii) the use of low-noise detectors, and (iii) the optimization of photometric and coherence throughput. Beam combination and most of the beam transport are performed with single-mode waveguides in vacuum and at low temperature. In this paper, we present the functions and performance achieved with weakly birefringent standard single-mode fiber systems in GRAVITY. Fibered differential delay lines (FDDLs) are used to dynamically compensate for up to 6 mm of delay between the science and reference targets. Fibered polarization rotators allow us to align polarizations in the instrument and make the single-mode beam combiner close to polarization neutral. The single-mode fiber system exhibits very low birefringence (less than 23{\deg}), very low attenuation (3.6-7 dB/km across the K band), and optimized differential dispersion (less than 2.04 $\mu$rad cm2 at zero extension of the FDDLs). As a consequence, the typical fringe contrast losses due to the single-mode fibers are 6% to 10% in the lowest-resolution mode and 5% in the medium- and high-resolution modes of the instrument for a photometric throughput of the fiber chain of the order of 90%. There is no equivalent of this fiber system to route and modally filter beams with delay and polarization control in any other K-band beamcombiner.

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of the extreme horizontal branch stars of globular clusters exhibit a periodic light variability that has been attributed to rotational modulation caused by surface spots. These spots are believed to be connected to inhomogeneous surface distribution of elements. However, the presence of such spots has not been tested against spectroscopic data. We analyzed the phase-resolved ESO X-shooter spectroscopy of three extreme horizontal branch stars that are members of the globular cluster $\omega$ Cen and also display periodic light variations. The aim of our study is to understand the nature of the light variability of these stars and to test whether the spots can reproduce the observed variability. Our spectroscopic analysis of these stars did not detect any phase-locked abundance variations that are able to reproduce the light variability. Instead, we revealed the phase variability of effective temperature and surface gravity. In particular, the stars show the highest temperature around the light maximum. This points to pulsations as a possible cause of the observed spectroscopic and photometric variations. However, such an interpretation is in a strong conflict with Ritter's law, which relates the pulsational period to the mean stellar density. The location of the $\omega$ Cen variable extreme horizontal branch stars in HR diagram corresponds to an extension of PG 1716 stars toward lower temperatures or blue, low-gravity, large-amplitude pulsators toward lower luminosities, albeit with much longer periods. Other models of light variability, namely, related to temperature spots, should also be tested further. The estimated masses of these stars in the range of $0.2-0.3\,M_\odot$ are too low for helium-burning objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are extremely interesting observational phenomena. However, the precise physical mechanisms leading to their generation are still hotly debated. We performed a systematic search for transient QPO signals using Weighted Wavelet Z-transforms on the gamma-ray light curves of 134 bright blazars with peak flux exceeding $1\times10^{-6}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ as monitored by Fermi-LAT. Artificial light curves were generated from the power spectral density and probability distribution functions of the original light curves to assess the significance level of transient QPO. We discuss several physical mechanisms that produce transient QPOs, with the helical jet model providing the best explanation. This study identified four new transient QPO events. Interestingly, repetitive transient QPOs are observed in PKS 0537-441, and nested transient QPOs are detected in PKS 1424-41. Additionally, we find that transient QPOs tend to occur in the flare state of the blazar. Finally, we estimate the incidence of transient QPO events to be only about 3\%.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for pulsars in monitoring data obtained at the radio telescope Large Phased Array (LPA) at a frequency of 111 MHz was carried out. Daily round-the-clock observations were carried out for about 3,000 days. The duration of the observation session for each direction in the sky was 3.5 minutes per day. The search for pulsars was carried out using power spectra. To search for weak pulsars, power spectra were summed up. The expected increase in sensitivity was 35-40 times compared to observations in one session. In a blind search, 330 pulsars with regular radiation were detected, with periods (P) from 0.0333 to 3.7455 s and dispersion measures (DM) up to 249 pc/cm3. 39 pulsars turned out to be new. Average profiles were obtained for 6 pulsars. The DM for 7 pulsars previously detected on the LPA have been clarified.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters (OCs) are common in the Milky Way, but most of them remain undiscovered. There are numerous techniques, including some machine-learning algorithms, available for the exploration of OCs. However, each method has its own limitations and therefore, different approaches to discovering OCs hold significant value. We develop a comprehensive approach method to automatically explore the data space and identify potential OC candidates with relatively reliable membership determination. This approach combines the techniques of HDBSCAN, GMM, and a novel cluster member identification technique, 2-color constraint. The new method exhibits efficiency in detecting OCs while ensuring precise determination of cluster memberships. Because the main feature of this technique is to add an extra constraint for the members of cluster candidates using the homogeneity of color excess, comparing to typical blind search codes, it is called Blind Search-Extra Constraint (BSEC) method. It is successfully applied to the Gaia Data Release 3, and 83 new OCs with CMDs similar to stellar isochrones are found. In addition, this study reports 621 new OC candidates including at least the main sequence or red giant branch. It is shown that BSEC technique can discard some false negatives of previous works, which takes about 3 percentage of known clusters. It shows that color excess (or 2-color) constraint is useful for removing fake cluster member stars and getting more precise CMDs. It makes the CMDs of 15 percent clusters clearer (in particular for the region near turnoff) and therefore is helpful for CMD and stellar population studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic dawn represents critical juncture in cosmic history when the first population of stars emerged. The astrophysical processes that govern this transformation need to be better understood. The detection of redshifted 21-cm radiation emitted from neutral hydrogen during this era offers a direct window into the thermal and ionization state of the universe. This emission manifests as differential brightness between spin temperature and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). SARAS experiment aims to detect the sky-averaged signal in the frequency range 40-200 MHz. SARAS's unique design and operation strategy to float the antenna over a water body minimizes spectral features that may arise due to stratified ground beneath the antenna. However, the antenna environment can be prone to configuration changes due to variations in critical design parameters such as conductivity and antenna tilts. In this paper, we connect the variations in antenna properties to signal detection prospects. By using realistic simulations of a direction and frequency-dependent radiation pattern of the SARAS antenna and its transfer function, we establish critical parameters and estimate bias in the detectability of different models of the global 21-cm signal. We find a correlation between the nature of chromaticity in antenna properties and the bias in the recovered spectral profiles of 21-cm signals. We also find stringent requirements for transfer function corrections, which can otherwise make detection prospects prohibitive. We finally explore a range of critical parameters that allow robust signal detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The sulfur dimer (S$_2$) is an important molecular constituent in cometary atmospheres and volcanic plumes on Jupiter's moon Io. It is also expected to play an important role in the photochemistry of exoplanets. The UV spectrum of S$_2$ contains transitions between vibronic levels above and below the dissociation limit, giving rise to a distinctive spectral signature. By using spectroscopic information from the literature, and the spectral simulation program PGOPHER, a UV line list of S$_2$ is provided. This line list includes the primary $B\,^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{u}-X\,^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$ ($v'$=0-27, $v''$=0-10) electronic transition, where vibrational bands with $v'$$\geq$10 are predissociated. Intensities have been calculated from existing experimental and theoretical oscillator strengths, and semi-empirical strengths for the predissociated bands of S$_2$ have been derived from comparisons with experimental cross-sections. The S$_2$ line list also includes the $B''\,^{3}\Pi_{u}-X\,^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$ ($v'$=0-19, $v''$=0-10) vibronic bands due to the strong interaction with the $B$ state. In summary, we present the new HITRAN-formatted S$_2$ line list and its validation against existing laboratory spectra. The extensive line list covers the spectral range 21700$-$41300~cm$^{-1}$ ($\sim$242$-$461~nm) and can be used for modeling both absorption and emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented precision of Gaia has led to a paradigm shift in membership determination of open clusters where a variety of machine learning (ML) models can be employed. In this paper, we apply the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to a sample of thirteen clusters with varying ages ($log \ t \approx$ 6.38-9.64) and distances (441-5183 pc) from Gaia DR3 data to determine membership. We use ASteca to determine parameters for the clusters from our revised membership data. We define a quantifiable metric Modified Silhouette Score (MSS) to evaluate its performance. We study the dependence of MSS on age, distance, extinction, galactic latitude and longitude, and other parameters to find the particular cases when GMM seems to be more efficient than other methods. We compared GMM for nine clusters with varying ages but we did not find any significant differences between GMM performance for younger and older clusters. But we found a moderate correlation between GMM performance and the cluster distance, where GMM works better for closer clusters. We find that GMM does not work very well for clusters at distances larger than 3~kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Only 3-4 per cent of galactic O stars are observed to display the emission features representative of the OBe phenomenon, compared to galactic B stars, which display these characteristics in 25-35 per cent of B0 and B1 stars. We present new observations of the high-mass O star, VES 735, which confirms its classification as one of these rare emission-line stars. These are its first recorded observations that display strong spectroscopic variations in nearly 30 years of monitoring, with the H$\alpha$ profile exhibiting a tenfold increase in emission compared to observations taken between 1996 and 2014 and having variations which show episodes of inflowing and outflowing material. These observations, coupled with photometric variations in the visible and infrared, show behavior that is consistent with the mass reservoir effect for viscous decretion discs. We propose that in 2015 VES 735 began an approximately three year event in which mass was being injected into the circumstellar environment followed by re-accretion towards the star. We also find evidence that the re-accretion may have been interrupted with another, smaller, mass-injection event based on observations in 2022 and 2023. Observational cadences ranging from hours to months show no evidence that VES 735 is part of a binary system, making it an ideal candidate for future observations to further investigate the evolution of high-mass stars and the OBe phenomenon as it pertains to their circumstellar environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of three highly non-radial solar wind events when the azimuthal solar wind flow angle exceeds > 6 degrees for one day or more. None of the events are associated with coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions observed at 1 AU. For all events, the solar wind outflows at 1 AU have low solar wind velocity and solar wind density. Based on the significant increase in the Oxygen charge state ratio of O7+/O6+ at 1 AU for all of the events, we have traced them back to the Sun and found that their source regions originated in an active region and coronal hole (AR-CH) pairs mainly located at the central meridian. Further, examining the dynamical evolutions in their source regions using both the Extreme ultra-violet Imaging Telescope and Michelson Doppler Imager, it is found that the changes taking place in AR-CH boundaries eventually disturbed the stable CH configurations, resulting in a reduction of the CH area and finally its disappearance, leaving only with the AR. Our study provides a possible explanation to discuss the origin of the prolonged and highly non-radial solar wind flows.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing an image from sparsely sampled Fourier data is an ill-posed inverse problem that occurs in a variety of subjects within science, including the data analysis for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) for solar observations. Despite ongoing parallel developments of novel imaging algorithms, synergies remain unexplored. We study the synergies between the data analysis for the STIX instrument and VLBI, compare the methodologies and evaluate their potential. In this way, we identify key trends in the performance of several algorithmic ideas and draw recommendations for the future. To this end, we organized a semi-blind imaging challenge with data sets and source structures that are typical for sparse VLBI, specifically in the context of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and for STIX observations. 17 different algorithms from both communities, from 6 different imaging frameworks, participated in the challenge, marking this work the largest scale code comparisons for STIX and VLBI to date. Strong synergies between the two communities have been identified, as can be proven by the success of the imaging methods proposed for STIX in imaging VLBI data sets and vice versa. Novel imaging methods outperform the standard CLEAN algorithm significantly in every test-case. Improvements over the performance of CLEAN make deeper updates to the inverse modeling pipeline necessary, or consequently replacing inverse modeling with forward modeling. Entropy-based and Bayesian methods perform best on STIX data. The more complex imaging algorithms utilizing multiple regularization terms (recently proposed for VLBI) add little to no additional improvements for STIX, but outperform the other methods on EHT data. This work demonstrates the great synergy between the STIX and VLBI imaging efforts and the great potential for common developments.
