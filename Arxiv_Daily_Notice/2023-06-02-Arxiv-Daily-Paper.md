 - **Abstract**
 The LHAASO Collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Plane at energies between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. While this emission is brighter than that expected from cosmic-ray interactions in the interstellar medium alone, we show that the intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess are in good agreement with that predicted from the "TeV halos" which surround the Milky Way's pulsar population. These results support the conclusion that TeV halos dominate the ultra-high-energy sky, and that these objects convert $\sim 5\%$ of their total spindown power into very-high and ultra-high-energy photons.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the interaction between ionized jets, molecular outflows and their environments is critical to understanding high-mass star formation, especially because jets and outflows are thought to be key in the transfer of angular momentum outwards from accretion disks. We report a low-spectral resolution VLA survey for hydrogen radio recombination lines, OH, NH$_3$, and CH$_3$OH lines toward a sample of 58 high-mass star forming regions that contain numerous ionized jet candidates. The observations are from a survey designed to detect radio continuum; the novel aspect of this work is to search for spectral lines in broadband VLA data (we provide the script developed in this work to facilitate exploration of other datasets). We report detection of 25$\,$GHz CH$_3$OH transitions toward ten sources; five of them also show NH$_3$ emission. We found that most of the sources detected in CH$_3$OH and NH$_3$ have been classified as ionized jets or jet candidates and that the emission lines are coincident with, or very near ($\lesssim 0.1$ pc) these sources, hence, these molecular lines could be used as probes of the environment near the launching site of jets/outflows. No radio recombination lines were detected, but we found that the RMS noise of stacked spectra decreases following the radiometer equation. Therefore, detecting radio recombination lines in a sample of brighter free-free continuum sources should be possible. This work demonstrates the potential of broadband VLA continuum observations as low-resolution spectral line scans.

 - **Abstract**
 Photochemical hazes are expected to form and significantly contribute to the chemical and radiative balance of exoplanets with relatively moderate temperatures, possibly in the habitable zone of their host star. In the presence of humidity, haze particles might thus serve as cloud condensation nuclei and trigger the formation of water droplets. In the present work, we are interested in the chemical impact of such a close interaction between photochemical hazes and humidity on the organic content composing the hazes and on the capacity to generate organic molecules with high prebiotic potential. For this purpose, we explore experimentally the sweet spot by combining N-dominated super-Earth exoplanets in agreement with Titan's rich organic photochemistry and humid conditions expected for exoplanets in habitable zones. A logarithmic increase with time is observed for the relative abundance of oxygenated species, with O-containing molecules dominating after 1 month only. The rapidity of the process suggests that the humid evolution of N-rich organic haze provides an efficient source of molecules with high prebiotic potential.
#### The evolutionary stage of Betelgeuse inferred from its pulsation periods

 - **Abstract**
 Betelgeuse is a well known bright red supergiant that shows semi-regular variations with four approximate periods of 2200, 420, 230, and 185 days. While the longest period was customarily regarded as LSP (long secondary period) of unknown origin, we identify the ~2200-d period as the radial fundamental mode, and the three shorter periods as the radial first, second, and third overtones. From a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis including the pulsation/convection coupling, we have found that these radial pulsation modes are all excited in the envelope of a model in a late stage of the core-carbon burning. Models with similar pulsation property have masses around 11M_\odot (19M_\odot at ZAMS) with luminosities (log L/L_\odot =5.27~5.28) and effective temperatures (log T_{eff}\approx 3.53) that are consistent with the range of the observational determinations. We also find that a synthetic light curve obtained by adding the fundamental and the first-overtone mode qualitatively agrees with the light curve of Betelgeuse up to the Great Dimming. We conclude that Betelgeuse is in the late stage of core carbon burning, and a good candidate for the next Galactic supernova.
#### A matched-filter approach to radio variability and transients: searching  for orphan afterglows in the VAST Pilot Survey

 - **Abstract**
 Radio transient searches using traditional variability metrics struggle to recover sources whose evolution timescale is significantly longer than the survey cadence. Motivated by the recent observations of slowly evolving radio afterglows at gigahertz frequency, we present the results of a search for radio variables and transients using an alternative matched-filter approach. We designed our matched-filter to recover sources with radio light curves that have a high-significance fit to power-law and smoothly broken power-law functions; light curves following these functions are characteristic of synchrotron transients, including "orphan" gamma-ray burst afterglows, which were the primary targets of our search. Applying this matched-filter approach to data from Variables and Slow Transients Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian SKA Pathfinder, we produced five candidates in our search. Subsequent Australia Telescope Compact Array observations and analysis revealed that: one is likely a synchrotron transient; one is likely a flaring active galactic nucleus, exhibiting a flat-to-steep spectral transition over $4\,$months; one is associated with a starburst galaxy, with the radio emission originating from either star formation or an underlying slowly-evolving transient; and the remaining two are likely extrinsic variables caused by interstellar scintillation. The synchrotron transient, VAST J175036.1$-$181454, has a multi-frequency light curve, peak spectral luminosity and volumetric rate that is consistent with both an off-axis afterglow and an off-axis tidal disruption event; interpreted as an off-axis afterglow would imply an average inverse beaming factor $\langle f^{-1}_{\text{b}} \rangle = 860^{+1980}_{-710}$, or equivalently, an average jet opening angle of $\langle \theta_{\textrm{j}} \rangle = 3^{+4}_{-1}\,$deg.
#### Gravitational Wave Detection by Hollow-Core Fiber-Optics Mach-Zehnder  Interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in the field of very long distance optical communication suggest the adoption of the advanced technology based on Hollow Core Nested Anti-resonant Nodeless Fiber (HC-NANF) within the endeavour of Gravitational Wave detection using a Mach-Zehnder optical interferometer (MZ-IF). The proposal, consisting of a summary project of the device emphasizes the favorable properties of (MZ-IF) in comparison with Michelson Interferometer (MIF) currently in operation. The key feature of the proposed method consists of the use of a couple of "fibrated" metallic antennas enfolded by a very large (K x 8.10^4 with K=1,2,3 etc.) of coiled (HC-NANF) rings. This amounts to a corresponding fiber length: Leff = K x 1600 Km. The relevant properties of the device are noise reduction, absence of critical optical mirror alignment in a noisy environment, reduced spatial extension of the apparatus, exploration of the entire sky scenario by freely orientable antennas, a substational cost reduction of the apparatus. The remarkable properties of (HC-NANF), invented by F. Poletti in 2013 are currently investigated by his group at the University of Southampton (UK).
#### Long-term optical spectral monitoring of a changing-look active galactic  nucleus NGC 3516 -- II. Broad-line profile variability

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the broad H$\beta$ line profile variability of the "changing look" active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 3516 over a long period of 25 years. The observed change in the broad line profile may indicate a change in the geometry of the broad line region (BLR). Using spectral line profiles, we aim to explore changes in the kinematics and dimensions of the BLR in NGC 3516. We consider two possible scenarios, i.e. changes in the broad-line emission are caused by a decrease of ionization continuum emission or by the BLR obscuration by outer dusty regions. With this investigation we aim to clarify the CL mechanism of this AGN. We analyze the spectral band around the H$\beta$ line as well as the broad H$\beta$ line parameters, and how they change in time. We model the broad-line profiles assuming that there is an emission from the accretion disc superposed with an emission from a surrounding region that is outside the disc. We find that in the Type 1 activity phase, the BLR is very complex. There is a clear disc-like BLR that contributes to the broad line wings and an additional intermediate line region (ILR) that contributes to the line core. In the high activity phase, the ILR emission is close to the center of the line (in some cases slightly shifted to the red), whereas in the low activity phase (i.e., Type 2 phase), the ILR component has a significant shift to the blue, indicating an outflow. We propose that the changing look mechanism in NGC 3516 is rather connected with the intrinsic effects than with an outer obscuring region. It may still be possible that the dust has an important role in the low activity phase when it is coming inside of the BLR, making a dusty BLR. In this way, it causes a decrease in the ionization and recombination rates.
#### One hundred new unidentified optical emission lines from a  low-metallicity photodissociation region

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a rich spectrum of more than one hundred optical emission lines from neutral/molecular gas in the photodissociation region (PDR) around the mini-starburst cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We propose the term Deep Red Line (DRL) for these lines, which are concentrated in the spectral range 6000 Angstrom to 9300 Angstrom and have observed brightnesses ranging from 0.01% to 0.4% times that of the H beta lambda 4861 hydrogen recombination line. The vast majority of the DRLs have never previously been detected from astronomical nebulae. Some of them may be due to neutral atoms, but most have no credible identifications in databases of atomic line transitions, and it is possible that some may correspond to transitions in molecules or molecular ions. Analysis of the spatial distribution of the DRLs shows that they originate from a range of depths in the PDR, providing a missing link between the shallow layers probed by known fluorescent lines of neutral nitrogen and oxygen, and the more shielded layers probed by neutral carbon recombination lines. Comparison with other PDRs shows that the relative strength of the DRLs with respect to the [C I] lambda 8727 line increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity.
