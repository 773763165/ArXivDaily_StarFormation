          Probing beyond local-type non-Gaussianity with kSZ tomography

 - **Abstract**
 Non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations may arise from a variety of well motivated early Universe scenarios. In particular, inflationary theories with additional light degrees of freedom can generate a bispectrum that is peaked in the squeezed limit. While the presence of an additional massless scalar can produce local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, in general the squeezed limit of the bispectrum depends on the mass of the new degree of freedom, and can deviate from the local shape. The resulting bispectrum leaves a distinct imprint on the amplitude and scale-dependence of the galaxy bias, which for massive fields can differ from the $k^{-2}$ scaling from local type non-Gaussianity, providing an observational window into the physics of the early Universe. In this work we demonstrate that kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich tomography with next generation cosmological surveys will offer significant additional constraining power for both the shape and amplitude of scale-dependent bias arising from primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the local type. We show that this improved constraining power is robust to various obstacles such as the optical depth degeneracy, photometric redshift errors, and uncertainty in the galaxy bias model. With CMB S4 and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, we forecast that compared to the galaxy survey alone the addition of kSZ tomography will offer a roughly factor of two reduction in the measurement uncertainty of the amplitude $f_{NL}$ of primordial non-Gaussianity well beyond the local (massless) limit. We find that kSZ tomography extends the range of masses for which order unity constraints on $f_{NL}$ are achievable, as well as extending the range of masses for which the late time probes of the matter power spectrum outperform the sensitivity of the CMB itself.

          A Generative Modeling Approach to Reconstructing 21-cm Tomographic Data

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses of the cosmic 21-cm signal are hampered by astrophysical foregrounds that are far stronger than the signal itself. These foregrounds, typically confined to a wedge-shaped region in Fourier space, often necessitate the removal of a vast majority of modes, thereby degrading the quality of the data anisotropically. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep generative model based on stochastic interpolants to reconstruct the 21-cm data lost to wedge filtering. Our method leverages the non-Gaussian nature of the 21-cm signal to effectively map wedge-filtered 3D lightcones to samples from the conditional distribution of wedge-recovered lightcones. We demonstrate how our method is able to restore spatial information effectively, considering both varying cosmological initial conditions and astrophysics. Furthermore, we discuss a number of future avenues where this approach could be applied in analyses of the 21-cm signal, potentially offering new opportunities to improve our understanding of the Universe during the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionization.

          The evolution of the $M_{\mathrm{d}}-M_{\star}$ and $\dot M-M_{\star}$ correlations traces protoplanetary disc dispersal

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Observational surveys of entire star-forming regions have provided evidence of power-law correlations between the disc properties and the stellar mass, especially the disc mass (${M_d \propto M_*}^{\lambda_m}$) and the accretion rate ($\dot M \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc}}$). Whether the secular disc evolution affects said correlations is still debated: while the purely viscous scenario has been probed, other mechanisms could impact differently. We study the evolution of the slopes $\lambda_m$ and $\lambda_{acc}$ in the wind-driven and hybrid case and compare it to the viscous prediction, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations (performed with the 1D population synthesis code Diskpop, that we also present and release). Assuming $M_d(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{m, 0}}$ and $\dot M(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc, 0}}$ as initial conditions, we find that viscous and hybrid accretion preserve the shape of the correlations and evolve their slope; on the other hand, MHD winds change the shape of the correlations, bending them according to the scaling of the accretion timescale with the stellar mass. We also show how a spread in the initial conditions conceals this behaviour. We then analyse the impact of disc dispersal, and find that the currently available sample sizes ($\sim 30$ discs at 5 Myr) introduce stochastic oscillations in the slopes evolution, which dominate over the physical signatures. Increasing the sample size could mitigate this issue: $\sim 140$ discs at 5 Myr, corresponding to the complete Upper Sco sample, would give small enough error bars to use the evolution of the slopes as a proxy for the driving mechanism of disc evolution. Finally, we discuss how the observational claim of steepening slopes necessarily leads to an initially steeper $M_d - M_*$ correlation with respect to $\dot M - M_*$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays indicate the presence of gravitational wave signals, likely from supermassive black hole binaries. These binaries can produce two types of signals: a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) or deterministic continuous gravitational waves (CGW). Correctly separating these signals is essential for accurate signal recovery and interpretation. This paper investigates the interaction between GWB and CGW signals within current analysis pipelines, focusing on misinterpretations and biases in parameter estimation when these signals are analyzed separately or together. We conducted several simulations based on the European PTA 24.8-year dataset. First, we injected either a GWB or a CGW. We compared parameter estimation using different search models, including Earth term only, combined Earth and pulsar term CGW templates, and correlated (HD) or uncorrelated (CURN) power law GWB templates. Our findings show that, when searched independently, the GWB and CGW signals can be misinterpreted as each other, and only a combined search can recover the true signal present. For datasets containing both a GWB and a CGW, failure to account for the CGW biases the recovery of the GWB. However, a combined search allows for the recovery of both GWB and CGW parameters without significant bias. Care must be taken with the method used to perform combined searches on these multi-component datasets, as the CGW pulsar term can be misinterpreted as a CURN. This can be avoided by direct searches for an HD correlated GWB plus a CGW. Our study underscores the importance of combined searches to ensure unbiased recovery of GWB parameters in the presence of strong CGWs, which is crucial for interpreting signals recently found in PTA data and represents a step toward a robust framework for disentangling stochastic and deterministic GW signals in future, more sensitive datasets.

          Clouds on partial atmospheres of lava planets and where to find them

 - **Abstract**
 With dayside temperatures hot enough to sustain a magma ocean and a silicate atmosphere, lava planets are the best targets to study the atmosphere of a rocky world. In the absence of nightside heating, the entire atmosphere collapses near the day-night terminator, so condensation seems inevitable, but the impact of clouds on radiative transfer, dynamics, and observables has not yet been studied in the non-global atmospheric regime. Therefore, we simulate cloud formation and determine which lava planets should be most affected by clouds. We find that despite the scattering of visible light by clouds, heat advection compensates for the cooling effect of clouds in the atmosphere. On the other hand, surface temperatures are significantly affected and can drop 100-200 K under a cloudy sky. We find that among our targets, HD213885b and HD20329b are most affected by cloud formation: there is a discernable difference between having clouds and not having them, but the precision required to make such an inference is at the limit of current instruments.

          The Nature of the Emission Spectrum of NGC 7793 P13: modeling the atmosphere of the donor star

 - **Abstract**
 We continue to study the ultra-luminous X-ray source NGC 7793 P13 in the optical range. In this work, we are testing the model of a spherically symmetric wind atmosphere of the donor star, previously identified as a B9 Ia supergiant. The model spectrum has shown good agreement with the observed one at a relatively high mass loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 6\times10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$; other parameters turned out to be close to those expected for late B-supergiants. The increased mass loss rate can be explained by the high rotation velocity of the star. In addition, we have qualitatively demonstrated the effect of X-ray irradiation on the observed spectrum and discuss the fundamental possibility of wind acceleration under conditions of powerful irradiation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of 239 trans-Neptunian Objects discovered through the on-going New Horizons survey for distant minor bodies being performed with the Hyper Suprime-Cam mosaic imager on the Subaru Telescope. These objects were discovered in images acquired with either the r2 or the recently commissioned EB-gri filter using shift and stack routines. Due to the extremely high stellar density of the search region down stream of the spacecraft, new machine learning techniques had to be developed to manage the extremely high false positive rate of bogus candidates produced from the shift and stack routines. We report discoveries as faint as r2$\sim26.5$. We highlight an overabundance of objects found at heliocentric distances $R\gtrsim70$~au compared to expectations from modelling of the known outer Solar System. If confirmed, these objects betray the presence of a heretofore unrecognized abundance of distant objects that can help explain a number of other observations that otherwise remain at odds with the known Kuiper Belt, including detections of serendipitous stellar occultations, and recent results from the Student Dust Counter on-board the New Horizons spacecraft.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations by the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK) detectors have provided new insights in the demographics of stellar-origin black hole binaries (sBHB). A few years before gravitational-wave signals from sBHB mergers are recorded in the LVK detectors, their early coalescence will leave a unique signature in the ESA/NASA mission Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Multiband observations of sBHB sources between LISA and LVK detectors opens an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the astrophysical environment and multi-messenger early-alerts. In this study, we report the sBHB sources that will be present in the LISA data derived directly from the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation Illustris. By surveying snapshots across cosmological volume, metallicity and look-back time, we find that about tens to thousand sBHB candidates will be present in the LISA data for various combinations of mission lifetime. For estimates consistent with the LVK rates, we find that only 20 sBHBs across Illustris snapshots will be detected with significant confidence for a 10-year LISA mission, while a 4-year LISA mission would detect only 2 sBHBs. Our work paves the way for creating LISA mock data and bench marking LISA detection pipelines directly using cosmological simulations.

          The Trojan-like Colors of Low-Perihelion Kuiper Belt Objects

 - **Abstract**
 An important testable prediction of dynamical instability models for the early evolution of the Solar System is that Jupiter Trojans share a source population with the Kuiper belt. Concrete evidence of this prediction remains elusive, as Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and Jupiter Trojans appear to have different surface compositions. We address the long-standing question of Trojan origin by finding a dynamical sub-population in the Kuiper belt with Trojan-like colors. Combining existing photometric data with our own surveys on Keck I and Palomar P200, we find that the low-perihelion ($q<30 $AU, $a>30 $AU) component of the Kuiper belt has colors that bifurcate similarly to the Jupiter Trojans, unlike Centaurs ($a<30 $AU) which have redder, Kuiper belt-like colors. To connect the Jupiter Trojans to the Kuiper belt, we test whether the distinct Trojan-like colors of low-perihelion KBOs result from surface processing, or are sourced from a specific population in the Kuiper belt. By simulating the evolution of the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey synthetic population of KBOs for four billion years, we find that differences in heating timescales cannot result in a significant depletion of Very Red low-perihelion KBOs as compared to the Centaurs. We find that the neutrally-colored scattered disk objects ($e>0.6$ KBOs) contribute more to the low-perihelion KBO population rather than Centaurs, resulting in their different colors.

 - **Abstract**
 The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of close-in exoplanets provide clues to their formation and evolutionary history. Many close-in exoplanets likely formed far out in their protoplanetary disks and migrated to their current orbits, perhaps via high-eccentricity migration (HEM), a process that can also excite obliquities. A handful of known exoplanets are perhaps caught in the act of HEM, as they are observed on highly eccentric orbits with tidal circularization timescales shorter than their ages. One such exoplanet is Kepler-1656 b, which is also the only known non-giant exoplanet (<100 $M_\oplus$) with an extreme eccentricity (e=0.84). We measured the sky-projected obliquity of Kepler-1656 b by observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during a transit with the Keck Planet Finder. Our data are consistent with an aligned orbit, but are also consistent with moderate misalignment with $\lambda < 50$ deg at 95% confidence, with the most likely solution of $35^{+14.9}_{-21.6}$ deg. A low obliquity would be an unlikely outcome of most eccentricity-exciting scenarios, but we show that the properties of the outer companion in the system are consistent with the coplanar HEM mechanism. Alternatively, if the system is not relatively coplanar (<20 deg mutual inclination), Kepler-1656 b may be presently at a rare snapshot of long-lived eccentricity oscillations that do not induce migration. Kepler-1656 b is only the fourth exoplanet with e>0.8 to have its obliquity constrained; expanding this population will help establish the degree to which orbital misalignment accompanies migration. Future work that constrains the mutual inclinations of outer perturbers will be key for distinguishing plausible mechanisms.

          KPF Confirms a Polar Orbit for KELT-18 b

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first spectroscopic transit results from the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder on the Keck-I telescope at W. M. Keck Observatory. We observed a transit of KELT-18 b, an inflated ultra-hot Jupiter orbiting a hot star ($T_\text{eff} = 6670$ K) with a binary stellar companion. By modeling the perturbation to the measured cross correlation functions using the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique, we derived a sky projected obliquity of $\lambda = -94.8 \pm 0.7$ deg ($\psi = 93.8_{-1.8}^{+1.6}$ deg for isotropic $i_\star$). The data are consistent with an extreme stellar differential rotation ($\alpha = 0.9$), though a more likely explanation is moderate center-to-limb variations of the emergent stellar spectrum. We see additional evidence for the latter from line widths increasing towards the limb. Using loose constraints on the stellar rotation period from observed variability in the available TESS photometry, we were able to constrain the stellar inclination and thus the true 3D stellar obliquity to $\psi = 91.7_{-1.8}^{+2.2}$ deg. KELT-18 b could have obtained its polar orbit through high-eccentricity migration initiated by Kozai-Lidov oscillations induced by the binary stellar companion KELT-18 B, as the two likely have a large mutual inclination as evidenced by Gaia astrometry. KELT-18 b adds another data point to the growing population of close-in polar planets, particularly around hot stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging due to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here, we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ($\nu_{\mathrm{max}}\sim4300\mu$Hz) in the nearby K-dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using extreme precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20-second cadence photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of $5.9\pm0.8\,$cm$\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and $0.8\pm0.2$ ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity-velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}<\,5500\,$K diminish in scale following a $(L/M)^{1.5}$ relation. By modeling the star's oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of $4.5\pm0.9\,\rm{(ran)} \pm 1.0\,\rm{(sys)}$ Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the OATMEAL survey, an effort to measure the obliquities of stars with transiting brown dwarf companions. We observed a transit of the close-in ($P_{\rm orb} = 1.74 \,$ days) brown dwarf GPX-1 b using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph to measure the sky-projected angle between its orbital axis and the spin axis of its early F-type host star ($\lambda$). We measured $\lambda = 6.88 \pm 1.72 ^\circ$ (with additional unquantified systematic uncertainty), suggesting an orbit that is prograde and well aligned with the stellar equator. Hot Jupiters around early F stars are frequently found to have highly misaligned orbits, with polar and retrograde orbits being commonplace. It has been theorized that these misalignments stem from dynamical interactions, such as von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov cycles, and are retained over long timescales due to weak tidal dissipation in stars with radiative envelopes. By comparing GPX-1 to similar systems under the frameworks of different tidal evolution theories, we argued that the rate of tidal dissipation is too slow to have re-aligned the system. This suggests that GPX-1 may have arrived at its close-in orbit via coplanar high-eccentricity migration or migration through an aligned protoplanetary disk. Our result for GPX-1 is the fifth measurement of the obliquity of a star with a transiting brown dwarf. By enlarging the number of such measurements and comparing them with hot Jupiter systems, we will more clearly discern the differences between the mechanisms that dictate the formation and evolution of both classes of objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar X-ray and UV radiation can significantly affect the survival, composition, and long-term evolution of the atmospheres of planets in or near their host star's habitable zone (HZ). Especially interesting are planetary systems in the solar neighborhood that may host temperate and potentially habitable surface conditions, which may be analyzed by future ground and space-based direct-imaging surveys for signatures of habitability and life. To advance our understanding of the radiation environment in these systems, we leverage $\sim$3 Msec of XMM-Newton and Chandra observations in order to measure three fundamental stellar properties at X-ray energies for 57 nearby FGKM stellar systems: the shape of the stellar X-ray spectrum, the luminosity, and the timescales over which the stars vary (e.g., due to flares). These systems possess HZs that will be directly imageable to next-generation telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory and ground-based Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). We identify 29 stellar systems with $L_X/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios similar to (or less than) that of the Sun; any potential planets in the habitable zones of these stars therefore reside in present day X-ray radiation environments similar to (or less hostile than) modern Earth, though a broader set of these targets could host habitable planets. An additional 19 stellar systems have been observed with the Swift X-ray Telescope; in total, only $\sim$30% of potential direct imaging target stars has been observed with XMM-Newton, Chandra, or Swift. The data products from this work (X-ray light curves and spectra) are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11490574).

 - **Abstract**
 The SPECtrophotometer for TRansmission spectroscopy of exoplanets (SPECTR) is a new low-resolution optical (3800 Å - 6850 Å) spectrophotometer installed at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) 1.8 m telescope. SPECTR is designed for observing the transmission spectra of transiting exoplanets. Unique features of SPECTR are its long slit length of 10 arcminutes which facilitates observing the target and the comparison star simultaneously, and its wide slit width to minimize slit losses. SPECTR will be used to survey exoplanets, such as those identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), providing information about their radii across the wavelength range. In this paper, we present the design of SPECTR and the observational results of the partial transit of HD 189733 b and a full transit of Qatar-8 b. Analyses show the SPECTR's capability on the white light curves with an accuracy of one ppt. The transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b shows general agreement with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Pictor A is a $\gamma$-ray emitting radio galaxy and has a bright hotspot called WHS, located $\sim$4 arcmin away from the nucleus. In this letter, we present an analysis of its 16-year Fermi-LAT data and report the first Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation for this source. Our analysis of the Fermi-LAT observations reveals evidence of two components in the average $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Pictor A, exhibiting a statistically significant hardening from $\Gamma^1_{\gamma}=3.25\pm0.15$ to $\Gamma^2_{\gamma}=1.81\pm0.07$ at a break energy of $2.46\pm0.09$ GeV. The evident variability of $\gamma$-rays is observed in Pictor A. Interestingly, the variability is dominated by the component below the break energy, and the component above the break energy shows no variability. Furthermore, we find that a power-law function can adequately fit the spectrum during high-flux states, whereas a broken power-law is still required to explain the spectrum during low-flux state. We suggest that the low-energy component originates from the nucleus, while the high-energy component primarily stems from WHS. The broadband spectral energy distributions of both nucleus and WHS can be well represented by a simple leptonic model, with both $\gamma$-ray components attributed to the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) process. The analysis of IXPE data on the nucleus yields an upper limit to the polarization degree $\Pi_{\rm X}<$8.9\% in the 2--8 keV band, agreeing with its X-ray emission originating from SSC. However, $\Pi_{\rm X}=23.5\%\pm5.6\%$ is observed at a confidence level of $>99\%$ in the 5--7 keV band, and the possible physical origin of this narrow-energy-band polarization signal is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinematic studies of protoplanetary discs are a valuable method for uncovering hidden companions. In the first paper of this series, we presented five morphological and kinematic criteria that aid in asserting the binary nature of a protoplanetary disc. In this work we study the kinematic signatures of circumbinary discs in the residuals of their velocity maps. We show that Doppler-flips, spiral arms, eccentric gas motion, fast flows inside of the cavity, and vortex-like kinematic signatures are commonly observed. Unlike in the planetary mass companion case, Doppler-flips in circumbinary discs are not necessarily centred on a companion, and can extend towards the cavity edge. We then compare the kinematic signatures in our simulations with observations and see similarities to the Doppler-flip signal in HD 100546 and the vortex-like kinematic signatures in HD 142527. Our analysis also reveals kinematic evidence for binarity in several protoplantary disks typically regarded as circumstellar rather than circumbinary, including AB Aurigae and HD 100546.

 - **Abstract**
 On May 27 2024, the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) mission detected enhanced X-ray emission from a new transient source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) during its commissioning phase. Prompt follow-up with the EP Follow-up X-ray Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope and Nicer have revealed a very soft, thermally emitting source (kT$\sim$0.1 keV at the outburst peak) with an X-ray luminosity of L$\sim$4$\times$10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, coincident with CXOU J005245.0-722844. This super-soft outburst faded very quickly in a week time. Several emission lines and absorption edges were present in the X-ray spectrum, such as the Oxygen (0.57 keV) and Neon (0.92 keV) He-like emission lines, and deep Nitrogen (0.67 keV) and Oxygen (0.87 keV) absorption edges. The X-ray emission resembles typical nova outbursts from an accreting white dwarf (WD) in a binary system, despite the X-ray source being historically associated with an O9-B0e massive star exhibiting a 17.55 days periodicity in the optical band. The discovery of this super-soft outburst nails down CXOU J005245.0-722844 as a BeWD X-ray binary: an elusive evolutionary stage where two main-sequence massive stars have undergone a common envelope phase and experienced at least two episodes of mass transfer. In addition, the very short duration of the outburst and the presence of Ne features hint at a rather massive, i.e., close to the Chandrasekhar limit, Ne-O WD in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 When observing astronomical objects, we must deal with extinction (i.e. the absorption and scattering of the emitted radiation by dust and gas between the source and the observer). Interstellar extinction depends on the location of the object and the wavelength. The different extinction laws describing these effects are difficult to estimate for a small sample of stars. Many sophisticated and automatic methods have recently been developed for estimating astrophysical parameters (age and metallicity, for example) depending on the reddening, which is usually treated as a free parameter within the corresponding estimations. However, many reddening values for stars have been published over the last few decades, most of which include observations in the ultraviolet, which are essential for a good estimation but are essentially no longer considered. We searched the literature through the end of 2022 for published independent reddening values of stellar objects based on various methods that exclude estimates from reddening maps. In addition, we present new reddening estimates based on the classical photometric indices in the Geneva, Johnson, and Stromgren-Crawford systems. These are based on well-established and reliable calibrations. After a careful identification procedure and quality assessment of the data, we calculated the mean reddening values of 157 631 individual available measurements for 97 826 objects. We find several statistically significant offsets and trends within the different references and discuss possible explanations for them.

 Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.9^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=5.36^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ AU, $e_{c}=0.26^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$) exterior to previously known close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocity observations. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected obliquity $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true obliquity of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}<33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is the first hot Jupiter system where both the true obliquity of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.

          Why Do Stars Turn Red?

 - **Abstract**
 When a star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, the core contracts, and the envelope may expand to $\sim 100$ times its original size. Consequently, stars with $\lesssim 8$ solar masses become red giants, while those with $\gtrsim 8$ solar masses evolve into red supergiants. However, the physics driving this extreme expansion is unclear. This letter presents a new mechanism grounded in the instability of stellar envelopes to explain the expansion. If the gravitational energy released by core contraction can trigger the initial expansion to a critical radius where the envelope becomes unstable, the star then continues expanding until stabilizing, thereby becoming a red giant or supergiant. We demonstrate that the envelope instability can explain several elusive features in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, such as the Hertzsprung gap between the main sequence and the red giant branch, as well as the dichotomy of the supergiant populations in red and blue.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraining the formation processes of small solar system bodies is crucial for gaining insights into planetesimal formation. Their bulk densities, determined by their compressive strengths, offer valuable information about their formation history. In this paper, we utilize a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from dust $N$-body simulations to establish the relation between bulk density and diameter. We find that this relation can be effectively approximated by a polytrope with an index of 0.5, coupled with a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates. The lowest-density trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and main-belt asteroids (MBAs) are well reproduced by dust aggregates composed of 0.1-$\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized grains. However, most TNOs, MBAs, comets, and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) exhibit higher densities, suggesting the influence of compaction mechanisms such as collision, dust grain disruption, sintering, or melting, leading to further growth. We speculate that there are two potential formation paths for small solar system bodies: one involves the direct coagulation of primordial dust grains, resulting in the formation of first-generation planetesimals, including the lowest-density TNOs, MBAs, and parent bodies of comets and NEAs. In this case, comets and NEAs are fragments or rubble piles of first-generation planetesimals, and objects themselves or rubbles are composed of 0.1-$\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized grains. The other path involves further potential fragmentation of first-generation planetesimals into compact dust aggregates observed in protoplanetary disks, resulting in the formation of second-generation planetesimals composed of compact dust aggregates, which may contribute to explaining another formation process of comets and NEAs.

 The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.

 - **Abstract**
 XTE J1701-462 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS LMXB) discovered in 2006 as the first system to demonstrate unambiguously that the `Atoll' and `Z' classes of accreting neutron stars are separated by accretion rate. Radio observations during the 2006/7 outburst provided evidence for the formation of a relativistic jet, as now expected for all accreting neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries at high accretion rates. The source entered a new outburst in 2022, and we report 29 observations made with the MeerKAT radio telescope. The first radio detection was on the 16th September 2022, we continued detecting the source until mid-December 2022. Thereafter, establishing radio upper limits till 25 March 2023. We present the radio analysis alongside analysis of contemporaneous X-ray observations from MAXI. The radio light curve shows evidence for at least three flare-like events over the first hundred days, the most luminous of which has an associated minimum energy of $1\times10^{38}$ erg. We provide a detailed comparison with the 2006/7 outburst, and demonstrate that we detected radio emission from the source for considerably longer in the more recent outburst, although this is probably a function of sampling. We further constrain the radio emission from the source to have a polarisation of less than 9% at the time of 2022 IXPE detection of X-ray polarisation. Finally, we place the source in the radio -- X-ray plane, demonstrating that when detected in radio it sits in a comparable region of parameter space to the other Z-sources.

 Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our Solar System. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with the sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ in a non-transitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (${\lesssim}$25 au in radius) nature, the broad line width ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$), and the high excitation temperature (${\sim}$200 K) indicate sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$, methanol (CH$_3$OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH$_3$OCH$_3$/CH$_3$OH ${\gtrsim}$7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that, in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (${\gtrsim}$20 au).

 Thermal Doppler broadening of spectral profiles for particle populations in the absence or presence of potential fields are described by kappa distributions. The kappa distribution provides a replacement for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which can be considered as a generalization for describing systems characterized by local correlations among their particles as found in space and astrophysical plasmas. This paper presents all special cases of kappa distributions as members of a general pathway family of densities introduced by Mathai.

 The identification of complex prebiotic molecules using millimeter and submillimeter telescopes allows us to understand how the basic building blocks of life are formed in the universe. In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is the reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of $aGg^{\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is (4.5$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 155$\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH are 3.1$\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the observed abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the possible formation pathways of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is probably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular cloud collisions are a prominent theory for the formation of stars. Observational studies into cloud collisions identify the collision via a bridging feature: a continuous strip of line emission that connects two intensity peaks that are related in position space and separated in velocity space. Currently, most observations of collisions and these bridging features take place in the Milky Way disc. They are also theorized to take place in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), where temperatures and densities are both significantly higher than in the disc. For studies in the Milky Way Disc, the most commonly-used tracer tends to be CO. However, for studies in the CMZ, where the density and temperature are significantly higher, CO becomes so abundant that it loses its ability to adequately highlight the bridging feature of cloud collisions. As a result, studies have begun using other tracers, whose physical and chemical behavior has not been studied under CMZ conditions. We perform combined hydrodynamical, chemical and radiative transfer simulations of cloud collisions under both disc- and CMZ-like conditions, and investigate collision signatures in a number of commonly-observed molecular lines. Under the Milky Way disc conditions \( \co \) has the standard bridging feature; however, the other tracers, CS, HCO$^{+}$, N$_2$H$^{+}$ only emit in the intermediate-velocity bridge region, making the feature itself non-existent. In the CMZ, the higher density and temperature make the bridging feature far more indistinct for CO, but the other tracers have morphologically similar bridging features to the CO disc model, validating their use as tracers of cloud collisions under these conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Several evolved stars have been found to exhibit long-period radial velocity variations that cannot be explained by planetary or brown dwarf companions. Non-radial oscillations caused by oscillatory convective modes have been put forth as an alternative explanation, but no modeling attempt has yet been undertaken. We provide a model of a non-radial oscillation, aiming to explain the observed variations of the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127. The star was previously reported to host a brown dwarf companion, but whose existence was later refuted in the literature. We reanalyzed 58 archival HARPS spectra, acquiring additional activity indicators using the SERVAL and RACCOON pipelines. We searched for periodicity in the indicators and correlations between the indicators and radial velocities. We further present a simulation code able to produce synthetic HARPS spectra, incorporating the effect of non-radial oscillations, and compare the simulated results to the observed variations. We find a positive correlation between chromatic index and radial velocity, along with closed-loop Lissajous-like correlations between radial velocity and each of the spectral line shape indicators (full width at half maximum, and contrast of the cross-correlation function and differential line width). Simulations of a low-amplitude, retrograde, dipole (l = 1, m = 1), non-radial oscillation can reproduce the observed behavior and explain the observables. Photometric variations below the detection threshold of the available ASAS-3 photometry are predicted. The oscillation and stellar parameters are largely in agreement with the prediction of oscillatory convective modes. The periodic variations of the radial velocities and activity indicators, along with the respective phase shifts, measured for the intermediate-mass cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127, can be explained by a non-radial oscillation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars do not form in isolation but together with other stars, and often in a clustered environment. Depending on the initial conditions in these environments, such as initial density and substructure, the distances of encounters between stars will differ. These encounters can also affect just-formed exoplanetary systems. Using N-body simulations, we show the effect of a single fly-by on a common type of exoplanetary system: close-in Super-Earths/sub-Neptunes with or without a distant Giant planet. Even a single encounter can significantly modify the architecture of these exoplanetary systems over their long lifetimes. We test fly-bys with different characteristics, such as distance and mass, and show how they perturb the inner planets long after the encounter, leading to collisions and mutual inclination excitation, which can significantly modify the observed architecture of these systems in transit. We find that our initially four-planet inner systems reduce to three or two inner planets depending on their initial separation and that the mutual inclinations of these remaining planets can be high enough to reduce the number of observable, transiting planets. In our 500 Myr simulations, we show that this reduction in the number of transiting planets due to stellar fly-bys can contribute to the observed excess of single-transit systems.

 - **Abstract**
 NRAO and SpaceX have been engaged in coordinated testing efforts since Fall 2021, including conducting experiments on different interference avoidance schemes for the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) inside the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) in West Virginia. The Starlink system is capable of avoiding direct illumination of telescope sites with their adaptive tasking to place downlink beams far away. Nevertheless, even satellites operating in this mode can potentially present strong signals into the telescope's receiver system if they pass close to the telescope's main beam at the boresight. For additional protection, Starlink satellites can either momentarily redirect or completely disable their downlink channels while they pass within some minimum angular separation threshold from the telescope's boresight, methods that are referred to as "telescope boresight avoidance". In two separate experiments conducted since Fall 2023, NRAO and SpaceX arranged to have the GBT observe a fixed RA/Dec position in the sky, chosen to have a large number of close-to-boresight Starlink passages. Preliminary analysis from these two experiments illustrate the feasibility of these avoidance methods to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the negative impact of close-to-boresight satellite passages. Importantly, these experiments demonstrate the value of continuing cooperative efforts between NRAO and SpaceX, and expanding cooperation between the radio astronomy and satellite communities more generally.

 I show that microlens parallaxes, $\pi_{\rm E}$, can be derived for free-floating planets (FFPs) with masses down to that of Pluto, by combining observations from a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit with another observatory that is on or near Earth's surface, i.e., either ground-based or in low Earth orbit (LEO). Because these low-mass FFPs typically have measurements of the angular Einstein radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$, from finite-source effects, such $\pi_{\rm E}$ measurements directly yield the FFP mass $M=\theta_{\rm E}/\kappa \pi_{\rm E}$ where $\kappa$ is a physical constant. Such Earth-GEO measurements almost perfectly complement Earth-L2 measurements, which extend to higher FFP mass and greater FFP distance. LEO-only observations can yield mass measurement at even smaller FFP mass and nearer FFP distances. I discuss methods for breaking the Refsdal (1966) two-fold degeneracy in $\pi_{{\rm E},\pm}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic monitoring of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. First we focus on the evolution of the most prominent spectral features observed in the low resolution spectra, then we discuss more in detail the high resolution spectrum collected for NGC 300 2008OT-1 with the Very Large Telescope equipped with UVES. Finally we analyse late time spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd through comparisons with both synthetic and observed spectra. Balmer and Ca lines dominate the optical spectra, revealing the presence of slowly moving circumstellar medium (CSM) around the objects. The line luminosity of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Ca II NIR triplet presents a double peaked evolution with time, possibly indicative of interaction between fast ejecta and the slow CSM. The high resolution spectrum of NGC 300 2008OT-1 reveals a complex circumstellar environment, with the transient being surrounded by a slow ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$) progenitor wind. At late epochs, optical spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd show broad ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$) emission features at $\sim$6170 A and $\sim$7000 A which are unprecedented for ILRTs. We find that these lines originate most likely from the blending of several narrow lines, possibly of iron-peak elements.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the frequency of transiting planetary systems around metal-polluted white dwarfs using high-cadence photometry from ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC on the ground, and space-based observations with TESS. Within a sample of 313 metal-polluted white dwarfs with available TESS light curves, two systems known to have irregular transits are blindly recovered by box-least-squares and Lomb-Scargle analyses, with no new detections, yielding a transit fraction of 0.8 (-0.4, +0.6) per cent. Planet detection sensitivities are determined using simulated transit injection and recovery for all light curves, producing upper limit occurrences over radii from dwarf to Kronian planets, with periods from 1 h to 27 d. The dearth of short-period, transiting planets orbiting polluted white dwarfs is consistent with engulfment during the giant phases of stellar evolution, and modestly constrains dynamical re-injection of planets to the shortest orbital periods. Based on simple predictions of transit probability, where (R + Rp)/a ~ 0.01, the findings here are nominally consistent with a model where 100 per cent of polluted white dwarfs have circumstellar debris near the Roche limit; however, the small sample size precludes statistical confidence in this result. Single transits are also ruled out in all light curves using a search for correlated outliers, providing weak constraints on the role of Oort-like comet clouds in white dwarf pollution.
