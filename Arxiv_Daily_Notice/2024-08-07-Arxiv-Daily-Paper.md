 - **Abstract**
 EXO 0748-676 is a well-studied neutron star (NS) Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) that recently emerged from 16 years of quiescence into a new outburst. Here, we report the results from a 53 ks XMM-Newton observation to compare with studies for the previous outburst, particularly focusing on high-resolution spectroscopy using the same instrument (RGS) that produced important results for this source during the previous outburst. The EPIC light curve reveals a type I X-ray burst at MJD 60492.31. The entire data are divided into burstless, pre-, and post-burst spectra to understand the effect of the burst on the ionization structure. The spectra for dip and non-dip phases are also created. The primary spectral feature in all phases is a broad O VII recombination line, along with velocity-broadened OVIII, NVII, and Ne IX lines. Notably, the Ne IX line is detected at different ionization states for the pre-burst (11.65 Å) and post-burst (13.56 Å) phases. The O VIII line profile also shows a difference in equivalent width between dip and non-dip phases. These findings suggest the presence of highly ionized circumstellar material or collisionally ionized gas affected by the burst and dips. The source remains in a soft spectral state, which is consistent with observations during the previous outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive analysis of the argon K-edge absorption region (3.1-4.2 Å) using high-resolution HETGS {\it Chandra} spectra of 33 low-mas X-ray binaries. Utilizing R-matrix theory, we computed new K photoabsorption cross-sections for {\rm Ar}~{\sc i}--{\rm Ar}~{\sc xvi} species. For each X-ray source, we estimated column densities for the {\rm Ar}~{\sc i}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc ii}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc iii}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc xvi}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc xvii} and {\rm Ar}~{\sc xviii} ions, which trace the neutral, warm and hot components of the gaseous Galactic interstellar medium. We examined their distribution as a function of Galactic latitude, longitude, and distances to the sources. However, no significant correlations were discerned among distances, Galactic latitude, or longitude. Future X-ray observatories will allow us to benchmark the atomic data as the main resonance lines will be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The first interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, Borisov and IM1, were discovered over the past decade. Aims. We follow the trajectories of known interstellar objects in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy to constrain their possible origin. Methods. We initiate the trajectories based on the measured velocities of the interstellar objects relative to the Local Standard of Rest. Since the scale-height of stars in the Milky-Way disk increases with age, we use the vertical excursion of each interstellar object from the Milky-Way disk mid-plane to constrain their likely age. Results. The small vertical extent of 'Oumuamua's past trajectory suggests that it originated near the mid-plane of the thin disk, implying a likely age younger than 1-2 Gyr. The maximal excursion of the comet Borisov is similar to that of the Sun, suggesting a similar age. The meteor IM1 exhibits yet larger vertical excursions, suggesting an older source. Finally, we show that human-made interstellar probes, like Voyager 1 or Pioneer 10 will arrive at the opposite side of the Milky Way disk relative to the Sun in $\sim$ 2 Gyr and return to the vicinity of the Sun before it becomes a red giant.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive evolved stars such as red supergiants and hypergiants are potential progenitors of Type II supernovae, and they are known for ejecting substantial amounts of matter, up to half their initial mass, during their final evolutionary phases. The rate and mechanism of this mass loss play a crucial role in determining their ultimate fate and the likelihood of their progression to supernovae. However, the exact mechanisms driving this mass ejection have long been a subject of research. Recent observations, such as the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, have suggested that the activity of large convective cells, combined with pulsation, could be a plausible explanation for such mass loss events. In this context, we conducted interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant, $\rho$~Cassiopeiae using the CHARA Array in H and K-band wavelengths. $\rho$~Cas is well known for its recurrent eruptions, characterized by periods of visual dimming ($\sim$~1.5-2 mag) followed by recovery. From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of $1.04\pm0.01$ milliarcseconds (mas), or $564 - 700~R_\odot$. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star's envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K-band ($\lambda=2.31-2.38 ~\mu$m), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of $1.45\pm0.10$ mas.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves have revolutionised the field of astronomy by providing scientists with a new way to observe the universe and gain a better understanding of exotic objects like black holes. Several large-scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) have been constructed worldwide, with a focus on achieving the best sensitivity possible. However, in order for a detector to operate at its intended sensitivity, its optics must be free from imperfections such as thermal lensing effects. In the GEO\,600 gravitational wave detector, the beam splitter (BS) experiences a significant thermal lensing effect due to the high power build-up in the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) combined with a very small beam waist. This causes the fundamental mode to be converted into higher order modes (HOMs), subsequently impacting the detector's performance. To address this issue, the GEO\,600 detector is equipped with a thermal compensation system (TCS) applied to the BS. This involves projecting a spatially tunable heating pattern through an optical system onto the beam splitter. The main objective of the TCS is to counteract the thermal lens at the BS and restore the detector to its ideal operating condition. This paper presents the new beam splitter TCS in GEO\,600, its commissioning, and its effect on strain sensitivity. It also outlines the planned upgrade to further enhance the performance of the TCS.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's DART and ESA's Hera missions offer a unique opportunity to investigate the delivery of impact ejecta to other celestial bodies. We performed ejecta dynamical simulations using 3 million particles categorized into three size populations (10 cm, 0.5 cm, and 30 $\mu$m) and constrained by early post-impact LICIACube observations. The main simulation explored ejecta velocities ranging from 1 to 1,000 m/s, while a secondary simulation focused on faster ejecta with velocities from 1 to 2 km/s. We identified DART ejecta orbits compatible with the delivery of meteor-producing particles to Mars and Earth. Our results indicate the possibility of ejecta reaching the Mars Hill sphere in 13 years for launch velocities around 450 m/s, which is within the observed range. Some ejecta particles launched at 770 m/s could reach Mars's vicinity in 7 years. Faster ejecta resulted in a higher flux delivery towards Mars and particles impacting the Earth Hill sphere above 1.5 km/s. The delivery process is slightly sensitive to the initial observed cone range and driven by synodic periods. The launch locations for material delivery to Mars were predominantly northern the DART impact site, while they displayed a southwestern tendency for the Earth-Moon system. Larger particles exhibit a marginally greater likelihood of reaching Mars, while smaller particles favor delivery to Earth-Moon, although this effect is insignificant. To support observational campaigns for DART-created meteors, we provide comprehensive information on the encounter characteristics (orbital elements and radiants) and quantify the orbital decoherence degree of the released meteoroids.

 - **Abstract**
 While the nitrile group is by far the most prevalent one among interstellar molecules, the existence of interstellar dinitriles (molecules containing two -CN groups) has recently been proven. Here we report the discovery of two new dinitriles in the cold dense cloud TMC-1. These newly identified species are malononitrile, CH2(CN)2, and maleonitrile, the Z isomer of NC-CH=CH-CN, which can be seen as the result of substituting two H atoms with two -CN groups in methane and ethylene, respectively. These two molecules were detected using data from the ongoing QUIJOTE line survey of TMC-1 that is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. We derive column densities of 1.8e11 cm-2 and 5.1e10 cm-2 for malononitrile and maleonitrile, respectively. This means that they are eight and three times less abundant than HCC-CH2-CN and (E)-HCC-CH=CH-CN, respectively, which are analog molecules detected in TMC-1 in which one -CN group is converted into a -CCH group. This is in line with previous findings in which -CCH derivatives are more abundant than the -CN counterparts in TMC-1. We examined the potential chemical pathways to these two dinitriles, and we find that while maleonitrile can be efficiently formed through the reaction of CN with CH2CHCN, the formation of malononitrile is not clear because the neutral-neutral reactions that could potentially form it are not feasible under the physical conditions of TMC-1.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new analysis of Kepler-21, the brightest (V = 8.5) Kepler system with a known transiting exoplanet, Kepler-21 b. Kepler-21 b is a radius valley planet ($R = 1.6\pm 0.2 R_{\oplus}$) with an Earth-like composition (8.38$\pm$1.62 g/cc), though its mass and radius fall in the regime of possible "water worlds." We utilize new Keck/HIRES and WIYN/NEID radial velocity (RV) data in conjunction with Kepler and TESS photometry to perform a detailed study of activity mitigation between photometry and RVs. We additionally refine the system parameters, and we utilize Gaia astrometry to place constraints on a long-term RV trend. Our activity analysis affirms the quality of Kepler photometry for removing correlated noise from RVs, despite its temporal distance, though we reveal some cases where TESS may be superior. Using refined orbital parameters and updated composition curves, we rule out a ``water world" scenario for Kepler-21 b, and we identify a long period super-Jupiter planetary candidate, Kepler-21 (c).

          Exploring the broadband spectral and timing characteristics of GRS 1915+105 with AstroSat and NICER observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we undertake a spectral-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary source GRS 1915+105 using simultaneous observations carried out by AstroSat (LAXPC and SXT) and NICER in 2017. The source showed two flux levels (high and low), whose energy spectra can be described by the thermal comptonization of disk photons. The spectral parameters obtained by the joint fitting of SXT/LAXPC and NICER/LAXPC were consistent. The power density spectra from LAXPC and NICER revealed a broad, prominent feature at approximately 2 Hz. The energy dependence of the fractional R.M.S. and time lag of this feature cannot be explained by only variations of coronal spectral parameters. Instead, a model where the coronal heating rate varies first and induces a change in the disk temperature and inner radius can explain the variation. Our results underline the importance of simultaneous observations by AstroSat and NICER and highlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the spectral-temporal behavior of black hole systems.

 - **Abstract**
 A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 $M_\odot$ helium novae with mass accretion rates of $(1.6-7.5) \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days to 10 years) and high X-ray luminosities ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transients or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical pre-maximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of nova study. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from literature on extra-galactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD.

          A framework for incorporating binding energy distribution in gas-ice astrochemical models

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most serious limitations of current astrochemical models with the rate equation (RE) approach is that only a single type of binding site is considered in grain surface chemistry, although laboratory and quantum chemical studies have found that surfaces contain various binding sites with different potential energy depths. When various sites exist, adsorbed species can be trapped in deep potential sites, increasing the resident time on the surface. On the other hand, adsorbed species can be populated in shallow sites, activating thermal hopping and thus two-body reactions even at low temperatures, where the thermal hopping from deeper sites is not activated. Such behavior cannot be described by the conventional RE approach. In this work, I present a framework for incorporating various binding sites (i.e., binding energy distribution) in gas-ice astrochemical models as an extension of the conventional RE approach. I propose a simple method to estimate the probability density function for the occupation of various sites by adsorbed species, assuming a quasi-steady state. By using thermal desorption and hopping rates weighted by the probability density functions, the effect of binding energy distribution is incorporated into the RE approach without increasing the number of ordinary differential equations to be solved. This method is found to be accurate and computationally efficient and enables us to consider binding energy distribution even for a large gas-ice chemical network, which contains hundreds of icy species. The impact of the binding energy distribution on interstellar ice composition is discussed quantitatively for the first time.

          FAST detection of OH emission in the carbon-rich planetary nebula NGC 7027

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of the ground-state OH emission line at 1612 MHz toward the prototypical carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband (UWB) receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This emission is likely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized region. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are observed in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO$^+$ absorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC 7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud cannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blue-shifted component with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich environments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our observations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they underscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for nascent PNe.

 In this work, I report that large fraction of stars detected by Ádám et al. (2023, A&A, 674, A170, arXiv:2304.08394) and noted in that work as new discoveries are in fact known systems. This is especially true for the dense bulge fields with large blending of nearby sources. Among the published 245 stars determined to be doubly eclipsing (i.e. containing two eclipsing signals), I identified 53 blends. In other words, about a quarter of the systems noted by Ádám et al. (2023, A&A, 674, A170) are not actually doubly eclipsing; rather, these are contaminations of known nearby sources that have already been detected by OGLE. Such a high proportion of reported false positives should not be readily ignored and ought to be addressed in future studies.

          Modeling and measuring the anisotropic halo 3-point correlation function: a coordinated study

 - **Abstract**
 Ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys like DESI (arXiv:1611.00037, arXiv:1611.00036) and Euclid (arXiv:2405.13491) will cover unprecedented volumes with a number of objects large enough to effectively probe clustering anisotropies through higher-order statistics. In this work, we present an original and efficient implementation of both a model for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3-point correlation function (3PCF) and for their estimator. To assess the adequacy of our model, we have predicted the anisotropic 3PCF for a set of dark matter halos at redshift $z = 1$ and compared our prediction with the 3PCF measurement obtained by applying our estimator to a suite of 298 N-body + 3000 approximate mock halo catalogs at the same redshift. The use of the anisotropic component of the 3PCF effectively breaks the degeneracy between the growth rate $f$ and the linear bias $b_1$, allowing us to obtain unbiased estimates for both parameters from a Euclid-like survey. A joint, full anisotropic, 2 and 3-point correlation analysis would also allow us to measure the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$ along with $f$ and $b_1$ with a precision of approximately 17%, and to effectively constrain all galaxy biasing parameters of the model. However, these results largely exploit information from the isotropic part of the 3PCF signal. The addition of the anisotropic multipoles tightens parameter estimates by just 5% at most. We argue that this modest improvement likely reflects the use of a simplified cosmological model with relatively few free parameters. The 3PCF anisotropic multipoles will prove useful in reducing the impact of projection effects that affect high-dimensional cosmological analyses. To support this conjecture, we provide an example in which an additional source of anisotropy, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, is added to the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Close white dwarf binaries (CWDBs) are considered to be progenitors of several exotic astronomical phenomena (e.g., type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables). These violent events are broadly used in studies of general relativity and cosmology. However, obtaining precise stellar parameter measurements for both components of CWDBs is a challenging task given their low luminosities, swift time variation, and complex orbits. High-resolution spectra (R$> 20 000$) are preferred but expensive, resulting in a sample size that is insufficient for robust population study. To release the full potential of the less expensive low-resolution spectroscopic surveys, and thus greatly expand the CWDB sample size, it is necessary to develop a robust pipeline for spectra decomposition and analysis. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to build spectrum generators for DA/DB white dwarfs and main-sequence stars. The best-fit stellar parameters were obtained by finding the least $\chi^2$ solution to these feature lines and the continuum simultaneously. We demonstrate the reliability of our code with two well-studied CWDBs, WD 1534+503 and PG 1224+309. We also estimate the stellar parameters of 14 newly identified CWDB candidates, most of which are fitted with double component models for the first time. Our estimates agree with previous results for the common stars and follow the statistical distribution in the literature. The application of our code to a large volume of white dwarf binary candidates will offer important statistic samples to stellar evolution studies and future gravitational wave monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the He/H ratio in cool stars presents a fundamental astrophysical challenge. While this ratio is established for hot O and B stars, its extrapolation to cool stars remains uncertain due to the absence of helium lines in their observed spectra. We address this knowledge gap by focusing on the Sun as a representative cool star. We conduct spectroscopic analyses of the observed solar photospheric lines by utilizing a combination of MgH molecular lines and neutral Mg atomic lines including yet another combination of CH and C_2 molecular lines with neutral C atomic lines. Our spectroscopic analyses were further exploited by adopting solar model atmospheres constructed for distinct He/H ratios to determine the solar photospheric helium abundance. The helium abundance is determined by enforcing the fact that for an adopted model atmosphere with an appropriate He/H ratio, the derived Mg abundance from the neutral Mg atomic lines and that from the MgH molecular lines must be the same. Ditto holds for the C abundance derived from neutral C atomic lines and that from CH lines of the CH molecular band and C_2 lines from the C_2 Swan band. The estimated He/H ratio for the Sun is discussed based on the one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (1D LTE) model atmosphere. The helium abundance (He/H = 0.091(+0.019/+0.014)) obtained for the Sun serves as a critical reference point to characterize the He/H ratio of cool stars across the range in their effective temperature. Using this derived He/H ratio, the solar mass fractions are determined to be X_sun=0.7232(+0.0305/-0.0377), Y_sun=0.2633(+0.0384/-0.0311), and Z_sun=0.0135(+0.0006/-0.0007).

 - **Abstract**
 In the double detonation scenario the ignition of a surface He detonation on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf leads to a secondary core detonation. Double detonation models have shown promise for explaining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with a variety of luminosities. A key feature of such models is unburnt He in the ejecta, which can show significant variation in both its mass and velocity distribution. Many previous radiative transfer simulations for double detonation models have neglected treatment of non-thermal ionization and excitation, preventing them from robustly assessing whether He spectral features are expected to form. We present a non local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer simulation, including treatment for non-thermal electrons, for a double detonation model with a modest mass of He (${\sim}$0.04 M${\odot}$) ejected at reasonably low velocities (${\sim}$12000$\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Despite our simulation predicting no clear optical He features, a strong and persistent He I 10830$\,Å$ absorption feature forms that is significantly blended with the spectral contribution of Mg II 10927$\,Å$. For some normal SNe Ia the Mg feature shows an extended blue wing, previously attributed to C I, however the simulated He feature shows its strongest absorption at wavelengths consistent with this wing. We therefore suggest this extended wing is instead a spectral signature of He. The He feature predicted by this particular model is too strong and persistent to be consistent with normal SNe Ia, however, this motivates further work to use this observable signature to test the parameter space for double detonation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a spatial averaging scheme and use it to study the evolution of spatial averages in large-scale simulations of cosmological structure formation performed with the Einstein Toolkit. The averages are performed on the spatial hypersurfaces of the simulation setup which, at least initially, represent the hypersurfaces of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. We find only negligible cosmic backreaction on these hypersurfaces even on very small scales, but find significant curvature fluctuations of up to $10\%$ in $\Omega_R$ for sub-volumes with radius $\sim200$ Mpc and even larger fluctuations in smaller sub-volumes. In addition, we quantify fluid flow in and out of these sub-volumes. We find this to be significant, up to a $5\%$ change in the density between redshift $z=1$ and $z=0$ of a single sphere of radius $\sim200$ Mpc (and larger for smaller spheres). We suggest this may be important for studies basing averages on volumes co-moving with the simulation hypersurfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 The degree of spin-orbit alignment in a population of binary stars can be determined from measurements of their orbital inclinations and rotational broadening of their spectral lines. Alignment in a face-on binary guarantees low rotational broadening, while alignment in an edge-on binary maximizes the rotational broadening. In contrast, if spin-orbit angles ($\psi$) are random, rotational broadening should not depend on orbital inclination. Using this technique, we investigated a sample of 2{,}727 astrometric binaries from Gaia DR3 with F-type primaries and orbital periods between 50 and 1000 days (separations 0.3--2.7~au). We found that $\psi$ is strongly associated with $e$, the orbital eccentricity. When $e<0.15$, the mean spin-orbit angle is $\langle\psi\rangle = 6.9_{-4.1}^{+5.4}$\,degrees, while for $e>0.7$, it rises to $\langle\psi\rangle = 46_{-24}^{+26}$\,degrees. These results suggest that some binaries are affected by processes during their formation or evolution that excite both orbital eccentricity and inclination.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the cosmological and constrained ELUCID simulation, this study explores the statistical characteristics of filaments within the cosmic web, focussing on aspects such as the distribution of filament lengths and their radial density profiles. Using the classification of the cosmic web environment through the Hessian matrix of the density field, our primary focus is on how cosmic structures react to the two variables $R_{\rm s}$ and $\lambda_{\rm th}$. The findings show that the volume fractions of knots, filaments, sheets, and voids are highly influenced by the threshold parameter $\lambda_{\rm th}$, with only a slight influence from the smoothing length $R_{\rm s}$. The central axis of the cylindrical filament is pinpointed using the medial-axis thinning algorithm of the COWS method. It is observed that median filament lengths tend to increase as the smoothing lengths increase. Analysis of filament length functions at different values of $R_{\rm s}$ indicates a reduction in shorter filaments and an increase in longer filaments as $R_{\rm s}$ increases, peaking around $2.5R_{\rm s}$. The study also shows that the radial density profiles of filaments are markedly affected by the parameters $R_{\rm s}$ and $\lambda_{\rm th}$, showing a valley at approximately $2R_{\rm s}$, with increases in the threshold leading to higher amplitudes of the density profile. Moreover, shorter filaments tend to have denser profiles than their longer counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 Preplanetary nebulae (PPNe) are formed from mass-ejecting late-stage AGB stars. Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust particles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have not yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar core. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the groundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density distribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's Footprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient single-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for double-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results indicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer radial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary companion during the formation of the nebula.

          Redshift dependence of FRB host dispersion measures across cosmic epochs

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the redshift dependence of (rest frame) host galaxy dispersion measures of localized FRBs by assuming it to vary as a simple power law ($\propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$). We simultaneously fit $\alpha$ as well as the host dispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that $\alpha\approx 0$ is preferred over higher values of $\alpha$ with either a positive or negative sign. Such constraints have implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Science Fiction is using astronomy to offer to the public blockbusters at the movies (e.g. Interstellar), series or movies in streaming media (Don't Look Up, The Expanse), many books from classic authors (I. Asimov, A.C. Clarke) or more modern ones (K.S. Robinson), comics (the adventures of Valerian and Laureline), or video games (Mass Effect, No Man's sky) that have a very large cumulated audience. Astronomers can use Science Fiction to illustrate physics or astronomical facts. It might be a good way to talk about our work, our methods, by comparing them to examples with which a large audience is familiar. A few examples are provided in this contribution. In a recent study (Stanwey, 2022), it was shown that 93 percent of British professional astronomers have an interest for Science Fiction, and 69 percent consider that Science Fiction influenced their career or life choice. I am presenting a similar study made for French astronomers, performed during and just after the 2024 French astronomer meeting (Journees de la SF2A).

          Effect of phase noise on fringe visibility of LISA telescopes in the presence of tilt and astigmatism aberrations

 - **Abstract**
 An in-depth analysis of GWs, LISA and its telescopes has been carried out in this paper, especially for the case in which all aberrations, except astigmatism and tilt are optimised. Though it is popular to neglect these two aberration types for their minute effect on the wavefront, a test of this negligence has been carried out in an extreme scenario of high phase noise. The relationship between phase noise and fringe visibility has been analysed, resulting in the discovery of an upper bound for allowed phase noise in LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cislunar region is crucial for expanding human presence in space in the forthcoming decades. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent and anticipated Earth-Moon missions, and ongoing space domain awareness initiatives. An introduction to the dynamics as well as periodic trajectories in the Cislunar realm is presented. Then, a review of modern Cislunar programs as well as smaller missions are compiled to provide insights into the key players pushing towards the Moon. Trends of Cislunar missions and practices are identified, including the identification of regions of interest, such as the South Pole and the Near-rectilinear halo orbit. Finally, a review of the current state and short-comings of space domain awareness (SDA) in the region is included, utilizing the regions of interest as focal points for required improvement. The SDA review is completed through the analysis of the Artemis 1 trajectory.

          The characterisation of water ice in debris discs: implications for JWST scattered light observations

 - **Abstract**
 Water ice plays a crucial role throughout the different stages of planetary evolution and is abundant in the Universe. However, its presence and nature in debris discs of exoplanetary systems are not yet strongly established observationally. In this study, we quantify and discuss the impact of ice parameters such as volume fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$, blow-out grain size, size distribution, and its phase on the observational appearance of debris discs, considering the diverse nature of these systems around stellar spectral types ranging from A to M. Our findings reveal that the prominent ice features at approximately 2.7 and 3.3\,$\mu$m depend on both the water ice fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$ and the scattering angle, with backscattering geometries yielding the most prominent signatures. When the phase function is considered and data are not background limited, strong forward and backward scattering (near edge-on discs) are expected to yield the strongest detections in images/spectra for A or F-type stars, while scattering angle matters less for later type stars. The Fresnel peak at 3.1\,$\mu$m serves as a viable discriminant for the transitional phase (crystalline/amorphous), while simultaneously constraining the water ice temperature. For JWST imaging, we find that the F356W and F444W filter combination is most effective for constraining the grain size distribution, while the F356W and F277W filter combination provides better constraints on the ice fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$ in debris discs. However, degeneracy between the grain size distribution and ice fraction when using photometric flux ratios means that obtaining robust constraints will likely require more than two filters, or spectroscopic data.

          A search for soft X-ray emission lines in the afterglow spectrum of GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 221009A was the Brightest gamma-ray burst Of All Time (BOAT), surpassing in prompt brightness all GRBs discovered in ~50 yr and in afterglow brightness in ~20 yr. We observed the BOAT with XMM-Newton 2.3 d after the prompt. The X-ray afterglow was still very bright and we collected the largest number of photons with the Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) on a GRB. We searched the RGS data for narrow emission or absorption features. We did not detect any bright line feature. A candidate narrow feature is identified at a (rest-frame) energy of 1.455+0.006-0.014 keV, consistent with an Mg XII K{\alpha} emission line, slightly redshifted (0.012) with respect to the host galaxy. We assessed a marginal statistical significance of 3.0sigma for this faint feature based on conservative Monte Carlo simulations, which requires caution for any physical interpretation. If this line feature would be for real, we propose that it might originate from the reflection in the innermost regions of the infalling funnel from low-level late-time activity emission of the central engine.

          Chasing cosmic inflation: constraints for inflationary models and reheating insights

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of different choice of prior's range for the reheating epoch on cosmic inflation parameter inference in light of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from the Planck 2018 legacy release in combination with BICEP/Keck Array 2018 data and additional late-time cosmological observations such as uncalibrated Type Ia Supernovae from the Pantheon catalogue, baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions from SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS. Here, we explore in particular the implications for the combination of reheating and inflationary-model parameter space considering $R+R^2$ inflation and a broad class of $\alpha$-attractor and D-brane models. These inflationary models completely cover the $n_s$-$r$ parameter space allowed by Planck and BICEP/Keck data and represent good targets for future CMB and large-scale structure experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison of inflationary models, taking into account the reheating uncertainties.
