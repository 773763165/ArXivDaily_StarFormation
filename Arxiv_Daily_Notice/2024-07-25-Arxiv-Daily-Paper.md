          Evaluating Cosmological Biases using Photometric Redshifts for Type Ia Supernova Cosmology with the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological analyses with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have traditionally been reliant on spectroscopy for both classifying the type of supernova and obtaining reliable redshifts to measure the distance-redshift relation. While obtaining a host-galaxy spectroscopic redshift for most SNe is feasible for small-area transient surveys, it will be too resource intensive for upcoming large-area surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will observe on the order of millions of SNe. Here we use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to address this problem with photometric redshifts (photo-z) inferred directly from the SN light-curve in combination with Gaussian and full p(z) priors from host-galaxy photo-z estimates. Using the DES 5-year photometrically-classified SN sample, we consider several photo-z algorithms as host-galaxy photo-z priors, including the Self-Organizing Map redshifts (SOMPZ), Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ), and Directional-Neighbourhood Fitting (DNF) redshift estimates employed in the DES 3x2 point analyses. With detailed catalog-level simulations of the DES 5-year sample, we find that the simulated w can be recovered within $\pm$0.02 when using SN+SOMPZ or DNF prior photo-z, smaller than the average statistical uncertainty for these samples of 0.03. With data, we obtain biases in w consistent with simulations within ~1$\sigma$ for three of the five photo-z variants. We further evaluate how photo-z systematics interplay with photometric classification and find classification introduces a subdominant systematic component. This work lays the foundation for next-generation fully photometric SNe Ia cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Exo-NINJA will realize nearIR R$\sim$4000 diffraction-limited narrow-field spectro-imaging for characterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disk structures. It uniquely combines mid-R spectroscopy, high throughput, and spatial resolution, in contrast to CHARIS, which does spectro-imaging, and REACH, which is single-point (no spatial resolution). Exo-NINJA's spectro-imaging at the telescope diffraction limit will characterize exoplanet atmospheres, detect and map (spatially and spectrally) gas accretion on protoplanets, and also detect exoplanets at small angular separation ($\lambda$/D) from their host star by spectro-astrometry. Exo-NINJA will link two instruments at the Subaru Telescope using a high-throughput hexagonal multi-mode fiber bundle (hexabundle). The fiber coupling resides between the high contrast imaging system SCExAO, which combines ExAO and coronagraph, and the medium-resolution spectrograph NINJA (R$=$4000 at JHK bands). Exo-NINJA will provide an end-to-end throughput of 20% compared to the 1.5% obtained with REACH. Exo-NINJA is scheduled for implementation on the Subaru Telescope's NasIR platform in 2025; we will present a concise overview of its future installation, laboratory tests such as the throughput and focal ratio degradation (FRD) performance of optical fiber imaging hexabundles, in the NIR and the trade-offs for fiber choices for the NINJA-SCExAO hexabundle fiber cable, and the expected on sky performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) is a novel on-chip charge detection technology that can, in principle, provide significantly greater responsivity and improved noise performance than traditional charge coupled device (CCD) readout circuitry. The SiSeRO, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, uses a p-MOSFET transistor with a depleted back-gate region under the transistor channel; as charge is transferred into the back gate region, the transistor current is modulated. With our first generation SiSeRO devices, we previously achieved a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 4.5 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV, at a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s and for a detector temperature of 250 K. Importantly, since the charge signal remains unaffected by the SiSeRO readout process, we have also been able to implement Repetitive Non-Destructive Readout (RNDR), achieving an improved ENC performance. In this paper, we demonstrate sub-electron noise sensitivity with these devices, utilizing an enhanced test setup optimized for RNDR measurements, with excellent temperature control, improved readout circuitry, and advanced digital filtering techniques. We are currently fabricating new SiSeRO detectors with more sensitive and RNDR-optimized amplifier designs, which will help mature the SiSeRO technology in the future and eventually lead to the pathway to develop active pixel sensor (APS) arrays using sensitive SiSeRO amplifiers on each pixel. Active pixel devices with sub-electron sensitivity and fast readout present an exciting option for next generation, large area astronomical X-ray telescopes requiring fast, low-noise megapixel imagers.

 - **Abstract**
 Future strategic X-ray satellite telescopes, such as the probe-class Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), will require excellent soft energy response in their imaging detectors to enable maximum discovery potential. In order to characterize Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and Single Electron Sensitive Read Output (SiSeRO) detectors in the soft X-ray region, the X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford has developed, assembled, and commissioned a 2.5-meter-long X-ray beamline test system. The beamline is designed to efficiently produce monoenergetic X-ray fluorescence lines in the 0.3-10 keV energy range and achieve detector temperatures as low as 173 K. We present design and simulation details of the beamline, and discuss the vacuum, cooling, and X-ray fluorescence performance achieved. As a workhorse for future detector characterization at Stanford, the XOC beamline will support detector development for a broad range of X-ray astronomy instruments.

          X-ray speed reading with the MCRC: prototype success and next generation upgrades

 - **Abstract**
 The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a NASA probe class mission concept designed to deliver arcsecond resolution with an effective area ten times that of Chandra (at launch). The AXIS focal plane features an MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) detector working in conjunction with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC). While this readout ASIC targets the AXIS mission, it is applicable to a range of potential X-ray missions with comparable readout requirements. Designed by the X-ray astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford University, the MCRC ASIC prototype (MCRC-V1.0) uses a 350 nm technology node and provides 8 channels of high speed, low noise, low power consumption readout electronics. Each channel implements a current source to bias the detector output driver, a preamplifier to provide gain, and an output buffer to interface directly to an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. The MCRC-V1 ASIC exhibits comparable performance to our best discrete electronics implementations, but with ten times less power consumption and a fraction of the footprint area. In a total ionizing dose (TID) test, the chip demonstrated a radiation hardness equal or greater to 25 krad, confirming the suitability of the process technology and layout techniques used in its design. The next iteration of the ASIC (MCRC-V2) will expand the channel count and extend the interfaces to external circuits, advancing its readiness as a readout-on-a-chip solution for next generation X-ray CCD-like detectors. This paper summarizes our most recent characterization efforts, including the TID radiation campaign and results from the first operation of the MCRC ASIC in combination with a representative MIT-LL CCD.

 - **Abstract**
 Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G>14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.

          Continued developments in X-ray speed reading: fast, low noise readout for next-generation wide-field imagers

 - **Abstract**
 Future strategic X-ray astronomy missions will require unprecedentedly sensitive wide-field imagers providing high frame rates, low readout noise and excellent soft energy response. To meet these needs, our team is employing a multi-pronged approach to advance several key areas of technology. Our first focus is on advanced readout electronics, specifically integrated electronics, where we are collaborating on the VERITAS readout chip for the Athena Wide Field Imager, and have developed the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC), which enables fast readout and high frame rates for MIT-LL JFET (junction field effect transistor) CCDs. Second, we are contributing to novel detector development, specifically the SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and their advanced readout, to achieve sub-electron noise performance. Hardware components set the stage for performance, but their efficient utilization relies on software and algorithms for signal and event processing. Our group is developing digital waveform filtering and AI methods to augment detector performance, including enhanced particle background screening and improved event characterization. All of these efforts make use of an efficient, new X-ray beamline facility at Stanford, where components and concepts can be tested and characterized.

 - **Abstract**
 Bringing artificial intelligence (AI) alongside next-generation X-ray imaging detectors, including CCDs and DEPFET sensors, enhances their sensitivity to achieve many of the flagship science cases targeted by future X-ray observatories, based upon low surface brightness and high redshift sources. Machine learning algorithms operating on the raw frame-level data provide enhanced identification of background vs. astrophysical X-ray events, by considering all of the signals in the context within which they appear within each frame. We have developed prototype machine learning algorithms to identify valid X-ray and cosmic-ray induced background events, trained and tested upon a suite of realistic end-to-end simulations that trace the interaction of cosmic ray particles and their secondaries through the spacecraft and detector. These algorithms demonstrate that AI can reduce the unrejected instrumental background by up to 41.5 per cent compared with traditional filtering methods. Alongside AI algorithms to reduce the instrumental background, next-generation event reconstruction methods, based upon fitting physically-motivated Gaussian models of the charge clouds produced by events within the detector, promise increased accuracy and spectral resolution of the lowest energy photon events.

          Tracing the Milky Way spiral arms with 26Al -- The role of nova systems in the 2D distribution of 26Al

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are one of the most important and investigated astrophysical production sites of $^{26}$Al, a short-lived radioisotope with $\sim$ 1 Myr half-life. Its short lifetime prevents us from observing its complete chemical history, and only the $^{26}$Al that was recently produced by massive stars can be observed. Hence, it is considered a tracer of star formation rate (SFR). However, important contributions to $^{26}$Al comes from nova systems that pollute the interstellar medium with a large delay, thus partly erasing the correlation between $^{26}$Al and SFR. In this work we describe the 2D distribution of the mass of $^{26}$Al as well as that of massive stars and nova systems in the Milky Way, to investigate their relative contributions to the production of $^{26}$Al. We use a detailed 2D chemical evolution model where the SFR is azimuthally dependent and is required to reproduce the spiral arm pattern observed in the Milky Way. We test two different models, one where the $^{26}$Al comes from massive stars and novae, and one with massive stars only. We then compare the predictions to the $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{26}$Al mass observed by the surveys COMPTEL and INTEGRAL. The results show that novae do not trace SFR and, in the solar vicinity, they concentrate in its minima. The effect of novae on the map of the $^{26}$Al mass consists in damping the spiral pattern by a factor of five. Regarding the nucleosynthesis, we find that $\sim$75% of the $^{26}$Al is produced by novae and the $\sim$25% by massive stars. We conclude that novae cannot be neglected as $^{26}$Al producers since the observations can only be reproduced by including their contribution. Moreover, we suggest that bulge novae should eject around six times more material than the disc ones to well reproduce the observed mass of $^{26}$Al.

          Towards efficient machine-learning-based reduction of the cosmic-ray induced background in X-ray imaging detectors: increasing context awareness

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional cosmic ray filtering algorithms used in X-ray imaging detectors aboard space telescopes perform event reconstruction based on the properties of activated pixels above a certain energy threshold, within 3x3 or 5x5 pixel sliding windows. This approach can reject up to 98% of the cosmic ray background. However, the remaining unrejected background constitutes a significant impediment to studies of low surface brightness objects, which are especially prevalent in the high-redshift universe. The main limitation of the traditional filtering algorithms is their ignorance of the long-range contextual information present in image frames. This becomes particularly problematic when analyzing signals created by secondary particles produced during interactions of cosmic rays with body of the detector. Such signals may look identical to the energy deposition left by X-ray photons, when one considers only the properties within the small sliding window. Additional information is present, however, in the spatial and energy correlations between signals in different parts of the frame, which can be accessed by modern machine learning (ML) techniques. In this work, we continue the development of an ML-based pipeline for cosmic ray background mitigation. Our latest method consist of two stages: first, a frame classification neural network is used to create class activation maps (CAM), localizing all events within the frame; second, after event reconstruction, a random forest classifier, using features obtained from CAMs, is used to separate X-ray and cosmic ray features. The method delivers >40% relative improvement over traditional filtering in background rejection in standard 0.3-10keV energy range, at the expense of only a small (<2%) level of lost X-ray signal. Our method also provides a convenient way to tune the cosmic ray rejection threshold to adapt to a user's specific scientific needs.

          A Sub-solar Fe/O, logT~7.5 Gas Component Permeating the Milky Way's CGM

 - **Abstract**
 Our study focuses on characterizing the highly ionized gas within the Milky Way's (MW) Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) that gives rise to ionic transitions in the X-ray band 2 - 25 Å. Utilizing stacked \Chandra/\ACISS\ \MEG\ and \LETG\ spectra toward QSO sightlines, we employ the self-consistent hybrid ionization code PHASE to model our data. The stacked spectra are optimally described by three distinct gas phase components: a \warm\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 5.5), \warmhot\ (\logT\ $\sim 6$), and \hot\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 7.5) components. These findings confirm the presence of the \hot\ component in the MW's CGM indicating its coexistence with a \warm\ and a \warmhot\ gas phases. We find this \hot\ component to be homogeneous in temperature but inhomogeneous in column density. The gas in the \hot\ component requires over-abundances relative to solar to be consistent with the Dispersion Measure (DM) from the Galactic halo reported in the literature. {For the hot phase we estimated a DM = $55.1^{+29.9}_{-23.7}$ pc cm$^{-3}$}. We conclude that this phase is either enriched in Oxygen, Silicon, and Sulfur, or has metallicity {over 6} times solar value, or a combination of both. We do not detect Fe L-shell absorption lines, implying O/Fe $\geq$ 4. The non-solar abundance ratios found in the super-virial gas component in the Galactic halo suggest that this phase arises from Galactic feedback.

          Towards understanding interactions between the AO system and segment co-phasing with the vector-Zernike wavefront sensor on Keck

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our previous demonstration of the first on-sky primary mirror segment closed-loop control on Keck using a vector-Zernike wavefront sensor (vZWFS), which improved the Strehl ratio on the NIRC2 science camera by up to 10 percentage points. Segment co-phasing errors contribute to Keck contrast limits and will be necessary to correct for the segmented Extremely Large Telescopes and future space missions. The goal of the post-AO vZWFS on Keck is to monitor and correct segment co-phasing errors in parallel with science observations. The ZWFS is ideal for measuring phase discontinuities and is one of the most sensitive WFSs, but has limited dynamic range. The Keck vZWFS consists of a metasurface mask imposing two different phase shifts to orthogonal polarizations, split into two pupil images, extending its dynamic range. We report on the vZWFS closed-loop co-phasing performance and early work towards understanding the interactions between the AO system and segment phasing. We discuss a comparison of the AO performance when co-phasing by aligning segment edges, as is currently done at Keck, compared with aligning to the average phase over the segments, as is done by the vZWFS.

          Using a new spectral disentangling approach to ascertain whether the massive binary HDE 228766 contains a Wolf-Rayet star

 - **Abstract**
 The massive binary HDE 228766 is composed of an O type primary and an evolved secondary. However, previous qualitative analyses of the composite spectrum have led to a wide discussion about whether the secondary is an Of or a Wolf-Rayet star. We use new observations and our novel QER20 package to disentangle for the first time the spectra of the two stellar components and obtain artefact free reconstructed spectra, yielding the more accurate and reliable spectral classifications of O7.5 V((f))z for the primary and O6 Iaf for the secondary. The emission features of the P-Cygni profiles of the H\b{eta} and He I 5876 Å lines, present in the reconstructed spectrum of the secondary, show that this star is at an initial phase of its transition to the WN evolutionary stage. A previously unobserved variable emission, composed of at least four independent features, is seen since 2014 superposed to the H{\gamma} absorption line. Our analysis reveals that these emission features originate from a physically extended region. This could be explained by an episode of enhanced mass-loss in the scenario of a non conservative evolution of the binary.

          The rich galactic environment of a H$_2$-absorption selected quasar

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first VLT/MUSE observations of a quasar featuring a proximate molecular absorption system, SDSS J125917.31+030922.5. The proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption acts as a natural coronagraph, removing the quasar emission over $\sim$40~Å in wavelength, and allows us to detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission without the necessity of subtracting the quasar emission. This natural coronagraph permits the investigation of the quasar environment down to its inner regions ($r < 20$ kpc), where galaxy interactions or feedback processes should have the most noticeable effects. Our observations reveal a dense environment, with a highly asymmetric Ly$\alpha$ emission within $2"$ ($\sim 15$ kpc), possibly shaped by a companion galaxy, and a southern extension of the nebulae at about 50~kpc, with rotation-like kinematic signature. The width of the Ly$\alpha$ emission is broadest closer to the quasar, indicating perturbed kinematics as expected if interactions and significant gas flows are present. The foreground absorbing system itself is redshifted by $\approx $400 km/s relative to the background quasar, and therefore is likely arising from gas moving towards the quasar. Finally two additional Ly$\alpha$ emitters are detected with $>10\,\sigma$ significance at 96 and 223 kpc from the quasar, making this field overdense relative to other similar observations of quasars at $z\sim 3$. Our results support the hypothesis that quasars with proximate neutral/molecular absorption trace rich environments where galaxy interactions are at play and motivates further studies of H$_2$-selected quasars to shed light on feeding and feedback processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first application of data-driven techniques for dynamical system analysis based on Koopman theory to variable stars. We focus on light curves of RRLyrae type variables, in the Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. Light curves are thus summarized by a handful of complex eigenvalues, corresponding to oscillatory or fading dynamical modes. We find that variable stars of the RRc subclass can be summarized in terms of fewer ($\approx 8$) eigenvalues, while RRab need comparatively more ($\approx 12$). This result can be leveraged for classification and reflects the simpler structure of RRc light curves. We then consider variable stars displaying secular variations due to the Tseraskaya-Blazhko effect and find a change in relevant eigenvalues with time, with possible implications for the physical interpretation of the effect.

 We are on the verge of a revolutionary era in space exploration, thanks to advancements in telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres have been collected over the past few decades, requiring the development of accurate and reliable pipelines and tools for their analysis. Accurately and swiftly determining the spectroscopic parameters from the observational spectra of these objects is crucial for understanding their atmospheric composition and guiding future follow-up observations. \texttt{TelescopeML} is a Python package developed to perform three main tasks: 1. Process the synthetic astronomical datasets for training a CNN model and prepare the observational dataset for later use for prediction; 2. Train a CNN model by implementing the optimal hyperparameters; and 3. Deploy the trained CNN models on the actual observational data to derive the output spectroscopic parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The upper atmosphere at the altitude of 60-110 km, the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has the least observational data of all atmospheres due to the difficulties of in-situ observations. Previous studies demonstrated that atmospheric occultation of cosmic X-ray sources is an effective technique to investigate the MLT. Aiming to measure the atmospheric density of the MLT continuously, we are developing an X-ray camera, "Soipix for observing Upper atmosphere as Iss experiment Mission (SUIM)", dedicated to atmospheric observations. SUIM will be installed on the exposed area of the International Space Station (ISS) and face the ram direction of the ISS to point toward the Earth rim. Observing the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) transmitted through the atmosphere, we will measure the absorption column density via spectroscopy and thus obtain the density of the upper atmosphere. The X-ray camera is composed of a slit collimator and two X-ray SOI-CMOS pixel sensors (SOIPIX), and will stand on its own and make observations, controlled by a CPU-embedded FPGA "Zynq". We plan to install the SUIM payload on the ISS in 2025 during the solar maximum. In this paper, we report the overview and the development status of this project.

 - **Abstract**
 The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both the Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production mechanisms, enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low energy calorimeter, and a high energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector with the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance including the effective area, angular resolution and energy resolution, as well as explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the VLAST's current design is physically feasible, with an acceptance larger than 10~$\rm m^2\ sr$ which is four times larger than Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2\% at 10~GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2 degrees at 10~GeV. The VLAST project is expected to make significant contribution to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and to enhance our understanding of the cosmos.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary interactions have been proposed to explain a variety of circumstellar structures seen around evolved stars, including asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and planetary nebulae. Studies resolving the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars have revealed spirals, discs and bipolar outflows, with shaping attributed to interactions with a companion. For the first time, we have used a combined chemical and dynamical analysis to reveal a highly eccentric and long-period orbit for W Aquilae, a binary system containing an AGB star and a main sequence companion. Our results are based on anisotropic SiN emission, the first detections of NS and SiC towards an S-type star, and density structures observed in the CO emission. These features are all interpreted as having formed during periastron interactions. Our astrochemistry-based method can yield stringent constraints on the orbital parameters of long-period binaries containing AGB stars, and will be applicable to other systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Streaming Instability (SI) in dust has long been thought to be a promising process in triggering planetesimal formation in the protoplanetary disks (PPDs). In this study, we present the first numerical investigation that models the SI in the vertically stratified disk together with the dust coagulation process. Our simulations reveal that, even with the initial small dust sizes, because dust coagulation promotes dust size growth, SI can eventually still be triggered. As such, the dust coagulation process broadens the parameter boundaries obtained from the previous SI studies using single dust species. We describe the various stages of dust dynamics along with their size evolution, and explore the impact of different dust fragmentation velocities. Implications of these results for realistic PPDs are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the main sites of high-mass star formation, is an essential process to unravel the galaxy evolution. Using a GMC catalogue of M33 from ALMA-ACA survey, we classified 848 GMCs into three types based on the association with HII regions and their H$\alpha$ luminosities $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$): Type I is associated with no HII regions; Type II with HII regions of $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$) $<$ 10$^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$; and Type III with HII regions of $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$) $\geqq$ 10$^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These criteria yield 224 Type I GMCs, 473 Type II GMCs, and 151 Type III GMCs. GMCs show changes in their physical properties according to the types; mass, radius, velocity dispersion, and $^{13}$CO detection rate of GMCs systematically increase from Type I to Type III, and additionally, Type III GMCs are closest to virial equilibrium. Type III GMCs show the highest spatial correlation with clusters younger than 10 Myr, Type II GMCs moderate correlation, and Type I GMCs are almost uncorrelated. We interpret that these types indicate an evolutionary sequence from Type I to Type II, and then to Type III with timescales of 4 Myr, 13 Myr, and 5 Myr, respectively, indicating the GMC lifetime of 22 Myr by assuming that Type II GMC has the same timescale as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The evolved GMCs concentrate on the spiral arms, while the younger GMCs are apart from the arm both to the leading and trailing sides. This indicated that GMCs collide with each other by the spiral potential, leading to the compression of GMCs and the triggering of high-mass star formation, which may support the dynamic spiral model. Overall, we suggest that the GMC evolution concept helps illuminate the galaxy evolution, including the spiral arm formation.

 - **Abstract**
 GroundBIRD is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment for observing the polarization pattern imprinted on large angular scales ($\ell > 6$ ) from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain. Our primary scientific objective is a precise measurement of the optical depth $\tau$ ($\sigma(\tau) \sim 0.01$) to the reionization epoch of the Universe to cross-check systematic effects in the measurements made by previous experiments. GroundBIRD observes a wide sky area in the Northern Hemisphere ($\sim 40\%$ of the full sky) while continuously rotating the telescope at a high speed of up to 20 rotations per minute (rpm) to overcome the fluctuations of atmospheric radiation. We have adopted the NbTiN/Al hybrid microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) as focal plane detectors. We observe two frequency bands centered at 145 GHz and 220 GHz. The 145 GHz band picks up the peak frequency of the CMB spectrum. The 220 GHz band helps accurate removal of the contamination of thermal emission from the Galactic interstellar dust. The MKID arrays (138 MKIDs for 145GHz and 23 MKIDs for 220GHz) were designed and optimized so as to minimize the contamination of the two-level-system noise and maximize the sensitivity. The MKID arrays were successfully installed in May 2023 after the performance verification tests were performed at a laboratory. GroundBIRD has been upgraded to use the full MKID arrays, and scientific observations are now underway. The telescope is automated, so that all observations are performed remotely. Initial validations, including polarization response tests and observations of Jupiter and the moon, have been completed successfully. We are now running scientific observations.

 Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass primordial black holes could be detected in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data. Here, we apply a method originally designed to look for rapidly spinning-down neutron stars, the generalized frequency-Hough transform, to search for planetary-mass primordial black holes using data from the first half of the third observing run of advanced LIGO. In this companion paper to arXiv:2402.19468, in which the main results of our search are presented, we delve into the details of the search methodology, the choices we have made regarding the parameter space to explore, the follow-up procedure we use to confirm or reject possible candidates returned in our search, and a comparison of our analytic procedure of generating upper limits to those obtained through injections.

 An MK-like spectral classification has been conducted for 1224 hot subdwarf stars with LAMOST DR9 low-resolution spectra. The whole sample was divided into four categories according to the spectral line characteristics: He-normal, He-weak, He-strong C and He-strong. Each selected spectrum was assigned a spectral class, a luminosity class and an helium class by comparing the line depth and width with standard spectra selected in LAMOST. Relationships between atmospheric parameters and spectral classification were also presented.

          Discovery of a Damped Ly$\alpha$ Absorber in the Circumnuclear Zone of the FeLoBAL Quasar SDSS J083942.11+380526.3

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 ($z=2.315$) is a FeLoBAL quasar that exhibits visible Balmer absorption lines (H$\alpha$), implying a significant $n=2$ population. The quasar also shows an array of absorption lines, including \oi, \niii, \feii, \mgii, \aliii\, to \civ\ and \nv. The high-ionization absorption lines such as \civ\ and \siiv\ are revealed by slightly blueshifted BAL troughs. The resonance doublets such as \mgii\ and \aliii\ are saturated but did not reached zero intensity which indicates that the BLR is partially covered. Overall, however, the absorption is predominantly from low-ionization \feii\ lines, emitted from ground and excited states up to at least 3.814 eV. This implies that the absorbing gas spans the hydrogen ionization front and extends into the partially ionized zone where neutral hydrogen is certainly present. Notably, the hydrogen line spectrum of the quasar shows no signature of expected Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Instead, the line spectrum shows an unusual Ly$\alpha$ emission characterized by a fully filled emission line spectrum which is a composite of a strong narrow core superposed on a weak broad base. Taking into account the effect of partial covering to BLR, we have extracted a strong DLA trough in Ly$\alpha$ emission region. To fit the spectrum, we performed photoionized model calculations and compared them to the observations. We found that photoionization modeling using CLOUDY can successfully reproduce the main characteristics of the quasar spectrum, and the predicted neutral hydrogen column density arising from the clouds responsible for the low-ionization absorption provides a good match to the extracted DLA trough. This indicates that both the DLA and the low-ionization absorption arise from the same medium that is roughly collocated with the dusty torus.

 The Observatory Science Operations (OSO) subsystem of the SKAO consists of a range of complex tools which will be used to propose, design, schedule and execute observations. Bridging the gap between the science and telescope domains is the key responsibility of OSO, requiring considerations of usability, performance, availability and accessibility, amongst others. This paper describes the state of the observatory software as we approach construction milestones, how the applications meet these requirements using a modern technology architecture, and challenges so far.

 - **Abstract**
 The SKA Observatory, currently in the construction phase, will have two of the world's largest radio telescopes when completed in 2028. The scale of the project introduces unique challenges for the telescope software design and implementation at all levels, from user interfacing software down to the lower-level control of individual telescope elements. The Observation Execution Tool (OET) is part of the Observation Science Operations (OSO) suite of applications and is responsible for orchestrating the highest level of telescope control through the execution of telescope control scripts. One of the main challenges for the OET is creating a design that can robustly run concurrent observations on multiple subarrays while remaining responsive to the user. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) development process followed by the SKA project also means the software should be allow to iterative implementation and easily accommodate new and changing requirements. This paper concentrates on the design decisions and challenges in the development of the OET, how we have solved some of the specific technical problems and details on how we remain flexible for future requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 The $f(R)$ modified gravity theory can explain the accelerating expansion of the late Universe without introducing dark energy. In this study, we predict the constraint strength on the $f(R)$ theory using the mock data generated from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) survey and wide-field slitless spectroscopic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) survey. We explore three popular $f(R)$ models, and introduce a parameter $b$ to characterize the deviation of the f(R) theory from the $\Lambda$CDM theory. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the parameters in the $f(R)$ models, and the nuisance parameters and systematical uncertainties are also considered in the model fitting process. Besides, we also perform model comparisons between the $f(R)$ models and the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the constraint accuracy using the CSST SN Ia+BAO dataset alone is comparable to or even better than the result given by the combination of the current relevant observations, and the CSST SN Ia+BAO survey can distinguish the $f(R)$ models from the $\Lambda$CDM model. This indicates that the CSST SN Ia and BAO surveys can effectively constrain and test the $f(R)$ theory.

 The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) is a project dedicated to identifying optical counter-parts to gravitational-wave detections using a network of dedicated, wide-field telescopes. After almost a decade of design, construction, and commissioning work, the GOTO network is now fully operational with two antipodal sites: La Palma in the Canary Islands and Siding Spring in Australia. Both sites host two independent robotic mounts, each with a field-of-view of 44 square degrees formed by an array of eight 40 cm telescopes, resulting in an instantaneous 88 square degree field-of-view per site. All four telescopes operate as a single integrated network, with the ultimate aim of surveying the entire sky every 2-3 days and allowing near-24-hour response to transient events within a minute of their detection. In the modern era of transient astronomy, automated telescopes like GOTO form a vital link between multi-messenger discovery facilities and in-depth follow-up by larger telescopes. GOTO is already producing a wide range of scientific results, assisted by an efficient discovery pipeline and a successful citizen science project: Kilonova Seekers.

 - **Abstract**
 To leverage the angular resolution of interferometry at high contrast, one must employ specialized beam-combiners called interferometric nullers. Nullers discard part of the astrophysical information to optimize the recording of light present in the dark fringe of the central source. Asgard/NOTT will deploy a beam-combination scheme offering good instrumental noise rejection when phased appropriately, but for which information is degenerate on the outputs, prompting a dedicated tuning strategy using the science detector. The dispersive effect of water vapor can be corrected with prisms forming a variable thickness of glass. But observations in the L band suffer from an additional and important chromatic effect due to longitudinal atmospheric dispersion coming from a resonance of CO2 at 4.3 micron. To compensate for this effect efficiently, a novel type of compensation device will be deployed leveraging a gas cell of variable length at ambient pressure. After reviewing the impact of water vapor and CO2, we present the design of this atmospheric dispersion compensation device and describe a strategy to maintain this tuning on-sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are neutron stars that rotate rapidly. Most pulsars in binary systems tend to spin faster than those in isolation. According to binary evolution theory, radio pulsars in binary systems can have various types of companion stars. However, currently, binary radio pulsars with companions of giant stars, helium stars, and black holes are still missing. We aim to investigate the possible parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code to consider the effect of irradiation in binary evolution and evolved a series of binary models. In this paper, we present the potential physical properties of binary radio pulsars with giant star companions under the framework of the classical recycling scenario and the irradiation model. We found that the parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions can be greatly expanded by the effect of irradiation. Moreover, if irradiation is strong enough, the sub-millisecond pulsars might be accompanied by giant companion stars. We also demonstrate a correlation between the timescale of the binary system being in the state of low mass X-ray binary and the irradiation efficiency. Birth rate problem between the millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries might not resolved by irradiation effect and a more detailed Binary Population Synthesis is necessary. Our findings may also offer guidance for observers to locate binary radio pulsars with giant companions or sub-millisecond pulsars.

 SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) is the new ESO instrument that is going to be installed on the 3.58-m New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory. SOXS is a single object spectrograph offering a wide simultaneous spectral coverage from U- to H-band. Although such an instrument may have potentially a large variety of applications, the consortium designed it with a clear science case: it is going to provide the spectroscopic counterparts to the ongoing and upcoming imaging surveys, becoming one of the main follow-up instruments in the Southern hemisphere for the classification and characterization of transients. The NTT+SOXS system is specialized to observe all transients and variable sources discovered by imaging surveys with a flexible schedule maintained by the consortium, based on a remote scheduler which will interface with the observatory software infrastructure. SOXS is realized timely to be highly synergic with transients discovery machines like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The instrument has been integrated and tested in Italy, collecting and assembling subsystems coming from all partners spread over six countries in three continents. The first preparatory activities in Chile have been completed at the telescope. This article gives an updated status of the project before the shipping of the instrument to Chile.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the second observing program of the active galactic nucleus NGC 4151 with simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE; {\sim}750 ks), NuSTAR ({\sim}60 ks), XMM-Newton ({\sim}75 ks), and NICER ({\sim}65 ks) pointings. NGC 4151 is the first Type 1 radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy with constrained polarization properties for the X-ray corona. Despite the lower flux state in which the source is re-observed and the resulting higher contribution of the constant reflection component in the IXPE energy band, our results are in agreement with the first detection. From the polarimetric analysis, a polarization degree {\Pi} = 4.7 {\pm} 1.3 per cent and angle {\Psi} = 77° {\pm} 8° east of north (68 per cent confidence level) are derived in the 2.0 - 8.0 keV energy range. Combining the two observations leads to polarization properties that are more constrained than those of the individual detections, showing {\Pi} = 4.5 {\pm} 0.9 per cent and {\Psi} = 81° {\pm} 6° (with detection significance {\sim}4.6{\sigma}). The observed polarization angle aligns very well with the radio emission in this source, supporting, together with the significant polarization degree, a slab or wedge geometry for the X-ray corona. However, a switch in the polarization angle at low energies (37° {\pm} 7° in the 2 - 3.5 keV bin) suggests the presence of another component. When it is included in the spectro-polarimetric fit, a high polarization degree disfavors an interpretation in terms of a leakage through the absorbers, rather pointing to scattering from some kind of mirror.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the opto-mechanical integration and alignment, functional and optical performance verification of the NIR arm of Son Of X-Shooter (SOXS) instrument. SOXS will be a single object spectroscopic facility for the ESO-NTT 3.6-m telescope, made by two arms high efficiency spectrographs, able to cover the spectral range 350 2050 nm with a mean resolving power R~4500. In particular the NIR arm is a cryogenic echelle cross-dispersed spectrograph spanning the 780-2050 nm range. We describe the integration and alignment method performed to assemble the different opto-mechanical elements and their installation on the NIR vacuum vessel, which mostly relies on mechanical characterization. The tests done to assess the image quality, linear dispersion and orders trace in laboratory conditions are summarized. The full optical performance verification, namely echellogram format, image quality and resulting spectral resolving power in the whole NIR arm (optical path and science detector) is detailed. Such verification is one of the most relevant prerequisites for the subsequent full instrument assembly and provisional acceptance in Europe milestone, foreseen in 2024.

 - **Abstract**
 The SOXS spectrograph, designed for the ESO NTT telescope, operates in both the optical (UV-VIS: 350-850 nm) and NIR (800-2000 nm) bands. This article provides an overview of the final tests conducted on the UV-VIS camera system using a telescope simulator. It details the system's performance evaluation, including key metrics such as gain, readout noise, and linearity, and highlights the advancements made in the upgraded acquisition system. The testing process, conducted in the Padua laboratory, involved comprehensive simulations of the telescope environment to ensure the results closely resemble those expected at the ESO-NTT telescope. The successful completion of these tests confirms the system's readiness for deployment to Chile, where it will be installed on the NTT telescope, marking a significant milestone in the SOXS project.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the binary Class 0 protostellar system BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2 as part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA Large Program. We describe the $^{12}$CO ($J$=2--1), $^{13}$CO ($J$=2--1), C$^{18}$O ($J$=2--1), H$_2$CO ($J=3_{2,1}$--$2_{2,0}$), and SiO ($J$=5--4) molecular lines along with the 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.08" or $\sim$5 au). Dust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central compact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are smooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings or gaps. However, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed disk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically thick disk-like component. Using a position-velocity diagram analysis of the C$^{18}$O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source. If Keplerian rotationally-supported disks are present, they are likely deeply embedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central protostellar mass of 0.46 M$_\odot$ and 0.26 M$_\odot$ for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR 71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by $^{12}$CO and SiO are detected in both sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle outflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure, reflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is very collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion events.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the acceleration of particles in astrophysical sources by the Fermi mechanism is revisited under the assumption of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We calculate the energy spectrum and the acceleration time of particles leaving the source as a function of the energy beyond which the Lorentz invariance violation becomes relevant. Lorentz invariance violation causes significant changes in the acceleration of particles by the first and second-order Fermi mechanisms. The energy spectrum of particles accelerated by first-order Fermi mechanism under LIV assumption shows a strong suppression for energies above the break. The calculations presented here complete the scenario for LIV searches with astroparticles by showing, for the first time, how the benchmark acceleration mechanisms (Fermi) are modified under LIV assumption.

 A novel approach to the class of cosmic barotropic fluids in which the speed of sound squared is defined as a function of the Equation of State parameter, so called $c_s^2(w)$ models, is examined. For this class of models, a new analytical reconstruction method is introduced for finding their equivalent purely kinetic k-essence formulation. The method is explicitly demonstrated for several $c_s^2(w)$ models. The application of the obtained explicit or closed form solutions in understanding dark sector unification models is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the advancements in the development of the scheduler for the Son Of X-shooter instrument at the ESO-NTT 3.58-m telescope in La Silla, Chile. SOXS is designed as a single-object spectroscopic facility and features a high-efficiency spectrograph with two arms covering the spectral range of 350-2000 nm and a mean resolving power of approximately R=4500. It will conduct UV-visible and near-infrared follow-up observations of astrophysical transients, drawing from a broad pool of targets accessible through the streaming services of wide-field telescopes, both current and future, as well as high-energy satellites. The instrument will cater to various scientific objectives within the astrophysical community, each entailing specific requirements for observation planning. SOXS will operate at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, without the presence of astronomers on the mountain. This poses a unique challenge for the scheduling process, demanding a fully automated algorithm that is autonomously interacting with the appropriate databases and the La Silla Weather API, and is capable of presenting the operator not only with an ordered list of optimal targets (in terms of observing constraints) but also with optimal backups in the event of changing weather conditions. This imposes the necessity for a scheduler with rapid-response capabilities without compromising the optimization process, ensuring the high quality of observations and best use of the time at the telescope. We thus developed a new highly available and scalable architecture, implementing API Restful applications like Docker Containers, API Gateway, and Python-based Flask frameworks. We provide an overview of the current state of the scheduler, which is now ready for the approaching on-site testing during Commissioning phase, along with insights into its web interface and preliminary performance tests.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a scalable approach for inferring the dark energy equation-of-state parameter ($w$) from a population of strong gravitational lens images using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Strong gravitational lensing offers crucial insights into cosmology, but traditional Monte Carlo methods for cosmological inference are computationally prohibitive and inadequate for processing the thousands of lenses anticipated from future cosmic surveys. New tools for inference, such as SBI using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), address this challenge effectively. By training a machine learning model on simulated data of strong lenses, we can learn the likelihood-to-evidence ratio for robust inference. Our scalable approach enables more constrained population-level inference of $w$ compared to individual lens analysis, constraining $w$ to within $1\sigma$. Our model can be used to provide cosmological constraints from forthcoming strong lens surveys, such as the 4MOST Strong Lensing Spectroscopic Legacy Survey (4SLSLS), which is expected to observe 10,000 strong lenses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the study of two solar eruptive events observed on December 7 2020 and October 28 2021.Both events were associated with full halo CMEs and flares.These events were chosen because they show a strong non-radial direction of propagation in the low corona and their main propagation direction is not fully aligned with the Sun-Earth line.This characteristic makes them suitable for our study, which aims to inspect how the non-radial direction of propagation in the low corona affects the time of CMEs' arrival at Earth.We reconstructed the CMEs using coronagraph observations and modelled them with EUHFORIA and the cone model for this http URL compare the accuracy of forecasting the CME arrival time at Earth obtained from different methods, we also used so-called typeII bursts, radio signatures of associated shocks, to find the velocities of the CME-driven shocks and forecast the time of their arrival at Earth.We also estimated the CME arrival time using the 2D CME velocity.Our results show that the lowest accuracy of estimated CME Earth arrival times is found when the 2D CME velocity is used.The velocity of the typeII radio bursts provides better, but still not very accurate, results.Employing, as an input to EUHFORIA, the CME parameters obtained from the GCS fittings at consequently increasing heights, results in a strongly improved accuracy of the modelled CME and shock arrival time Delta t changes from 14h to 10min for the first event, and from 12h to 30min for the second one.This improvement shows that when we increased the heights of the GCS reconstruction we accounted for the change in the propagation direction of the studied CMEs, which allowed us to accurately model the CME flank encounter at Earth. Our results show the great importance of the change in the direction of propagation of the CME in the low corona when modelling CMEs and estimating the time of their arrival at Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] AGB stars are significant contributors to the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium. In this paper, we adapted models from advanced RHD simulations as input for radiative transfer software to create synthetic observables. A major goal is to describe an AGB star's non-sphericity and to simulate its effects on the surrounding dusty envelope. We developed tools to translate models of an AGB star and its dust-driven wind from simulations with CO5BOLD into the format used by RADMC-3D. We preserved the asymmetric shape of the star by including it as a `dust species' and by using temperature data computed in CO5BOLD. Circumstellar dust is included using Mg2SiO4 opacity data with spatially dependent grain sizes. We compared images and SEDs created with RADMC-3D of a model with similar output made with a spherically symmetric star. Our CO5BOLD model features substantial and clumpy dust formation just above 3.4 au from the grid centre, and large-scale structures due to giant convection cells are visible on the stellar surface. With the properties of VLTI as a basis, we have created simple synthetic observables. Such optical interferometers should be able to detect these dust clouds. We find that it is important to include asymmetric stellar models since they even affect the SEDs. Effects on flux levels can be linked to the clumpiness of the circumstellar dust and the angle-dependent illumination resulting from temperature variations on the stellar surface causes shifts in the wavelengths of the flux maximum. The methods presented here are an important step towards producing realistic synthetic observables and testing predictions of advanced 3D RHD models. Taking the angle-dependence of SEDs as a proxy for temporal variations in unresolved data, we conclude that not all variability observed in AGB stars should be interpreted as global changes in the sense of spherical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the effects of cosmic ray interactions with the Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) based focal plane array for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). TIM is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to probe the peak of the star formation in the Universe. It employs two spectroscopic bands, each equipped with a focal plane of four $\sim\,$900-pixel, KID-based array chips. Measurements of an 864-pixel TIM array shows 791 resonators in a 0.5$\,$GHz bandwidth. We discuss challenges with resonator calibration caused by this high multiplexing density. We robustly identify the physical positions of 788 (99.6$\,$%) detectors using a custom LED-based identification scheme. Using this information we show that cosmic ray events occur at a rate of 2.1$\,\mathrm{events/min/cm^2}$ in our array. 66$\,$% of the events affect a single pixel, and another 33$\,$% affect $<\,$5 KIDs per event spread over a 0.66$\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ region (2 pixel pitches in radius). We observe a total cosmic ray dead fraction of 0.0011$\,$%, and predict that the maximum possible in-flight dead fraction is $\sim\,$0.165$\,$%, which demonstrates our design will be robust against these high-energy events.

 SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) will be the new medium-resolution (R 4500 for 1 slit), high-efficiency, wide-band spectrograph for the ESO NTT at La Silla Observatory, Chile. It will be dedicated to the follow-up of any kind of transient events, ensuring fast time, high efficiency, and availability. It consists of a central structure (common path) that supports two spectrographs optimized for the UV-Visible and a Near-Infrared range. Attached to the common path is the Acquisition and Guiding Camera system (AC), equipped with a filter wheel that can provide science-grade imaging and moderate high-speed photometry. The AC Unit was integrated and aligned during the summer months of 2022 and has since been mounted in the NTTs telescope simulator. This work gives an update on the Acquisition Camera Unit status, describes the Image Quality Tests that were performed, and discusses the AC Optical Performance.

 Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for the studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict the ICs with the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, ${\rm log}\,g$, and $\rm [M/H]$. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and 2MASS bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 GSP-phot module and were validated by comparing with APOGEE and LAMOST. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for $\rm [M/H]$, do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})_0$, 0.050 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$, and 0.040 mag for $(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$. The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from Andrae et al. (2023) to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of $E(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})$ between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of $E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})/E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})$, a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and the accuracy of the machine-learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectro-photometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via \url{this https URL}. The models for more bands will be completed in the following works.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts, including the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. Most of the key science goals require the joint analysis of datasets from multiple surveys to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such analyses, a large set of mock simulations that realistically model correlated observables is required. In this paper we present the N-body component of the HalfDome cosmological simulations, designed for the joint analysis of Stage-IV cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD. Our 300TB initial data release includes full-sky lightcones and halo catalogs between $z$=0--4 for 11 fixed cosmology realizations, as well as an additional run with local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$=20). The simulations evolve $6144^3$ particles in a 3.75$\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ box, reaching a minimum halo mass of $\sim 6 \times 10^{12}\,h^{-1} M_\odot$ and maximum scale of $k \sim 1\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.
