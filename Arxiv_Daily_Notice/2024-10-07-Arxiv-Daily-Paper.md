#### Title:
          Off-center ignition of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs does not resolve the tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation of type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The resulting explosion resembles a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD), which is known to be in tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ (the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). SCD predicts an anti-correlation between $t_0$ and $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$, with $t_0\mathord{\approx}30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_{\rm{Ni}56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of 35-45 days. In this study, we apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate in 2D the impact of off-center ignition in sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD, aiming to better emulate the behavior expected in the DDM scenario. Our calculations of the $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, which do not require radiation transfer calculations, achieve convergence to within a few percent with a numerical resolution of $\mathord{\sim}1\,\rm{km}$. We find that the results only slightly depend on the ignition location, mirroring the SCD model, and consequently, the discrepancy with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation remains unresolved.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectroscopic and photometric classification of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has enabled comparisons between contemporary observations and formation theories regarding the initial spatial configurations of the MPs. However, the kinematics of these MPs is an aspect that requires more attention. We investigated the 3D kinematics of 30 Galactic GCs, extending to 3-5 half-light radii, as well as their MPs, in order to uncover clues of the initial conditions of GCs and the MPs within. We have combined Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia DR3 proper motions together with a comprehensive set of line-of-sight velocities to determine the 3D rotation amplitudes, rotation axes, and anisotropy profiles of the clusters. We include radial velocities from new IFU observations of NGC 5024 and an analysis of archival MUSE data of NGC 6101. We compare our kinematic results with structural and orbital parameters of each cluster, reporting the most significant correlations and common features. We find significant rotation in 21 GCs, with no significant differences between the total rotational amplitudes of the MPs, except for NGC 104. We find no significant differences in the position angles or inclination angles. We find that the 3D rotational amplitude is strongly correlated with mass, relaxation time, enriched star fraction and concentration. We determine the anisotropy profiles of each cluster and the MPs where possible. We investigate correlations with the structural parameters, orbital parameters and accretion history of the clusters, finding that the dynamically young clusters with the highest central concentrations of primordial stars show radial anisotropy in their outer regions ($>2$ half-light radii). The dynamically young clusters with a central concentration of enriched stars show significant tangential anisotropy or isotropy in their outer regions.

          On the origin of transition disk cavities: Pebble-accreting protoplanets vs Super-Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars are the birth places of planets. Among them, transition disks with inner dust cavities of tens of au are sometimes suggested to host massive companions. Yet, such companions are often not detected. Some transition disks exhibit a large amount of gas inside the dust cavity and relatively high stellar accretion rates, which contradicts typical models of gas-giant-hosting systems. Therefore, we investigate whether a sequence of low-mass planets can produce cavities in the dust disk. We evolve the disks with low-mass accreting embryos in combination with 1D dust transport and 3D pebble accretion, to investigate the reduction of the pebble flux at the embryos' orbits. We vary the planet and disk properties. We find that multiple pebble-accreting planets can efficiently decrease the dust surface density, resulting in dust cavities consistent with transition disks. The number of low-mass planets necessary to sweep up all pebbles decreases with decreasing turbulent strength and is preferred when the dust Stokes number is $10^{-2}-10^{-4}$. Compared to dust rings caused by pressure bumps, those by efficient pebble accretion exhibit more extended outer edges. We also highlight the observational reflections: the transition disks with rings featuring extended outer edges tend to have a large gas content in the dust cavities and rather high stellar accretion rates. We propose that planet-hosting transition disks consist of two groups. In Group A disks, planets have evolved into gas giants, opening deep gaps in the gas disk. Pebbles concentrate in pressure maxima, forming dust rings. In Group B, multiple Neptunes (unable to open deep gas gaps) accrete incoming pebbles, causing the appearance of inner dust cavities. The morphological discrepancy of these rings may aid in distinguishing between the two groups using high-resolution ALMA observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of global, resonant oscillation modes in red giant stars offers valuable insights into their internal structures. In this study, we investigate in detail the information we can recover on the structural properties of core-helium burning (CHeB) stars by examining how the coupling between gravity- and pressure-mode cavities depends on several stellar properties, including mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary state. Using the structure of models computed with the stellar evolution code MESA we calculate the coupling coefficient implementing analytical expressions, which are appropriate for the strong coupling regime and the structure of the evanescent region in CHeB stars. Our analysis reveals a notable anti-correlation between the coupling coefficient and both the mass and metallicity of stars in the regime $M \lesssim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, in agreement with Kepler data. We attribute this correlation primarily to variations in the density contrast between the stellar envelope and core. The strongest coupling is expected thus for red-horizontal branch stars, partially stripped stars, and stars in the higher-mass range exhibiting solar-like oscillations ($M \gtrsim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$). While our investigation emphasises some limitations of current analytical expressions, it also presents promising avenues. The frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient emerges as a potential tool for reconstructing the detailed stratification of the evanescent region.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, JWST has detected the earliest known star clusters in our Universe (Adamo et al. 2024, Messa et al. 2024, Vanzella et al. 2024, Mowla et al. 2024). They appear to be relatively compact (~few pc, Adamo et al. 2024) and had only recently formed their stars. It was speculated that these clusters may be the earliest progenitors of globular clusters ever detected. Globular clusters are a relic of the initial stages of star formation in the Universe. However, because they contain little to no dark matter (e.g., Heggie & Hut 1996, Bradford et al. 2011, Conroy et al. 2011, Ibata et al. 2013), their formation mechanism poses a significant theoretical challenge. A recent suggestion pointed out that the relative velocity between the gas and the dark matter (Tseliakhovich & Hirata 2010) in the early Universe could naturally form potentially star-forming regions outside of dark matter halos. Here, for the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical black holes (BHs) have two fundamental properties: mass and spin. While the mass-evolution of BHs has been extensively studied, much less work has been done on predicting the distribution of BH spins. In this paper we present the spin evolution for a sample of intermediate-mass and massive BHs from the newHorizon simulation, which evolved BH spin across cosmic time in a full cosmological context through gas accretion, BH-BH mergers and BH feedback including jet spindown. As BHs grow, their spin evolution alternates between being dominated by gas accretion and BH mergers. Massive BHs are generally highly this http URL for the spin energy extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism increases the scatter in BH spins, especially in the mass range $10^{5-7} \rm \ M_\odot$, where BHs had previously been predicted to be almost universally maximally spinning. We find no evidence for spin-down through efficient chaotic accretion. As a result of their high spin values, massive BHs have an average radiative efficiency of $<\varepsilon_{\rm r}^{\rm thin}> \approx 0.19$. As BHs spend much of their time at low redshift with a radiatively inefficient thick disc, BHs in our sample remain hard to observe. Different observational methods probe different sub-populations of BHs, significantly influencing the observed distribution of spins. Generally, X-ray-based methods and higher luminosity cuts increase the average observed BH spin. When taking BH spin evolution into account, BHs inject on average between 3 times (in quasar mode) and 8 times (in radio mode) as much feedback energy into their host galaxy as previously assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the super-massive black holes in the Universe accrete material in an obscured phase. While it is commonly accepted that the "dusty torus" is responsible for the nuclear obscuration, its geometrical, physical, and chemical properties are far from being properly understood. In this paper, we take advantage of the multiple X-ray observations taken between 2007 and 2020, as well as of optical to far infra-red (FIR) observations of NGC 6300, a nearby ($z=0.0037$) Seyfert 2 galaxy. The goal of this project is to study the nuclear emission and the properties of the obscuring medium, through a multi-wavelength study conducted from X-ray to IR. We perform a simultaneous X-ray spectral fitting and optical-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to investigate the obscuring torus. For the X-ray spectral fitting, physically motivated torus models, such as borus02, UXClumpy and XClumpy are used. The SED fitting is done using XCIGALE. Through joint analysis, we constrain the physical parameters of the torus and the emission properties of the accreting supermassive black hole. Through X-ray observations taken in the last 13 years, we have not found any significant line-of-sight column density variability for this source, but observed the X-ray flux dropping $\sim40-50\%$ in 2020 with respect to previous observations. The UXClumpy model predicts the presence of an inner ring of Compton-thick gaseous medium, responsible for the reflection dominated spectra above 10 keV. Through multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure an Eddington accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}\sim2\times10^{-3}$, which falls in the range of the radiatively inefficient accretion solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Interacting binary star systems play a critical role in many areas of astrophysics. One interesting example of a binary merger product are Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs), stars that look like red supergiants but contain neutron stars at their cores. TŻOs were theorized nearly five decades ago, and significant work has gone into understanding the physics of their formation, evolution, and stability. Several searches for TŻO candidates have also been carried out. Whether or not TŻOs could even exist or if they would be stable after formation has also been investigated. Understanding the existence and possible prevalence of TŻOs would have important effects on our understanding of binary evolution, stellar mergers, and inform binary population synthesis models. In this chapter, we review the formation channels, evolution and structure, final fates, and observable signatures of TŻOs, as well as candidates in the literature, from the inception of TŻO theory to recent progress in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The disk instability model is a promising pathway for giant planet formation in various conditions. At the moment, population synthesis models are used to investigate the outcomes of this theory, where a key ingredient of the disk population evolution are collisions of self-gravitating clumps formed by the disk instabilities. In this study, we explore the wide range of dynamics between the colliding clumps by performing state-of-the-art Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations with a hydrogen-helium mixture equation of state and investigate the parameter space of collisions between clumps of different ages, masses (1--10 Jupiter mass), various impact conditions (head-on to oblique collisions) and a range of relative velocities. We find that the perfect merger assumption used in population synthesis models is rarely satisfied and that the outcomes of most of the collisions lead to erosion, disruption or a hit-and-run. We also show that in some cases collisions can initiate the dynamical collapse of the clump. We conclude that population synthesis models should abandon the simplifying assumption of perfect merging. Relaxing this assumption will significantly affect the inferred population of planets resulting from the disk instability model.

          Evidence of Truly Young high-$\alpha$ Dwarf Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of high-$\alpha$ stars with inferred ages < 6 Gyr has been confirmed recently with large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. However, stellar mergers or binary interactions can induce properties associated with young ages, such as high mass, rapid rotation, or high activity, even in old populations. Literature studies have confirmed that at least some of these apparently young stars are old merger products. However, none have ruled out the possibility of genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars. Because cool GKM dwarfs spin down, rapid rotation can be used to indicate youth. In this paper, we provide strong evidence that truly young high-$\alpha$ stars exist by studying high-$\alpha$ rotators in the Kepler and K2 field with abundance measurements from GALAH and APOGEE. After excluding close binaries using radial velocity (RV) measurements from Gaia DR3 and multi-epoch RVs from APOGEE, we find a total of 70 high-$\alpha$ rapid rotators with periods ~10-30 days, 29 of which have lithium measurements from GALAH, indicating that they have not gone through past mass transfer or stellar merger events. We identify 10 young high-$\alpha$ candidates with no signs of merger-induced mixing or close companions. One clear example is a G dwarf with a measurable rotation and an age of 1.98$^{+0.12}_{-0.28}$ Gyr that is likely a single star with multiple RV measurements from APOGEE, has significant lithium detection from GALAH (A(Li) = 1.79), and has no signs of planet engulfment.

          The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) on Mars Express: a new science instrument made from an old webcam orbiting Mars

 - **Abstract**
 The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) is a small imaging instrument onboard Mars Express with a field of view of ~40x30 degrees. The camera was initially intended to provide visual confirmation of the separation of the Beagle 2 lander and has similar technical specifications to a typical webcam of the 2000s. In 2007, a few years after the end of its original mission, VMC was turned on again to obtain full-disk images of Mars to be used for outreach purposes. As VMC obtained more images, the scientific potential of the camera became evident, and in 2018 the camera was given an upgraded status of a new scientific instrument, with science goals in the field of Martian atmosphere meteorology. The wide Field of View of the camera combined with the orbit of Mars Express enable the acquisition of full-disk images of the planet showing different local times, which for a long time has been rare among orbital missions around Mars. The small data volume of images also allows videos that show the atmospheric dynamics of dust and cloud systems to be obtained. This paper is intended to be the new reference paper for VMC as a scientific instrument, and thus provides an overview of the updated procedures to plan, command and execute science observations of the Martian atmosphere. These observations produce valuable science data that is calibrated and distributed to the community for scientific use.

          An Extremely Elongated Cloud over Arsia Mons Volcano on Mars: II. Mesoscale modeling

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous work (Hernández-Bernal et al. 2021) we performed an observational analysis of the Arsia Mons Elongated Cloud (AMEC), which stands out due to its impressive size and shape, quick dynamics, and the fact that it happens during the martian dusty season. Observations show that its morphology can be split in a head, on the western slope of the volcano of around 120 km in diameter; and a tail, that expands to the west reaching more than 1000 km in length, making the AMEC the longest orographic cloud observed so far in the solar system. In this work we run the LMD (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) Mesoscale Model to gain insight into the physics of the AMEC. We note that it is coincident in terms of local time and seasonality with the fastest winds on the summit of Arsia Mons. A downslope windstorm on the western slope is followed by a hydraulic-like jump triggering a strong vertical updraft that propagates upwards in the atmosphere, causing a drop in temperatures of down to 30K at 40-50 km in altitude, spatially and temporarily coincident with the observed head of the AMEC. However the model does not reproduce the microphysics of this cloud: the optical depth is too low and the expansion of the tail does not happen in the model. The observed diurnal cycle is correctly captured by the model for the head of the cloud. This work raises new questions that will guide future observations of the AMEC.

 - **Abstract**
 On 24 September 2023, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) Sample Return Capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere after successfully collecting samples from an asteroid. The known trajectory and timing of this return provided a rare opportunity to strategically instrument sites to record geophysical signals produced by the capsule as it traveled at hypersonic speeds through the atmosphere. We deployed two optical-fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) interrogators to sample over 12 km of surface-draped, fiber-optic cables along with six co-located seismometer-infrasound sensor pairs, spread across two sites near Eureka, NV. This campaign-style rapid deployment is the first reported recording of a sample return capsule entry with any distributed fiber optic sensing technology. The DAS interrogators recorded an impulsive arrival with an extended coda which had features that were similar to recordings from both the seismometers and infrasound sensors. While the signal-to-noise of the DAS data was lower than the seismic-infrasound data, the extremely dense spacing of fiber-optic sensors allowed for more phases to be clearly distinguished and the continuous transformation of the wavefront as it impacted the ground could be visualized. Unexpectedly, the DAS recordings contain less low-frequency content than is present in both the seismic and infrasound data. The deployment conditions strongly affected the recorded DAS data, in particular, we observed that fiber selection and placement exert strong controls on data quality.

          Chromospheric Mg I Emission Lines of Pre-Main-Sequence Stars

 - **Abstract**
 To reveal details of the internal structure, the relationship between chromospheric activity and the Rossby number has been extensively examined for main-sequence stars. For active pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, it is suggested that the level of activity be assessed using optically thin emission lines, such as Mg I. We aim to detect Mg I chromospheric emission lines from PMS stars and determine whether the chromosphere is activated by the dynamo process or by mass accretion from protoplanetary disks. We analyzed high-resolution optical spectra of $64\ $PMS stars obtained with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-shooter and UVES and examined the infrared Ca II (8542 A) and Mg I (8807 A) emission lines. To detect the weak chromospheric emission lines, we determined the atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log\ g$) and the degree of veiling of the PMS stars by comparing the observed spectra with photospheric model spectra. After subtracting the photospheric model spectrum from the PMS spectrum, we detected Ca II and Mg I as emission lines. The strengths of the Mg I emission lines in PMS stars with no veiling are comparable to those in zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars if both types of stars have similar Rossby numbers. The Mg I emission lines in these PMS stars are thought to be formed by a dynamo process similar to that in ZAMS stars. In contrast, the Mg I emission lines in PMS stars with veiling are stronger than those in ZAMS stars. These objects are believed to have protoplanetary disks, where mass accretion generates shocks near the photosphere, heating the chromosphere. The chromosphere of PMS stars is activated not only by the dynamo process but also by mass accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of another planetary companion in a transiting exoplanet system can impact its transit light curve, leading to sinusoidal transit timing variations (TTV). By utilizing both $\chi^2$ and RMS analysis, we have combined the TESS observation data with an N-body simulation to investigate the existence of an additional planet in the system and put a limit on its mass. We have developed CMAT, an efficient and user-friendly tool for fitting transit light curves and calculating TTV with a theoretical period, based on which we can give a limit on its hidden companion's mass. We use 260 hot Jupiter systems from the complete TESS data set to demonstrate the use of CMAT. Our findings indicate that, for most systems, the upper mass limit of a companion planet can be restricted to several Jupiter masses. This constraint becomes stronger near resonance orbits, such as the 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 mean motion resonance, where the limit is reduced to several Earth masses. These findings align with previous studies suggesting that a lack of companion planets with resonance in hot Jupiter systems could potentially support the high eccentricity migration theory. Additionally, we observed that the choice between $\chi^2$ or {root mean square (RMS)} method does not significantly affect the upper limit on companion mass; however, $\chi^2$ analysis may result in weaker restrictions but is statistically more robust compared to RMS analysis in most cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Although flares from late-type main-sequence stars have been frequently detected in multi-wavelength, the associated dynamical process has been rarely reported so far. Here, we report follow-up observations of an X-ray transient triggered by WXT onboard the Einstein Probe at UT08:45:08 in 2024, May 7. The photometry in multi-bands and time-resolved spectroscopy started at 3 and 7.5 hours after the trigger, respectively, which enables us to identify the transient as a flare of the M-dwarf 2MASS J12184187-0609123. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\sim10^{36}\ \mathrm{erg}$ from its X-ray light curve. The H$\alpha$ emission-line profile obtained at about 7 hours after the trigger shows an evident blue asymmetry with a maximum velocity of $200-250\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The blue wing can be likely explained by the chromospheric temperature (cool) upflow associated with chromospheric evaporation, in which the mass of the evaporating plasma is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{18}$g. In addition, a prominence eruption with an estimated mass of $7\times10^{15}\mathrm{g}<M_{\mathrm{p}}<7\times10^{18}\mathrm{g}$ can not be entirely excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 JASMINE is a Japanese planned space mission that aims to reveal the formation history of our Galaxy and discover habitable exoEarths. For these objectives, the JASMINE satellite performs high-precision astrometric observations of the Galactic bulge and high-precision transit monitoring of M-dwarfs in the near-infrared (1.0-1.6 microns in wavelength). For feasibility studies, we develop an image simulation software named JASMINE-imagesim, which produces realistic observation images. This software takes into account various factors such as the optical point spread function (PSF), telescope jitter caused by the satellite's attitude control error (ACE), detector flat patterns, exposure timing differences between detector pixels, and various noise factors. As an example, we report a simulation for the feasibility study of astrometric observations using JASMINE-imagesim. The simulation confirms that the required position measurement accuracy of 4 mas for a single exposure of 12.5-mag objects is achievable if the telescope pointing jitter uniformly dilutes the PSF across all stars in the field of view. On the other hand, the simulation also demonstrates that the combination of realistic pointing jitter and exposure timing differences in the detector can significantly degrade accuracy and prevent achieving the requirement. This means that certain countermeasures against this issue must be developed. This result implies that this kind of simulation is important for mission planning and advanced developments to realize more realistic simulations help us to identify critical issues and also devise effective solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of extraordinary X-ray burst (XRB) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB) like FRB 20200428D is still unclear, though several models such as the emission of a trapped fireball modified by resonant cyclotron scattering, the outflow from a polar trapped-expanding fireball, and the synchrotron radiation of a far-away relativistic shock, have been proposed. To determine which model is true, we study possible X-ray polarization signature for each model, inspired by the importance of radio polarization in identifying FRB origin. We first numerically simulate or calculate the XRB spectrum for each model and fit it to the observed data, then compute the corresponding polarization signal based on the fit. We find that these three models predict different polarization patterns in terms of phase/time and energy variations. The differences can be used to test the models with future X-ray polarization observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in radio astronomy is a complex task due to the challenges posed by radio frequency interference (RFI) and signal dispersion in the interstellar medium. Traditional search algorithms are often inefficient, time-consuming, and generate a high number of false positives. In this paper, we present DRAFTS, a deep learning-based radio fast transient search pipeline. DRAFTS integrates object detection and binary classification techniques to accurately identify FRBs in radio data. We developed a large, real-world dataset of FRBs for training deep learning models. The search test on FAST real observation data demonstrates that DRAFTS performs exceptionally in terms of accuracy, completeness, and search speed. In the re-search of FRB 20190520B observation data, DRAFTS detected more than three times the number of bursts compared to Heimdall, highlighting the potential for future FRB detection and analysis.

          Localised ejection of dust and chunks on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko: testing how comets work

 - **Abstract**
 We extend an existing thermophysical activity model of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko to include pressure buildup inside the pebbles making up the nucleus. We test various quantities of H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$, in order to simulate the material inside and outside of proposed water enriched bodies (WEBs). We find that WEBs can reproduce the peak water flux observed by Rosetta, but that the addition of a time-resolved heat-flow reduces the water fluxes away from perihelion as compared to the previously assumed equilibrium model. Our modelled WEBs eject dust continuously but with a rate that is much higher than the observed erosion and mass-loss, thus requiring an active area smaller than the total comet surface area or very large quantities of dust fallback. When simulating the CO$_{2}$-rich non-WEB material, we only find the ejection of large chunks under specific conditions (e.g.~low diffusivities between the pebbles or intense insolation at southern summer), whilst we also find CO$_{2}$ outgassing rates that are much greater than observed. This is a general problem in models where CO$_{2}$ drives erosion, alongside difficulties in simultaneously ejecting chunks from deep whilst eroding the surface layer. We therefore conclude that ejection of chunks by CO$_{2}$ must be a localised phenomenon, occurring separately in space or time from surface erosion and water emission. Simulating the global production rates of gas, dust, and chunks from a comet thus remains challenging, while the activity mechanism is shown to be very sensitive to the material structure (i.e.~porosity and diffusivity) at various scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The Helix is a visually striking and the nearest planetary nebula, yet any companions responsible for its asymmetric morphology have yet to be identified. In 2020, low-amplitude photometric variations with a periodicity of 2.8 d were reported based on Cycle 1 TESS observations. In this work, with the inclusion of two additional sectors, these periodic light curves are compared with lcurve simulations of irradiated companions in such an orbit. Based on the light curve modelling, there are two representative solutions: i) a Jupiter-sized body with 0.102 Rsol and an arbitrarily small orbital inclination i=1 deg, and ii) a 0.021 Rsol exoplanet with i approx. 25 deg, essentially aligned with the Helix Nebular inclination. Irradiated substellar companion models with equilibrium temperature 4970 K are constructed and compared with existing optical spectra and infrared photometry, where Jupiter-sized bodies can be ruled out, but companions modestly larger than Neptune are still allowed. Additionally, any spatially-unresolved companions are constrained based on the multi-wavelength, photometric spectral energy distribution of the central star. No ultracool dwarf companion earlier than around L5 is permitted within roughly 1200 au, leaving only faint white dwarfs and cold brown dwarfs as possible surviving architects of the nebular asymmetries. While a planetary survivor is a tantalizing possibility, it cannot be ruled out that the light curve modulation is stellar in nature, where any substellar companion requires confirmation and may be possible with JWST observations.

 We calculate the 2024 impact factors of 36 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.

          A General, Differentiable Transit Model for Ellipsoidal Occulters: Derivation, Application, and Forecast of Planetary Oblateness and Obliquity Constraints with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Increasingly precise space-based photometry uncovers higher-order effects in transits, eclipses and phase curves which can be used to characterize exoplanets in novel ways. The subtle signature induced by a rotationally deformed exoplanet is determined by the planet's oblateness and rotational obliquity, which provide a wealth of information about a planet's formation, internal structure, and dynamical history. However, these quantities are often strongly degenerate and require sophisticated methods to convincingly constrain. We develop a new semi-analytic model for an ellipsoidal object occulting a spherical body with arbitrary surface maps expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. We implement this model in an open-source Jax-based Python package eclipsoid, allowing just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation. We then estimate the precision obtainable with JWST observations of the long period planet population and demonstrate the best current candidates for studies of oblateness and obliquity. We test our method on the JWST NIRSpec transit of the inflated warm Neptune WASP-107 b and place an upper bound on its projected oblateness $f<0.23$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}}>13$h if the planet is not inclined to our line of sight. Further studies of long-period exoplanets will necessitate discarding the assumption of planets as spherical bodies. Eclipsoid provides a general framework allowing rotational deformation to be modelled in transits, occultations, phase curves, transmission spectra and more.

          The Feasibility of Asynchronous Rotation via Thermal Tides for Diverse Atmospheric Compositions

 - **Abstract**
 The equilibrium rotation rate of a planet is determined by the sum of torques acting on its solid body. For planets with atmospheres, the dominant torques are usually the gravitational tide, which acts to slow the planet's rotation rate, and the atmospheric thermal tide, which acts to spin up the planet. Previous work demonstrated that rocky planets with thick atmospheres may produce strong enough thermal tides to avoid tidal locking, but a study of how the strength of the thermal tide depends on atmospheric properties has not been done. In this work, we use a combination of simulations from a global climate model and analytic theory to explore how the thermal tide depends on the shortwave and longwave optical depth of the atmosphere, the surface pressure, and the absorbed stellar radiation. We find that for planets in the habitable zones of M stars only high-pressure but low-opacity atmospheres permit asynchronous rotation owing to the weakening of the thermal tide at high longwave and shortwave optical depths. We conclude that asynchronous rotation may be very unlikely around low-mass stars, which may limit the potential habitability of planets around M stars.

 - **Abstract**
 XTE J1829-098 is a transient X-ray pulsar with a period of ~7.8 s. It is a candidate Be star system, although the evidence for this is not yet definitive. We investigated the twenty-year long X-ray light curve using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array (PCA), Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). We find that all three light curves are clearly modulated on the ~244 day orbital period previously reported from PCA monitoring observations, with outbursts confined to a narrow phase range. The light curves also show that XTE J1829-098 was in an inactive state between approximately December 2008 and April 2018 and no strong outbursts occurred. Such behavior is typical of Be X-ray binary systems, with the absence of outbursts likely related to the dissipation of the Be star's decretion disk. The mean outburst shapes can be approximated with a triangular profile and, from a joint fit of this to all three light curves, we refine the orbital period to 243.95 +/- 0.04 days. The mean outburst profile does not show any asymmetry and has a total phase duration of 0.140 +/- 0.007. However, the PCA light curve shows that there is considerable cycle-to-cycle variability of the individual outbursts. We compare the properties of XTE J1829-098 with other sources that show short phase-duration outbursts, in particular GS 1843-02 (2S 1845-024) which has a very similar orbital period, but longer pulse period, and whose orbit is known to be highly eccentric.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of the next generation of astrophysics experiments, the volume of data available to researchers will be greater than ever. As these projects will significantly drive down statistical uncertainties in measurements, it is crucial to develop novel tools to assess the ability of our models to fit these data within the specified errors. We introduce to astronomy the Leave One Out-Probability Integral Transform (LOO-PIT) technique. This first estimates the LOO posterior predictive distributions based on the model and likelihood distribution specified, then evaluates the quality of the match between the model and data by applying the PIT to each estimated distribution and data point, outputting a LOO-PIT distribution. Deviations between this output distribution and that expected can be characterised visually and with a standard Kolmogorov--Smirnov distribution test. We compare LOO-PIT and the more common $\chi^2$ test using both a simplified model and a more realistic astrophysics problem, where we consider fitting Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in galaxy survey data with contamination from emission line interlopers. LOO-PIT and $\chi^2$ tend to find different signals from the contaminants, and using these tests in conjunction increases the statistical power compared to using either test alone. We also show that LOO-PIT outperforms $\chi^2$ in certain realistic test cases.

 With sizable volatile envelopes but smaller radii than the solar system ice giants, sub-Neptunes have been revealed as one of the most common types of planet in the galaxy. While the spectroscopic characterization of larger sub-Neptunes (2.5-4R$_\oplus$) has revealed hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, smaller sub-Neptunes (1.6--2.5R$_\oplus$) could either host thin, rapidly evaporating hydrogen-rich atmospheres or be stable metal-rich "water worlds" with high mean molecular weight atmospheres and a fundamentally different formation and evolutionary history. Here, we present the 0.6--2.8$\mu$m JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of GJ 9827 d, the smallest (1.98 R$_\oplus$) warm (T$_\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3} \sim 620$K) sub-Neptune where atmospheric absorbers have been detected to date. Our two transit observations with NIRISS/SOSS, combined with the existing HST/WFC3 spectrum, enable us to break the clouds-metallicity degeneracy. We detect water in a highly metal-enriched "steam world" atmosphere (O/H of $\sim 4$ by mass and H$_2$O found to be the background gas with a volume mixing ratio of >31%). We further show that these results are robust to stellar contamination through the transit light source effect. We do not detect escaping metastable He, which, combined with previous nondetections of escaping He and H, supports the steam atmosphere scenario. In water-rich atmospheres, hydrogen loss driven by water photolysis happens predominantly in the ionized form which eludes observational constraints. We also detect several flares in the NIRISS/SOSS light-curves with far-UV energies of the order of 10$^{30}$ erg, highlighting the active nature of the star. Further atmospheric characterization of GJ 9827 d probing carbon or sulfur species could reveal the origin of its high metal enrichment.

          A Laboratory Method for Measuring the Cross-Polarization in High-Contrast Imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and related techniques have proven effective for coronagraphic exoplanet imaging. EFC creates a dark hole region in the image plane, allowing for the detection of faint planetary emissions. The quality of a dark hole is quantified by the contrast, i.e., the planet-to-star intensity ratio, that could be measured inside it. Inside the dark hole, the planet's light is distinguished from the residual starlight due to its incoherence. Cross polarization can cause the modulation of the starlight to behave differently than predicted, and can limit the achievable contrast. Sophisticated physical optics software can model the cross polarization for a fully specified optical system, but this does not obviate the need for measurements. This article presents realistic simulations of a novel laboratory-based method for measurements of the cross-polarization in a coronagraph. This capability may well prove useful for validating models of polarization effects. The proposed laboratory method is not much more demanding than current efforts on the high-contrast testbeds, yet the simulation results demonstrate highly accurate estimates of the electric field corresponding to the cross polarization in a dark hole. These encouraging results suggest viable laboratory implementation. The proposed method uses a laser and two linear polarizers to isolate the cross polarization. A nonlinear probing scheme addresses polarizer leakage. Simulations are performed for an aberrated Lyot coronagraph with an initial dark hole contrast of $\sim 10^{-10}$ and cross-polarization electric fields corresponding to intensities of $\sim 10^{-11}$ in contrast units. The primary application of this method is likely laboratory validation of digital twin models for cross-polarization. On-sky, the experimentally validated models could then be used to account for cross polarization.

 Over the past several decades, time-series photometry of CSPNe has yielded significant results including, but not limited to, discoveries of nearly 100 binary systems, insights into pulsations and winds in young white dwarfs, and studies of stars undergoing very late thermal pulses. We have undertaken a systematic study of optical photometric variability of cataloged CSPNe, using the epochal photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By applying appropriate variability metrics, we arrive at a list of 94 significantly variable CSPNe. Based on the timescales of the light-curve activity, we classify the variables broadly into short- and long-timescale variables. In this first paper in this series, we focus on the former, which is the majority class comprising 83 objects. We infer periods for six sources for the first time, and recover several known periodic variables. Among the aperiodic sources, most exhibit a jitter around a median flux with a stable amplitude, and a few show outbursts. We draw attention to WeSb 1, which shows a different kind of variability: prominent deep and aperiodic dips, resembling transits from a dust/debris disk. We find strong evidence for a binary nature of WeSb 1 (possibly an A- to G-type companion). The compactness of the emission lines and inferred high electron densities make WeSb 1 a candidate for either an EGB 6-type planetary nucleus, or a symbiotic system inside an evolved planetary nebula, both of which are rare objects. To demonstrate further promise with ZTF, we report three additional newly identified periodic sources that do not appear in the list of highly variable sources. Finally, we also introduce a two-dimensional metric space defined by the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying unique variables of astrophysical interest, like WeSb 1.

 We present $72$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only N-body zoom-in simulations with initial conditions beyond cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM), as the first installment of the COZMIC suite. We simulate Milky Way (MW) analogs with linear matter power spectra, $P(k)$ for: i) thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,4,5,6,6.5,10]~\mathrm{keV}$, ii) fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}\in [25.9,69.4,113,151,185,490]\times 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$, and iii) interacting dark matter (IDM) with a velocity-dependent elastic proton scattering cross section $\sigma=\sigma_0 v^n$ relative particle velocity scaling $n\in [2,4]$, and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}\in[10^{-4},~ 10^{-2},~ 1]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression is significantly steeper in FDM versus WDM, while dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$ can reduce SHMF suppression for IDM. We fit SHMF models to our simulation results and derive new bounds on WDM and FDM from the MW satellite population, obtaining $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}>5.9~\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}>1.4\times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ at $95\%$ confidence; these limits are $\approx 10\%$ weaker and $5\times$ stronger than previous constraints due to the updated transfer functions and SHMF models, respectively. We estimate IDM bounds for $n=2$ ($n=4$) and obtain $\sigma_0 < 1.0\times 10^{-27}$, $1.3\times 10^{-24}$, and $3.1\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($\sigma_0 < 9.9\times 10^{-27}$, $9.8\times 10^{-21}$, and $2.1\times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{cm}^2$) for $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}=10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, and $1$ GeV, respectively. Thus, future development of IDM SHMF models can improve IDM cross section bounds by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ with current data. COZMIC presents an important step toward accurate small-scale structure modeling in beyond-CDM cosmologies, critical to upcoming observational searches for DM physics.

 In this chapter, we provide an overview of the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars and of the impact of neutrinos on these systems. Observations of colliding neutron stars play an important role in nuclear astrophysics today. They allow us to study the properties of cold nuclear matter and the origin of many heavy elements (gold, platinum, uranium). We show that neutrinos significantly impact the observable signals powered by these events as well as the outcome of nucleosynthesis in the matter that they eject into the surrounding intergalactic medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and Lyman continuum (LyC) properties of the Sunburst Arc, a $z=2.37$ gravitationally lensed galaxy with a multiply-imaged, compact region leaking LyC and a triple-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile indicating direct Ly$\alpha$ escape. Non-LyC-leaking regions show a redshifted Ly$\alpha$ peak, a redshifted and central Ly$\alpha$ peak, or a triple-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile. We measure the properties of the Ly$\alpha$ profile from different regions of the galaxy using $R\sim5000$ Magellan/MagE spectra. We compare the Ly$\alpha$ spectral properties to LyC and narrowband Ly$\alpha$ maps from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging to explore the subgalactic Ly$\alpha-$LyC connection. We find strong correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient $r>0.6$) between the LyC escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$) and Ly$\alpha$ (1) peak separation $v_{\rm{sep}}$, (2) ratio of the minimum flux density between the redshifted and blueshifted Ly$\alpha$ peaks to continuum flux density $f_{\rm{min}}/f_{\rm{cont}}$, and (3) equivalent width. We favor a complex \ion{H}{1} geometry to explain the Ly$\alpha$ profiles from non-LyC-leaking regions and suggest two \ion{H}{1} geometries that could diffuse and/or rescatter the central Ly$\alpha$ peak from the LyC-leaking region into our sightline across transverse distances of several hundred parsecs. Our results emphasize the complexity of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the anisotropies of \ion{H}{1} gas on subgalactic scales. Large differences in the physical scales on which we observe spatially variable direct escape Ly$\alpha$, blueshifted Ly$\alpha$, and escaping LyC photons in the Sunburst Arc underscore the importance of resolving the physical scales that govern Ly$\alpha$ and LyC escape.
