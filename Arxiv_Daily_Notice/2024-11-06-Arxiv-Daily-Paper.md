          Caught in flagrante delicto: evidence for past mass transfer in massive binaries?

 - **Abstract**
 Many massive binary systems undergo mass and angular momentum transfer over the course of their evolution. This kind of interaction is expected to deeply affect the properties of the mass donor and mass gainer and to leave various observational signatures. The most common smoking guns of a past mass transfer episode are notably rapid rotation of the mass gainer and altered surface chemical abundances of the stripped mass donor star. Quantitative observational studies of evolved massive binaries are crucial to gain insight into poorly constrained parameters of binary evolution models such as the fraction of mass lost by the mass donor that is actually accreted by the mass gainer. Yet, drawing conclusions about a past mass transfer episode requires a detailed analysis of all aspects of a binary system which sometimes leads to unexpected results. In this contribution, we review the existing observational evidence for past mass exchange events in massive main-sequence and post main-sequence binaries.

          A new multiple-arc model of the resonant Kuiper belt objects -- Plutinos

 - **Abstract**
 To incorporate the gravitational influence of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in planetary ephemerides, uniform-ring models are commonly employed. In this paper, for representing the KBO population residing in Neptune's 2:3 mean motion resonance (MMR), known as the Plutinos, we introduce a three-arc model by considering their resonant characteristics. Each `arc' refers to a segment of the uniform ring and comprises an appropriate number of point masses. Then the total perturbation of Plutinos is numerically measured by the change in the Sun-Neptune distance ($\Delta d_{SN}$). We conduct a comprehensive investigation to take into account various azimuthal and radial distributions associated with the resonant amplitudes ($A$) and eccentricities ($e$) of Plutinos, respectively. The results show that over a 100-year period: (1) at the smallest $e=0.05$, the Sun-Neptune distance change $\Delta d_{SN}$ caused by Plutinos decreases significantly as $A$ reduces. It can deviate from the value of $\Delta d_{SN}$ obtained in the ring model by approximately 100 km; (2) as $e$ increases in the medium range of 0.1-0.2, the difference in $\Delta d_{SN}$ between the arc and ring models becomes increasingly significant; (3) at the largest $e\gtrsim0.25$, $\Delta d_{SN}$ can approach zero regardless of $A$, and the arc and ring models exhibit a substantial difference in $\Delta d_{SN}$, reaching up to 170 km. Then the applicability of our three-arc model is further verified by comparing it to the perturbations induced by observed Plutinos on the positions of both Neptune and Saturn. Moreover, the concept of the multiple-arc model, designed for Plutinos, can be easily extended to other MMRs densely populated by small bodies.

          No missing flare in OJ~287

 - **Abstract**
 The quasar OJ~287 has shown large flares since 1888, following a pattern that arises in a supermassive black hole binary when the secondary hits the accretion disk of the primary, and releases a hot bubble of gas at every disk crossing. A complete mathematical solution of the flare sequence produced a list of future flares, the latest happening in the summer of 2022. Here I look into the origin of the idea that the lack of seeing the 2022 flare is a theoretical problem. During the summer OJ~287 cannot be observed by ground-based optical telescopes. In a paper published in 2021, ahead of the 2022 observing campaign, this was clearly stated. The often repeated claim that there is a "missing flare problem", is a misunderstanding, as no detection was possible with the current instrumentation.

          A highly efficient Voigt program for line profile computation

 - **Abstract**
 Evaluation of the Voigt function, a convolution of a Lorentzian and a Gaussian profile, is essential in various fields such as spectroscopy, atmospheric science, and astrophysics. Efficient computation of the function is crucial, especially in applications where the function may be called for an enormous number of times. In this paper, we present a highly efficient novel algorithm and its Fortran90 implementation for the practical evaluation of the Voigt function with accuracy in the order of 1.0e-6. The algorithm uses improved fits based on Chebyshev subinterval polynomial approximation for functions in two variables. The algorithm significantly outperforms widely-used competitive algorithms in the literature, in terms of computational speed, making it highly suitable for real-time applications and large-scale data processing tasks. The substantial improvement in efficiency positions the present algorithm and computer code as a valuable tool in relevant scientific domains. The algorithm has been adopted and implemented in the Meudon PDR code at Paris Observatory and is recommended for similar applications and simulation packages.

          $\texttt{bayes_spec}$: A Bayesian Spectral Line Modeling Framework for Astrophysics

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is a Bayesian spectral line modeling framework for astrophysics. Given a user-defined model and a spectral line dataset, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ enables inference of the model parameters through different numerical techniques, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods, implemented in the PyMC probabilistic programming library. The API for $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is designed to support astrophysical researchers who wish to ``fit'' arbitrary, user-defined models, such as simple spectral line profile models or complicated physical models that include a full physical treatment of radiative transfer. These models are ``cloud-based'', meaning that the spectral line data are decomposed into a series of discrete clouds with parameters defined by the user's model. Importantly, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ provides algorithms to determine the optimal number of clouds for a given model and dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star-forming regions exhibit a rich chemistry with complex gas distributions, especially on small scales. While surveys have yielded constraints on typical gas conditions, they often have coarse spatial resolution and limited bandwidths. Thus, to establish an interpretative framework for these efforts, detailed observations that simultaneously provide high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and large bandwidths for a subset of diverse sources are needed. Here, we present wideband (32 GHz) Submillimeter Array observations of four high-mass star-forming regions (G28.20-0.05, G20.08-0.14 N, G35.58-0.03, W33 Main) at subarcsecond resolution, where we detect and spatially-resolve 100s of lines from over 60 molecules, including many complex organic molecules (COMs). The chemical richness of our sample is consistent with an evolutionary sequence from the line-rich hot cores and HC HII regions of G28.20-0.05 and G20.08-0.14 N to the more chemically-modest UC HII regions in G35.58-0.03, followed by the molecule-poor HII region W33 Main. We detect lines across a range of excitation conditions (Eu=20 to >800 K) and from numerous isotopologues, which enables robust estimates of gas properties. We derive nearly constant COM column density ratios that agree with literature values in other low- and high-mass protostellar cores, supporting the idea that COM abundances are set during the pre-stellar phase. In all regions, we identify spatial offsets among different molecular families, due to a combination of source physical structure and chemistry. In particular, we find potential evidence of carbon grain sublimation in G28.20-0.05 and identify an elemental oxygen gradient and rich sulfur-chemistry in G35.58-0.03. Overall, these results demonstrate that the SMA's wide bandwidth is a powerful tool to untangle the complex molecular gas structures associated with massive star formation.

          Light Scattering Measurements of KCl Particles as an Exoplanet Cloud Analog

 - **Abstract**
 Salt clouds are predicted to be common on warm exoplanets, but their optical properties are uncertain. The Exoplanet Cloud Ensemble Scattering System (ExCESS), a new apparatus to measure the scattering intensity and degree of linear polarization (DOLP) for an ensemble of particles, is introduced here and used to study the light scattering properties of KCl cloud analogs. ExCESS illuminates particles with a polarized laser beam (532 nm) and uses a photomultiplier tube detector to sweep the plane of illumination. Scattering measurements for KCl particles were collected for three size distributions representative of modeled clouds for the warm exoplanet GJ 1214b. Our measurements show that Lorenz-Mie calculations, commonly used to estimate the light scattering properties of assumedly spherical cloud particles, offer an inaccurate depiction of cubic and cuboid shaped KCl particles. All of our measurements indicate that Lorenz-Mie scattering overestimates the backscattering intensity of our cloud analogs and incorrectly predicts the scattering at mid-phase angles (~90 degrees) and preferential polarization state of KCl scattered light. Our results align with the general scattering properties of non-spherical particles and underscore the importance of further understanding the effects that such particles will have on radiative transfer models of exoplanet atmospheres and reflected light observations of exoplanets by the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Habitable Worlds Observatory.

          Can dark energy explain a high growth index?

 - **Abstract**
 A promising way to test the physics of the accelerated expansion of the Universe is by studying the growth rate of matter fluctuations, which can be parameterized by the matter energy density parameter to the power $\gamma$, the so-called growth index. It is well-known that the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts $\gamma=0.55$. However, using observational data, Ref. \citep{Nguyen:2023fip} measured a much higher $\gamma=0.633^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, excluding the $\Lambda$CDM value within $3.7\sigma$. In this work, we analyze whether Dark Energy (DE) with the Equation of State (EoS) parameter described by the CPL parametrization can significantly modify $\gamma$ with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM one. Besides the usual Smooth DE (SDE) scenario, where DE perturbations are neglected on small scales, we also consider the case of Clustering Dark Energy (CDE), which has more potential to impact the growth of matter perturbations. In order to minimally constrain the background evolution and assess the largest meaningful $\gamma$ distribution, we use data from $32$ Cosmic Chronometers, $H(z$), data points. In this context, we found that both SDE and CDE models described by the CPL parametrization can not provide a significant number of $\gamma$ samples compatible with the value determined in Nguyen et al. (2023). Therefore, explaining the measured value of $\gamma$ is a challenge for DE models. Moreover, we present new fitting functions for $\gamma$, which are more accurate and general than the one proposed in Linder (2005) for SDE, and, for the first time, fitting functions for CDE models.

 - **Abstract**
 Large scientific institutions, such as the Space Telescope Science Institute, track the usage of their facilities to understand the needs of the research community. Astrophysicists incorporate facility usage data into their scientific publications, embedding this information in plain-text. Traditional automatic search queries prove unreliable for accurate tracking due to the misidentification of facility names in plain-text. As automatic search queries fail, researchers are required to manually classify publications for facility usage, which consumes valuable research time. In this work, we introduce a machine learning classification framework for the automatic identification of facility usage of observation sections in astrophysics publications. Our framework identifies sentences containing telescope mission keywords (e.g., Kepler and TESS) in each publication. Subsequently, the identified sentences are transformed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and classified with a Support Vector Machine. The classification framework leverages the context surrounding the identified telescope mission keywords to provide relevant information to the classifier. The framework successfully classifies usage of MAST hosted missions with a 92.9% accuracy. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates robustness when compared to other approaches, considering common metrics and computational complexity. The framework's interpretability makes it adaptable for use across observatories and other scientific facilities worldwide.

          Machine- and deep-learning-driven angular momentum inference from BHEX observations of the $n=1$ photon ring

 - **Abstract**
 The $n=1$ photon ring is an important probe of black hole (BH) properties and will be resolved by the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) for the first time. However, extraction of black hole parameters from observations of the $n=1$ subring is not trivial. Developing this capability can be achieved by building a sample of $n=1$ subring simulations, as well as by performing feature extraction on this high-volume sample to track changes in the geometry, which presents significant computational challenges. Here, we present a framework for the study of $n=1$ photon ring behavior and BH property measurement from BHEX images. We use KerrBAM to generate a grid of $\gtrsim10^6$ images of $n=1$ photon rings spanning the entire space of Kerr BH spins and inclinations. Intensity profiles are extracted from images using a novel feature extraction method developed specifically for BHEX. This novel method is highly optimized and outperforms existing EHT methods by a factor of ${\sim}3000$. Additionally, we propose a novel, minimal set of geometric measurables for characterizing the behavior of the $n=1$ subring geometry. We apply these measurables to our simulation grid and test spin recovery on simulated images using: (i) gradient boosting, a machine learning algorithm; and (ii) an extension of Deep Horizon, a deep learning framework. We find $\gtrsim90$\% correct recovery of BH properties using the machine/deep learning approaches, and characterize the space of resolution-dependent geometric degeneracies. Finally, we test both approaches on GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, and report accurate recovery of spin at the expected inclination of M87*.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding planetary habitability is one of the major challenges of the current scientific era, particularly given the discovery of a large and diverse terrestrial exoplanet population. Discerning the primary factors that contribute to planetary habitability may be extracted through a detailed examination of the terrestrial planets within the Solar System, most particularly Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the evolution of their interiors and atmospheres through time. Here, we provide a detailed description of the fundamental properties of these three planets, the effects of solar evolution, and the potential contributions of these various aspects toward driving their evolutionary pathways. We argue that evolution of Venus, Earth, and Mars provide essential templates from which a more comprehensive approach toward the study of planetary habitability may be derived.

          Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models (SPECTRUM) -- I: Updating radiative opacities for pulsation models of Classical Cepheid and RR-Lyrae

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsating stars are universally recognized as precise distance indicators and tracers of stellar populations. Their variability, combined with well-defined relationships between pulsation properties and intrinsic evolutionary parameters such as luminosity, mass, and age, makes them essential for understanding galactic evolution and retrieving star formation histories. Therefore, accurate modeling of pulsating stars is crucial for using them as standard candles and stellar population tracers. This is the first paper in the "Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models" (SPECTRUM) project, which aims to present an update of Stellingwerf's hydrodynamical pulsation code, by adopting the latest radiative opacity tables commonly used in stellar evolution community. We assess the impact of this update on pulsation properties, such as periods, instability strip topology, and light curve shapes, as well as on Period Wesenheit and Period-Luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars, comparing the results with those derived using older opacity data. Our results indicate that the opacity update introduces only minor changes: instability strip boundary locations shift by no more than $100K$ in effective temperature, and pulsation periods vary within $1\sigma$ compared to previous evaluations. Light curves exhibit slight differences in shape and amplitude. Consequently, the theoretical calibration of the Cepheid or RRL-based extragalactic distance scale remains largely unaffected by the opacity changes. However, achieving consistency in opacity tables between stellar evolution and pulsation codes is a significant step toward a homogeneous and self-consistent stellar evolution and pulsation framework.

 - **Abstract**
 The Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) is one of the components of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and can monitor any sources over two-thirds of the sky for up to 7 hours per day with >98\% duty cycle. In this work, we report the detection of two outbursts of the Fanaroff-Riley I radio galaxy NGC 1275 that were detected by LHAASO-WCDA between November 2022 and January 2023 with statistical significance of 5.2~$\sigma$ and 8.3~$\sigma$. The observed spectral energy distribution in the range from 500 GeV to 3 TeV is fitted by a power-law with a best-fit spectral index of $\alpha=-3.37\pm0.52$ and $-3.35\pm0.29$, respectively. The outburst flux above 0.5~TeV was ($4.55\pm 4.21)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$ and ($3.45\pm 1.78)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$, corresponding to 60\%, 45\% of Crab Nebula flux. Variation analysis reveals the variability time-scale of days at the TeV energy band. A simple test by one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model reproduces the data in the gamma-ray band well.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation have made significant contributions to our understanding of cosmology. While temperature observations of the CMB have greatly advanced our knowledge, the next frontier lies in detecting the elusive B-modes and obtaining precise reconstructions of the CMB's polarized signal in general. In anticipation of proposed and upcoming CMB polarization missions, this study introduces a novel method for accurately determining the angular power spectrum of CMB B-modes. We have developed a Neural Network-based approach to enhance the performance of the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) technique. Our method is applied to the frequency channels of the proposed ECHO (Exploring Cosmic History and Origins) mission and its performance is rigorously assessed. Our findings demonstrate the method's efficiency in achieving precise reconstructions of CMB B-mode angular power spectra, with errors constrained primarily by cosmic variance.

          Cosmological consequences of statistical inhomogeneity

 - **Abstract**
 A space-dependent mean for cosmological perturbations negates the ansatz of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, and hence ergodicity. In this work, we construct such a primordial mean of scalar perturbations from an alternative quantum initial state (coherent state) and examine the associated power and bi-spectra. A multitude of cosmological tests based on these spectra are discussed. We find that current cosmological data doesn't favor a primordial mean over large scales and strong constraints arise from the limit on bispectrum from Planck data. At small scales, this hypothesis can be tested by future observables such as $\mu$-distortion of CMB.

          Origins of Super Jupiters: TOI-2145b Has a Moderately Eccentric and Nearly Aligned Orbit

 - **Abstract**
 Super Jupiters are giant planets with several Jupiter masses. It remains an open question whether these planets originate with such high masses or grow through collisions. Previous work demonstrates that warm super Jupiters tend to have more eccentric orbits compared to regular-mass warm Jupiters. This correlation between mass and eccentricity may indicate that planet-planet interactions significantly influence the warm giant planet demographics. Here we conducted a detailed characterization of a warm super Jupiter, TOI-2145b. This analysis utilized previous observations from TESS and Keck/HIRES, enhanced by new Rossiter-McLaughlin effect data from the NEID spectrometer on the 3.5 m WIYN Telescope. TOI-2145b is a $5.68^{+0.37}_{-0.34} M_{\rm Jup}$ planet on a moderate eccentricity ($e = 0.214^{+0.014}_{-0.014}$), 10.26-day orbit, orbiting an evolved A-star. We constrain the projected stellar obliquity to be $\lambda = 6.8^{+2.9}_{-3.8}$$^\circ$ from two NEID observations. Our $N$-body simulations suggest that the formation of super Jupiter TOI-2145b could involve either of two scenarios: a high initial mass or growth via collisions. On a population level, however, the collision scenario can better describe the mass-eccentricity distribution of observed warm Jupiters.

 - **Abstract**
 This article describes condensation of the elements and use of condensation temperatures (Tcond) to interpret the volatility trend of the Earth. Major points are: (1) a listing of updated 50% Tcond for all natural elements and Pu at 1e-2 to 1e-8 bar pressure for solar composition matter. (2) The Tcond are mainly controlled by the Gibbs energy of condensation reactions and also by the Gibbs energy of ideal mixing if elements (compounds) condense in a solution. The Gibbs energy change of non-ideal solution (activity coefficients not equal to 1) is a secondary effect. (3) The theoretically correct relationship between Tcond and fraction condensed is derived from mass balance and chemical thermodynamic considerations. (4) The maximum amount of element condensed per 1/T, is at the inflection point in the logistic (sigmoid) curve for an element, which is also at (or close to) the 50% Tcond. (5) Plots of normalized elemental abundances versus 50% Tcond (volatility trends) are qualitative indicators of elemental fractionations due to volatility. (6) Volatility trend plots for average elemental abundances in CM, CO, CV, CR, H, L, LL, EH, EL chondrites show different trends for moderately and highly volatile elements, which may be linear, curved, a step function, or plateau. Comparison of three abundance sets for CM and CV chondrites shows trends depend on which elements are plotted, which data sources are used, and which temperature range is considered. (7) Proposed mechanisms for volatile element depletion in carbonaceous chondrites and the Earth are reviewed. (8) Possible implications of volatile element abundances in the bulk silicate Earth are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a framework for estimating and evaluating uncertainty in deep-attention-based classifiers for light curves for variable stars. We implemented three techniques, Deep Ensembles (DEs), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and Hierarchical Stochastic Attention (HSA) and evaluated models trained on three astronomical surveys. Our results demonstrate that MCD and HSA offers a competitive and computationally less expensive alternative to DE, allowing the training of transformers with the ability to estimate uncertainties for large-scale light curve datasets. We conclude that the quality of the uncertainty estimation is evaluated using the ROC AUC metric.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Key nuclear inputs for the astrophysical r process simulations are the weak interaction rates. Consequently, the accuracy of these inputs directly affects the reliability of nucleosynthesis modeling. Majority of the stellar rates, used in simulation studies, are calculated invoking the Brink Axel (BA) hypothesis. The BA hypothesis assumes that the strength functions of all parent excited states are the same as for the ground state, only shifted in energies. However, BA hypothesis has to be tested against microscopically calculated state by state rates. In this project we study the impact of the BA hypothesis on calculated stellar \b{eta} decay and electron capture rates. Our investigation include both Unique First Forbidden (U1F) and allowed transitions for 106 neutron rich trans iron nuclei ([27, 77] less than equal to [Z, A] less than equal to [82, 208]). The calculations were performed using the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle randomphase approximation (pn QRPA) model with a simple plus quadrupole separable and schematic interaction. Waiting-point and several key r process nuclei lie within the considered mass region of the nuclear chart.

 - **Abstract**
 We report our counterpart identification study for two high-energy, Gold neutrino events IC-130127A and IC-131204A listed in the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks. Within the events' 90\% positional uncertainty regions, we respectively find PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN J1916$-$1519. The first source is a flat-spectrum radio quasar at redshift $z= 1.18$ and the second a blazar of an uncertain type with photometric $z= 0.968$. As they correspondingly had a $\gamma$-ray flare temporally coincident with the arrival times of IC-130127A and IC-131204A, we identify them as the respective neutrino emitters. Detailed analysis of the $\gamma$-ray data for the two blazars, obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}, is conducted. The two flares respectively from PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN~J1916$-$1519 lasted $\sim$4\,yr and $\sim$4\,month, and showed possible emission hardening by containing high-energy $\sim$2--10\,GeV photons in the emissions. Accompanying the flare of PKS~2332$-$017, optical and MIR brightening variations were also observed. We discuss the properties of the two sources and compare the properties with those of the previously reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the multiwavelength (MW) variability of the blazar AO 0235+164 based on the radio-to-$\gamma$-ray data covering a long time period from 1997 to 2023. The radio data are represented by the 1-22 GHz measurements from the RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope. The optical measurements in the $R$-band were collected with the 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes. Additionally we used the archive data at 230~GHz from the SMA and the $\gamma$-ray data in the 0.1-100 GeV band from the Fermi-LAT point source 4FGL-DR2 catalogue. The variability properties during four epochs containing major flares and one epoch of relatively low activity were analysed. A significant correlation ($\geq\!2\sigma$) between the radio, optical, and $\gamma$-ray bands is found for all these periods with time delays from 0 to 1.7 yrs. The relation between time delay and frequency is described by a linear law with a negative slope of -10 day/GHz. The discovered properties of MW variability for the low activity period and for flaring states suggest that the mechanisms dominating the radio-$\gamma$-ray variations are not substantially different. The detected quasi-periodic oscillations of about 6 and 2 years are tentative, as the time span of the observations includes fewer than 4 full cycles for the radio and optical data and only about 3 cycles for the Fermi-LAT data. The physical parameters of the radio jet were obtained using the Hedgehog model applied to the average radio spectrum of AO 0235+164 in the range 0.1-300 GHz. The effectiveness of replacing electrons with protons in the synchrotron radio emission of relativistic jets is shown for describing the nature of blazars and the generation of high energy neutrinos.

 The clustering dipole in the 2MASS galaxy survey converges on a scale of ~400Mpc to the local peculiar velocity inferred from the Cosmic-Microwave-Background dipole. I show that this limits the graviton mass in Yukawa theories of gravity to less than 5x10^{-32}eV. The new limit is 2.5x10^8 times tighter than the latest constraint from gravitational waves detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.

          Reheating constraints and the $H_0$ tension in Quintessential Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we focus on two important aspects of modern cosmology: reheating and Hubble constant tension within the framework of a unified model, namely, quintessential inflation connecting the early inflationary era and late-time cosmic acceleration. In the context of reheating, we use instant preheating and gravitational reheating, two viable reheating mechanisms when the evolution of the universe is not affected by an oscillating regime. After obtaining the reheating temperature, we analyze the number of $e$-folds and establish its relationship with the reheating temperature. This allows us to connect, for different quintessential inflation models, the reheating temperature with the spectral index of scalar perturbations, thereby enabling us to constrain its values. In the second part of this article, we explore various alternatives to address the $H_0$ tension, a discrepancy which indicates a possible revision of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Initially, we establish that quintessential inflation alone cannot mitigate the Hubble tension by solely deviating from the concordance model at low redshifts. The introduction of a phantom fluid, capable of increasing the Hubble rate at the present time, becomes a crucial element in alleviating the Hubble tension, resulting in a deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model only at low redshifts. On a different note, by utilizing quintessential inflation as a source of early dark energy, thereby diminishing the physical size of the sound horizon close to the baryon-photon decoupling redshift, we observe a reduction in the Hubble tension. This alternative avenue, which has the same effect of a cosmological constant changing its scale close to the recombination, sheds light on the nuanced interplay between the quintessential inflation and the Hubble tension, offering a distinct perspective on addressing this cosmological challenge.

          Reheating Dynamics in Inflationary Cosmology: Insights from $\alpha$-Attractor and $\alpha$-Starobinsky Models

 - **Abstract**
 Reheating in inflationary cosmology is essential for understanding the early universe, influencing particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. Crucial quantities defined during the reheating epoc, such as the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reheating temperature $T_{re}$, and the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, affect inflationary observables like the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze two classes of inflationary models: generalized $\alpha$-attractor models and the $\alpha$-Starobinsky generalization. These models, motivated by supergravity and string theory, exhibit attractor behavior, ensuring strong predictions and have been studied extensively before. A salient novelty of this study, compared to previous works, is the inclusion of an analytical expression for the reheating temperature, $T_{\text{re}}$, which makes it a dynamical quantity. This is crucial for determining all the cosmological quantities analyzed in this work. Our results show a universal scaling behavior for a tightly bounded $T_{re}$ in both models. We believe this is the first time that $T_{re}$ is so closely determined. This work complements previous Bayesian and numerical studies by providing detailed numerical and analytical insights into the evolution of cosmological observables and reheating parameters, offering also constraints on inflationary models based on observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of the CO (J=3-2) line emission of the protostellar system HH 212 at $\sim$24 au spatial resolution and compare them to those of the SiO (J=8-7) and SO (J=8-7) line emission reported in the literature. We find that the CO line traces four distinct regions: (1) an outer outflow shell, (2) a rotating wind region between the SiO and CO shells, (3) the shocked and wide-angle inner X-wind inside a SiO shell, and (4) the jet. The origin of the CO outer outflow shell could be associated with the entrained material of the envelope, or an extended disk wind. The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a radius of 9-15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO shell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with and shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the CO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large scale CO shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the inner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots. The CO jet is traced by a chain of knots with roughly equal interval, exhibiting quasi-periodicity, as reported in other jets in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio astronomy observatories, such as the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia, try to limit radio frequency interference to observe incredibly faint astronomical signals. These protective measures include placing observatories in geographically remote locations, the implementation of radio-frequency-interference-free quiet zones, or removal of interference in data processing. In 2018, we set out to explore how necessary radio-quiet zones are, by studying the radio frequency emission around the Observatory and around our local environment in Calgary, Alberta. We studied five well-used radio frequency bands and found the emission to be variable and environment dependent. While the radio frequency environment has changed since then, as a consequence of increased satellite activity and other forms of emission, we present these results as documentation of the past environment with the aim to redo the measurements. Overall, as there is use from both public and private services across the radio spectrum, protective measures at astronomical observatories are essential to reduce radio frequency interference.

 - **Abstract**
 The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, this classical model becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting nonphysical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w}/v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta\leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our modified model naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w<1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our model for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved model offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for ultra-high energy ($E_\nu \geq 10$ PeV) cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos (UHENs) have been conducted by several experiments over the last two decades. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the geographical South Pole, was one of the first two experiments that used radio antennas sensitive to orthogonal polarizations for detection of neutrino-induced Askaryan radiation. ARA comprises five independent autonomous stations, with an additional low threshold phased array merged with station 5, which were deployed at a depth of 100-200 m over the period 2012-2018, corresponding to a total livetime of more than 27 station years. In this article, we present a brief overview of the detector, its detection technique, and discuss a few of its major achievements with a focus on the current status of the array-wide UHEN search. We expect to produce the most sensitive results on the neutrino flux by any existing in-ice neutrino experiment below 1000 EeV energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We presented the first photometric analysis of the V1961 Cyg and V0890 Lyr binary systems. We observed and analyzed these systems at an observatory in France as part of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. We extracted and collected the times of minima from the observations and literature and presented a new ephemeris for each system. Due to the few observations about these systems over the years, both O-C diagrams were fitted linearly. The PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method were used to light curve solutions. The light curve solution required a cold starspot on the hotter component in the V1961 Cyg binary system. We compared and have close agreements between our mass ratios' results from the light curve analysis processes and a new method based on the light curve derivative. We estimated the absolute parameters using an empirical relationship between the semi-major axis and orbital period for contact binary systems. The results show V1961 Cyg and V0890 Lyr are W-type contact binary systems. We displayed stars and systems' positions in the M-L, M-R, and logM_{tot}-logJ_0 diagrams. We also presented a new relationship between mass ratio and luminosity ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 With the ongoing characterisation of the atmospheres of exoplanets by the JWST, we are unveiling a large diversity of planetary atmospheres, both in terms of composition and dynamics. As such, it is necessary to build coherent atmospheric models for exoplanetary atmospheres to study their dynamics in any regime of thickness, stratification and rotation. However, many models only partially include the Coriolis acceleration with only taking into account the local projection of the rotation vector along the vertical direction (this is the so-called "Traditional Approximation of Rotation") and do not accurately model the effects of the rotation when it dominates the stratification. In this contribution, we report the ongoing efforts to take the full Coriolis acceleration into account for the transport of momentum and the mixing of chemicals. First, we show how the horizontal local component of the rotation vector can deeply modifies the instabilities of horizontal sheared flows and the turbulence they can trigger. Next, we show how the interaction between waves and zonal winds can be drastically modified because of the modification of the wave damping or breaking when taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. These works are devoted to improve the parameterization of waves and turbulent processes in global atmospheric models.

 The problem of analytical estimation of the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov timescales of the motion in multiplets of interacting nonlinear resonances is considered. To this end, we elaborate a unified framework, based on the separatrix map theory, which incorporates both an earlier approach for the first fundamental model of perturbed resonance (given by the perturbed pendulum Hamiltonian) and a new one for its second fundamental model (given by the perturbed Andoyer Hamiltonian). Within this framework, new accurate estimates for the Lyapunov timescales of the inner and outer subsystems of the Solar planetary system are presented and discussed.

 We present a comprehensive analysis of the region containing the large smooth patch on comet Tempel 1, focusing on its spectral and morphological characteristics and those of its surroundings. Utilizing observational data from the Deep Impact and Stardust-NExT missions, an updated stereophotoclinometry-based shape model, and numerical simulations, we aim to investigate the origin and evolution of this feature. Our study characterizes the morphological changes between the two mission visits, determining that the smooth patch has a thickness of approximately 25 meters. This patch is embedded in a cliff with an average height of 50 meters and exhibits a lobate U-shape morphology. Our findings support the previously suggested idea that an ice flow phenomenon is compatible with the observations. Moreover, our simulations indicate that a single phenomenon could link both the large and secondary smooth patches and the mass wasting feature observed on the comet's opposite northern face. We propose that a cryovolcano-like event may be responsible for this smooth feature, although more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 With the ever-increasing number of light curve solutions of contact binary systems increasing number of potential bright red nova progenitors are being reported. There remains, however, only one confirmed event. In the present study we undertake a comprehensive review of orbital stability of contact binary systems considering the effects of the stellar internal composition (metallicity) and age on the evolution of the gyration radius and its effect on the instability mass ratio of contact binaries. We find that both metallicity and age have an independent effect on orbital stability with metal poor and older systems being more stable. The combined effects of age and metallicity are quite profound such that for most systems with primaries of solar mass or greater which are halfway or more through the main sequence lifespans have instability mass ratio at levels where the secondary component would be below the hydrogen fusion mass limit. We find that from the currently available solutions we cannot confidently assign any system as unstable. Although we identify 8 potential red nova progenitors all have methodological or astrophysical concerns which lower our confidence in designating any of them as potential merger candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Variations in scaling behavior in the flux and emissions of gravitational lensed quasars can provide valuable information about the dynamics within the sources and their cosmological evolution with time. Here, we study the multifractal behavior of the light curves of 14 lensed quasars with multiple images in the $r$ band, with redshift ranging from 0.657 to 2.730, in the search for potential differences in nonlinearity between the signals of the quasar multiple images. Among these lensed systems, nine present two images, two present three images, and three present four images. To this end, we apply the wavelet transform-based multifractal analysis formalism called Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM). We identify strong multifractal signatures in the light curves of the images of all analyzed lensed quasar systems, independently of the number of images, with a significant difference between the degree of multifractality of all the images and combinations. We have also searched for a possible connection between the degree of multifractality and the characteristic parameters related to the quasar source and the lensing galaxy. These parameters include the Einstein ring radius and the accretion disk size and the characteristic timescales related to microlensing variability. The analysis reveals some apparent trends, pointing to a decrease in the degree of multifractality with the increase of the quasar's source size and timescale. Using a larger sample and following a similar approach, the present study confirms a previous finding for the quasar Q0957+561.

 - **Abstract**
 Future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments are primarily targeting a detection of the primordial $B$-mode polarisation. The faintness of this signal requires exquisite control of systematic effects which may bias the measurements. In this work, we derive requirements on the relative calibration accuracy of the overall polarisation gain ($\Delta g_\nu$) for LiteBIRD experiment, through the application of the blind Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) foreground-cleaning method. We find that minimum variance techniques, as NILC, are less affected by gain calibration uncertainties than a parametric approach, which requires a proper modelling of these instrumental effects. The tightest constraints are obtained for frequency channels where the CMB signal is relatively brighter (166 GHz channel, $\Delta {g}_\nu \approx 0.16 \%$), while, with a parametric approach, the strictest requirements were on foreground-dominated channels. We then propagate gain calibration uncertainties, corresponding to the derived requirements, into all frequency channels simultaneously. We find that the overall impact on the estimated $r$ is lower than the required budget for LiteBIRD by almost a factor $5$. The adopted procedure to derive requirements assumes a simple Galactic model. We therefore assess the robustness of obtained results against more realistic scenarios by injecting the gain calibration uncertainties, according to the requirements, into LiteBIRD simulated maps and assuming intermediate- and high-complexity sky models. In this case, we employ the so-called Multi-Clustering NILC (MC-NILC) foreground-cleaning pipeline and obtain that the impact of gain calibration uncertainties on $r$ is lower than the LiteBIRD gain systematics budget for the intermediate-complexity sky model. For the high-complexity case, instead, it would be necessary to tighten the requirements by a factor $1.8$.

 The symbiotic X-ray binary GX 1+4 possesses a number of peculiar properties that have been studied since the early 1970s. In particular, the orbital period has been a point of debate for many years, until radial velocity measurements were able to settle the debate. These radial velocity findings have so far not been confirmed using X-ray data, even though multiple factors would cause a periodic variation on the same timescale as the orbital period at these energies. Because the orbit of GX 1+4 is eccentric and not seen face-on, changes in the accretion rate and column density along the line of sight could cause a periodic variation in the spin-frequency measurements, X-ray light curves, and hardness ratios of the source. Furthermore, for a high inclination of the orbital plane, the neutron star could be eclipsed by the companion, which would lead to periodic decreases in brightness. We used data from a number of different X-ray telescopes to search directly for periodicity by applying the Lomb-Scargle and epoch-folding approaches to long-term light-curve and spin-frequency measurement data of the source. We support our findings using folded light curves, hardness ratios, and images. We find that our results agree with the radial velocity findings, and we form a self-consistent model that is supported by folded hardness-ratios and light curves. We find that the source is clearly detected in X-rays during the predicted eclipse. Motivated by this absence of an eclipse in the system, we constrain the inclination of the system to $\sim 76^\circ-84^\circ$ and the mass of the neutron star in the system to $\sim1.23M_\odot - 1.45M_\odot$ using the constraints on the red giant mass and surface gravity provided in the literature. Furthermore, we constrain the radius of the red giant to $\sim 60R_\odot - 150R_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim at characterizing the X-ray-to-optical/near-infrared broad-band emission of luminous QSOs in the first Gyr of cosmic evolution to understand whether they exhibit differences compared to the lower-\textit{z} QSO population. Our goal is also to provide for these objects a reliable and uniform catalog of SED fitting derivable properties such as bolometric and monochromatic luminosities, Eddington ratios, dust extinction, strength of the hot dust emission. We characterize the X-ray/UV emission of each QSO using average SEDs from luminous Type 1 sources and calculate bolometric and monochromatic luminosities. Finally we construct a mean SED extending from the X-rays to the NIR bands. We find that the UV-optical emission of these QSOs can be modelled with templates of $z\sim$2 luminous QSOs. We observe that the bolometric luminosities derived adopting some bolometric corrections at 3000 Å ($BC_{3000\textÅ}$) largely used in the literature are slightly overestimated by 0.13 dex as they also include reprocessed IR emission. We estimate a revised value, i.e. $BC_{3000\textÅ}=3.3 $ which can be used for deriving $L_\text{bol}$ in \textit{z} $\geq$ 6 QSOs. A sub-sample of 11 QSOs is provided with rest-frame NIR photometry, showing a broad range of hot dust emission strength, with two sources exhibiting low levels of emission. Despite potential observational biases arising from non-uniform photometric coverage and selection biases, we produce a X-ray-to-NIR mean SED for QSOs at \textit{z} $\gtrsim$ 6, revealing a good match with templates of lower-redshift, luminous QSOs up to the UV-optical range, with a slightly enhanced contribution from hot dust in the NIR.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system with a 48 ms radio pulsar orbiting around an O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, in a highly eccentric ~3.4 yr long orbit. Close to the periastron the system is detected from radio up to the TeV energies due to the interaction of LS 2883 and pulsar's outflows. The observations of last 4 periastra passages taken in 2010-2021 demonstrate periastron to periastron variability at all wavelength, probably linked to the state of the decretion disk. In this paper we present the results of our optical, radio and X-ray observational campaigns on PSR B1259-63 performed in 2024 accompanied with the analysis of the publicly available GeV FERMI/LAT data. We show that this periastron passage was characterised by the early flaring of X-rays before the periastron passage and GeV emission after the periastron passage, which can be explained by a larger size of the decretion disk as supported by the optical observations. The structure of the GeV flare is also in agreement with the disruption of the large dense disk. The possible X-ray/radio correlation was observed only during the post-periastron rise of X-ray and radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel microlensing event search method that differs from either the traditional time domain method, astrometric microlensing, or the parallax microlensing method. Our method assumes that stars with nearly identical "genes" - normalized Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) bear the same luminosity within the intrinsic scatter due to stellar properties. Given a sample of stars with similar normalized SEDs, the outliers in luminosity distribution can be considered microlensing events by excluding other possible variations. In this case, we can select microlensing events from archive data rather than time domain monitoring the sky, which we describe as static microlensing. Following this concept, we collect the data from Gaia DR3 and SDSS DR16 from the northern galactic cap at high galactic latitudes. This area is not preferable for normal microlensing search due to the low stellar density and, therefore, low discovery rate. By applying a similarity search algorithm, we find 5 microlensing candidates in the Galactic halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern astrophysics. However, their classification into repeaters and non-repeaters is challenging. Here, we present the application of the graph theory Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) methodology as an unsupervised classifier of repeaters and non-repeaters FRBs. By constructing MSTs based on various combinations of variables, we identify those that lead to MSTs that exhibit a localized high density of repeaters at each side of the node with the largest betweenness centrality. Comparing the separation power of this methodology against known machine learning methods, and with the random expectation results, we assess the efficiency of the MST-based approach to unravel the physical implications behind the graph pattern. We finally propose a list of potential repeater candidates derived from the analysis using the MST.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST, despite not being designed to observe astrophysical phenomena that vary on rapid time scales, can be an unparalleled tool for such studies. If timing systematics can be controlled, JWST will be able to open up the sub-second infrared timescale regime. Rapid time-domain studies, such as lag measurements in accreting compact objects and Solar System stellar occultations, require both precise inter-frame timing and knowing when a time series begins to an absolute accuracy significantly below 1s. In this work we present two long-duration observations of the deeply eclipsing double white dwarf system ZTF J153932.16+502738.8, which we use as a natural timing calibrator to measure the absolute timing accuracy of JWST's clock. From our two epochs, we measure an average clock accuracy of $0.12\pm0.06$s, implying that JWST can be used for sub-second time-resolution studies down to the $\sim100$ms level, a factor $\sim5$ improvement upon the pre-launch clock accuracy requirement. We also find an asymmetric eclipse profile in the F322W2 band, which we suggest has a physical origin.

          Using Polar Faculae to Determine the Sun's High-Latitude Rotation Rate. I. Techniques and Initial Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from simultaneous observations of many polar faculae. In this experiment, I extracted frames from a movie made previously from flat-fielded images obtained in the 6767 A continuum during February 1997-1998 and used those frames to construct space-time maps from high-latitude slices of the favorably oriented south polar cap. These maps show an array of slanted tracks whose average slope indicates the east-west speed of faculae at that latitude, Ls. When the slopes are measured and plotted as a function of latitude, they show relatively little scatter 0.01-02 km/s from a straight line whose zero-speed extension passes through the Sun's south pole. This means that the speed, v(Ls), and the latitudinal radius, R cos(Ls), approach 0 at the same rate, so that their ratio gives a nearly constant synodic rotation rate 8.6 deg/day surrounding the Sun's south pole. A few measurements of the unfavorably oriented north polar cap are consistent with these measurements near the south pole.

 - **Abstract**
 The worlds of Data Science (including big and/or federated data, machine learning, etc) and Astrophysics started merging almost two decades ago. For instance, around 2005, international initiatives such as the Virtual Observatory framework rose to standardize the way we publish and transfer data, enabling new tools such as VOSA (SED Virtual Observatory Analyzer) to come to existence and remain relevant today. More recently, new facilities like the Vera Rubin Observatory, serve as motivation to develop efficient and extremely fast (very often deep learning based) methodologies in order to fully exploit the informational content of the vast Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) dataset. However, fundamental changes in the way we explore and analyze data cannot permeate in the "astrophysical sociology and idiosyncrasy" without adequate training. In this talk, I will focus on one specific initiative that has been extremely successful and is based on "learning by doing": the La Serena School for Data Science. I will also briefly touch on a different successful approach: a series of schools organized by the Spanish Virtual Observatory. The common denominator among the two kinds of schools is to present the students with real scientific problems that benefit from the concepts / methodologies taught. On the other hand, the demographics targeted by both initiatives vary significantly and can represent examples of two "flavours" to be followed by others.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial oscillatory features in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are sensitive probes of the dynamics of the early Universe and can provide insights beyond the standard inflationary scenario. While these features have been the focus of extensive studies using cosmic microwave background anisotropy data, large-scale structure surveys now provide the opportunity to probe their effects at smaller scales with higher precision. In this paper, we present a complete description of the nonlinear model for primordial oscillatory features in the context of time-sliced perturbation theory extending the results already presented in the literature. We derive analytical expressions including novel contributions such as the mixed term between primordial oscillations and baryon acoustic oscillations, and we also calculate the corrections arising from the specific envelope of the oscillatory pattern, corresponding to a scale-dependent amplitude. These results are compared with N-body simulations using the COLA method and show consistent behaviour across different scales. Although the corrections are found to be small, they represent an important step towards fully characterising the nonlinear imprints of primordial features on the matter power spectrum. Our results offer new predictions for future cosmological surveys that seek to detect these subtle signatures in the matter distribution.

          Evolution of the disky second generation of stars in globular clusters on cosmological timescale

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Many Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations, challenging the traditional view of GCs as single-population systems. It has been suggested that second-generation stars could form in a disk from gas lost by first-generation stars or from external accreted gas. Aims. We investigate how the introduction of a second stellar generation affects mass loss, internal mixing, and rotational properties of GCs in a time-varying Galactic tidal field and different orbital configurations. Methods. We conducted direct N-body simulations of GCs on three types of orbits derived from the observed Milky Way GCs. We evolved the clusters for 8 Gyr in the time-varying Galactic potential of the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological simulation. After 2 Gyr, we introduced a second stellar generation, comprising 5% of the initial mass of the first generation, as a flattened disk of stars. For comparison, we ran control simulations using a static Galactic potential and isolated clusters. Results. We present the mass loss, structural evolution, and kinematic properties of GCs with two stellar generations, focusing on tidal mass, half-mass radii, velocity distributions, and angular momentum. Conclusions. Our results show that the mass loss of GCs depends primarily on their orbital parameters, with tighter orbits leading to higher mass loss. The Galaxy's growth resulted in tighter orbits, meaning GCs lost less mass than if its mass had always been constant. The initially flattened second-generation disk became nearly spherical within one relaxation time. However, whether its distinct rotational signature was retained depends on the orbit: for the long radial orbit, it vanished quickly; for the tube orbit, it lasted several Gyr; but for the circular orbit, rotation persisted until the present day

          Prospects for optical detections from binary neutron star mergers with the next-generation multi-messenger observatories

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer, will observe binary neutron star (BNS) mergers across cosmic history, providing precise parameter estimates for the closest ones. Innovative wide-field observatories, like the Vera Rubin Observatory, will quickly cover large portions of the sky with unprecedented sensitivity to detect faint transients. This study aims to assess the prospects for detecting optical emissions from BNS mergers with next-generation detectors, considering how uncertainties in neutron star (NS) population properties and microphysics may affect detection rates. Starting from BNS merger populations exploiting different NS mass distributions and equations of state (EOSs), we model the GW and kilonova (KN) signals based on source properties. We model KNe ejecta through numerical-relativity informed fits, considering the effect of prompt collapse of the remnant to black hole and new fitting formulas appropriate for more massive BNS systems, like GW190425. We include optical afterglow emission from relativistic jets consistent with observed short gamma-ray bursts. We evaluate the detected mergers and the source parameter estimations for different geometries of ET, operating alone or in a network of current or next-generation GW detectors. Finally, we estimate the number of detected optical signals simulating realistic observational strategies by the Rubin Observatory. ET as a single observatory will enable the detection of about ten to a hundred KNe per year by the Rubin Observatory. This improves by a factor of $\sim 10$ already when operating in the network with current GW detectors. Detection rate uncertainties are dominated by the poorly constrained local BNS merger rate, and depend to a lesser extent on the NS mass distribution and EOS.

 - **Abstract**
 Whether considering rare astrophysical events on cosmological scales or unresolved stellar populations, accurate models must account for the integrated contribution from the entire history of star formation upon which that population is built. Here, we describe the second version of POSYDON, an open-source binary population synthesis code based on extensive grids of detailed binary evolution models computed using the MESA code, which follows both stars' structures as a binary system evolves through its complete evolution from the zero-age main sequence, through multiple phases of mass transfer and supernovae, to their death as compact objects. To generate synthetic binary populations, POSYDON uses advanced methods to interpolate between our large, densely spaced grids of simulated binaries. In our updated version of POSYDON, we account for the evolution of stellar binaries across a cosmological range of metallicities, extending from $10^{-4}\,Z_{\odot}$ to $2\,Z_{\odot}$, including grids specifically focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds ($0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ and $0.45\,Z_{\odot}$). In addition to describing our model grids and detailing our methodology, we outline several improvements to POSYDON. These include the incorporation of single stars in stellar populations, a treatment for stellar mergers, and a careful modeling of "reverse-mass transferring" binaries, in which an once-accreting star later becomes a donor star. Our simulations are focused on binaries with at least one high-mass component, such as those that host neutron stars and black holes, and we provide post-processing methods to account for the cosmological evolution of metallicity and star formation as well as rate calculations for gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Model mis-specification (e.g. the presence of outliers) is commonly encountered in astronomical analyses, often requiring the use of ad hoc algorithms (e.g. sigma-clipping). We develop and implement a generic Bayesian approach to linear regression, based on Student's t-distributions, that is robust to outliers and mis-specification of the noise model. Our method is validated using simulated datasets with various degrees of model mis-specification; the derived constraints are shown to be systematically less biased than those from a similar model using normal distributions. We demonstrate that, for a dataset without outliers, a worst-case inference using t-distributions would give unbiased results with $\lesssim\!10$ per cent increase in the reported parameter uncertainties. We also compare with existing analyses of real-world datasets, finding qualitatively different results where normal distributions have been used and agreement where more robust methods have been applied. A Python implementation of this model, t-cup, is made available for others to use.
