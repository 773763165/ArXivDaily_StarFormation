#### Neutrino anisotropy as a probe of extreme astrophysical accelerators
 - **Authors:** Marco Stein Muzio, Noémie Globus
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 We consider how the cutoff of the ultrahigh energy neutrino spectrum introduces an effective neutrino horizon, allowing for future neutrino detectors to measure an anisotropy in neutrino arrival directions driven by the local large-scale structure. We show that measurement of the level of this anisotropy along with features of the neutrino spectrum will allow for a measurement of the evolution of ultrahigh energy neutrino sources, which are expected to also be the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 and TNG50 dark matter (DM)-only simulations from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to conduct an updated survey of halo figure rotation in the presence of baryons. We develop a novel methodology to detect coherent figure rotation about an arbitrary axis and for arbitrary durations and apply it to a catalog of 1,577 DM halos from the DM-only run and 1,396 DM halos from the DM+baryons (DM+B) run that are free of major mergers. Figure rotation was detected in $94\%$ of DM-only halos and $82\%$ of the DM+B halos. The pattern speeds of rotations lasting $\gtrsim 1h^{-1}$ Gyr were log-normally distributed with medians of $0.25~h$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ for DM-only in agreement with past results, but $14\%$ higher at $0.29~h$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ in the DM+B halos. We find that rotation axes are typically aligned with the halo minor or major axis, in $57\%$ of DM-only halos and in $62\%$ of DM+B halos. The remaining rotation axes were not strongly aligned with any principal axis but typically lay in the plane containing the halo minor and major axes. Longer-lived rotations showed greater alignment with the halo minor axis in both simulations. Our results show that in the presence of baryons, figure rotation is marginally less common, shorter-lived, faster, and better aligned with the minor axis than in DM-only halos. This updated understanding will be consequential for future efforts to constrain figure rotation in the Milky Way dark halo using the morphology and kinematics of tidal streams.
#### Cross-correlation of the thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich and CMB lensing  signals in Planck PR4 data with robust CIB decontamination

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16260
 - **Abstract**
 We use the full-mission Planck PR4 data to measure the CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$)--thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ, $y$) cross-correlation, $C_\ell^{y\kappa}$. This is only the second measurement to date of this signal, following Hill \& Spergel (2014). We perform the measurement using foreground-cleaned tSZ maps built from the PR4 frequency maps via a tailored needlet internal linear combination (NILC) code in our companion paper, in combination with the Planck PR4 $\kappa$ maps and various systematic-mitigated PR3 $\kappa$ maps. A serious systematic is the residual cosmic infrared background (CIB) in the tSZ map, as the high CIB--$\kappa$ correlation can significantly bias the inferred tSZ--$\kappa$ cross-correlation. We mitigate this by deprojecting the CIB in our NILC, using a moment-deprojection approach to avoid leakage due to incorrect modelling of the CIB frequency dependence. We validate our method on mm-sky simulations. We fit a theoretical halo model to our measurement, finding a best-fit amplitude of $A=0.82\pm0.21$ (for the highest signal-to-noise PR4 $\kappa$ map) or $A=0.56\pm0.24$ (for a PR3 $\kappa$ map built from a tSZ-deprojected CMB map), indicating that the data are consistent with our model within $\sim 1$-$2\sigma$. Although our error bars are similar to those of the 2014 measurement, our method is significantly more robust to CIB contamination. Our moment-deprojection approach lays the foundation for future measurements of this signal with higher signal-to-noise maps from ground-based telescopes, which will precisely probe the astrophysics of the intracluster medium of galaxy groups and clusters in the intermediate-mass ($M\sim 10^{13} -10^{14} h^{-1} M_\odot$), high-$z$ ($z<\sim1.5$, c.f. $z<\sim0.8$ for the tSZ auto-power signal) regime, as well as CIB-decontaminated measurements of tSZ cross-correlations with other large-scale structure probes.
#### The Missing Link: Testing Galactic Chemical Evolution Models with the  First Multi-Isotopic Abundances in Solar Twin Stars
 - **Authors:** David R. Coria, Ian J. M. Crossfield, Joshua Lothringer, Becky Flores, Nikos Prantzos, Richard Freedman

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first isotopic abundances of both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O in solar twin stars and test the results against several galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models with different nucleosynthesis prescriptions. First, we compare M-band spectra from IRTF/iSHELL to synthetic spectra generated from custom solar atmosphere models using the PHOENIX atmosphere code. Next, we compare our calculated abundances to GCE models that consider isotopic yields from massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and fast-rotating stars. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios determined for this sample of solar twins are consistent with predictions from the selected GCE models; however, the $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O ratios tentatively contradict these predictions. This project constitutes the first in a stellar chemical abundance series seeking to: (1) support the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as it characterizes exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and biosignatures by providing host star abundances (2) identify how unexplored stellar abundances reveal the process of galactic chemical evolution and correlate with star formation, interior, age, metallicity, and activity; and (3) provide improved stellar ages using stellar abundance measurements. By measuring elemental and isotopic abundances in a variety of stars, we not only supply refined host star parameters, but also provide the necessary foundations for complementary exoplanet characterization studies and ultimately contribute to the exploration of galactic, stellar, and planetary origins and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Leo T ($M_V = -8.0$) is both the faintest and the least massive galaxy known to contain neutral gas and to display signs of recent star formation. We analyse photometry and stellar spectra to identify member stars and to better understand the overall dynamics and stellar content of the galaxy and to compare the properties of its young and old stars. We use data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the VLT. We supplement this information with spectroscopic data from the literature and with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry. Our analysis reveals two distinct populations of stars in Leo T. The first population, with an age of $\lesssim 500~\mathrm{Myr}$, includes three emission-line Be stars comprising 15% of the total number of young stars. The second population of stars is much older, with ages ranging from $>5~\mathrm{Gyr}$ to as high as $10~\mathrm{Gyr}$. We combine MUSE data with literature data to obtain an overall velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v} = 7.07^{+1.29}_{-1.12}~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ for Leo T. When we divide the sample of stars into young and old populations, we find that they have distinct kinematics. Specifically, the young population has a velocity dispersion of $2.31^{+2.68}_{-1.65}\,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, contrasting with that of the old population, of $8.14^{+1.66}_{-1.38}\,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The fact that the kinematics of the cold neutral gas is in good agreement with the kinematics of the young population suggests that the recent star formation in Leo T is linked with the cold neutral gas. We assess the existence of extended emission-line regions and find none to a surface brightness limit of~$< 1\times 10^{-20}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$ which corresponds to an upper limit on star formation of $\sim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{M_\odot~yr^{-1}~pc^{-2}}$, implying that the star formation in Leo T has ended.
#### Goodbye to Chi-by-Eye: A Bayesian Analysis of Photometric Binaries in  Six Open Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Using Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS and 2MASS data, we self-consistently define the cluster parameters and binary demographics for the open clusters (OCs) NGC 2168 (M35), NGC 7789, NGC 6819, NGC 2682 (M67), NGC 188, and NGC 6791. These clusters span in age from ~200 Myr (NGC 2168) to more than ~8 Gyr (NGC 6791) and have all been extensively studied in the literature. We use the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution software suite (BASE-9) to derive the age, distance, reddening, metallicity, binary fraction, and binary mass-ratio posterior distributions for each cluster. We perform a careful analysis of our completeness and also compare our results to previous spectroscopic surveys. For our sample of main-sequence stars with masses between 0.6 - 1 M_Sun, we find that these OCs have similar binary fractions that are also broadly consistent with the field multiplicity fraction. Within the clusters, the binary fraction increases dramatically toward the cluster centers, likely a result of mass segregation. Furthermore nearly all clusters show evidence of mass segregation within the single and binary populations, respectively. The OC binary fraction increases significantly with cluster age in our sample, possibly due to a combination of mass-segregation and cluster dissolution processes. We also find a hint of an anti-correlation between binary fraction and cluster central density as well as total cluster mass, possibly due to an increasing frequency of higher energy close stellar encounters that inhibit long-period binary survival and/or formation.

 - **Abstract**
 MoonBEAM is a SmallSat concept placed in cislunar orbit developed to study the progenitors and multimessenger/multiwavelength signals of transient relativistic jets and outflows and determine the conditions that lead to the launching of a transient relativistic jet. The advantage of MoonBEAM is the instantaneous all-sky coverage due to its orbit, which maximizes the gamma-raytransient observations and provides upperlimits for non-detections. Earth blockage and detector downtime from the high particle activity in the South Atlantic Anomaly region prevent gamma-ray observatories in low Earth orbit from surveying the entire sky at a given time. In addition, the long baseline provided from a cislunar orbit allows MoonBEAM to constrain the localization annulus when combined with a gamma-ray instrument in low Earth orbit utilizing the timing triangulation technique. We present the scientific performance of MoonBEAM including the expected effective area, localization ability and duty cycle. MoonBEAM provides many advantages to the gamma-ray and gravitational-wave follow up community by reducing the search region needed to identify the afterglow and kilanova emission. In addition, the all-sky coverage will provide insight into the conditions that lead to a successful relativistic jet, instead of a shock breakout event, or a completely failed jet in the case of core collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The detectors in the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are arsenic-21 doped silicon impurity band conduction (Si:As IBC) devices and are direct descendants of the Spitzer IRAC22 long wavelength arrays (channels 3 and 4). With appropriate data processing, they can provide excellent per-23 formance. In this paper we discuss the various non-ideal behaviors of these detectors that need to be addressed24 to realize their potential. We have developed a set of algorithms toward this goal, building on experience with25 previous similar detector arrays. The MIRI-specific stage 1 pipeline algorithms, of a three stage JWST cali-26 bration pipeline, were developed using pre-flight tests on the flight detectors and flight spares and have been27 refined using flight data. This paper describes these algorithms, which are included in the first stage of the28 JWST Calibration Pipeline for the MIRI instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter halos can enter a phase of gravothermal core--collapse in the presence of self-interactions. This phase that follows a core--expansion phase is thought to be subdominant due to the long time-scales involved. However, it has been shown that the collapse can be accelerated in tidal environments particularly for halos that are centrally concentrated. Cosmological simulations in $\Lambda$CDM give us the full distribution of satellite orbits and halo profiles in the universe. We use properties of the orbits and profiles of subhalos from simulations to estimate the fraction of the subhalos in different host halo environments, ranging from the Large Magellanic cloud(LMC)--like hosts to clusters, that are in the core--collapse phase. We use fluid simulations of self--interacting dark matter (SIDM) to evolve subhalos in their hosts including the effect of tidal truncation at the time of their pericenter crossing. We find that for parameters that allow the interaction cross-section to be high at dwarf scales, at least $10~\%$ of all subhalos are expected to have intrinsically collapsed within Hubble time up to the group mass host scales. This fraction increases significantly, becoming at least 20$\%$ when tidal interactions are considered. To identify these objects we find that we either need to measure their densities at very small radial scales, where the subhalos show a bimodal distribution of densities, or alternatively we need to measure the slopes of their inner density profiles near the scale radius, which are much steeper than NFW slopes expected in cold dark matter halos. Current measurements of central slopes of classical dwarfs do not show a preference for collapsed objects, however this is consistent with an SIDM scenario where the classical dwarfs are expected to be in a cored phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new procedure for time calibration of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope. The track reconstruction quality depends on accurate measurements of arrival times of Cherenkov photons. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a high precision in time calibration. For that purpose, in addition to other calibration methods, we employ a new procedure using atmospheric muons reconstructed in a single-cluster mode. The method is based on iterative determination of effective time offsets for each optical module. This paper focuses on the results of the iterative reconstruction procedure with time offsets from the previous iteration and the verification of the method developed. The theoretical muon calibration precision is estimated to be around 1.5-1.6ns.
#### DECODE: DilatEd COnvolutional neural network for Detecting  Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16422
 - **Abstract**
 The detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is intricate due to their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations, thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5 detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for future space-based gravitational wave data analyses.
#### Peculiar orbital characteristics of Earth quasi-satellite 469219  Kamo`oalewa: implications for the Yarkovsky detection and orbital uncertainty  propagation

 - **Abstract**
 469219 Kamo`oalewa is selected as one of the primary targets of Tianwen-2 mission, which is currently believed to be the most stable quasi-satellite of Earth. Here we derive a weak detection of the Yarkovsky effect for Kamo`oalewa, giving $A_2 = -1.075\pm0.447\times 10^{-13} \rm{au/d}^2$, with the available ground-based optical observations from Minor Planet Center and a relatively conservative weighting scheme. Due to the quasi-satellite resonance with Earth, we show that the detection of Yarkovsky effect by orbital fitting with astrometric observations becomes difficult as its orbital drift shows a slow oscillatory growth resulting from the Yarkovsky effect. In addition, we extensively explore the characteristics of orbital uncertainty propagation and find that the positional uncertainty mainly arises from the geocentric radial direction in 2010-2020, and then concentrates in the heliocentric transverse direction in 2020-2030. Furthermore, the heliocentric transverse uncertainty is clearly monthly dependent, which can arrive at a minimum around January and a maximum around July as the orbit moves towards the leading and trailing edges, respectively, in 2025-2027. Finally, we investigate a long-term uncertainty propagation in the quasi-satellite regime, implying that the quasi-satellite resonance with Earth may play a crucial role in constraining the increase of uncertainty over time. Such interesting feature further implies that the orbital precision of Kamo`oalewa is relatively stable at its quasi-satellite phase, which may also be true for other quasi-satellites of Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear symmetry energy and its behaviour with density has been recently evaluated with enhanced value by PREX-2 experiment. This new values enables direct Urca neutrino emission process to be functioning in the dense matter inside neutron stars. With this new outlook we study the cooling rate of canonical mass neutron stars and compare with available observational cooling data. We find most of the isolated neutron star thermal profile is compatible with the cooling of canonical mass star including superfluidity suppression.
#### Gravitational anomaly detection using a satellite constellation:  Analysis and simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the utility of a constellation of four satellites in heliocentric orbit, equipped with accurate means to measure intersatellite ranges, round-trip times and phases of signals coherently retransmitted between members of the constellation. Our goal is to reconstruct the measured trace of the gravitational gradient tensor as accurately as possible. Intersatellite ranges alone are not sufficient for its determination, as they do not account for any rotation of the satellite constellation, which introduces fictitious forces and accelerations. However, measuring signal round-trip time differences among the satellites supplies the necessary observables to estimate, and subtract, the effects of rotation. Utilizing, in addition, the approximate distance and direction from the Sun, it is possible to approach an accuracy of $10^{-24}~{\rm s}^{-2}$ for a constellation with typical intersatellite distances of 1,000 km in an orbit with a 1 astronomical unit semi-major axis. This is deemed sufficient to detect the presence of a galileonic modification of the solar gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of muons in an air shower is a strong indicator of the mass of the primary particle and increases with a small power of the cosmic ray mass by the $\beta$-exponent, $N_{\mu} \sim A^{(1-\beta)}$. This behaviour can be explained in terms of the Heitler-Matthews model of hadronic air showers. In this paper, we present a method for calculating $\beta$ from the Heitler-Matthews model. The method has been successfully verified with a series of simulated events observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory at $10^{19}$ eV. To follow real measurements of the mass composition at this energy, the generated sample consists of a certain fraction of events produced with p, He, N and Fe primary energies. Since hadronic interactions at the highest energies can differ from those observed at energies reached by terrestrial accelerators, we generate a mock data set with $\beta =0.92$ (the canonical value) and $\beta =0.96$ (a more exotic scenario). The method can be applied to measured events to determine the muon signal for each primary particle as well as the muon scaling factor and the $\beta$-exponent. Determining the $\beta$-exponent can effectively constrain the parameters that govern hadronic interactions and help solve the so-called muon problem, where hadronic interaction models predict too few muons relative to observed events. In this paper, we lay the foundation for the future analysis of measured data from the Pierre Auger Observatory with a simulation study.
#### Constraints on the dust size distributions in the HD 163296 disk from  the difference of the apparent dust ring widths between two ALMA Bands

 - **Abstract**
 The dust size in protoplanetary disks is a crucial parameter for understanding planet formation, while the observational constraints on dust size distribution have large uncertainties. In this study, we present a new method to constrain the dust size distribution from the dust spatial distribution, utilizing the fact that larger dust grains are more spatially localized. We analyze the ALMA Band 6 (1.25 mm) and Band 4 (2.14 mm) high-resolution images and constrain the dust size distribution in the two rings of the HD 163296 disk. We find that the outer ring at 100 au appears narrower at the longer wavelengths, while the inner ring at 67 au appears to have similar widths across the two wavelengths. We model dust rings trapped at gas pressure maxima, where the dust grains follow a power-law size distribution, and the dust grains of a specific size follow a Gaussian spatial distribution with the width depending on the grain size. By comparing the observations with the models, we constrain the maximum dust size $a_{\mathrm{max}}$ and the exponent of the dust size distribution $p$. We constrain that $0.9 \ \mathrm{mm} < a_{\mathrm{max}} < 5 \ \mathrm{mm}$ and $p < 3.3$ in the inner ring, and $a_{\mathrm{max}} > 3 \times 10^1 \ \mathrm{mm}$ and $3.4 < p < 3.7$ in the outer ring. The larger maximum dust size in the outer ring implies a spatial dependency in dust growth, potentially influencing the formation location of the planetesimals. We further discuss the turbulence strength $\alpha$ derived from the constrained dust spatial distribution, assuming equilibrium between turbulent diffusion and accumulation of dust grains.
#### Seven hints that early-time new physics alone is not sufficient to solve  the Hubble tension

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension has now grown to a level of significance which can no longer be ignored and calls for a solution which, despite a huge number of attempts, has so far eluded us. Significant efforts in the literature have focused on early-time modifications of $\Lambda$CDM, introducing new physics operating prior to recombination and reducing the sound horizon. In this opinion paper I argue that early-time new physics alone will always fall short of fully solving the Hubble tension. I base my arguments on seven independent hints, related to 1) the ages of the oldest astrophysical objects, 2) considerations on the sound horizon-Hubble constant degeneracy directions in cosmological data, 3) the important role of cosmic chronometers, 4) a number of ``descending trends'' observed in a wide variety of low-redshift datasets, 5) the early integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect as an early-time consistency test of $\Lambda$CDM, 6) early-Universe physics insensitive and uncalibrated cosmic standard constraints on the matter density, and finally 7) equality wavenumber-based constraints on the Hubble constant from galaxy power spectrum measurements. I argue that a promising way forward should ultimately involve a combination of early- and late-time (but non-local -- in a cosmological sense, i.e. at high redshift) new physics, as well as local (i.e. at $z \sim 0$) new physics, and I conclude by providing reflections with regards to potentially interesting models which may also help with the $S_8$ tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Geminga is an enigmatic radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar located at a mere 250 pc distance from Earth. Extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission around the pulsar has been detected by multiple water Cherenkov detector based instruments. However, the detection of extended TeV gamma-ray emission around the Geminga pulsar has proven challenging for IACTs due to the angular scale exceeding the typical field-of-view. By detailed studies of background estimation techniques and characterising systematic effects, a detection of highly extended TeV gamma-ray emission could be confirmed by the H.E.S.S. IACT array. Building on the previously announced detection, in this contribution we further characterise the emission and apply an electron diffusion model to the combined gamma-ray data from the H.E.S.S. and HAWC experiments, as well as X-ray data from XMM-Newton.
#### On the nature of the energy-dependent morphology of the composite  multi-TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1702-420

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1702-420 is a multi-TeV gamma-ray source with an unusual energy-dependent morphology. The recent H.E.S.S. observations suggest that the emission is well described by a combination of point-like HESS J1702-420A (dominating at highest energies, $\gtrsim$ 30 TeV ) and diffuse ($\sim$ 0.3$^\circ$) HESS J1702-420B (dominating below $\lesssim$ 5TeV) sources with very hard (${\Gamma} \sim 1.5$) and soft (${\Gamma}$ ~2.6) power-law spectra, respectively. Here we propose a model which postulates that the proton accelerator is located at the position of HESS J1702-420A and is embedded into a dense molecular cloud that coincides with HESS J1702-420B. In the proposed model, the VHE radiation of HESS J1702-420 is explained by the pion-decay emission from the continuously injected relativistic protons propagating through a dense cloud. The energy-dependent morphology is defined by the diffusive nature of the low-energy protons propagation, transiting sharply to (quasi) ballistic propagation at higher energies. Adopting strong energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D \propto E^\beta$ with $\beta \geq 1$, we argue that HESS J1702-420 as the system of two gamma-ray sources is the result of the propagation effect. Protons injected by a single accelerator at the rate $Q_0 \simeq 10^{38} \, (n_0/100 \, \rm cm^{-3})^{-1}\, (d/ \, 0.25\,kpc)^{-1} \rm erg/s$ can reasonably reproduce the morphology and fluxes of two gamma-ray components.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of non-zero polarization can be used to infer the presence of departures from spherical symmetry in supernovae (SNe). The origin of the majority of the intrinsic polarization observed in SNe is in electron scattering, which induces a wavelength-independent continuum polarization that is generally observed to be low (<1%) for all SN types. The key indicator of asymmetry in SNe is the polarization observed across spectral lines, in particular the characteristic ``inverse P Cygni'' profile. The results of a suite of 900 Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations are presented here. These simulations cover a range of possible axisymmetric structures (including unipolar, bipolar and equatorial enhancements) for the line forming region of the Ca II infrared triplet. Using a Variational Autoencoder, 7 key latent parameters are learned that describe the relationship between Stokes I and Stokes q, under the assumption of an axially symmetric line forming region and resonant scattering. Likelihood-free inference techniques are used to invert the Stokes I and q line profiles, in the latent space, to derive the underlying geometries. For axially symmetric structures, that yield an observable ``dominant axis'' on the Stokes $q-u$ plane, we propose the existence of a geometry ``conjugate" (which is indistinguishable under a rotation of $\pi /2$). Using this machine learning infrastructure, we attempt to identify possible geometries associated with spectropolarimetric observations of the Type Ib SN 2017gax.

 - **Abstract**
 A list of candidates for \textit{supermassive binary black holes} (SMBBHs), compiled from available data on the variability in the optical range and the shape of the emission spectrum, is analysed. An artificial neural network is constructed to estimate the radiation flux at 240~GHz. For those candidate SMBBH for which the network building procedure was feasible, the criterion of the possibility of observing the source at the \textit{Millimetron Space Observatory} (MSO) was tested. The result is presented as a table of 17 candidate SMBBHs. Confirmation (or refutation) of the duality of these objects by means of observational data which could be commited on a space-ground interferometer with parameters similar to those of the MSO will be an important milestone in the development of the theory of galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 With interstellar mission concepts now being under study by various space agencies and institutions, a feasible and worthy interstellar precursor mission concept will be key to the success of the long shot. Here we investigate interstellar-bound trajectories of solar sails made of the ultra-light material aerographite, known for its low density (0.18 kg m$^{-3}$) and high absorptivity ($\mathcal{A}{\sim}1$), enabling remarkable solar irradiation-based acceleration. Payloads of up to 1 kg can swiftly traverse the solar system and the regions beyond. Our simulations consider various launch scenarios from a polar orbit around the Earth with direct outbound trajectories and Sun diver launches with subsequent outward acceleration. Utilizing the poliastro Python library, we calculate positions, velocities, and accelerations for a 1 kg spacecraft (including 720 g aerographite mass) with 10$^4$ m$^2$ of cross-sectional area, corresponding to a 56 m radius. A direct outward Mars transfer yields 65 km s$^{-1}$ in 26 d. The inward Mars transfer, with a sail deployment at a minimum distance of 0.6 AU, achieves 118 km s$^{-1}$ in 126 d. Transfer times and velocities vary due to the Earth-Mars constellation and initial injection trajectory. The direct interstellar trajectory peaks at 109 km s$^{-1}$, reaching interstellar space in 5.3 yr defined by the heliopause at 120 AU. Alternatively, the initial Sun dive to 0.6 AU provides 148 km s$^{-1}$ of escape velocity, reaching the heliopause in 4.2 yr. Values differ based on the minimum distance to the Sun. Presented concepts enable swift Mars flybys and interstellar space exploration. For delivery missions of sub-kg payloads, the deceleration remains a challenge.

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1813-178 is one of the brightest sources detected during the first HESS Galactic Plane survey. The compact source, also detected by MAGIC, is believed to be a pulsar wind nebula powered by one of the most powerful pulsars known in the Galaxy, PSR J1813-1749 with a spin-down luminosity of $\dot{\mathrm{E}} = 5.6 \cdot 10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. With its extreme physical properties, as well as the pulsar's young age of 5.6 kyrs, the $\gamma$-rays detected in this region allow us to study the evolution of a highly atypical system. Previous studies of the region in the GeV energy range show emission extended beyond the size of the compact H.E.S.S. source. Using the archival H.E.S.S. data with improved background methods, we perform a detailed morphological and spectral analysis of the region. Additionally to the compact, bright emission component, we find significantly extended emission, whose position is coincident with HESS J1813-178. We reanalyse the region in GeV and derive a joint-model in order to find a continuous description of the emission in the region from GeV to TeV. Using the results derived in this analysis, as well as X-ray and radio data of the region, we perform multi-wavelength spectral modeling. Possible hadronic or leptonic origins of the $\gamma$-ray emission are investigated, and the diffusion parameters necessary to explain the extended emission are examined.

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has captured the most detailed and sharpest infrared images ever taken of the inner region of the Orion Nebula, the nearest massive star formation region, and a prototypical highly irradiated dense photo-dissociation region (PDR). We investigate the fundamental interaction of far-ultraviolet photons with molecular clouds. The transitions across the ionization front (IF), dissociation front (DF), and the molecular cloud are studied at high-angular resolution. These transitions are relevant to understanding the effects of radiative feedback from massive stars and the dominant physical and chemical processes that lead to the IR emission that JWST will detect in many Galactic and extragalactic environments. Due to the proximity of the Orion Nebula and the unprecedented angular resolution of JWST, these data reveal that the molecular cloud borders are hyper structured at small angular scales of 0.1-1" (0.0002-0.002 pc or 40-400 au at 414 pc). A diverse set of features are observed such as ridges, waves, globules and photoevaporated protoplanetary disks. At the PDR atomic to molecular transition, several bright features are detected that are associated with the highly irradiated surroundings of the dense molecular condensations and embedded young star. Toward the Orion Bar PDR, a highly sculpted interface is detected with sharp edges and density increases near the IF and DF. This was predicted by previous modeling studies, but the fronts were unresolved in most tracers. A complex, structured, and folded DF surface was traced by the H2 lines. This dataset was used to revisit the commonly adopted 2D PDR structure of the Orion Bar. JWST provides us with a complete view of the PDR, all the way from the PDR edge to the substructured dense region, and this allowed us to determine, in detail, where the emission of the atomic and molecular lines, aromatic bands, and dust originate.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Mid-infrared observations of photodissociation regions (PDRs) are dominated by strong emission features called aromatic infrared bands (AIBs). The most prominent AIBs are found at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 $\mu$m. The most sensitive, highest-resolution infrared spectral imaging data ever taken of the prototypical PDR, the Orion Bar, have been captured by JWST. We provide an inventory of the AIBs found in the Orion Bar, along with mid-IR template spectra from five distinct regions in the Bar: the molecular PDR, the atomic PDR, and the HII region. We use JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the JWST Early Release Science Program, PDRs4All (ID: 1288). We extract five template spectra to represent the morphology and environment of the Orion Bar PDR. The superb sensitivity and the spectral and spatial resolution of these JWST observations reveal many details of the AIB emission and enable an improved characterization of their detailed profile shapes and sub-components. While the spectra are dominated by the well-known AIBs at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2, and 12.7 $\mu$m, a wealth of weaker features and sub-components are present. We report trends in the widths and relative strengths of AIBs across the five template spectra. These trends yield valuable insight into the photochemical evolution of PAHs, such as the evolution responsible for the shift of 11.2 $\mu$m AIB emission from class B$_{11.2}$ in the molecular PDR to class A$_{11.2}$ in the PDR surface layers. This photochemical evolution is driven by the increased importance of FUV processing in the PDR surface layers, resulting in a "weeding out" of the weakest links of the PAH family in these layers. For now, these JWST observations are consistent with a model in which the underlying PAH family is composed of a few species: the so-called 'grandPAHs'.
#### Search for the gamma-ray spectral lines with the DAMPE and the Fermi-LAT  observations

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly interacting massive particles, as a major candidate of dark matter (DM), may directly annihilate or decay into high-energy photons, producing monochromatic spectral lines in the gamma-ray band. These spectral lines, if detected, are smoking-gun signatures for the existence of new physics. Using the 5 years of DAMPE and 13 years of Fermi-LAT data, we search for line-like signals in the energy range of 3 GeV to 1 TeV from the Galactic halo. Different regions of interest are considered to accommodate different DM density profiles. We do not find any significant line structure, and the previously reported line-like feature at $\sim$133 GeV is also not detected in our analysis. Adopting a local DM density of $\rho_{\rm local}=0.4\,{\rm GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, we derive 95% confidence level constraints on the velocity-averaged cross-section of $\langle{\sigma v}\rangle_{\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and the decay lifetime of $\tau_{\gamma\nu} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{29}\,{\rm s}$ at 100 GeV, achieving the strongest constraints to date for the line energies of 6-660 GeV. The improvement stems from the longer Fermi-LAT data set used and the inclusion of DAMPE data in the analysis. The simultaneous use of two independent data sets could also reduce the systematic uncertainty of the search.

 - **Abstract**
 This study uses multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to study the radio emission from 10 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and four radio-loud quasars (RLQs). The diverse morphologies, radio spectra, and brightness temperatures observed in the VLBI images of these RQQs, together with the variability in their GHz spectra and VLBI flux densities, shed light on the origins of their nuclear radio emission. The total radio emission of RQQs appears to originate from non-thermal synchrotron radiation due to a combination of active galactic nuclei and star formation activities. However, our data suggest that the VLBI-detected radio emission from these RQQs is primarily associated with compact jets or corona, with extended emissions such as star formation and large-scale jets being resolved by the high resolution of the VLBI images. Wind emission models are not in complete agreement the VLBI observations. Unlike RLQs, where the parsec-scale radio emission is dominated by a relativistically boosted core, the radio cores of RQQs are either not dominant or are mixed with significant jet emission. RQQs with compact cores or core-jet structures typically have more pronounced variability, with flat or inverted spectra, whereas jet-dominated RQQs have steep spectra and unremarkable variability. Future high-resolution observations of more RQQs could help to determine the fraction of different emission sources and their associated physical mechanisms.
#### The MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey II. The eccentric double neutron  star system PSR J1208-5936 and a neutron star merger rate update

 - **Abstract**
 The MMGPS-L is the most sensitive pulsar survey in the Southern Hemisphere. We present a follow-up study of one of these new discoveries, PSR J1208-5936, a 28.71-ms recycled pulsar in a double neutron star system with an orbital period of Pb=0.632 days and an eccentricity of e=0.348. Through timing of almost one year of observations, we detected the relativistic advance of periastron (0.918(1) deg/yr), resulting in a total system mass of Mt=2.586(5) Mo. We also achieved low-significance constraints on the amplitude of the Einstein delay and Shapiro delay, in turn yielding constraints on the pulsar mass (Mp=1.26(+0.13/-0.25) Mo), the companion mass (Mc=1.32(+0.25/-0.13) Mo, and the inclination angle (i=57(2) degrees). This system is highly eccentric compared to other Galactic field double neutron stars with similar periods, possibly hinting at a larger-than-usual supernova kick during the formation of the second-born neutron star. The binary will merge within 7.2(2) Gyr due to the emission of gravitational waves. With the improved sensitivity of the MMGPS-L, we updated the Milky Way neutron star merger rate to be 25(+19/-9) Myr$^{-1}$ within 90% credible intervals, which is lower than previous studies based on known Galactic binaries owing to the lack of further detections despite the highly sensitive nature of the survey. This implies a local cosmic neutron star merger rate of 293(+222/-103} Gpc/yr, consistent with LIGO and Virgo O3 observations. With this, we predict the observation of 10(+8/-4) neutron star merger events during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 run. We predict the uncertainties on the component masses and the inclination angle will be reduced to 5x10$^{-3}$ Mo and 0.4 degrees after two decades of timing, and that in at least a decade from now the detection of the shift in Pb and the sky proper motion will serve to make an independent constraint of the distance to the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Roughly half of Solar-type planet hosts have stellar companions, so understanding how these binary companions affect the formation and evolution of planets is an important component to understanding planetary systems overall. Measuring the dynamical properties of planet host binaries enables a valuable test of planet formation in multi-star systems and requires knowledge of the binary orbital parameters. Using high resolution imaging, we have measured the relative astrometry and visual orbits of 13 binary systems where one of the stars is known to host a transiting exoplanet. Our results indicate that the mutual inclination between the orbits of the binary hosts and the transiting planets are well aligned. Our results for close binary systems (a<100 AU) complement past work for wide planet host binaries from Gaia.

 We report on a study of the mounds that dominate the appearance of Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) (486958) Arrokoth's larger lobe, named Wenu. We compare the geological context of these mounds, measure and intercompare their shapes, sizes/orientations, reflectance, and colors. We find the mounds are broadly self-similar in many respects and interpret them as the original building blocks of Arrokoth. It remains unclear why these building blocks are so similar in size, and this represents a new constrain and challenge for solar system formation models. We then discuss the interpretation of this interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 We have mapped the NGC 2023 reflection nebula in the 63 and 145 micron transitions of [O I] and the 158 micron [C II] spectral lines using the heterodyne receiver upGREAT on SOFIA. The observations were used to identify the diffuse and dense components of the PDR traced by the [C II] and [O I] emission, respectively. The velocity-resolved observations reveal the presence of a significant column of low-excitation atomic oxygen, seen in absorption in the [O I] 63 micron spectra, amounting to about 20-60% of the oxygen column seen in emission in the [O I] 145 micron spectra. Some self-absorption is also seen in [C II], but for the most part it is hardly noticeable. The [C II] and [O I] 63 micron spectra show strong red- and blue-shifted wings due to photo evaporation flows especially in the southeastern and southern part of the reflection nebula, where comparison with the mid- and high-J CO emission indicates that the C+ region is expanding into a dense molecular cloud. Using a two-slab toy model the large-scale self-absorption seen in [O I] 63 micron is readily explained as originating in foreground low-excitation gas associated with the source. Similar columns have also been observed recently in other Galactic photon-dominated-regions (PDRs). These results have two implications: for the velocity-unresolved extra-galactic observations this could impact the use of [O I] 63 micron as a tracer of massive star formation and secondly the widespread self-absorption in [O I] 63 micron leads to underestimate of the column density of atomic oxygen derived from this tracer and necessitates the use of alternative indirect methods.
