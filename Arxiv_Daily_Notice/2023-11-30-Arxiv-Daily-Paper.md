 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade the study of exoplanet atmospheres at high-spectral resolution, via transmission/emission spectroscopy and cross-correlation techniques for atomic/molecular mapping, has become a powerful and consolidated methodology. The current limitation is the signal-to-noise ratio during a planetary transit. This limitation will be overcome by ANDES, an optical and near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT. ANDES will be a powerful transformational instrument for exoplanet science. It will enable the study of giant planet atmospheres, allowing not only an exquisite determination of atmospheric composition, but also the study of isotopic compositions, dynamics and weather patterns, mapping the planetary atmospheres and probing atmospheric formation and evolution models. The unprecedented angular resolution of ANDES, will also allow us to explore the initial conditions in which planets form in proto-planetary disks. The main science case of ANDES, however, is the study of small, rocky exoplanet atmospheres, including the potential for biomarker detections, and the ability to reach this science case is driving its instrumental design. Here we discuss our simulations and the observing strategies to achieve this specific science goal. Since ANDES will be operational at the same time as NASA's JWST and ESA's ARIEL missions, it will provide enormous synergies in the characterization of planetary atmospheres at high and low spectral resolution. Moreover, ANDES will be able to probe for the first time the atmospheres of several giant and small planets in reflected light. In particular, we show how ANDES will be able to unlock the reflected light atmospheric signal of a golden sample of nearby non-transiting habitable zone earth-sized planets within a few tenths of nights, a scientific objective that no other currently approved astronomical facility will be able to reach.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical transients, such as supernovae and other rare stellar explosions, have been instrumental in some of the most significant discoveries in astronomy. New astronomical sky surveys will soon record unprecedented numbers of transients as sparsely and irregularly sampled multivariate time series. To improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms of transients and their progenitor systems, early-time measurements are necessary. Prioritizing the follow-up of transients based on their age along with their class is crucial for new surveys. To meet this demand, we present the first method of predicting the age of transients in real-time from multi-wavelength time-series observations. We build a Bayesian probabilistic recurrent neural network. Our method can accurately predict the age of a transient with robust uncertainties as soon as it is initially triggered by a survey telescope. This work will be essential for the advancement of our understanding of the numerous young transients being detected by ongoing and upcoming astronomical surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 V510 Pup (IRAS 08005-2356) is a binary post-AGB system with a fast molecular outflow that has been noted for its puzzling mixture of carbon- and oxygen-rich features in the optical and infrared. To explore this chemical dichotomy and relate it to the kinematics of the source, we present an ACA spectral line survey detailing fourteen newly detected molecules in this pre-planetary nebula. The simultaneous presence of CN/C2H/HC3N and SO/SO2 support the previous conclusion of mixed chemistry, and their line profiles indicate that the C- and O-rich material trace distinct velocity structures in the outflow. This evidence suggests that V510 Pup could harbor a dense O-rich central waist from an earlier stage of evolution, which persisted after a fast C-rich molecular outflow formed. By studying the gas phase composition of this unique source, we aim to reveal new insights into the interplay between dynamics and chemistry in rapidly evolving post-AGB systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) underwent its most recent eruption on 8 August 2021 and became the first nova to produce both detectable GeV and TeV emission. We used extensive X-ray monitoring with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER) to model the X-ray spectrum and probe the shock conditions throughout the 2021 eruption. The rapidly evolving NICER spectra consisted of both line and continuum emission that could not be accounted for using a single-temperature collisional equilibrium plasma model with an absorber that fully covered the source. We successfully modelled the NICER spectrum as a non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma with partial-covering absorption. The temperature of the the non-equilibrium plasma show a peak on Day 5 with a kT of approximately 24 keV. The increase in temperature during the first five days could have been due to increasing contribution to the X-ray emission from material behind fast polar shocks or a decrease is the amount of energy being drained from shocks into particle acceleration during that time period. The absorption showed a change from fully covering the source to having a covering fraction of roughly 0.4, suggesting a geometrical evolution of the shock region within the complex global distribution of the circumstellar material. These findings show the evidence of the ejecta interacting with some dense equatorial shell initially and with less dense material in the bipolar regions at later times during the eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of the live isotopes $^{60}{\rm Fe}$ and $^{244}{\rm Pu}$ in deep ocean sediments dating back to the past 3-4 Myr poses a serious challenge to the identification of their production site(s). While $^{60}{\rm Fe}$ is usually attributed to standard supernovae, actinides are r-process nucleosynthesis yields, which are believed to be synthesized in rare events, such as special classes of supernovae or binary mergers involving at least one neutron star. Previous works concluded that a single binary neutron star merger cannot explain the observed isotopic ratio. In this work, we consider a set of numerical simulations of binary neutron star mergers producing long-lived massive remnants expelling both dynamical and spiral-wave wind ejecta. The latter, due to a stronger neutrino irradiation, produce also iron-group elements. Assuming that large scale mixing is inefficient before the fading of the kilonova remnant and that the spiral-wave wind is sustained over a 100-200 ms timescale, the ejecta emitted at mid-high latitudes provide a $^{244}{\rm Pu}$ over $^{60}{\rm Fe}$ ratio compatible with observations. The merger could have happened 110-200 pc away from the Earth, and between 3.5 and 4.5 Myr ago. We also compute expected isotopic ratios for 8 other live radioactive nuclides showing that the proposed binary neutron star merger scenario is distinguishable from other scenarios proposed in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/MIRI has sharpened our infrared eyes toward the star formation process. This paper presents the first mid-infrared detection of gaseous SO$_2$ emission in an embedded low-mass protostellar system. MIRI-MRS observations of the low-mass protostellar binary NGC 1333 IRAS2A are presented from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program, revealing emission from the SO$_2~\nu_3$ asymmetric stretching mode at 7.35 micron. The results are compared to those derived from high-angular resolution SO$_2$ data obtained with ALMA. The SO$_2$ emission from the $\nu_3$ band is predominantly located on $\sim50-100$ au scales around the main component of the binary, IRAS2A1. A rotational temperature of $92\pm8$ K is derived from the $\nu_3$ lines. This is in good agreement with the rotational temperature derived from pure rotational lines in the vibrational ground state (i.e., $\nu=0$) with ALMA ($104\pm5$ K). However, the emission of the $\nu_3$ lines is not in LTE given that the total number of molecules predicted by a LTE model is found to be a factor $2\times10^4$ higher than what is derived for the $\nu=0$ state. This difference can be explained by a vibrational temperature that is $\sim100$ K higher than the derived rotational temperature of the $\nu=0$ state. The brightness temperature derived from the continuum around the $\nu_3$ band of SO$_2$ is $\sim180$ K, which confirms that the $\nu_3=1$ level is not collisionally populated but rather infrared pumped by scattered radiation. This is also consistent with the non-detection of the $\nu_2$ bending mode at 18-20 micron. Given the rotational temperature, the extent of the emission ($\sim100$ au in radius), and the narrow line widths in the ALMA data (3.5 km/s), the SO$_2$ in IRAS2A likely originates from ice sublimation in the central hot core around the protostar rather than from an accretion shock at the disk-envelope boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 Isocurvature fluctuations, where the relative number density of particle species spatially varies, can be generated from initially adiabatic or curvature fluctuations if the various species fall out of or were never in thermal equilibrium. The freezing of the thermal relic dark matter abundance is one such case, but for modes that are still outside the horizon the amplitude is highly suppressed and originates from the small change in the local expansion rate due to the local space curvature produced by the curvature fluctuation. We establish a simple separate-universe method for calculating this generation that applies to both freeze-in and freeze-out models, identify three critical epochs for this process, and give general scaling behaviors for the amplitude in each case: the freezing epoch, the kinetic decoupling epoch and matter-radiation equality. Freeze-out models are typically dominated by spatially modulated annihilation from the latter epochs and can generate much larger isocurvature fluctuations compared with typical freeze-in models, albeit still very small and observationally allowed by cosmic microwave background measurements. We illustrate these results with concrete models where the dark matter interactions are vector or scalar mediated.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological distances are fundamental observables in cosmology. The luminosity ($D_L$), angular diameter ($D_A$) and gravitational wave ($D_{\rm GW}$) distances are all trivially related in General Relativity assuming no significant absorption of photons in the extragalactic medium, also known as cosmic opacity. Supernovae have long been the main cosmological standard candle for the past decades, but bright standard sirens are now a proven alternative, with the advantage of not requiring calibration with other astrophysical sources. Moreover, they can also measure deviations from modified gravity since they can provide evidence for a discrepancy between $D_L$ and $D_{\rm GW}$. However, both gravitational and cosmological parameters are degenerate in the Hubble diagram, making it hard to properly detect beyond standard model physics. Finally, recently a model-independent method was proposed to infer angular diameter distances from large-scale structure which is independent of both early universe and dark energy physics. In this paper we propose a tripartite test of the ratios of these three distances with minimal amount of assumptions regarding cosmology, the early universe, cosmic opacity and modified gravity. We proceed to forecast this test with a combination of uncalibrated LSST and Roman supernovae, Einstein Telescope bright sirens and a joint DESI-like + Euclid-like galaxy survey. We find that even in this very model-independent approach we will be able to detect, in each of many redshift bins, percent-level deviations in these ratios of distances, allowing for very precise consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and standard physics.
#### Revisiting the Extreme Clustering of $z \approx 4$ Quasars with Large  Volume Cosmological Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Observations from wide-field quasar surveys indicate that the quasar auto-correlation length increases dramatically from $z\approx2.5$ to $z\approx4$. This large clustering amplitude at $z\approx4$ has proven hard to interpret theoretically, as it implies that quasars are hosted by the most massive dark matter halos residing in the most extreme environments at that redshift. In this work, we present a model that simultaneously reproduces both the observed quasar auto-correlation and quasar luminosity functions. The spatial distribution of halos and their relative abundance are obtained via a novel method that computes the halo mass and halo cross-correlation functions by combining multiple large-volume dark-matter-only cosmological simulations with different box sizes and resolutions. Armed with these halo properties, our model exploits the conditional luminosity function framework to describe the stochastic relationship between quasar luminosity, $L$, and halo mass, $M$. Assuming a simple power-law relation $L\propto M^\gamma$ with log-normal scatter, $\sigma$, we are able to reproduce observations at $z\sim 4$ and find that: (a) the quasar luminosity-halo mass relation is highly non-linear ($\gamma\gtrsim2$), with very little scatter ($\sigma \lesssim 0.3$ dex); (b) luminous quasars ($\log_{10} L/{\rm erg s}^{-1} \gtrsim 46.5-47$) are hosted by halos with mass $\log_{10} M/{\rm M}_\odot\gtrsim 13-13.5$; and (c) the implied duty cycle for quasar activity approaches unity ($\varepsilon_{\rm DC}\approx10-60\%$). We also consider observations at $z\approx2.5$ and find that the quasar luminosity-halo mass relation evolves significantly with cosmic time, implying a rapid change in quasar host halo masses and duty cycles, which in turn suggests concurrent evolution in black hole scaling relations and/or accretion efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 FU Orionis-type objects(FUors) are embedded protostars that undergo episodes of high accretion, potentially indicating a widespread but poorly understood phase in the formation of low-mass stars. Gaining a better understanding of the influence exerted by these outbursts on the evolution of the surrounding protoplanetary disc may hold significant implications for the process of planet formation and the evolution of disc chemistry. The heating due to outbursts of high accretion in FUors pushes the snowlines of key volatiles farther out in the disc, so they become easier to observe and study. Among the known FUors, V883 Ori is of particular interest. V883 Ori was the first FUor to show indirect evidence of a resolvable snowline beyond 40 au. By introducing a radial-dependent model of this source including viscous heating, we show that active heating is needed to reproduce the steep thermal profile of dust in the inner disc of V883 Ori. Our disc modeling combines the effect of stellar irradiation and the influence on the disc shape caused by the outburst of accretion. The accuracy of our model is tested by comparing synthetic ALMA images with continuum observations of V883 Ori, showing that the model successfully reproduces the 1.3 mm emission of V883 Ori at high spatial resolution. Our final predictions underline the importance of viscous heating as a predominant heat source for this type of object, changing the physical conditions (shape and temperature) of the disc, and influencing its evolution.
#### Charting the Galactic acceleration field II. A global mass model of the  Milky Way from the STREAMFINDER Atlas of Stellar Streams detected in Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 We present an atlas and follow-up spectroscopic observations of 87 thin stream-like structures detected with the STREAMFINDER algorithm in Gaia DR3, of which 29 are new discoveries. Here we focus on using these streams to refine mass models of the Galaxy. Fits with a double power law halo with the outer power law slope set to $-\beta_h=3$ yield an inner power law slope $-\gamma_h=0.97^{+0.17}_{-0.21}$, a scale radius of $r_{0, h}=14.7^{+4.7}_{-1.0}$ kpc, a halo density flattening $q_{m, h}=0.75\pm0.03$, and a local dark matter density of $\rho_{h, \odot}=0.0114\pm0.0007 {\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}}$. Freeing $\beta$ yields $\beta=2.53^{+0.42}_{-0.16}$, but this value is heavily influenced by our chosen virial mass limit. The stellar disks are found to have a combined mass of $4.20^{+0.44}_{-0.53}\times10^{10} {\rm M_\odot}$, with the thick disk contributing $12.4\pm0.7$\% to the local stellar surface density. The scale length of the thin and thick disks are $2.17^{+0.18}_{-0.08}$ kpc and $1.62^{+0.72}_{-0.13}$ kpc, respectively, while their scale heights are $0.347^{+0.007}_{-0.010}$ kpc and $0.86^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ kpc, respectively. The virial mass of the favored model is $M_{200}=1.09^{+0.19}_{-0.14}\times 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$, while the mass inside of 50 kpc is $M_{R<50}=0.46\pm0.03\times 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$. We introduce the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the derived potential models, and fit the "Orphan" stream therein, finding a mass for the LMC that is consistent with recent estimates. Some highlights of the atlas include the nearby trailing arm of $\omega$-Cen, and a nearby very metal-poor stream that was once a satellite of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Finally, we unambiguously detect a hot component around the GD-1 stream, consistent with it having been tidally pre-processed within its own DM subhalo.

 - **Abstract**
 Central Compact Objects (CCOs), neutron stars found near the centre of some Supernova Remnants (SNRs), have been almost exclusively studied in X-rays and are thought to lack the wind nebulae typically seen around young, rotation-powered pulsars. We present the first, spatially-resolved, morphological and spectroscopic study of the optical nebula observed at the location of CXOU J085201.4-461753, the CCO in the heart of the Vela Junior SNR. It is currently the only Galactic CCO with a spatially coincident nebula detected at optical wavelengths, whose exact nature remains uncertain. New MUSE integral field spectroscopy data confirm that the nebula, shaped like a smooth blob extending 8" in diameter, is dominated by [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583 emission. The data reveals a distinct and previously unobserved morphology of the H$\alpha$ emission, exhibiting an arc-like shape reminiscent of a bow shock nebula. We observe a significantly strong [N II] emission relative to H$\alpha$, with the [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583 up to 34 times the intensity of the H$\alpha$ emission within the optical nebula environment. Notably, the [N II] and H$\alpha$ structures are not spatially coincident, with the [N II] nebula concentrated to the south of the CCO and delimited by the H$\alpha$ arc-like structure. We detect additional emission in [N I], He I, [S II], [Ar III], [Fe II], and [S III]. We discuss our findings in the light of a photoionization or Wolf-Rayet nebula, pointing to a very massive progenitor and further suggesting that very massive stars do not necessarily make black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical picture of star formation involves disk-mediated accretion, with Keplerian accretion disks and associated bipolar jets primarily observed in nearby, low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs). Recently, rotating gaseous structures and Keplerian disks have been detected around a number of massive (M > 8 solar masses) YSOs (MYSOs) including several disk-jet systems. All of the known MYSO systems are located in the Milky Way, and all are embedded in their natal material. Here we report the detection of a rotating gaseous structure around an extragalactic MYSO in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The gas motions show radial flow of material falling from larger scales onto a central disk-like structure, the latter exhibiting signs of Keplerian rotation, i.e., a rotating toroid feeding an accretion disk and thus the growth of the central star. The system is in almost all aspects comparable to Milky Way high-mass young stellar objects accreting gas via a Keplerian disk. The key difference between this source and its Galactic counterparts is that it is optically revealed, rather than being deeply embedded in its natal material as is expected of such a young massive star. We suggest that this is the consequence of the star having formed in a low-metallicity and low-dust content environment, thus providing important constraints for models of the formation and evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar disks.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the many exciting revelations of the New Horizons flyby of Pluto was the observation of global haze layers at altitudes as high as 200 km in the visible wavelengths. This haze is produced in the upper atmosphere through photochemical processes, similar to the processes in Titan's atmosphere. As the haze particles grow in size and descend to the lower atmosphere, they coagulate and interact with the gases in the atmosphere through condensation and sticking processes that serve as temporary and permanent loss processes. New Horizons observations confirm studies of Titan haze analogs suggesting that photochemically produced haze particles harden as they grow in size. We outline in this chapter what is known about the photochemical processes that lead to haze production and outline feedback processes resulting from the presence of haze in the atmosphere, connect this to the evolution of Pluto's atmosphere, and discuss open questions that need to be addressed in future work.
#### Kinetic Preheating after $α$-attractor Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We study preheating via kinetic couplings after dilaton-axion $\alpha$-attractor inflation. We focus on E-model $\alpha$-attractor driven inflation where the inflaton is kinetically coupled to an ultralight axion. In this class of models, the kinetic coupling is related to the form of the potential, and once the amplitude of the scalar curvature spectrum as well as the tensor-to-scalar ratio are specified, the model has no free parameters. We find that kinetic preheating can be extremely efficient, with stronger preheating occurring at parameter values corresponding to smaller values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Preheating becomes extremely efficient below $r \lesssim 1.6\times 10^{-5}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming surveys are predicted to discover galaxy-scale strong lenses on the order of $10^5$, making deep learning methods necessary in lensing data analysis. Currently, there is insufficient real lensing data to train deep learning algorithms, but the alternative of training only on simulated data results in poor performance on real data. Domain Adaptation may be able to bridge the gap between simulated and real datasets. We utilize domain adaptation for the estimation of Einstein radius ($\Theta_E$) in simulated galaxy-scale gravitational lensing images with different levels of observational realism. We evaluate two domain adaptation techniques - Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We train on a source domain of simulated lenses and apply it to a target domain of lenses simulated to emulate noise conditions in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We show that both domain adaptation techniques can significantly improve the model performance on the more complex target domain dataset. This work is the first application of domain adaptation for a regression task in strong lensing imaging analysis. Our results show the potential of using domain adaptation to perform analysis of future survey data with a deep neural network trained on simulated data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Distributed Electronic Cosmic-ray Observatory (DECO) is a cell phone app that uses a cell phone camera image sensor to detect cosmic-ray particles and particles from radioactive decay. Images recorded by DECO are classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN) according to their morphology. In this project, we develop a GEANT4-derived simulation of particle interactions inside the CMOS sensor using the Allpix$^2$ modular framework. We simulate muons, electrons, and photons with energy range 10 keV to 100 GeV, and their deposited energy agrees well with expectations. Simulated events are recorded and processed in a similar way as data images taken by DECO, and the result shows both similar image morphology with data events and good quantitative data-Monte Carlo agreement.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that small chemical anomalies observed in planet-hosting wide binary systems could be due to planet signatures, where the role of the planetary mass is still unknown. We search for a possible planet signature by analyzing the Tc trends in the remarkable binary system HD196067-HD196068. At the moment, only HD196067 is known to host a planet which is near the brown dwarf regime. We take advantage of the strong physical similarity between both stars, which is crucial to achieving the highest possible precision in stellar parameters and elemental chemical abundances. This system gives us a unique opportunity to explore if a possible depletion of refractories in a binary system could be inhibited by the presence of a massive planet. We performed a line-by-line chemical differential study, employing the non-solar-scaled opacities, in order to reach the highest precision in the calculations. After differentially comparing both stars, HD196067 displays a clear deficiency in refractory elements in the Tc plane, a lower iron content (0.051 dex) and also a lower Li I content (0.14 dex) than its companion. In addition, the differential abundances reveal a Tc trend. These targets represent the first cases of an abundance difference around a binary system hosting a super-Jupiter. Although we explored several scenarios to explain the chemical anomalies, none of them can be entirely ruled out. Additional monitoring of the system as well as studies of larger sample of wide binary systems hosting massive planets, are needed to better understand the chemical abundance trend observed in HD196067-68.

 - **Abstract**
 We study line driven stellar winds using time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics where the continuum radiation couples to the gas via either a scattering or absorption opacity and there is an additional radiation force due to spectral lines that we model in the Sobolev approximation. We find that in winds with scattering opacities, instabilties tend to be suppressed and the wind reaches a steady state. Winds with absorption opacities are unstable and remain clumpy at late times. Clumps persist because they are continually regenerated in the subcritical part of the flow. Azimuthal gradients in the radial velocity distribution cause a drop in the radial radiation force and provide a mechanism for generating clumps. These clumps form on super-Sobolev scales, but at late times become Sobolev-length sized indicating that our radiation transfer model is breaking down. Inferring the clump distribution at late times therefore requires radiation-hydrodynamic modeling below the Sobolev scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Cen A hosts the closest active galactic nucleus to the Milky Way, which makes it an ideal target for investigating the dynamical processes in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we present 14 Chandra HETGS spectra of the nucleus of Cen A that were observed throughout 2022. We compared them with each other, and contrasted them against the two previous Chandra HETGS spectra from 2001. This enabled an investigation into the spectral changes occurring on timescales of months and 21 years. All Chandra spectra could be well fitted by an absorbed power law with a strong and narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line, a leaked power law feature at low energies, and Si and S K$\alpha$ lines that could not be associated with the central engine. The flux of the continuum varied by a factor of $2.74\pm0.05$ over the course of the observations, whereas the Fe line only varied by $18.8\pm8.8\%$. The photon index increased over 21 years, and the Hydrogen column density varied significantly within a few months as well. The Fe K$\alpha$ line was found at a lower energy than expected from the Cen A redshift, amounting to an excess velocity of $326^{+84}_{-94}~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ relative to Cen A. We investigated warped accretion disks, bulk motion, and outflows as possible explanations of this shift. The spectra also featured ionized absorption lines from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI, describing a variable inflow.

 - **Abstract**
 The common envelope evolution (CEE) is vital in forming short orbital period compact binaries. It covers many objects, such as double compact merging binaries, type Ia supernovae progenitors, binary pulsars, and X-ray binaries. Knowledge about the common envelope (CE) eject efficiency still needs to be improved, though progress has been made recently. Short orbital period hot subdwarf B star plus white dwarf binaries are the most straightforward samples to constrain CEE physics. We apply the known orbital period-white dwarf relation to constrain the sdB progenitor of seven sdB+WD binaries with a known inclination angle. The average value of the CE efficiency parameter is 0.32, which is consistent with previous studies. However, the CE efficiency might not be a constant but is a function of the initial mass ratio based on well-constrained sdB progenitor mass and evolutionary stage. Our results can be used as physical inputs for binary population synthesis simulations on related objects. A similar method can also be applied to study other short orbital period WD binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 1-5um spectroscopy of the coldest known brown dwarf, WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), performed with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). NIRSpec has dramatically improved the measurement of spectral energy distribution of WISE 0855 in terms of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise ratios, and spectral resolution. We have performed preliminary modeling of the NIRSpec data using the ATMO 2020 models of cloudless atmospheres, arriving at a best fitting model that has T_eff=285 K. That temperature is ~20 K higher than the value derived by combining our luminosity estimate with evolutionary models (i.e., the radius in the model fit to the SED is somewhat smaller than expected from evolutionary models). Through comparisons to the model spectra, we detect absorption in the fundamental band of CO, which is consistent with an earlier detection in a ground-based spectrum and indicates the presence of vertical mixing. Although PH_3 is expected in Y dwarfs that experience vertical mixing, it is not detected in WISE 0855. Previous ground-based M-band spectroscopy of WISE 0855 has been cited for evidence of H_2O ice clouds, but we find that the NIRSpec data in that wavelength range are matched well by our cloudless model. Thus, clear evidence of H_2O ice clouds in WISE 0855 has not been identified yet, but it may still be present in the NIRSpec data. The physical properties of WISE 0855, including the presence of H_2O clouds, can be better constrained by more detailed fitting with both cloudless and cloudy models and the incorporation of unpublished 5-28um data from the Mid-infrared Instrument on JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and evolution of Saturn's rings is critical to understanding the Saturnian system as a whole. Here, we discuss the physical and chemical composition of the rings, as a foundation for evolutionary models described in subsequent chapters. We review the physical characteristics of the main rings, and summarize current constraints on their chemical composition. Radial trends are observed in temperature and to a limited extent in particle size distribution, with the C ring exhibiting higher temperatures and a larger population of small particles. The C ring also shows evidence for the greatest abundance of silicate material, perhaps indicative of formation from a rocky body. The C ring and Cassini Division have lower optical depths than the A and B rings, which contributes to the higher abundance of the exogenous neutral absorber in these regions. Overall, the main ring composition is strongly dominated by water ice, with minor silicate, UV absorber, and neutral absorber components. Sampling of the innermost D ring during Cassini's Grand Finale provides a new set of in situ constraints on the ring composition, and we explore ongoing work to understand the linkages between the main rings and the D ring. The D ring material is organic- and silicate-rich and water-poor relative to the main rings, with a large population of small grains. This composition may be explained in part by volatile losses in the D ring, and current constraints suggest some degree of fractionation rather than sampling of the bulk D ring material.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the temperature and density structures of gas in massive protoclusters is crucial for understanding the chemical properties therein. In this study, we present observations of the continuum and thioformaldehyde (H2CS) lines at 345 GHz of 11 massive protoclusters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope. High spatial resolution and sensitivity observations have detected 145 continuum cores from the 11 sources. H2CS line transitions are observed in 72 out of 145 cores, including line-rich cores, warm cores and cold cores. The H2 column densities of the 72 cores are estimated from the continuum emission which are larger than the density threshold value for star formation, suggesting that H2CS can be widely distributed in star-forming cores with different physical environments. Rotation temperature and column density of H2CS are derived by use of the XCLASS software. The results show the H2CS abundances increase as temperature rises and higher gas temperatures are usually associated with higher H2CS column densities. The abundances of H2CS are positively correlated with its column density, suggesting that the H2CS abundances are enhanced from cold cores, warm cores to line-rich cores in star forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the photometric data in the Wide layer of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) over $\sim 1,200$ deg$^{2}$ to uncover new halo substructures beyond the distance, $D_{\odot}\sim$ 30 kpc, from the Sun. For this purpose, we develop an isochrone filter for an old, metal-poor stellar system to extract the faint main-sequence stars at a range of distances. With this method, we detect, not only the previously discovered substructures such as the Orphan Stream, but also the new overdensity toward Bo\"otes at 60 $\lesssim\,D_{\odot}\,\lesssim$ 100 kpc and the new stream-like feature toward Pisces at around $D_{\odot}\sim$ 60 kpc. It has been suggested that a small-scale overdensity exists in this direction of Pisces (the so-called Pisces Overdensity), but our results show that the overdensity is widely spread with a tidally elongated feature. Combining our results with the ongoing Hyper Suprime-Cam narrow-band survey and the near-future spectroscopic survey with Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) will allow us to place strong constraints on the origin of these halo substructures.
#### Generation of Isocurvature from Curvature Inhomogeneities on  Super-Horizon Scales

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17379

 - **Abstract**
 Here it is shown 1) how isocurvature inhomogeneities correlated on causally disconnected (super-horizon) scales are generated from curvature inhomogeneities which are known to be correlated on these scales 2) that super-horizon isocurvature generation is nearly inevitable for non-equilibrium chemical processes 3) that the amplitude of the compositional isocurvature correlations a) can be large for production of rare objects, b) falls off rapidly with separation c) falls off at scales below the horizon when these modes are generated. These two fall-offs results in an "isocurvature bump" in the power spectrum. Isocurvature generation is illustrated by the process of dark matter freeze-in, computed here with both separate universe modelling and linear perturbation theory. For freeze-in the most prominent isocurvature modes are inhomogeneities in the ratio of dark matter to standard model matter. Much smaller inhomogeneities in the ratio of baryons to standard model entropy are also produced. Previous constraints on freeze-in from Ly-$\alpha$ clouds limit the bump enhancement to $\lesssim10\%$ on comoving scales $\lesssim1\,$Mpc. Current observations are not sensitive to the isocurvature modes generated in viable freeze-in models. Results are obtained using a somewhat novel framework to describe cosmological inhomogeneities.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the fundamental parameters of galaxy evolution, we investigated the minimum set of parameters that explain the observed galaxy spectra in the local Universe. We identified four latent variables that efficiently represent the diversity of high-dimensional galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Additionally, we constructed meaningful latent representation using conditional variational autoencoders trained with different permutations of galaxy physical properties, which helped us quantify the information that these traditionally used properties have on the reconstruction of galaxy spectra. The four parameters suggest a view that complex SED population models with a very large number of parameters will be difficult to constrain even with spectroscopic galaxy data. Through an Explainable AI (XAI) method, we found that the region below 5000\textup{\AA} and prominent emission lines ([O II], [O III], and H$\alpha$) are particularly informative for predicting the latent variables. Our findings suggest that these latent variables provide a more efficient and fundamental representation of galaxy spectra than conventionally considered galaxy physical properties.

 Interferometric measurements of the 21cm signal are a prime example of the data-driven era in astrophysics we are entering with current and upcoming experiments. We showcase the use of deep networks that are tailored for the structure of 3D tomographic 21cm light-cones to firstly detect and characterise HI sources and to secondly directly infer global astrophysical and cosmological model parameters. We compare different architectures and highlight how 3D CNN architectures that mirror the data structure are the best-performing model.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-epoch VLBI observations measure 3D water maser motions in protostellar outflows, enabling analysis of inclination and velocity. However, these analyses assume that water masers and shock surfaces within outflows are co-propagating. We compared VLBI data on maser-traced bowshocks in high-mass protostar AFGL 5142-MM1, from seven epochs of archival data from the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), obtained from April 2014 to May 2015, and our newly-conducted data from the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA), obtained in March 2016. We find an inconsistency between the expected displacement of the bowshocks and the motions of individual masers. The separation between two opposing bowshocks in AFGL 5142-MM1 was determined to be $337.17\pm0.07~\rm{mas}$ in the KaVA data, which is less than an expected value of $342.1\pm0.7~\rm{mas}$ based on extrapolation of the proper motions of individual maser features measured by VERA. Our measurements imply that the bowshock propagates at a velocity of $24\pm3~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$, while the individual masing gas clumps move at an average velocity of $55\pm5~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$, i.e. the water masers are moving in the outflow direction at double the speed at which the bowshocks are propagating. Our results emphasise that investigations of individual maser features are best approached using short-term high-cadence VLBI monitoring, while long-term monitoring on timescales comparable to the lifetimes of maser features, are better suited to tracing the overall evolution of shock surfaces. Observers should be aware that masers and shock surfaces can move relative to each other, and that this can affect the interpretation of protostellar outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the radio synchrotron background (RSB) is currently unknown. Its understanding might have profound implications in fundamental physics or might reveal a new class of radio emitters. In this work, we consider the scenario in which the RSB is due to extragalactic radio sources and measure the angular cross-correlation of LOFAR images of the diffuse radio sky with matter tracers at different redshifts, provided by galaxy catalogs and CMB lensing. We compare these measured cross-correlations to those expected for models of RSB sources. We find that low-redshift populations of discrete sources are excluded by the data, while higher redshift explanations are compatible with available observations. We also conclude that at least 20\% of the RSB surface brightness level must originate from populations tracing the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe, indicating that at least this fraction of the RSB is of extragalactic origin. Future measurements of the correlation between the RSB and tracers of high-redshift sources will be crucial to constraining the source population of the RSB.
#### Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ as a plausible source candidate for PeV  neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the recently observed diffuse neutrinos by IceCube with energies above 1 PeV might have originated from Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ located in the galactic disk. This implies that the astrophysical settings of Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ need to accelerate hadronic cosmic rays to energies of $\sim 100$ PeV or more. Then, the hadronic emission scenario argues that this galactic neutrino source is also a PeV gamma-ray source. Recent observation of galactic diffuse PeV gamma-rays with energies $\sim 1$ PeV by Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has also advocated this conjecture. In the present paper, we demonstrate that if protons are accelerated to energies of $\sim 100$ PeV or more as reported by Osmanov {\it et al.} (Astrophys. J. {\bf 835} 164:2017) in Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ environment, then they might generate PeV neutrinos and gamma rays through cosmic rays-gas/interstellar matter ({\it e.g.} $pp$) interactions. We estimate theoretically the diffuse neutrino flux due to back-to-back charged pion decays and the accompanying gamma-ray flux from neutral pion decays. These results suggest that a fraction ($\simeq 1\%$) of the PeV diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can be explained by the neutrino emission from Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$. Upcoming IceCube Gen2 and Cherenkov telescope array could be able to test our scenario for PeV neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the only known galactic Pevatron Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ with CR energies more than $100$ PeV.

 The FRiM fractal operator belongs to a family of operators, called ASAP, defined by an ordered selection of nearest neighbors. This generalization provides means to improve upon the good properties of FRiM. We propose a fast algorithm to build an ASAP operator mimicking the fractal structure of FRiM for pupils of any size and geometry and to learn the sparse coefficients from empirical data. We empirically show the good approximation by ASAP of correlated statistics and the benefits of ASAP for solving phase restoration problems.

 - **Abstract**
 I present a review of how late observations of supernovae, of the nebular phase, and much later of supernova remnants (SNRs), and their analysis in 2023 made progress towards breakthroughs in supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in introducing the group of lonely white dwarf (WD) scenarios for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The new analyses of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) reveal point-symmetric morphologies in a way unnoticed before in three CCSNRs. Comparison to multipolar planetary nebulae that are shaped by jets suggests that jets exploded these CCSNe, as predicted by the JJEM, but incompatible with the prediction of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism. The spherical morphology of the ejecta Pa 30 of the historical type Iax supernova (SN Iax) of 1181 AD, which studies in 2023 revealed, is mostly compatible with the explosion of a lonely WD. Namely, at the explosion time, there is only a WD, without any close companion, although the WD was formed via a close binary interaction, i.e., binary merger. An identification of point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3, a normal SN Ia and the youngest SN in the Galaxy, suggests an SN explosion of a lonely WD inside a planetary nebula (an SNIP). The group of lonely WD scenarios includes the core degenerate scenario and the double degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay (MED) time. SN Ia explosions of lonely WDs are common, and might actually account for most (or even all) normal SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets with radii between that of the Earth and Neptune (hereafter referred to as sub-Neptunes) are found in close-in orbits around more than half of all Sun-like stars. Yet, their composition, formation, and evolution remain poorly understood. The study of multi-planetary systems offers an opportunity to investigate the outcomes of planet formation and evolution while controlling for initial conditions and environment. Those in resonance (with their orbital periods related by a ratio of small integers) are particularly valuable because they imply a system architecture practically unchanged since its birth. Here, we present the observations of six transiting planets around the bright nearby star HD 110067. We find that the planets follow a chain of resonant orbits. A dynamical study of the innermost planet triplet allowed the prediction and later confirmation of the orbits of the rest of the planets in the system. The six planets are found to be sub-Neptunes with radii ranging from 1.94 to 2.85 Re. Three of the planets have measured masses, yielding low bulk densities that suggest the presence of large hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we compare the scalar field dynamics in axion-like and power law potentials for both positive and negative values of the exponents. We find that, for positive exponents, both the potentials exhibit similar scalar field dynamics and it can be difficult to distinguish them at least at the background level. Even though the potentials are oscillatory in nature for positive exponents scaling solutions can be achieved for larger values of the exponent for which the dynamics can be different during early times. Because of the presence of this scaling nature there is a turnaround in the values of the scalar field equation of state as we increase the values of the exponent in both the potentials. This indicates the deviation from the oscillatory behaviour for the larger values of the exponent. For negative values of the exponent, the dynamics of the scalar field is distinguishable and axion-like potential can give rise to cosmologically viable tracker solutions unlike the power law potentials. So, while for positive exponents we may not distinguish the two potentials for negative exponents the dynamics of the scalar field is distinguishable.

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such "dressed PBHs" (dPBHs) are not subject to typical PBH constraints and can explain the DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} \sim 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to uniquely establish the co-existence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Human biology has a preference for left-handed chiral molecules and an outstanding question is if this is imposed through astrophysical origins. We aim to evaluate the known information about chiral molecules within astrophysical and astrochemical databases, evaluate chemical modeling accuracy, and use high-level CCSD(T) calculations to characterize propylene oxide and other oxirane variants. By comparing these computational values with past laboratory experiments, we find a 99.9% similarity. We also have put together a new database dedicated to chiral molecules and variants of chiral molecules to assist in answering this question.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems containing a compact object may exhibit periodic brightening episodes due to gravitational lensing as the compact object transits the companion star. Such "self-lensing" signatures have been detected before for white dwarf binaries. We attempt to use these signatures to identify detached stellar-mass neutron star and black hole binaries using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We present a systematic search for self-lensing signals in Galactic binaries from a subset of high-cadence ZTF data taken in 2018. We identify 19 plausible candidates from the search, although because each candidate is observed to only brighten once, other origins such as stellar flares are more likely. We discuss prospects for more comprehensive future searches of the ZTF data.

 - **Abstract**
 S 308 is an X-ray emitting bubble that surrounds the Wolf-Rayet star WR6. The structure shines in the optical as well and is thus known as the Dolphin Nebula. Due to its large angular extent, it has been covered at only 90% with past XMM-Newton observations. Thanks to the unique dataset provided by the all-sky survey performed in X-rays by SRG/eROSITA, we can show for the first time the image of the bubble in its entire extent in this band, together with its spectral characterization. Moreover, we have tried to apply the same procedure for other wind-blown bubbles detected in the optical/IR and we searched for X-ray extended emission around them. We first analyzed the diffuse emission of S308, providing a detailed spectral analysis. We then considered a sample of 22 optical/IR selected wind-blown bubbles from a previous study based on WISE data, providing an estimate of the X-ray flux for the first time. We obtained the best fit for S308 with a two-temperature non-equilibrium plasma model (kT$_{1}=0.8_{-0.3}^{+0.8}$ keV and kT$_{2}=2_{-1}^{+3}$ keV) showing super-solar N abundance and low absorption. We did not detect any of the 22 optical/IR emitting bubbles in X-rays, but using our best fit model, we estimated the 3$\sigma$ flux upper limits for each bubble. We demonstrate the new possibility offered by SRG/eROSITA to study known wind-blown bubbles and look for other ones. A two-temperature plasma description seems to fit the data quite well for S308. Since all of the 22 bubbles studied still remain undetected by SRG/eROSITA, it is very likely that absorption effects and spatial compactness are responsible for the challenges standing in the way of detecting these bubbles in soft X-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive distances and masses of stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17 (DR17) using simple neural networks. Training data for distances comes from Gaia EDR3, supplemented by literature distances for star clusters. For masses, the network is trained using asteroseismic masses for evolved stars and isochrone masses for main sequence stars. The models are trained on effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and carbon and nitrogen abundances. We found that our distance predictions have median fractional errors that range from $\approx 20\%$ at low log g and $\approx 10\%$ at higher log g with a standard deviation of $\approx 11\%$. The mass predictions have a standard deviation of $\pm 12\%$. Using the masses, we derive ages for evolved stars based on the correspondence between mass and age for giant stars given by isochrones. The results are compiled into a Value Added Catalog (VAC) called DistMass that contains distances and masses for 733901 independent spectra, plus ages for 396548 evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first measurement of the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) across 0.9 < z < 1.5 using 301 \lya absorption lines fitted from 12 HST STIS quasar spectra, with a total pathlength of \Delta z=2.1. We employ the machine-learning-based inference method that uses joint b-N distributions obtained from \lyaf decomposition. Our results show that the HI photoionization rates, \Gamma, are in good agreement with the recent UV background synthesis models, with \log (\Gamma/s^{-1})={-11.79}^{0.18}_{-0.15}, -11.98}^{0.09}_{-0.09}, and {-12.32}^{0.10}_{-0.12} at z=1.4, 1.2, and 1 respectively. We obtain the IGM temperature at the mean density, T_0, and the adiabatic index, \gamma, as [\log (T_0/K), \gamma]= [{4.13}^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, {1.34}^{+0.10}_{-0.15}], [{3.79}^{+0.11}_{-0.11}, {1.70}^{+0.09}_{-0.09}] and [{4.12}^{+0.15}_{-0.25}, {1.34}^{+0.21}_{-0.26}] at z=1.4, 1.2 and 1 respectively. Our measurements of T_0 at z=1.4 and 1.2 are consistent with the expected trend from z<3 temperature measurements as well as theoretical expectations that, in the absence of any non-standard heating, the IGM should cool down after HeII reionization. Whereas, our T_0 measurements at z=1 show unexpectedly high IGM temperature. However, because of the relatively large uncertainty in these measurements of the order of \Delta T_0~5000 K, mostly emanating from the limited redshift path length of available data in these bins, we can not definitively conclude whether the IGM cools down at z<1.5. Lastly, we generate a mock dataset to test the constraining power of future measurement with larger datasets. The results demonstrate that, with redshift pathlength \Delta z \sim 2 for each redshift bin, three times the current dataset, we can constrain the T_0 of IGM within 1500K. Such precision would be sufficient to conclusively constrain the history of IGM thermal evolution at z < 1.5.

 - **Abstract**
 About a dozen exoplanetary systems have been discovered with three or more planets participating in a sequence of mean-motion resonances. The unique and complex architectures of these so-called "resonant chains" motivate efforts to characterize their planets holistically. In this work, we perform a comprehensive exploration of the spin-axis dynamics of planets in resonant chains. Planetary spin states are closely linked with atmospheric dynamics and habitability and are thus especially relevant to resonant chains like TRAPPIST-1, which hosts several temperate planets. Considering a set of observed resonant chains, we calculate the equilibrium states of the planetary axial tilts ("obliquities"). We show that high obliquity states exist for $\sim60\%$ of planets in our sample, and many of these states can be stable in the presence of tidal dissipation. Using case studies of two observed systems (Kepler-223 and TOI-1136), we demonstrate how these high obliquity states could have been attained during the initial epoch of disk-driven orbital migration that established the resonant orbital architectures. We show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets most likely have zero obliquities, with the possible exception of planet d. Overall, our results highlight that both the orbital and spin states of resonant chains are valuable relics of the early stages of planet formation and evolution.
