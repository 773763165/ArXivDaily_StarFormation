#### A dependence of binary and planetary system destruction on subtle  variations in the substructure in young star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 Simulations of the effects of stellar fly-bys on planetary systems in star-forming regions show a strong dependence on subtle variations in the initial spatial and kinematic substructure of the regions. For similar stellar densities, the more substructured star-forming regions disrupt up to a factor of two more planetary systems. We extend this work to look at the effects of substructure on stellar binary populations. We present $N$-body simulations of substructured, and non-substructured (smooth) star-forming regions in which we place different populations of stellar binaries. We find that for binary populations that are dominated by close ($<$100au) systems, a higher proportion are destroyed in substructured regions. However, for wider systems ($>$100au), a higher proportion are destroyed in smooth regions. The difference is likely due to the hard-soft, or fast-slow boundary for binary destruction. Hard (fast/close) binaries are more likely to be destroyed in environments with a small velocity dispersion (kinematically substructured regions), whereas soft (slow/wide) binaries are more likely to be destroyed in environments with higher velocity dispersions (non-kinematically substructured regions). Due to the vast range of stellar binary semimajor axes in star-forming regions ($10^{-2} - 10^4$au) these differences are small and hence unlikely to be observable. However, planetary systems have a much smaller initial semimajor axis range (likely $\sim$1 -- 100au for gas giants) and here the difference in the fraction of companions due to substructure could be observed if the star-forming regions that disrupt planetary systems formed with similar stellar densities.

 - **Abstract**
 An equivalent width (EW) based classification may cause the erroneous judgement to the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacerate objects (BL Lac) due to the diluting the line features by dramatic variations in the jet continuum flux. To help address the issue, the present paper explore the possible intrinsic classification on the bias of a random forest supervised machine learning algorithm. In order to do so, we compile a sample of 1680 Fermi blazars that have both gamma-rays and radio-frequencies data available from the 4LAC-DR2 catalog, which includes 1352 training and validation samples and 328 forecast samples. By studying the results for all of the different combinations of 23 characteristic parameters, we found that there are 178 optimal parameters combinations (OPCs) with the highest accuracy ($\simeq$ 98.89\%). Using the combined classification results from the nine combinations of these OPCs to the 328 forecast samples, we predict that there are 113 true BL Lacs (TBLs) and 157 false BL Lacs (FBLs) that are possible intrinsically FSRQs misclassified as BL Lacs. The FBLs show a clear separation from TBLs and FSRQs in the $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index, $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$, and X-band radio flux, ${\rm log}{F_{R}}$, plot. Phenomenally, existence a BL Lac to FSRQ (B-to-F) transition zone is suggested, where the FBLs are in the stage of transition from BL Lacs to FSRQs. Comparing the LSP Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) reported in the literatures, the majority of LSP CLBs are located at the B-to-F zone. We argue that the FBLs located at B-to-F transition zone are the most likely Candidates of CLBs.
#### Neutral gas coma dynamics: modeling of flows and attempts to link inner  coma structures to properties of the nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 Deriving properties of cometary nuclei from coma data is of significant importance for our understanding of cometary activity and has implications beyond. Ground-based data represent the bulk of measurements available for comets. Yet, to date these observations only access a comet's gas and dust coma at rather large distances from the surface and do not directly observe its surface. In contrast, spacecraft missions are one of the only tools that gain direct access to surface measurements. However, such missions are limited to roughly one per decade. We can overcome these challenges by recognising that the coma contains information about the nucleus's properties. In particular, the near-surface gas environment is most representative of the nucleus. It can inform us about the composition, regionality of activity, and sources of coma features and how they link to the topography, morphology, or other surface properties. The inner coma data is a particularly good proxy because it has not yet, or only marginally, been contaminated by coma chemistry or secondary gas sources. Additionally, the simultaneous observation of the innermost coma with the surface provides the potential to make a direct link between coma measurements and the nucleus. If we hope to link outer coma measurements obtained by Earth-based telescopes to the surface, we must first understand how the inner coma measurements are linked to the surface. Numerical models that describe the flow from the surface into the immediate surroundings are needed to make this connection. This chapter focuses on the advances made to understand the flow of the neutral gas coma from the surface to distances up to a few tens of nuclei radii. We describe both simple/heuristic models and state-of-the-art physically consistent models. Model limitations and what they each are best suited for are discussed.
#### Black-Hole Formation Accompanied by the Supernova Explosion of a  40-M$_{\odot}$ Progenitor Star

 - **Abstract**
 We have simulated the collapse and evolution of the core of a solar-metallicity 40-M$_{\odot}$ star and find that it explodes vigorously by the neutrino mechanism. This despite its very high ``compactness". Within $\sim$1.5 seconds of explosion, a black hole forms. The explosion is very asymmetrical and has a total explosion energy of $\sim$1.6$\times$10$^{51}$ ergs. At black hole formation, its baryon mass is $\sim$2.434 M$_{\odot}$ and gravitational mass is 2.286 M$_{\odot}$. Seven seconds after black hole formation an additional $\sim$0.2 M$_{\odot}$ is accreted, leaving a black hole baryon mass of $\sim$2.63 M$_{\odot}$. A disk forms around the proto-neutron star, from which a pair of neutrino-driven jets emanates. These jets accelerate some of the matter up to speeds of $\sim$45,000 km s$^{-1}$ and contain matter with entropies of $\sim$50. The large spatial asymmetry in the explosion results in a residual black hole recoil speed of $\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$. This novel black-hole formation channel now joins the other black-hole formation channel between $\sim$12 and $\sim$15 M$_{\odot}$ discovered previously and implies that the black-hole/neutron-star birth ratio for solar-metallicity stars could be $\sim$20%. However, one channel leaves black holes in perhaps the $\sim$5-15 M$_{\odot}$ range with low kick speeds, while the other leaves black holes in $\sim$2.5 M$_{\odot}$ mass range with high kick speeds. This exotic channel of lower-mass black hole formation, accompanied by a very asymmetrical supernova explosion, reveals the importance of performing detailed and fully 3D simulations in order to determine the mapping of initial states to outcomes in the core-collapse context.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is thought to host a huge population of interstellar objects (ISOs), numbering approximately $10^{15}\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ around the Sun, which are formed and shaped by a diverse set of processes ranging from planet formation to galactic dynamics. We define a novel framework: firstly to predict the properties of this Galactic ISO population by combining models of processes across planetary and galactic scales, and secondly to make inferences about the processes modelled, by comparing the predicted population to what is observed. We predict the spatial and compositional distribution of the Galaxy's population of ISOs by modelling the Galactic stellar population with data from the APOGEE survey and combining this with a protoplanetary disk chemistry model. Selecting ISO water mass fraction as an example observable quantity, we evaluate its distribution both at the position of the Sun and averaged over the Galactic disk; our prediction for the Solar neighbourhood is compatible with the inferred water mass fraction of 2I/Borisov. We show that the well-studied Galactic stellar metallicity gradient has a corresponding ISO compositional gradient. We also demonstrate the inference part of the framework by using the current observed ISO composition distribution to constrain the parent star metallicity dependence of the ISO production rate. This constraint, and other inferences made with this framework, will improve dramatically as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) progresses and more ISOs are observed. Finally, we explore generalisations of this framework to other Galactic populations, such as that of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we have revisited a class of coupled dark energy models where dark energy interacts with dark matter via phenomenological interactions. We included correction terms on the perturbation equations taking into account the perturbation of the Hubble rate, absent in previous works. We also consider more recent data sets such as cosmic microwave background anisotropies from \textit{Planck} 2018, type I-a supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ and data from baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift space distortions. We analyzed the influence of the SH0ES Cepheid host distances on the results and for one model the discrepancy of $H_0$ is reduced to $1.3\sigma$ when compared to $\Lambda$CDM and $4.6\sigma$ when compared to the SH0ES team.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present details of the construction of a wideband, cryogenic receiver and its successful commissioning on the Arecibo 12m telescope. The cryogenic receiver works in the 2.5-14 GHz frequency range. The telescope is operated by the Arecibo Observatory, and is located within the premises of the Observatory. We upgraded the current narrow band, room temperature receivers of the telescope with the new wideband receiver. The current receiver is built around a Quadruple-Ridged Flared Horn (QRHF) developed by Akgiray et al. (2013). To mitigate strong radio frequency interference (RFI) below 2.7 GHz, we installed a highpass filter before the first stage low noise amplifier (LNA). The QRHF, highpass filter, noise coupler and LNA are located inside a cryostat and are cooled to 15 K. The measured receiver temperature is 25 K (median value) over 2.5 GHz to 14 GHz. The system temperature measured at zenith is about 40 K near 3.1 and 8.6 GHz and the zenith antenna gains are 0.025 and 0.018 K/Jy at the two frequencies respectively. In the next stage of the development, we plan to upgrade the highpass filter in order to achieve better RFI rejection near 2.5 GHz, improve the aperture efficiency at 8.6 GHz and upgrade the IF system to increase the upper frequency of operation from 12 GHz to 14 GHz.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio bursts are strongly affected by radio-wave scattering on density inhomogeneities, changing their observed time characteristics, sizes, and positions. The same turbulence causes angular broadening and scintillation of galactic and extra-galactic compact radio sources observed through the solar atmosphere. Using large-scale simulations of radio-wave transport, the characteristics of anisotropic density turbulence from $0.1 \, R_\odot$ to $1$ au are explored. For the first time, a profile of heliospheric density fluctuations is deduced that accounts for the properties of extra-solar radio sources, solar radio bursts, and in-situ density fluctuation measurements in the solar wind at $1$ au. The radial profile of the spectrum-weighted mean wavenumber of density fluctuations (a quantity proportional to the scattering rate of radio-waves) is found to have a broad maximum at around $(4-7) \, R_\odot$, where the slow solar wind becomes supersonic. The level of density fluctuations at the inner scale (which is consistent with the proton resonance scale) decreases with heliocentric distance as $\langle\delta{n_i}^2 \rangle (r) \simeq 2 \times 10^7 \, (r/R_\odot-1)^{-3.7}$ cm$^{-6}$. Due to scattering, the apparent positions of solar burst sources observed at frequencies between $0.1$ and $300$ MHz are computed to be essentially cospatial and to have comparable sizes, for both fundamental and harmonic emission. Anisotropic scattering is found to account for the shortest solar radio burst decay times observed, and the required wavenumber anisotropy is $q_\parallel/q_\perp =0.25-0.4$, depending on whether fundamental or harmonic emission is involved. The deduced radio-wave scattering rate paves the way to quantify intrinsic solar radio burst characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet imaging has thus far enabled studies of wide-orbit ($>$10 AU) giant planet ($>$2 Jupiter masses) formation and giant planet atmospheres, with future 30 meter-class Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) needed to image and characterize terrestrial exoplanets. However, current state-of-the-art exoplanet imaging technologies placed on ELTs would still miss the contrast required for imaging Earth-mass habitable-zone exoplanets around low-mass stars by ~100x due to speckle noise--scattered starlight in the science image due to a combination of aberrations from the atmosphere after an adaptive optics (AO) correction and internal to the telescope and instrument. We have been developing a focal plane wavefront sensing technology called the Fast Atmospheric Self-coherent camera Technique (FAST) to address both of these issues; in this work we present the first results of simultaneous first and second stage AO wavefront sensing and control with a Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) and FAST, respectively, using two common path deformable mirrors. We demonstrate this "multi-WFS single conjugate AO" real-time control at up to 200 Hz loop speeds on the Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory (SEAL) testbed, showing a promising potential for both FAST and similar high-speed diffraction-limited second-stage wavefront sensing technologies to be deployed on current and future observatories, helping to remove speckle noise as the main limitation to ELT habitable exoplanet imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 The MIDAS (Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System) atomic force microscope on board the Rosetta comet orbiter investigated and measured the 3D topography of a few hundred nm to tens of $\mu$m sized dust particles of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with resolutions down to a few nanometers, giving insights into the physical processes of our early Solar System. We analyze the shapes of the cometary dust particles collected by MIDAS on the basis of a recently updated particle catalog with the aim to determine which structural properties remained pristine. We develop a set of shape descriptors and metrics such as aspect ratio, elongation, circularity, convexity, and particle surface/volume distribution, which can be used to describe the distribution of particle shapes. Furthermore, we compare the structure of the MIDAS dust particles and the clusters in which the particles were deposited to those found in previous laboratory experiments and by Rosetta/COSIMA. Finally, we combine our findings to calculate a pristineness score for MIDAS particles and determine the most pristine particles and their properties. We find that the morphological properties of all cometary dust particles at the micrometer scale are surprisingly homogeneous despite originating from diverse cometary environments (e.g., different collection targets that are associated with cometary activities/source regions and collection velocities/periods). We next find that the types of clusters found by MIDAS show good agreement with those defined by previous laboratory experiments, however, there are some differences to those found by Rosetta/COSIMA. Based on our result, we rate 19 out of 1082 MIDAS particles at least moderately pristine, i.e., they are not substantially flattened by impact, not fragmented, and/or not part of a fragmentation cluster.
#### Potential Atmospheric Compositions of TRAPPIST-1 c constrained by  JWST/MIRI Observations at 15 $μ$m

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05899
 - **Abstract**
 The first JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 c showed a secondary eclipse depth of 421+/-94 ppm at 15 um, which is consistent with a bare rock surface or a thin, O2-dominated, low CO2 atmosphere (Zieba et al. 2023). Here, we further explore potential atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1 c by comparing the observed secondary eclipse depth to synthetic spectra of a broader range of plausible environments. To self-consistently incorporate the impact of photochemistry and atmospheric composition on atmospheric thermal structure and predicted eclipse depth, we use a two-column climate model coupled to a photochemical model, and simulate O2-dominated, Venus-like, and steam atmospheres. We find that a broader suite of plausible atmospheric compositions are also consistent with the data. For lower pressure atmospheres (0.1 bar), our O2-CO2 atmospheres produce eclipse depths within 1$\sigma$ of the data, consistent with the modeling results of Zieba et al. (2023). However, for higher-pressure atmospheres, our models produce different temperature-pressure profiles and are less pessimistic, with 1-10 bar O2, 100 ppm CO2 models within 2.0-2.2$\sigma$ of the measured secondary eclipse depth, and up to 0.5% CO2 within 2.9$\sigma$. Venus-like atmospheres are still unlikely. For thin O2 atmospheres of 0.1 bar with a low abundance of CO2 ($\sim$100 ppm), up to 10% water vapor can be present and still provide an eclipse depth within 1$\sigma$ of the data. We compared the TRAPPIST-1 c data to modeled steam atmospheres of $\leq$ 3 bar, which are 1.7-1.8$\sigma$ from the data and not conclusively ruled out. More data will be required to discriminate between possible atmospheres, or to more definitively support the bare rock hypothesis.
#### Investigating Cosmological Models and the Hubble Tension using Localized  Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05918
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05918
 - **Abstract**
 We use the dispersion measure (DM) and redshift measurements of 24 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to compare cosmological models and investigate the Hubble tension. Setting a flat prior on the DM contribution from the Milky Way's halo, $\mathrm{DM_{halo}^{MW}}\in[5,\;80]\;\mathrm{pc\;cm^{-3}}$, the best fit for flat $\Lambda$CDM is obtained with a Hubble constant $H_0=95.8^{+7.8}_{-9.2}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ and a median matter density $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}\approx0.66$. The best fit for the $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ universe is realized with $H_0=94.2^{+5.6}_{-6.2}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$. We emphasize that the $H_0$ measurement depends sensitively on the $\mathrm{DM_{halo}^{MW}}$ prior. Since flat $\Lambda$CDM has one more free parameter, $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ is favored by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with a likelihood of $\sim73\%$ versus $\sim27\%$. Through simulations, we find that if the real cosmology is $\Lambda$CDM, a sample of $\sim1,150$ FRBs in the redshift range $0<z<3$ would be sufficient to rule out $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ at a $3\sigma$ confidence level, while $\sim550$ FRBs would be necessary to rule out $\Lambda$CDM if the real cosmology is instead $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$. The required sample sizes are different, reflecting the fact that the BIC imposes a severe penalty on the model with more free parameters. We further adopt a straightforward method of deriving an upper limit to $H_{0}$, without needing to consider the poorly known probability distribution of the DM contributed by the host galaxy. The theoretical DM contribution from the intergalactic medium ($\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$) at any $z$ is proportional to $H_0$. Thus, requiring the extragalactic $\mathrm{DM_{ext}}$ to be larger than $\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$ delimits $H_0$ to the upside. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM, we have $H_0<89.0\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ at a 95\% confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, largely known as PAHs, are widespread in the universe and have been identified in a vast array of astronomical observations from the interstellar medium to protoplanetary discs. They are likely to be associated with the chemical history of the universe and the emergence of life on Earth. However, their abundance on exoplanets remains unknown. Aims: We aim to investigate the feasibility of PAH formation in the thermalized atmospheres of irradiated and non-irradiated hot Jupiters around Sun-like stars. Methods: To this aim, we introduced PAHs in the 1-D self-consistent forward modeling code petitCODE. We simulated a large number of planet atmospheres with different parameters (e.g. carbon to oxygen ratio, metallicity, and effective planetary temperature) to study PAH formation. By coupling the thermochemical equilibrium solution from petitCODE with the 1-D radiative transfer code, petitRADTRANS, we calculated the synthetic transmission and emission spectra for irradiated and non-irradiated planets, respectively, and explored the role of PAHs on planet spectra. Results: Our models show strong correlations between PAH abundance and the aforementioned parameters. In thermochemical equilibrium scenarios, an optimal temperature, elevated carbon to oxygen ratio, and increased metallicity values are conducive to the formation of PAHs, with the carbon to oxygen ratio having the largest effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of methanol among the common ice components in interstellar clouds and protostellar envelopes has been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Methanol is often detected in the gas phase toward lines of sight shielded from UV radiation. We measured the volumetric density of methanol ice, grown under simulated interstellar conditions, and the infrared spectroscopy at different deposition temperatures and during the warm-up. The IR band strengths are provided and the experimental spectra are compared to those computed with a model. The transition from amorphous to crystalline methanol ice was also explored. Finally, we propose new observations of methanol ice at high resolution to probe the methanol ice structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We report detections of scintillation arcs for pulsars in globular clusters M5, M13 and M15 for the first time using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). From observations of these arcs at multiple epochs, we infer that screen-like scattering medium exists at distances $4.1_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ kpc, $6.7_{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ kpc and $1.3_{-1.0}^{+0.7}$ kpc from Earth in the directions of M5, M13 and M15, respectively. This means M5's and M13's scattering screens are located at $3.0_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$ kpc and $4.4_{-0.1}^{+0.1}$ kpc above the galactic plane, whereas, M15's is at $0.6_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ kpc below the plane. We estimate the scintillation timescale and decorrelation bandwidth for each pulsar at each epoch using the one-dimensional auto-correlation in frequency and time of the dynamic spectra. We found that the boundary of the Local Bubble may have caused the scattering of M15, and detected the most distant off-plane scattering screens to date through pulsar scintillation, which provides evidence for understanding the medium circulation in the Milky Way.
#### A Search for exoplanets around northern circumpolar stars VIII. filter  out a planet cycle from the multi-period radial velocity variations in M  giant HD 3638

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is written as a follow-up observations to reinterpret the radial velocity (RV) of HD 36384, where the existence of planetary systems is known to be ambiguous. In giants, it is, in general, difficult to distinguish the signals of planetary companions from those of stellar activities. Thus, known exoplanetary giant hosts are relatively rare. We, for many years, have obtained RV data in evolved stars using the high-resolution, fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO). Here, we report the results of RV variations in the M giant HD 36384. We have found two significant periods of 586d and 490d. Considering the orbital stability, it is impossible to have two planets at so close orbits. To determine the nature of the RV variability variations, we analyze the HIPPARCOS photometric data, some indicators of stellar activities, and line profiles. A significant period of 580d was revealed in the HIPPARCOS photometry. H{\alpha} EW variations also show a meaningful period of 582d. Thus, the period of 586d may be closely related to the rotational modulations and/or stellar pulsations. On the other hand, the other significant period of 490d is interpreted as the result of the orbiting companion. Our orbital fit suggests that the companion was a planetary mass of 6.6 MJ and is located at 1.3 AU from the host.

 The interior of Enceladus, a medium sized icy moon of Saturn hosts hydrothermal activity and exhibits tidal heating and related geyser-like activity. There are major disagreements in the existing literature on the porosity of the interior, due to the different theoretical assumptions on which porosity related calculations were based. We present an application of experimental equations - derived for Earth - for icy planetary objects and Enceladus in particular. We chose a set of boundary values for our initial parameters from measured porosity values of chondrite samples as references, and calculated the porosity related values of Enceladus using various approaches. We present a comprehensive investigation of the effects of using these different porosity calculation methods on icy moons. With our most realistic approach we also calculated the same values for Earth and Mars for comparison. Our result for Enceladus is a minimum porosity of about 5\% at the centre of the body. For the total pore volume we estimated $1.51*10^7 km^3$ for Enceladus, $2.11*10^8 km^3$ for Earth and $1.62*10^8 km^3$ for Mars. Using the same method, we estimated the total pore surface area. From this we derived that the pore surface under a given $1 km^2$ area of the surface on Enceladus is about $1.37*10^9 km^2$, while for Earth this value is only $5.07*10^7 km^2$.

 Context. The long-term evolution of an atmosphere and the remote detectability of its chemical constituents are susceptible to how the atmospheric gas responds to stellar irradiation. The response remains poorly characterized for water and its dissociation products, however, this knowledge is relevant to our understanding of hypothetical water-rich exoplanets. Aims: Our work investigates the effect of photoelectrons, namely, the non-thermal electrons produced by photoionizing stellar radiation on the heating and ionization of extended atmospheres dominated by the dissociation products of water. Methods: We used a Monte Carlo model and up-to-date collision cross sections to simulate the slowing down of photoelectrons in O-H mixtures for a range of fractional ionizations and photoelectron energies. Results: We find that that the fraction of energy of a photoelectron that goes into heating is similar in a pure H gas and in O-H mixtures, except for very low fractional ionizations, whereby the O atom remains an efficient sink of energy. The O-H mixtures will go on to produce more electrons because the O atom is particularly susceptible to ionization. We quantified all that information and present it in a way that can be easily incorporated into photochemical-hydrodynamical models. Conclusions: Neglecting the role of photoelectrons in models of water-rich atmospheres will result in overestimations of the atmospheric heating and, foreseeably, the mass-loss rates as well. It will also underestimate the rate at which the atmospheric gas becomes ionized, which may have implications for the detection of extended atmospheres with Lyman-{\alpha} transmission spectroscopy. Our simulations for the small exoplanets {\pi} Men c and TRAPPIST-1 b reveal that they respond very differently to irradiation from their host stars, with water remaining in molecular form at lower pressures in the latter case.

 - **Abstract**
 The enigmatic nature of 55 Cancri e has defied theoretical explanation. Any explanation needs to account for the observed variability of its secondary eclipse depth, which is at times consistent with zero in the visible/optical range of wavelengths -- a phenomenon that does not occur with its also variable infrared eclipses. Yet, despite this variability its transit depth remains somewhat constant in time and is inconsistent with opaque material filling its Hill sphere. The current study explores the possibility of a thin, transient, secondary atmosphere on 55 Cancri e that is sourced by geochemical outgassing. Its transient nature derives from the inability of outgassing to be balanced by atmospheric escape. As the outgassed atmosphere escapes and is replenished, it rapidly adjusts to radiative equilibrium and the temperature fluctuations cause the infrared eclipse depths to vary. Atmospheres of pure carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide produce sufficient Rayleigh scattering to explain the observed optical/visible eclipse depths, which vanish in the absence of an atmosphere and the presence of a dark rocky surface. Atmospheres of pure methane are ruled out because they produce insufficient Rayleigh scattering. Upcoming observations by the James Webb Space Telescope will potentially allow the atmospheric temperature and surface pressure, as well as the surface temperature, to be measured.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents new optical and near-UV spectra of 11 extremely powerful jetted quasars, with radio to optical flux density ratio $>$ 10$^3$, that concomitantly cover the low-ionization emission of \mgii\ and \hb\ as well as the \feii\ blends in the redshift range $0.35 \lesssim z \lesssim 1$. We aim to quantify broad emission line differences between radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) quasars by using the 4D eigenvector 1 parameter space and its Main Sequence (MS) and to check the effect of powerful radio ejection on the low ionization broad emission lines. The \hb\ and \mgii\ emission lines were measured by using non-linear multicomponent fittings as well as by analysing their full profile. We found that broad emission lines show large redward asymmetry both in \hb\ and \mgii. The location of our RL sources in a UV plane looks similar to the optical one, with weak \feiiuv\ emission and broad \mgii. We supplement the 11 sources with large samples from previous work to gain some general inferences. We found that, compared to RQ, our extreme RL quasars show larger median \hb\ full width at half maximum (FWHM), weaker \feii\ emission, larger \mbh, lower \lledd, and a restricted bf space occupation in the optical and UV MS planes. The differences are more elusive when the comparison is carried out by restricting the RQ population to the region of the MS occupied by RL sources, albeit an unbiased comparison matching \mbh\ and \lledd\ suggests that the most powerful RL quasars show the highest redward asymmetries in \hb.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a minimal basis of kernels furnishing the perturbative expansion of the density contrast and velocity divergence in powers of the initial density field that is applicable to cosmological models with arbitrary expansion history, thereby relaxing the commonly adopted Einstein-de-Sitter (EdS) approximation. For this class of cosmological models, the non-linear kernels are at every order given by a sum of terms, each of which factorizes into a time-dependent growth factor and a wavenumber-dependent basis function. We show how to reduce the set of basis functions to a minimal amount, and give explicit expressions up to order $n=5$. We find that for this minimal basis choice, each basis function individually displays the expected scaling behaviour due to momentum conservation, being non-trivial at $n\geq 4$. This is a highly desirable property for numerical evaluation of loop corrections. In addition, it allows us to match the density field to an effective field theory (EFT) description for cosmologies with an arbitrary expansion history, which we explicitly derive at order four. We evaluate the differences to the EdS approximation for $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, paying special attention to the irreducible cosmology dependence that cannot be absorbed into EFT terms for the one-loop bispectrum. Finally, we provide algebraic recursion relations for a special generalization of the EdS approximation that retains its simplicity and is relevant for mixed hot and cold dark matter models.
#### Quasi-periodic oscillation in short gamma-ray bursts from black  hole-neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are commonly attributed to the mergers of double neutron stars (NSs) or the mergers of a neutron star with a black hole (BH). While the former scenario was confirmed by the event GW170817, the latter remains elusive. Here, we consider the latter scenario in which, a NS is tidally disrupted by a fast spinning low-mass BH and the accretion onto the BH launches a relativistic jet and hence produces a sGRB. The merging binary's orbit is likely misaligned with the BH's spin. Hence, the Lense-Thirring precession around the BH may cause a hyper-accreting thick disk to precess in a solid-body manner. We propose that a jet, initially aligned with the BH spin, is deflected and collimated by the wind from the disk, therefore being forced to precess along with the disk. This would result in a quasi-periodic oscillation or modulation in the gamma-ray light curve of the sGRB, with a quasi-period of $\sim 0.01-0.1$ s. The appearance of the modulation may be delayed respective to the triggering of the light curve. This feature, unique to the BH-NS merger, may have already revealed itself in a few observed sGRBs (such as GRB 130310A), and it carries the spin-obit orientation information of the merging system. Identification of this feature would be a new approach to reveal spin-orbit-misaligned merging BH-NS systems, which are likely missed by the current gravitational-wave searching strategy principally targeting aligned systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The evolutionary status of the blue supergiant Sher 25 and its membership to the massive cluster NGC 3603 are investigated. Methods. A hybrid non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) spectrum synthesis approach is employed to analyse a high-resolution optical spectrum of Sher 25 and five similar early B-type comparison stars in order to derive atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances. Fundamental stellar parameters are determined by considering stellar evolution tracks, Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) data and complementary distance information. Interstellar reddening and the reddening law along the sight line towards Sher 25 are constrained employing UV photometry for the first time in addition to optical and infrared data. The distance to NGC 3603 is reevaluated based on Gaia DR3 data of the innermost cluster O-stars. Results. The spectroscopic distance derived from the quantitative analysis implies that Sher 25 lies in the foreground of NGC 3603, which is found to have a distance of $d_\mathrm{NGC 3603}$ = 6250$\pm$150 pc. A cluster membership is also excluded as the hourglass nebula is unaffected by the vigorous stellar winds of the cluster stars and from the different excitation signatures of the hourglass nebula and the nebula around NGC 3603. Sher 25 turns out to have a luminosity of log L/L$_\odot$ = 5.48$\pm$0.14, equivalent to that of a $\sim$27 $M_\odot$ supergiant in a single-star scenario, which is about half of the mass assumed so far, bringing it much closer in its characteristics to Sk-69{\deg}202, the progenitor of SN 1987A. Sher 25 is significantly older than NGC 3603. Further arguments for a binary (merger) evolutionary scenario of Sher 25 are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters are excellent tools to probe the history of the Galactic disk and properties of star formation. In this work, we present a study of an old age open cluster Berkley 39 using the observations from UVOT instrument of the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory. Making use of a machine learning algorithm, ML-MOC, we have identified a total of 861 stars as cluster members out of which 17 are blue straggler stars. In this work, we present a characterisation of 2 blue straggler stars. To estimate the fundamental parameters of blue straggler stars and their companions (if any), we constructed spectral energy distributions using UV data from swift/UVOT and GALEX, optical data from Gaia DR3, and infrared (IR) data from 2MASS, Spitzer/IRAC, and WISE. We find excess flux in UV in one blue straggler star, implying the possibility of a hot companion.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a multi-tracer full-shape analysis in Fourier space based on the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS) using the complete Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) DR16 luminous red galaxy (LRG) and emission line galaxy (ELG) samples. We study in detail the impact of the volume projection effect and different prior choices when doing the full-shape analysis based on the EFTofLSS model. We show that adopting a combination of Jeffreys prior and Gaussian prior can mitigate the volume effect and avoid exploring unphysical regions in the parameter space at the same time, which is crucial when jointly analysing the eBOSS LRG and ELG samples. We validate our pipeline using 1000 eBOSS EZmocks. By performing a multi-tracer analysis on mocks with comparable footprints, we find that cosmological constraints can be improved by $\sim10-40\%$ depending on whether we assume zero stochastic terms in the cross power spectrum, which breaks the degeneracy and boosts the constraints on the standard deviation of matter density fluctuation $\sigma_8$. Combining with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prior and fixing the spectral tilt $n_s$ to Planck value, our multi-tracer full-shape analysis measures $H_0=70.0\pm2.3~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega_m=0.317^{+0.017}_{-0.021}$, $\sigma_8=0.787_{-0.062}^{+0.055}$ and $S_8=0.809_{-0.078}^{+0.064}$, consistent with the Planck 2018 results. In particular, the constraint on $\sigma_8$ is improved beyond that obtained from the single tracer analysis by $18\%$, or by $27\%$ when assuming zero stochastic terms in the cross power spectrum.
#### Forming rocky exoplanets around K-dwarf stars

 - **Abstract**
 How multiple close-in super-Earths form around stars with masses lower than that of the Sun is still an open issue. Several recent modeling studies have focused on planet formation around M-dwarf stars, but so far no studies have focused specifically on K dwarfs, which are of particular interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. We aim to reproduce the currently known population of close-in super-Earths observed around K-dwarf stars and their system characteristics. We performed 48 high-resolution N-body simulations of planet formation via planetesimal accretion using the existing GENGA software running on GPUs. In the simulations we varied the initial disk mass and the solid and gas surface density profiles. Each simulation began with 12000 bodies with radii of between 200 and 2000 km around two different stars, with masses of 0.6 and 0.8 $M_{\odot}$. Most simulations ran for 20 Myr, with several simulations extended to 40 or 100 Myr. The mass distributions for the planets with masses between 2 and 12 $M_\oplus$ show a strong preference for planets with masses $M_p<6$ $M_\oplus$ and a lesser preference for planets with larger masses, whereas the mass distribution for the observed sample increases almost linearly. However, we managed to reproduce the main characteristics and architectures of the known planetary systems and produce mostly long-term angular-momentum-deficit-stable, nonresonant systems, but we require an initial disk mass of 15 $M_\oplus$ or higher and a gas surface density value at 1 AU of 1500 g cm$^{-2}$ or higher. Our simulations also produce many low-mass planets with $M<2$ $M_\oplus$, which are not yet found in the observed population, probably due to the observational biases. The final systems contain only a small number of planets, which could possibly accrete substantial amounts of gas, and these formed after the gas had mostly dissipated.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently, an upgrade consisting of seven densely instrumented strings in the center of the volume of the IceCube detector with new digital optical modules (DOMs) is being built. On each string, DOMs will be regularly spaced with a vertical separation of 3 m between depths of 2160 m and 2430 m below the surface of the ice, which is a denser configuration than the existing DOMs of IceCube detector. For a precise calibration of the IceCube Upgrade it is important to understand the properties of the ice, both inside and surrounding the deployment holes. The camera system together with the LED illumination system was developed and produced at Sungkyunkwan university and are installed in almost every DOM to measure these properties. For these calibration measurements, a new simulation framework, which produces expected images from various geometric and optical variables has been developed. Images produced from the simulation will be used to develop an analysis framework for the IceCube Upgrade camera calibration system and for the design of the IceCube Gen2 camera system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new optical transmission spectra for two hot Jupiters: WASP-25b (M = 0.56~M$_J$; R = 1.23 R$_J$; P =~3.76 days) and WASP-124b (M = 0.58~M$_J$; R = 1.34 R$_J$; P = 3.37 days), with wavelength coverages of 4200 - 9100\AA\ and 4570 - 9940\AA, respectively. These spectra are from the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (v.2) mounted on the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera & Spectrograph on Magellan Baade. No strong spectral features were found in either spectra, with the data probing 4 and 6 scale heights, respectively. \texttt{Exoretrievals} and \texttt{PLATON} retrievals favor stellar activity for WASP-25b, while the data for WASP-124b did not favor one model over another. For both planets the retrievals found a wide range in the depths where the atmosphere could be optically thick ($\sim0.4\mu$ - 0.2 bars for WASP-25b and 1.6 $\mu$ -- 32 bars for WASP-124b) and recovered a temperature that is consistent with the planets' equilibrium temperatures, but with wide uncertainties (up to $\pm$430$^\circ$K). For WASP-25b, the models also favor stellar spots that are $\sim$500-3000$^\circ$K cooler than the surrounding photosphere. The fairly weak constraints on parameters are owing to the relatively low precision of the data, with an average precision of 840 and 1240 ppm per bin for WASP-25b and WASP-124b, respectively. However, some contribution might still be due to an inherent absence of absorption or scattering in the planets' upper atmospheres, possibly because of aerosols. We attempt to fit the strength of the sodium signals to the aerosol-metallicity trend proposed by McGruder et al. 2023, and find WASP-25b and WASP-124b are consistent with the prediction, though their uncertainties are too large to confidently confirm the trend.
