#### Constraining on the non-standard cosmological models combining the  observations of high-redshift quasars and BAO

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we studied four types of cosmological models with different mechanisms driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, include Braneworld models, Chaplygin Gas models, Emergent Dark Energy models, and cosmological torsion models. Considering that the dynamics of these models at low redshifts are very similar and difficult to distinguish, we used the latest and largest UV and X-ray measurements of quasars (QSOs) observations covering the range of redshift $0.009<z<7.5$. However, the high intrinsic dispersion of this sample and the degeneracy between cosmological model parameters, we added 2D-BAO and 3D-BAO datasets to help us constrain the parameters of these cosmological models. Our results suggest that standard cold dark matter scenario may not be the best cosmological model preferred by the high-redshift observations. The Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) and cosmological constant plus torsion (named Case II) models perform best by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), but the $\Lambda$CDM is the best cosmological model preferred by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our work also supports that the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy and cosmological torsion models may alleviate the Hubble tension, the reported value of the Hubble constant obtained from QSO+BAO datasets combination lies between Planck 2018 observations and local measurements from the SH0ES collaboration, while other cosmological models all support that the Hubble constant tends to be closer to recent Planck 2018 results, but these model are penalized by information criterion.

 - **Abstract**
 The asteroid Athor, residing today in the inner main asteroid belt, has been recently associated as the source of EL enstatite meteorites to Earth. It has been argued that Athor formed in the terrestrial region -- as indicated by similarity in isotopic compositions between Earth and EL meteorites -- and was implanted in the belt $\gtrsim$60 Myr after the formation of the solar system. A recently published study modelling Athor's implantation in the belt (Avdellidou et al 2024) further concluded, using an idealized set of numerical simulations, that Athor cannot have been scattered from the terrestrial region and implanted at its current location unless the giant planet dynamical instability occurred {\em after} Athor's implantation ($\gtrsim$60~Myr). In this work, we revisit this problem with a comprehensive suite of dynamical simulations of the implantation of asteroids into the belt during the terrestrial planet accretion. We find that Athor-like objects can in fact be implanted into the belt long after the giant planets' dynamical instability. The probability of implanting Athor analogs when the instability occurs at $\lesssim15$~Myr is at most a factor of $\sim$2 lower than that of an instability occurring at $\sim100$~Myr after the solar system formation. Moreover, Athor's implantation can occur up to $\gtrsim$100 Myr after the giant planet instability. We conclude that Athor's link to EL meteorites does not constrain the timing of the solar system's dynamical instability.
#### Implantation of asteroids from the terrestrial planet region: The effect  of the timing of the giant planet instability

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical architecture and compositional diversity of the asteroid belt strongly constrain planet formation models. Recent Solar System formation models have shown that the asteroid belt may have been born empty and later filled with objects from the inner ($<$2~au) and outer regions (>5 au) of the solar system. In this work, we focus on the implantation of inner solar system planetesimals into the asteroid belt - envisioned to represent S and/or E- type asteroids - during the late-stage accretion of the terrestrial planets. It is widely accepted that the solar system's giant planets formed in a more compact orbital configuration and evolved to their current dynamical state due to a planetary dynamical instability. In this work, we explore how the implantation efficiency of asteroids from the terrestrial region correlates with the timing of the giant planet instability, which has proven challenging to constrain. We carried out a suite of numerical simulations of the accretion of terrestrial planets considering different initial distributions of planetesimals in the terrestrial region and dynamical instability times. Our simulations show that a giant planet dynamical instability occurring at $t\gtrapprox5$ Myr -- relative to the time of the sun's natal disk dispersal -- is broadly consistent with the current asteroid belt, allowing the total mass carried out by S-complex type asteroids to be implanted into the belt from the terrestrial region. Finally, we conclude that an instability that occurs coincident with the gas disk dispersal is either inconsistent with the empty asteroid belt scenario, or may require that the gas disk in the inner solar system have dissipated at least a few Myr earlier than the gas in the outer disk (beyond Jupiter's orbit).

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Traditionally, Globular Clusters (GCs) have been assumed to be quasi-relaxed non-rotating systems, characterized by spherical symmetry and orbital isotropy. However, in recent years, a growing set of observational evidence is unveiling an unexpected dynamical complexity in Galactic GCs. Indeed, kinematic studies show that a measurable amount of internal rotation is present in many present-day GCs. Aims. The objective of this work is to analyse the APOGEE-2 Value-Added Catalogs (VACs) DR17 data of a sample of 21 GCs to extend the sample showing signatures of systemic rotation, in order to better understand the kinematic properties of GCs in general. Also, we aim to identify the fastest rotating GC from the sample of objects with suitable measurements. Methods. From the sample of 23 GCs included in this work, the presence of systemic rotation was detected in 21 of the GCs, using three different methods. All these methods use the radial velocity referred to the cluster systemic velocity. Using the first method, it was possible to visually verify the clear-cut signature of systemic rotation. Whereas, using the second and third methods, it was possible to determine the amplitude of the rotation curve and the position angle of the rotation axis. Results. This study shows that 21 GCs have a signature of systemic rotation. For these clusters, the rotation amplitude and the position angle of the rotation axis have been calculated. The clusters cover a remarkable range of rotational amplitudes, from 0.77 km/s to 13.85 km/s.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse a lossy transmission line and the Johnson-Nyquist noise generated therein. A representation as a noisy two-port with a voltage and a current noise sources on one end of a noiseless two-port is given. An expression for the noise properties is given for an arbitrary temperature profile along the transmission line. Agreement is demonstrated between the general expression found here and special cases calculable using thermodynamics. This work is motivated by the REACH experiment to observe the global 21 cm signal for which modelling noise with exquisite precision is essential for a reliable calibration.
#### Challenges to Inflation in the Post-Planck Era

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based missions studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have progressively refined the parameter space in conventional models of inflation shortly ($\sim 10^{-37}$ seconds) after the big bang. While most inflationary scenarios proposed thus far in the context of GR have since been ruled out, the basic idea of inflation may still be tenable, albeit with several unresolved conundrums, such as conflicting initial conditions and inconsistencies with the measured CMB power spectrum. In the new slow-roll inflationary picture, inflation arising in plateau-like potentials requires an initiation beyond the Planck time. This delay may be consistent with the cutoff, $k_{\rm min}$, measured recently in the primordial power spectrum. However, the actual value of $k_{\rm min}$ would imply an initiation time too far beyond the big bang for inflation to solve the horizon problem. In this paper, we also describe several other undesirable consequences of this delay, including an absence of well motivated initial conditions and a significant difficulty providing a viable mechanism for properly quantizing the primordial fluctuations. Nevertheless, many of these inconsistencies may still be avoided if one introduces non-conventional modifications to inflation, such as a brief departure from slow-roll dynamics, possibly due to a dramatic change in the inflationary potential, inflation driven by multiple fields, or a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In addition, some of these difficulties could be mitigated via the use of alternative cosmologies based, e.g., on loop quantum gravity, which replaces the initial big-bang singularity with finite conditions at a bounce-like beginning.
#### Scales of Stability and Turbulence in the Molecular ISM

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10979
 - **Abstract**
 From the archival data of the BU-FCRAO $^{13}$ CO GRS, we measure the radial profiles of column density and turbulent velocity dispersion from the centers of molecular clouds outward into the surrounding diffuse molecular ISM. Averaged across spatial scales, the profiles are consistent with turbulence that is on average in hydrostatic equilibrium. We measure the turbulent kinetic energy (KE) and the gravitational potential energy (GE) within and the pressure energy (PE) outside the clouds. The distribution of the sum 2KE-|GE|-PE has a mean near zero indicating approximate virial equilibrium. The average pressure energy is consistent with estimates of the pressure of the multiphase ISM at the Galactic mid-plane. If the dynamical time scale of the turbulence scales with its crossing time, this apparent equilibrium may result from the rapid virialization of the KE and GE with respect to changes in PE. In a snapshot, the clouds appear to be in virial equilibrium within a confining pressure. However, the duration of the equilibrium is approximately the crossing time. An analysis of Larson's scaling relationships of line width and column density finds no correlation. Tthe inference of constant column density with cloud size is a misinterpretation of this lack of correlation.
#### Mutual Occurrence Ratio of Planets. I. New Clues to Reveal Origins of  Hot- and Warm-Jupiter from the RV Sample

 - **Abstract**
 Many studies have analyzed planetary occurrence rates and their dependence on the host's properties to provide clues to planet formation, but few have focused on the mutual occurrence ratio of different kinds of planets. Such relations reveal whether and how one type of planet evolves into another, e.g. from a cold Jupiter to a warm or even hot Jupiter, and demonstrate how stellar properties impact the evolution history of planetary systems. We propose a new classification of giant planets, i.e. cold Jupiter(CJ), warm Jupiter(WJ), and hot Jupiter(HJ), according to their position relative to the snow line in the system. Then, we derive their occurrence rates(${\eta}_{\rm HJ}$, ${\eta}_{\rm WJ}$, ${\eta}_{\rm CJ}$) with the detection completeness of RV(Radial Velocity) surveys(HARPS$\&$ CORALIE) considered. Finally, we analyze the correlation between the mutual occurrence ratios, i.e. ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}} / {\eta}_{\rm WJ}$, ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}} / {\eta}_{\rm HJ}$ or ${\eta}{_{\rm WJ}}/{\eta}_{\rm HJ}$, and various stellar properties, e.g. effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$. Our results show that the ${\eta}_{\rm HJ}$, ${\eta}_{\rm WJ}$ and ${\eta}_{\rm CJ}$ are increasing with the increasing $T_{\rm eff}$ when $T_{\rm eff}\in (4600,6600] K$. Furthermore, the mutual occurrence ratio between CJ and WJ, i.e. ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}} /{\eta}_{\rm WJ}$, shows a decreasing trend with the increasing $T_{\rm eff}$. But, both ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}}/{\eta}_{\rm HJ}$ and ${\eta}{_{\rm WJ}}/{\eta}_{\rm HJ}$ are increasing when the $T_{\rm eff}$ increases. Further consistency tests reveal that the formation processes of WJ and HJ may be dominated by orbital change mechanisms rather than the in-situ model. However, unlike WJ, which favors gentle disk migration, HJ favors a more violent mechanism that requires further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1641-463 is an unidentified gamma-ray source with a hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum, and thus it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for cosmic ray (CR) accelerators up to PeV energies (a PeVatron candidate). The source spatially coincides with the radio supernova remnant (SNR) G338.5+0.1, but has not yet been fully explored in the X-ray band. We analyzed newly taken NuSTAR data, pointing at HESS J1641-463, with 82 ks effective exposure time. There is no apparent X-ray counterpart of HESS J1641-463, while nearby stellar cluster, Mercer 81, and stray-light X-rays are detected. Combined with the archival Chandra data, partially covering the source, we derived an upper limit of $\sim 6\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 2-10 keV ($\sim 3\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 10-20 keV). If the gamma-ray emission is originated from decay of $\pi^0$ mesons produced in interactions between CR protons and ambient materials, secondary electrons in the proton-proton interactions can potentially emit synchrotron photons in the X-ray band, which can be tested by our X-ray observations. Although the obtained X-ray upper limits cannot place a constraint on the primary proton spectrum, it will be possible with a future hard X-ray mission.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarf stars are not only the most promising hosts for detection and characterization of small and potentially habitable planets, they provide leverage relative to solar-type stars to test models of planet formation and evolution. Using Gaia astrometry, adaptive optics imaging, and calibrated gyrochronologic relations to estimate stellar properties, filter binaries, and assign ages, we refined the radii of 179 transiting planets orbiting 119 single late K- and early M-type stars detected by the Kepler mission, and assigned stellar rotation-based ages ) to 115 of these. We constructed the radius distribution of <4R$_{\oplus}$ planets and assessed its evolution with time. As for solar-type stars, the inferred distribution contains distinct populations of "super-Earths" (at ~1.3R$_{\oplus}$) and "sub-Neptunes" (at ~2.2Rearth) separated by a gap or "valley" at $\approx$1.7R$_{\oplus}$ that has a period dependence that is significantly weaker (power law index of -0.026$^{+0.026}_{-0.017}$) than for solar-type stars. Sub-Neptunes are largely absent at short periods ($<$2 days) and high irradiance, a feature analogous to the "Neptune desert" observed around solar-type stars. The relative number of sub-Neptunes to super-Earths declines between the younger and older halves of the sample (median age 3.8 Gyr), although the formal significance is low ($p = 0.06$) because of the small sample size. The decline in sub-Neptunes appears to be more pronounced at long orbital periods vs. short periods; this is not due to detection bias and could indicate that these objects are inflated by a mechanism that operates at elevated irradiance, e.g. a runaway water greenhouse augmented by H/He.
#### Can mid-infrared spectral energy distribution quantitatively trace  protoplanetary disk evolution?

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) is the major tracer of protoplanetary disks. It was recently proposed to use the mid-IR (MIR) SED slope $\alpha$ defined between 2-24$\mu$m as a potential quantitative tracer of disk age. We critically examine the viability of this idea and confront it with additional statistics of IR luminosities and SED shapes. We point out that, because the statistical properties of most of the complicated physical factors involved in disk evolution are still poorly understood in a quantitative sense, the only viable way is to assume them to be random so that an idealized `average disk' can be defined, which allows the $\alpha$ histogram to trace its age. We confirm that the statistics of the zeroth order (luminosity), first order (slope $\alpha$) and second order characteristics (concavity) of the observed MIR SED indeed carry useful information upon the evolutionary processes of the `average disk' and provide useful constraints to future disk population synthesis modeling. We also demonstrate that intrinsic diversities in MIR SED shapes and luminosities are always large at the level of individual stars so that the application of the evolutionary path of the `average disk' to individual stars must be done with care. The data of all curves in plots are provided on GitHub.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The TOI-421 planetary system contains two sub-Neptune-type planets and is a prime target to study the formation and evolution of planets and their atmospheres. The inner planet is especially interesting as the existence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere at its orbital separation cannot be explained by current formation models without previous orbital migration. We jointly analysed photometric data of three TESS sectors and six CHEOPS visits as well as 156 radial velocity data points to retrieve improved planetary parameters. We also searched for TTVs and modelled the interior structure of the planets. Finally, we simulated the evolution of the primordial H-He atmospheres of the planets using two different modelling frameworks. We determine the planetary radii and masses of TOI-421 b and c to be $R_{\rm b} = 2.64 \pm 0.08 \, R_{\oplus}$, $M_{\rm b} = 6.7 \pm 0.6 \, M_{\oplus}$, $R_{\rm c} = 5.09 \pm 0.07 \, R_{\oplus}$, and $M_{\rm c} = 14.1 \pm 1.4 \, M_{\oplus}$. We do not detect any statistically significant TTV signals. Assuming the presence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, the interior structure modelling results in both planets having extensive envelopes. While the modelling of the atmospheric evolution predicts for TOI-421 b to have lost any primordial atmosphere that it could have accreted at its current orbital position, TOI-421 c could have started out with an initial atmospheric mass fraction somewhere between 10 and 35%. We conclude that the low observed mean density of TOI-421 b can only be explained by either a bias in the measured planetary parameters (e.g. driven by high-altitude clouds) and/or in the context of orbital migration. We also find that the results of atmospheric evolution models are strongly dependent on the employed planetary structure model.

 - **Abstract**
 In the design process of large adaptive mirrors numerical simulations represent the first step to evaluate the system design compliance in terms of performance, stability and robustness. For the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes increased system dimensions and bandwidths lead to the need of modeling not only the deformable mirror alone, but also all the system supporting structure or even the full telescope. The capability to perform the simulations with an acceptable amount of time and computational resources is highly dependent on finding appropriate methods to reduce the size of the resulting dynamic models. In this paper we present a framework developed together with the company Microgate to create a reduced order structural model of a large adaptive mirror as a preprocessing step to the control system simulations. The reduced dynamic model is then combined with the remaining system components allowing to simulate the full adaptive mirror in a computationally efficient way. We analyze the feasibility of our reduced models for Microgate's prototype of the adaptive mirror of the Giant Magellan Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on ALMA ACA observations of a high-density region of the Corona Australis cloud forming a young star cluster, and the results of resolving internal structures. In addition to embedded Class 0/I protostars in continuum, a number of complex dense filamentary structures are detected in the C18O and SO lines by the 7m array. These are sub-structures of the molecular clump that are detected by the TP array as the extended emission. We identify 101 and 37 filamentary structures with a few thousand AU widths in C18O and SO, respectively, called as feathers. The typical column density of the feathers in C18O is about 10^{22} cm^{-2}, and the volume density and line mass are ~ 10^5 cm^{-3}, and a few times M_{sun} pc^{-1}, respectively. This line mass is significantly smaller than the critical line mass expected for cold and dense gas. These structures have complex velocity fields, indicating a turbulent internal property. The number of feathers associated with Class 0/I protostars is only ~ 10, indicating that most of them do not form stars but rather being transient structures. The formation of feathers can be interpreted as a result of colliding gas flow as the morphology well reproduced by MHD simulations, supported by the the presence of HI shells in the vicinity. The colliding gas flows may accumulate gas and form filaments and feathers, and trigger the active star formation of the R CrA cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this work is to measure the abundances of n-capture elements in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs that were formed in globular clusters, and subsequently became unbound from the cluster. These N-rich stars, HD 25329, HD 74000, HD 160617, G 24-3, G 53-41, and G 90-3, were previously studied in Paper I. The abundances of the n-capture elements in these stars were compared to the abundances in normal metal-poor dwarfs and in globular cluster stars in the same metallicity range in order to find evidence of an enrichment of the material from which these N-rich stars were formed, by the ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) inside the cluster.The abundances of 15 elements, from Sr to Yb, were derived line by line by comparing the observed profiles to synthetic spectra in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs and nine classical metal-poor dwarfs. We show that, generally speaking, the behaviours of the intermediate metal-poor stars here studied and the extremely metal-poor stars are very different. In particular, the scatter of the [X/Fe] ratios is much smaller since many more stars contribute to the enrichment.Among our six metal-poor N-rich stars, three stars (G24-3 and HD 74000 and maybe also HD 160617) present an enrichment in elements formed by the s-process, typical of a contribution of AGB stars, unexpected at the metallicity of these stars. This suggests that the intracluster medium from which these stars were formed was enriched by a first generation of massive AGB stars. Another N-rich star, G53-41, is also rich in s-process elements, but since it is more metal-rich this could be due to the normal galactic enrichment by low-mass AGB stars before the formation of the cluster. In contrast, two stars (G90-3 and HD 25329) have an abundance pattern compatible with a pure r-process such as that seen in metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<--1.5.

 Asteroseismology coupled with eclipsing binary modelling shows a great potential in improving the efficiency of measurements or calibrations of the interior mixing profile in massive stars. This helps, for instance in treating the challenging and mysterious discrepancies between observations and models of its stellar structure and evolution. This paper discusses the findings in our work titled "$\beta$ Cephei pulsators in eclipsing binaries observed with TESS", which aimed to compile a comprehensive catalogue of $\beta$ Cep pulsators in eclipsing binaries. Seventy eight (78) pulsators of the $\beta$ Cep type in eclipsing binaries among which are 59 new discoveries were reported. Here, we also report a fresh analysis of eight additional stars which were outside the scope of the earlier mentioned work. Six $\beta$ Cep pulsators in eclipsing binaries are reported, among which 5 are new discoveries and 1 is a confirmation of a candidate earlier suggested in literature. Our sample allows for future ensemble asteroseismic modelling of massive pulsators in eclipsing binaries to treat the discrepancy between observations and models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) is dedicated to the astrometric exploration for habitable-zone Earth-like planets orbiting solar-type stars in close proximity, achieving unprecedented micro-arcsecond precision. Given the elevated precision, thorough consideration of photocenter jitters induced by stellar activity becomes imperative. This study endeavors to model the stellar activity of solar-type stars, compute astrometric noise, and delineate the detection limits of habitable planets within the astrometric domain. Simulations were conducted for identified primary targets of CHES, involving the generation of simulated observed data for astrometry and photometry, accounting for the impact of stellar activity. Estimation of activity levels in our samples was achieved through chromospheric activity indices, revealing that over 90% of stars exhibited photocenter jitters below 1 $\mu\mathrm{as}$. Notably, certain proximate stars, such as $\alpha$ Cen A and B, displayed more discernible noise arising from stellar activity. Subsequent tests were performed to evaluate detection performance, unveiling that stellar activity tends to have a less pronounced impact on planetary detectability for the majority of stars. Approximately 95% of targets demonstrated a detection efficiency exceeding 80%. However, for several cold stars, e.g., HD 32450 and HD 21531, with the habitable zones close to the stars, a reduction in detection efficiency was observed. These findings offer invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between stellar activity and astrometric precision, significantly advancing our understanding in the search for habitable planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present time-dependent nova outburst models with optically thick winds for a 1.2 and 1.35 $M_\odot$ white dwarfs (WDs) with a mass accretion rate of $5 \times 10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and for a 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD with $2 \times 10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The X-ray flash occurs 11 days before the optical peak of the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD and 2.5 days before the peak of the 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD. The wind mass loss rate of the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD (1.3 $M_\odot$ WD) reaches a peak of $6.4 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ ($7.4 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) at the epoch of the maximum photospheric expansion with the lowest photospheric temperature of $\log T_{\rm ph}$ (K)=4.33 (4.35). The nuclear energy generated during the outburst is lost in a form of radiation (61% for the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD; 47% for the 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD), gravitational energy of ejecta (39%; 52%), and kinetic energy of the wind (0.28%; 0.29%). We found an empirical relation for fast novae between the time to optical maximum from the outburst $t_{\rm peak}$ and the expansion timescale $\tau_{\rm exp}$ at $t=0$. With this relation, we are able to predict the time to optical maximum $t_{\rm peak}$ from the ignition model (at $t=0$) without following a time-consuming nova wind evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses can be measured by observing the impacts of the SMBHs on dynamical tracers around them. We present high angular resolution ($0.19$ arcsec or $\approx24$ pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the $^{12}$CO(3-2) line emission of the early-type galaxy NGC 4751, which reveal a highly-inclined regularly-rotating molecular gas disc with clear central Keplerian motions. Using a Hubble Space Telescope image to constrain the stellar mass distribution, we forward model the molecular gas kinematics and data cube in a Bayesian framework using the Kinematic Molecular Simulation code. Assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$), we infer a SMBH mass $M_\text{BH}=3.43^{+0.45}_{-0.44}\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$ and a F160W filter stellar $M/L$ $M/L_\text{F160W}=(2.68\pm0.11)$ $\text{M}_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}}$ (all quoted uncertainties are at $3\sigma$ confidence). Assuming a linearly spatially-varying $M/L$, we infer $M_\text{BH}=2.79_{-0.57}^{+0.75}\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$ and $\left(M/L_\text{F160W}\right)/\left(\text{M}_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}}\right)=3.07^{+0.27}_{-0.35}-0.09^{+0.08}_{-0.06}\,\left(R/\text{arcsec}\right)$, where $R$ is the galactocentric radius. We also present alternative SMBH mass estimates using the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method and SINFONI stellar kinematics. Assuming a cylindrically-aligned velocity ellipsoid (JAM$_\text{cyl}$) we infer $M_\text{BH}=(2.52\pm 0.36)\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$, while assuming a spherically-aligned velocity ellipsoid (JAM$_\text{sph}$) we infer $M_\text{BH}=(3.24\pm0.87)\times10^9$ $\text{M}_\odot$. Our derived masses are all consistent with one another, but they are larger than (and inconsistent with) one previous stellar dynamical measurement using Schwarzschil's method and the same SINFONI kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star inspirals contain information on nuclear matter above saturation density. However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Many superconducting on-chip filter-banks suffer from poor coupling to the detectors behind each filter. This is a problem intrinsic to the commonly used half wavelength filter, which has a maximum theoretical coupling of 50 %. In this paper we introduce a phase coherent filter, called a directional filter, which has a theoretical coupling of 100 %. In order to to study and compare different types of filter-banks, we first analyze the measured filter frequency scatter, losses, and spectral resolution of a DESHIMA 2.0 filter-bank chip. Based on measured fabrication tolerances and losses, we adapt the input parameters for our circuit simulations, quantitatively reproducing the measurements. We find that the frequency scatter is caused by nanometer-scale line-width variations and that variances in the spectral resolution is caused by losses in the dielectric only. Finally, we include these realistic parameters in a full filter-bank model and simulate a wide range of spectral resolutions and oversampling values. For all cases the directional filter-bank has significantly higher coupling to the detectors than the half-wave resonator filter-bank. The directional filter eliminates the need to use oversampling as a method to improve the total efficiency, instead capturing nearly all the power remaining after dielectric losses.

 - **Abstract**
 To fully exploit the data from next generation surveys, we need an accurate modelling of the matter power spectrum up to non-linear scales. Therefore in this work we present the halo model reaction framework for the Generalized Cubic Covariant Galileon (GCCG) model, a modified gravity model within the Horndeski class of theories which extends the cubic covariant Galileon (G3) by including power laws of the derivatives of the scalar field in the K-essence and cubic terms. We modify the publicly available software ReACT for the GCCG in order to obtain an accurate prediction of the non-linear power spectrum. In the limit of the G3 model we compare the modified ReACT code to $N$-body simulations and we find agreement within 5\% for a wide range of scales and redshifts. We then study the relevant effects of the modifications introduced by the GCCG on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Finally, we provide forecasts from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by next generation surveys using a Fisher matrix method. We show that future data will be able to constrain at 1$\sigma$ the two additional parameters of the model at the percent level and that considering non-linear corrections to the matter power spectrum beyond the linear regime is crucial to obtain this result.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of masses of neutron stars, particularly the maximum mass value, is considered a probe of their formation, evolution and internal physics (i.e., equation of state). This mass distribution could in principle be inferred from the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. Using mock catalogues of $10^5$ dark sirens events, expected to be detected by Einstein Telescope over an operational period of $\sim1\, \rm year$ , we show how the biased luminosity distance measurement induced by gravitational lensing affects the inferred redshift and mass of the merger. This results in higher observed masses than expected. Up to $2\%$ of the events are predicted to fall above the maximum allowed neutron star mass depending on the intrinsic mass distribution and signal-to-noise ratio threshold adopted. The underlying true mass distribution and maximum mass could still be approximately recovered in the case of bright standard sirens.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 4395 is a dwarf Seyfert 1 galaxy with a possible intermediate-mass black hole of several $\rm{10^4}$ solar masses in its center. As a well-studied object, its broad line region size has been measured via H$\rm{\alpha}$ time lag in numerous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) and narrow-band photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) campaigns. Here we present its H$\rm{\alpha}$ time lag measurement using broad-band photometric data, with the application of our newly-developed ICCF-Cut method as well as the JAVELIN and $\chi ^2$ methods. utilizing the minute-cadence multi-band light curves obtained from the $\rm{2}$m FTN and $\rm{10.4}$m GTC telescopes in recent works, we measured its H$\rm{\alpha}$ lag as approximately $40 \sim 90$ minutes from broad-band PRM. With the H$\rm{\alpha}$ emission line velocity dispersion, we calculated its central black hole mass as $\rm M_{\rm BH} = (8\pm4) \times 10^3\, M_{\rm \odot}$. These results are comparable with previous results obtained by narrow-band PRM and SRM, providing further support to an intermediate-mass black hole in NGC 4395. In addition, our study also validates the ICCF-Cut as an effective method for broad-band PRM, which holds the potential for widespread application in the era of large multi-epoch, high-cadence photometric surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Quickly sky localizing of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) from the foreground of double white dwarf (DWD) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. In an orbit period of the space crafts, there is an optimal orbital position of the GW detectors to observe GW sources, where the signal intensity is at its peak. From the model Q3-d, five MBHB sources are selected based on the optimal observation orbital positions of the GW detectors, which are associated with the orientation of the MBHB perpendicular to the detection arms. For two MBHB sources of lower intensity, luminosity distance uncertainties, $\Delta D_L$/$D_L$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level from the overlapping GW signals of MBHB and DWD sources, when employing wavelet decomposition and reconstruction methods, are improved by $\sim$ 2 times and $\sim$ 10 times. Besides, the angular resolutions $\Delta \Omega_s$ are also improved by a factor of $\sim$ 35 and $\sim$ 8. These results imply that we can obtain relatively high accuracy of quickly localizing MBHB from the overlapped GW signals with DWDs at the best observation orbit position. The luminosity distance uncertainties at the 95$\%$ confidence level for MBHB sources with the higher sign-noise ratio, have constraints on the precision of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We forecast constraints on minimal model-independent parametrisations of several Modified Gravity theories using mock Stage-IV cosmic shear data. We include nonlinear effects and screening, which ensures recovery of General Relativity on small scales. We introduce a power spectrum emulator to accelerate our analysis and evaluate the robustness of the growth index parametrisation with respect to two cosmologies: $\Lambda$CDM and the normal branch of the DGP model. We forecast the uncertainties on the growth index $\gamma$ to be of the order $\sim 10\%$. We find that our halo-model based screening approach demonstrates excellent performance, meeting the precision requirements of Stage-IV surveys. However, neglecting the screening transition results in biased predictions for cosmological parameters. We find that the screening transition shows significant degeneracy with baryonic feedback, requiring a much better understanding of baryonic physics for its detection. Massive neutrinos effects are less prominent and challenging to detect solely with cosmic shear data.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. Aims. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R = 35,000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf HD 984 B. By measuring its C/O and 12CO/13CO ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters. Methods. We analysed the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {\mu}m) of HD 984 B using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitRADTRANS, using both clear and cloudy models. Results. Using our best-fit model, we find C/O = 0.50+0.01-0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for HD 984 B which agrees with that of its host star within 1{\sigma} (0.40+0.20-0.20). We also retrieve an isotopolog 12CO/13CO ratio of 98+20-25 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the Sun. In addition, HD 984 B has a substellar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.62+0.02-0.02. Finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. Conclusions. From our measured C/O and 12CO/13CO, the favored formation mechanism of HD 984 B seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m < 13 MJup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. However, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely.
#### Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars in MaStar: identification and  classification

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars populating the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar evolution are relevant contributors to the spectra of ~1 Gyr old populations. Atmosphere models for these types are uncertain, due to complex molecules and mass-loss effects. Empirical spectra are then crucial, but samples are small due to the short (~3 Myr) TP-AGB lifetime. Here we exploit the vastness of the MaNGA Stellar library MaStar (~60,000 spectra) to identify C,O-rich type stars. We define an optical colour selection with cuts of (g-r)>2 and (g-i)<1.55(g-r)-0.07, calibrated with known C- and O- rich spectra. This identifies C-,O-rich stars along clean, separated sequences. An analogue selection is found in V,R,I bands. Our equation identifies C- and O-rich spectra with predictive performance metric F1-scores of 0.72 and 0.74 (over 1), respectively. We finally identify 41 C- and 87 O-rich type AGB stars in MaStar, 5 and 49 of which do not have a SIMBAD counterpart. We also detect a sample of non-AGB, dwarf C-stars. We further design a fitting procedure to classify the spectra into broad spectral types, by using as fitting templates empirical C and O-rich spectra. We find remarkably good fits for the majority of candidates and categorise them into C- and O-rich bins following existing classifications, which correlate to effective temperature. Our selection models can be applied to large photometric surveys (e.g. Euclid, Rubin). The classified spectra will facilitate future evolutionary population synthesis models.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust particles in protoplanetary disks, lacking support from pressure, rotate at velocities exceeding those of the surrounding gas. Consequently, they experience a head-wind from the gas that drives them toward the central star. Radial drift occurs on timescales much shorter than those inferred from disk observations or those required for dust to aggregate and form planets. Additionally, turbulence is often assumed to amplify the radial drift of dust in planet-forming disks when modeled through an effective viscous transport. However, the local interactions between turbulent eddies and particles are known to be significantly more intricate than in a viscous fluid. Our objective is to elucidate and characterize the dynamic effects of Keplerian turbulence on the mean radial and azimuthal velocities of dust particles. We employ 2D shearing-box incompressible simulations of the gas, which is maintained in a developed turbulent state while rotating at a sub-Keplerian speed. Dust is modeled as Lagrangian particles set at a Keplerian velocity, therefore experiencing a radial force toward the star through drag. Turbulent eddies are found to reduce the radial drift, while simultaneously enhancing the azimuthal velocities of small particles. This dynamic behavior arises from the modification of dust trajectories due to turbulent eddies.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar system's distant reaches exhibit a wealth of anomalous dynamical structure, hinting at the presence of a yet-undetected, massive trans-Neptunian body - Planet 9. Previous analyses have shown how orbital evolution induced by this object can explain the origins of a broad assortment of exotic orbits, ranging from those characterized by high perihelia to those with extreme inclinations. In this work, we shift the focus toward a more conventional class of TNOs, and consider the observed census of long-period, nearly planar, Neptune-crossing objects as a hitherto-unexplored probe of the Planet 9 hypothesis. To this end, we carry out comprehensive $N-$body simulations that self-consistently model gravitational perturbations from all giant planets, the Galactic tide, as well as passing stars, stemming from initial conditions that account for the primordial giant planet migration and sun's early evolution within a star cluster. Accounting for observational biases, our results reveal that the orbital architecture of this group of objects aligns closely with the predictions of the P9-inclusive model. In stark contrast, the P9-free scenario is statistically rejected at a $\sim5\,\sigma$ confidence-level. Accordingly, this work introduces a new line of evidence supporting the existence of Planet 9 and further delineates a series of observational predictions poised for near-term resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia Collaboration has recently reported the detection of a 33 M$_\odot$ black hole in a wide binary system located in the Solar neighbourhood. Here we explore the relationship between this black hole, known as Gaia BH3, and the nearby ED-2 halo stellar stream. We study the orbital characteristics of the Gaia BH3 binary and present measurements of the chemical abundances of ED-2 member stars derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT. We find that the Galactic orbit of the Gaia BH3 system and its metallicity are entirely consistent with being part of the ED-2 stream. The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe. This is the first black hole unambiguously associated with a disrupted star cluster. We infer a plausible mass range for the cluster to be relatively narrow, between $2\times 10^3M_\odot$ and $4.2\times 10^4M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole could have formed directly from the collapse of a massive very-metal-poor star, but that the alternative scenario of binary interactions inside the cluster environment also deserves to be explored.

 - **Abstract**
 The power spectrum and voxel intensity distribution (VID) are two summary statistics that can be applied to condense the information encoded in line-intensity maps. The information contained in both summary statistics is highly complementary, and their combination allows for a major increase in precision of parameter estimation from line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. Until recently, combination of these statistics required simulation-based estimations of their covariance. In this work we leverage an analytical model of covariance between these observables to run a joint Fisher forecast focusing on the CO(1-0) rotational line targeted by the COMAP survey and a wider, shallower hypothetical iteration. We consider a generalized phenomenological non-CDM model, models with axion dark matter, and local primordial non-Gaussianity, to highlight where a combined analysis of the power spectrum and VID can be most useful. Our results demonstrate improvements in sensitivity to beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics over analyses using either the power spectrum or VID on their own, by factors ranging from 2 to 50, showcasing the potential of joint analyses in unlocking new insights into fundamental physics with LIM surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to assess observational evidence for potential atmospheric biosignatures on exoplanets, it will be essential to test whether spectral fingerprints from multiple gases can be explained by abiotic or biotic-only processes. Here, we develop and apply a coupled 1D atmosphere-ocean-ecosystem model to understand how primitive biospheres, which exploit abiotic sources of H2, CO and O2, could influence the atmospheric composition of rocky terrestrial exoplanets. We apply this to the Earth at 3.8 Ga and to TRAPPIST-1e. We focus on metabolisms that evolved before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which consume H2 and CO and produce potentially detectable levels of CH4. O2-consuming metabolisms are also considered for TRAPPIST-1e, as abiotic O2 production is predicted on M-dwarf orbiting planets. We show that these biospheres can lead to high levels of surface O2 (approximately 1-5 %) as a result of \ch{CO} consumption, which could allow high O2 scenarios, by removing the main loss mechanisms of atomic oxygen. Increasing stratospheric temperatures, which increases atmospheric OH can reduce the likelihood of such a state forming. O2-consuming metabolisms could also lower O2 levels to around 10 ppm and support a productive biosphere at low reductant inputs. Using predicted transmission spectral features from CH4, CO, O2/O3 and CO2 across the hypothesis space for tectonic reductant input, we show that biotically-produced CH4 may only be detectable at high reductant inputs. CO is also likely to be a dominant feature in transmission spectra for planets orbiting M-dwarfs, which could reduce the confidence in any potential biosignature observations linked to these biospheres.
