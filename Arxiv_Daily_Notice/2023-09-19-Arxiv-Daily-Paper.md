 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSG) are key objects for the evolution of massive stars and their endpoints, but uncertainties in their underlying mass-loss mechanism have thus far prevented an appropriate framework for massive star evolution. We analyse an empirical mass loss"kink" feature uncovered by Yang et al., and we highlight its similarity to hot star radiation-driven wind models and observations at the optically thin/thick transition point. We motivate a new RSG mass-loss prescription that depends on the Eddington factor Gamma (including both a steep L dependence and an inverse steep M dependence). We subsequently implement this new RSG mass-loss prescription in the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that our physically motivated mass-loss behaviour naturally reproduces the Humphreys-Davidson limit without a need for any ad-hoc tweaks. It also resolves the RSG supernova "problem". We argue that a universal behaviour of radiation-driven winds across the HR diagram, independent of the exact source of opacity, is a key feature of the evolution of the most massive stars.
#### Evolution of cosmic filaments in the MTNG simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshift with emphasis on some important properties: filament lengths, growth rates, and radial profiles of galaxy densities. Following an observation-driven approach, we build cosmic filament catalogues at z=0,1,2,3 and 4 from the galaxy distributions of the large hydro-dynamical run of the MilleniumTNG project. We employ the extensively used DisPerSE cosmic web finder code, for which we provide a user-friendly guide, including the details of a physics-driven calibration procedure, with the hope of helping future users. We perform the first statistical measurements of the evolution of connectivity in a large-scale simulation, finding that the connectivity of cosmic nodes (defined as the number of filaments attached) globally decreases from early to late times. The study of cosmic filaments in proper coordinates reveals that filaments grow in length and radial extent, as expected from large-scale structures in an expanding Universe. But the most interesting results arise once the Hubble flow is factored out. We find remarkably stable comoving filament length functions and over-density profiles, showing only little evolution of the total population of filaments in the past ~12.25 Gyrs. However, by tracking the spatial evolution of individual structures, we demonstrate that filaments of different lengths actually follow different evolutionary paths. While short filaments preferentially contract, long filaments expand along their longitudinal direction with growth rates that are the highest in the early, matter dominated Universe. Filament diversity at fixed redshift is also shown by the different (~$5 \sigma$) density values between the shortest and longest filaments. Our results hint that cosmic filaments can be used as additional probes for dark energy, but further theoretical work is still needed.

 - **Abstract**
 The mutual inclination between planets orbiting the same star provides key information to understand the formation and evolution of multi-planet systems. In this work, we investigate the potential of Gaia astrometry in detecting and characterizing cold Jupiters in orbits exterior to the currently known TESS planet candidates. According to our simulations, out of the $\sim 3350$ systems expected to have cold Jupiter companions, Gaia, by its nominal 5-year mission, should be able to detect $\sim 200$ cold Jupiters and measure the orbital inclinations with a precision of $\sigma_{\cos i}<0.2$ in $\sim 120$ of them. These numbers are estimated under the assumption that the orbital orientations of the CJs follow an isotropic distribution, but these only vary slightly for less broad distributions. We also discuss the prospects from radial velocity follow-ups to better constrain the derived properties and provide a package to do quick forecasts using our Fisher matrix analysis. Overall, our simulations show that Gaia astrometry of cold Jupiters orbiting stars with TESS planets can distinguish dynamically cold (mean mutual inclination $\lesssim5^\circ$) from dynamically hot systems (mean mutual inclination $\gtrsim 20^\circ$), placing a new set of constraints on their formation and evolution.

 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument is a critical technology demonstrator for NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory. With a predicted visible-light flux ratio detection limit of 1E-8 or better, it will be capable of reaching new areas of parameter space for both gas giant exoplanets and circumstellar disks. It is in the final stages of integration and test at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with an anticipated delivery to payload integration in the coming year. This paper will review the instrument systems, observing modes, potential observing applications, and overall progress toward instrument integration and test.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet detections and characterizations via direct imaging require high contrast and high angular resolution. These requirements typically require (i) cutting-edge instrumental facilities, (ii) optimized differential imaging to introduce a diversity in the signals of the sought-for objects, and (iii) dedicated processing algorithms to further eliminate the residual stellar leakages. Substantial efforts have been undertaken on the design of more efficient post-processing algorithms but their performance remains upper-bounded at shorter angular separations due to the the lack of diversity induced by the processing of each epoch of observations individually. We propose a new algorithm that is able to combine several observations of the same star by accounting for the Keplerian orbital motion across epochs of the sought-for sources in order to constructively co-add their weak signals. The proposed algorithm, PACOME, integrates an exploration of the plausible orbits within a statistical detection and estimation formalism. It is extended to a multi-epoch combination of the maximum likelihood framework of PACO, which is a mono-epoch post-processing algorithm. We derive a reliable multi-epoch detection criterion, interpretable both in terms of probability of detection and of false alarm. We tested the proposed algorithm on several datasets obtained from the VLT/SPHERE instrument with IRDIS and IFS. By resorting to injections of synthetic exoplanets, we show that PACOME is able to detect sources remaining undetectable in mono-epoch frameworks. The gain in detection sensitivity scales as high as the square root of the number of epochs. We also applied PACOME on a set of observations from the HR 8799 star hosting four known exoplanets, which are detected with very high signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, its implementation is efficient, fast, and fully automatized.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical research into exoplanets has delivered thousands of confirmed planets orbiting distant stars. These planets span a wide ranges of size and composition, with diversity also being the hallmark of system configurations, the great majority of which do not resemble our own solar system. Unfortunately, only a handful of the known planets have been characterized spectroscopically thus far, leaving a gaping void in our understanding of planetary formation processes and planetary types. To make progress, astronomers studying exoplanets will need new and innovative technical solutions. Astrophotonics -- an emerging field focused on the application of photonic technologies to observational astronomy -- provides one promising avenue forward. In this paper we discuss various astrophotonic technologies that could aid in the detection and subsequent characterization of planets and in particular themes leading towards the detection of extraterrestrial life.
#### Millimeter emission in photoevaporating disks is determined by early  substructures

 - **Abstract**
 [abridged]Photoevaporation and dust-trapping are individually considered to be important mechanisms in the evolution and morphology of protoplanetary disks. We studied how the presence of early substructures affects the evolution of the dust distribution and flux in the millimeter continuum of disks that are undergoing photoevaporative dispersal. We also tested if the predicted properties resemble those observed in the population of transition disks. We used the numerical code Dustpy to simulate disk evolution considering gas accretion, dust growth, dust-trapping at substructures, and mass loss due to X-ray and EUV (XEUV) photoevaporation and dust entrainment. Then, we compared how the dust mass and millimeter flux evolve for different disk models. We find that, during photoevaporative dispersal, disks with primordial substructures retain more dust and are brighter in the millimeter continuum than disks without early substructures, regardless of the photoevaporative cavity size. Once the photoevaporative cavity opens, the estimated fluxes for the disk models that are initially structured are comparable to those found in the bright transition disk population ($F_\textrm{mm} > 30\, \textrm{mJy}$), while the disk models that are initially smooth have fluxes comparable to the transition disks from the faint population ($F_\textrm{mm} < 30\, \textrm{mJy}$), suggesting a link between each model and population. Our models indicate that the efficiency of the dust trapping determines the millimeter flux of the disk, while the gas loss due to photoevaporation controls the formation and expansion of a cavity, decoupling the mechanisms responsible for each feature. In consequence, even a planet with a mass comparable to Saturn could trap enough dust to reproduce the millimeter emission of a bright transition disk, while its cavity size is independently driven by photoevaporative dispersal.
#### Optimal Fitting, Debiasing, and Cosmic Ray Rejection for Detectors Read  Out Up-the-Ramp

 - **Abstract**
 This paper derives the optimal fit to a pixel's count rate in the case of an ideal detector read out nondestructively in the presence of both read and photon noise. The approach is general for any readout scheme, provides closed-form expressions for all quantities, and has a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants (groups of reads). I also derive the bias of the fit from estimating the covariance matrix and show how to remove it to first order. The ramp-fitting algorithm I describe provides the $\chi^2$ value of the fit of a line to the accumulated counts, enabling hypothesis testing for cosmic ray hits using the entire ramp. I show that this approach can be substantially more sensitive than one that only uses the difference between sequential resultants, especially for long ramps and for jumps that occur in the middle of a group of reads. It can also be implemented for a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants. I provide and describe a pure Python implementation of these algorithms that can process a 10-resultant ramp on a $4096 \times 4096$ detector in $\approx$8 seconds with bias removal, or in $\approx$20 seconds including iterative cosmic ray detection and removal, on a single core of a 2020 Macbook Air. This Python implementation, together with tests and a tutorial notebook, are available at https://github.com/t-brandt/fitramp.

 - **Abstract**
 The proper motions of a source obtained at different epochs or in different spectral regions should in principle be consistent. However, in the case of a binary source or a source with associated ejecta, they could be different depending on the epochs when the observations were made and on what emission is traced in each spectral region. In this paper we determine the radio proper motions of the ultra-cool dwarf binary VHS 1256$-$1257AB from Very Large Array (VLA) observations, that we find are consistent within error ($\simeq 2-3\%$) with those reported by Gaia DR3. The comparison of the proper motions and the analysis of the VLA data imply that, as in the optical, the radio emission is coming in comparable amounts from both components of the unresolved binary.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent measurements of the spectral intensities of cosmic-ray nuclei have suggested that the ratio of Boron to Carbon nuclei, $R(E)$, comprises two components, one which carries all of the energy dependence and the other a constant independent of energy per nucleon. This supports the earlier theoretical expectations and results of gamma-ray astronomy that one of these components is attributable to spallation in a cocoon like region surrounding the sources and the other in the general interstellar medium before cosmic rays leak away from the Galaxy. A new way of analyzing cosmic-ray spectra is presented here to shed light on the recent findings: based solely on the assumption that the B nuclei in cosmic rays are entirely the products of spallation of heavier nuclei, we solve a cascade of propagation equations to derive both the source-spectra of p, C, O, and Fe nuclei prior to any spallation effects and the energy dependence of the leakage lifetime, $\tau(E)$, implied by the energy dependence of $R(E)$. We find that the source spectra of these nuclei are nearly power laws with the same index, in the nested leaky-box model where the energy-dependent part of the matter is traversed in a cocoon surrounding the sources, and the constant part of the traversal is in the interstellar medium. This is not the case for the alternate choice with the grammage in the sources being a constant. We briefly discuss our results and comment on some aspects of cosmic-ray propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is underway in the W49N molecular cloud (MC) at a high level of efficiency, with almost twenty ultra-compact (UC) HII regions observed thus far, indicating a recent formation of massive stars. Previous works have suggested that this cloud is undergoing a global contraction. We analyse the data on OH masers in the molecular cloud W49N, observed with the VLBA at the 1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz transitions in LCP and RCP with an aim to study the global kinematics of the masers. We carried out our study based on the locations and observed velocities of the maser spots. The velocities were fitted to the straight line of V$_{obs}$-V$_{sys}$ versus d$_{(\alpha, \delta)m}$, resulting in V$_{ftd}$. The difference between the fitted values and those obtained from observations is $\Delta $V. The V$_{obs}$-V$_{sys}$ velocity shows a gradient as a function of the distance to ($\alpha, \delta$)$_{m}$, where the closer spots have the largest velocities. Spots with similar velocities are located in different sectors, with respect to ($\alpha, \delta$)$_{m}$. Then, we assumed that the spots are moving towards a contraction centre (CC$_{OH}$), which is at the apex of a CONUS. We also assumed that the distance of each spot to CC$_{OH}$ is d$_{cc}$ and that they fall with a velocity V$_{CC}$, with the total velocity being V$_{Tot}$. Using this velocity, we estimated the free-fall velocity. The observed dispersion with respect to the global trend against $d_{cc}$, shows a maximum at 0.12 pc, with a decay from 0.12 to 0.19 pc, which is faster than that taking place between 0.19 and 0.42 pc. Based on $V_{tot}$ an inner mass of M$_{inn}$=2500 $M_{\odot}$ was estimated.The velocities of the OH spots at W49N, together with their positions respect $(\alpha, \delta)_m$, make it possible to trace a global kinematics, which seems to be due to a subcollapse in the W49N molecular cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) represent some of the most ancient remnants of our solar system, having evaded significant thermal or evolutionary processing. This makes them important targets for exploration as they offer a unique opportunity to scrutinize materials that are remnants of the epoch of planet formation. Moreover, with recent and upcoming observations of KBOs, there is a growing interest in understanding the extent to which these objects can preserve their most primitive, hypervolatile ices. Here, we present a theoretical framework that revisits this issue for small, cold classical KBOs like Arrokoth. Our analytical approach is consistent with prior studies but assumes an extreme cold end-member thermophysical regime for Arrokoth, enabling us to capture the essential physics without computationally expensive simulations. Under reasonable assumptions for interior temperatures, thermal conductivities, and permeabilities, we demonstrate that Arrokoth can retain its original CO stock for Gyrs if it was assembled long after the decay of radionuclides. The sublimation of CO ice generates an effective CO `atmosphere' within Arrokoth's porous matrix, which remains in near vapor-pressure equilibrium with the ice layer just below, thereby limiting CO loss. According to our findings, Arrokoth expels no more than $\approx 10^{22}$ particles s$^{-1}$, in agreement with upper limits inferred from \textit{New Horizons}' 2019 flyby observations. While our framework challenges recent predictions, it can serve as a benchmark for existing numerical models and be applied to future KBO observations from next-generation telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 According to the structures traced by $^{13}$CO spectral lines within the $^{12}$CO molecular clouds (MCs), we investigate the contributions of their internal gas motions and relative motions to the total velocity dispersions of $^{12}$CO MCs. Our samples of 2851 $^{12}$CO MCs harbor a total of 9556 individual $^{13}$CO structures, among which 1848 MCs ($\sim$ 65$\%$) have one individual $^{13}$CO structure and the other 1003 MCs ($\sim$ 35$\%$) have multiple $^{13}$CO structures. We find that the contribution of the relative motion between $^{13}$CO structures ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO, re}$) is larger than that from their internal gas motion ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO, in}$) in $\sim$ 62$\%$ of 1003 MCs in the `multiple' regime. In addition, we find the $\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO, re}$ tends to increase with the total velocity dispersion($\sigma_{\rm ^{12}CO, tot}$) in our samples, especially for the MCs having multiple $^{13}$CO structures. This result provides a manifestation of the macro-turbulent within MCs, which gradually becomes the dominant way to store the kinetic energy along with the development of MC scales.
#### The EUSO-TA ground-based detector: results and perspectives

 - **Abstract**
 EUSO--TA is a ground-based telescope installed in 2013 in the Black Rock Mesa Telescope Array (BRM-TA) site, operating with 2.5$\mu$s time resolution to observe the night sky in the UV range. The optical system contains two 1m$^2$ Fresnel lenses providing to the telescope a field of view of $11^\circ \times 11^\circ$. Signals are focused on the Photo Detector Module (PDM), with the focal surface composed of 36 Hamamatsu Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs), with 64 pixels/anodes each. The telescope is housed in a shed in front of the BRM-TA fluorescence detectors, and it is viewing towards azimuth $\sim307^\circ$. The main aim of the experiment is to validate the design of the JEM-EUSO detectors and firmware with the final goal of observing ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from space. Since the first installation of the EUSO-TA detector, 9 UHECR events have been detected and confirmed by comparison with TA observations. The night-sky UV background in different conditions, signals from stars and meteors have been measured, and anthropogenic signals, such as calibration lasers or planes. In 2019 an upgrade of the detector to a EUSO-TA2 version began, with a Covid brake till 2022. The new configuration will allow for more frequent and specialized observations. In this work, we present the status and perspectives of the EUSO-TA experiment, including a discussion of recently obtained results.

 - **Abstract**
 The JEM-EUSO program is focused on observations of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) from space. For this purpose, a series of detectors based on multi-anode photomultiplier tubes with a time resolution of the order of $\mu$s have been developed. The detectors work in the UV band to search for ultra-fast signals produced in the Earth's atmosphere during an Extensive Air Shower (EAS) development. Since 2014, various signals have been detected by ground-, ballon- and space-based detectors. A single photodetector module consists of a focal surface with a matrix of 36 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes containing 2304 pixels. The detector's structure allows probing it during the mission if a point-like source emitting in a UV band is in the field of view. In this work, we present the idea and results of calibration of the JEM--EUSO detectors using signals from stars registered during sky observations from the ground. Registered signals can be used for the absolute calibration of the detectors and for testing the detector condition during observations. The presented analysis is based on the data taken by the EUSO-TA and EUSO-TA2 experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected in various physical conditions. However, in the protostellar and protoplanetary environments, their complex kinematics make line profiles blend each other and the line strength of weak lines weaker. In this paper, we utilize the principal component analysis (PCA) technique to develop a filtering method which can extract COM spectra from the main kinematic component associated with COM emission and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spectra. This filtering method corrects non-Gaussian line profiles caused by the kinematics. For this development, we adopt the ALMA BAND 6 spectral survey data of V883 Ori, an eruptive young star with a Keplerian disk. A filter was, first, created using 34 strong and well-isolated COM lines and then applied to the entire spectral range of the dataset. The first principal component (PC1) describes the most common emission structure of the selected lines, which is confined within the water sublimation radius ($\sim$ 0.3 arcsec) in the Keplerian disk of V883 Ori. Using this PC1 filter, we extracted high-SNR kinematics-corrected spectra of V883 Ori over the entire spectral coverage of $\sim$50 GHz. The PC1-filtering method reduces the noise by a factor of $\sim$ 2 compared to the average spectra over the COM emission region. One important advantage of this PC1-filtering method over the previously developed matched filtering method is to preserve the original integrated intensities of COM lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength photometry of the secondary eclipses of extrasolar planets is able to disentangle the reflected and thermally emitted light radiated from the planetary dayside. This leads to the measurement of the planetary geometric albedo $A_g$, which is an indicator of the presence of clouds in the atmosphere, and the recirculation efficiency $\epsilon$, which quantifies the energy transport within the atmosphere. In this work we aim to measure $A_g$ and $\epsilon$ for the planet WASP-178 b, a highly irradiated giant planet with an estimated equilibrium temperature of 2450 K.} We analyzed archival spectra and the light curves collected by Cheops and Tess to characterize the host WASP-178, refine the ephemeris of the system and measure the eclipse depth in the passbands of the two respective telescopes. We measured a marginally significant eclipse depth of 70$\pm$40 ppm in the Tess passband and statistically significant depth of 70$\pm$20 ppm in the Cheops passband. Combining the eclipse depth measurement in the Cheops (lambda_eff=6300 AA) and Tess (lambda_eff=8000 AA) passbands we constrained the dayside brightness temperature of WASP-178 b in the 2250-2800 K interval. The geometric albedo 0.1<$\rm A_g$<0.35 is in general agreement with the picture of poorly reflective giant planets, while the recirculation efficiency $\epsilon>$0.7 makes WASP-178 b an interesting laboratory to test the current heat recirculation models.

It is based on the SFFT method but with revisions to accommodate the rotations and spatial variations of the Point Spread Functions (PSFs). It allows for spatially varying kernels in B-spline form with separately controlled photometric scaling and Tikhonov kernel regularization for harnessing the ultimate fitting flexibility. We present this method using the JWST/NIRCam images of Abell cluster 2744 acquired in JWST Cycle 1 as the test data. The algorithm can be useful for time-domain source detection and differential photometry with the JWST. It can also co-add images of multiple exposures taken at different field orientations. The co-added images preserve the sharpness of the central cores of the PSFs, and the positions and shapes of the objects are matched precisely with B-splines across the field.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a multi-region radiation model for the evolution of flux and spectral index with time. In this model, each perturbation component in the jet produces an independent flare. The model can be used to study the decomposition of microvariability, the structural scale of the perturbed components, and the physical parameters of the acceleration processes. Based on the shock acceleration model in relativistic jet, the influence of acceleration parameters on multiband flare parameters is calculated. We present the results of multiband optical microvariability of the blazar BL Lacertae observed performed during 89 nights in the period from 2009 to 2021, and use them as a sample for model fitting. The results show that both the amplitude and duration of flares decomposed from the microvariability light curves confirm a lognormal distribution. The time delays between the optical bands follow the normal distribution and amount to several minutes, that corroborates with both predictions from the theoretical model and the calculation of the discrete correlation function (DCF). Using the spectral index evolution and the simultaneous fitting of the multiband variability curves, we obtain the acceleration and radiation parameters to constrain and distinguish the origins of different flares. Based on the flare decomposition, we can well reproduce the time-domain evolution trends of the optical variation and energy spectrum, and explain the various redder-when-brighter (RWB) and/or bluer-when-brighter (BWB) behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a peculiar type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2022vqz. It shares many similarities with the SN 2002es-like SNe Ia, such as low luminosity (i.e., $M_{B,\rm max}=-18.11\pm0.16$ mag) and moderate post-peak decline rate (i.e., $\Delta m_{15,B}=1.33\pm0.11$ mag). The nickel mass synthesized in the explosion is estimated as $0.20\pm0.04~{\rm M}_\odot$ from the bolometric light curve, which is obviously lower than normal SNe Ia. SN 2022vqz is also characterized by a slow expanding ejecta, with Si II velocities persisting around 7000 km s$^{-1}$ since 16 days before the peak, which is unique among all known SNe Ia. While all these properties imply a less energetic thermonuclear explosion that should leave considerable amount of unburnt materials, however, absent signature of unburnt carbon in the spectra of SN 2022vqz is puzzling. A prominent early peak is clearly detected in the $c$- and $o$-band light curves of ATLAS and in the $gr$-band data of ZTF within days after the explosion. Possible mechanisms for the early peak are discussed, including sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation model and interaction of SN ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). We found both models face some difficulties in replicating all aspects of the observed data. As an alternative, we propose a hybrid CONe white dwarf as progenitor of SN 2022vqz which can simultaneously reconcile the tension between low ejecta velocity and absence of carbon. We further discuss the diversity of 02es-like objects and possible origins of different scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a Bayesian analysis of recent observational datasets, specifically the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset and Pantheon samples, to investigate the evolution of the EoS parameter in dark energy models. Our study focused on the effective EoS parameter, which is described by the parametric form $\omega_{eff}=-\frac{1}{1+m(1+z)^n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are model parameters. This parametric form is applicable within the framework of $f(R,L_m)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. Here, we examine a non-linear $f(R,L_m)$ model characterized by the functional form $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the free parameter of the model. We examine the evolution of several cosmological parameters, including the effective EoS parameter $\omega_{eff}$, the deceleration parameter $q$, the density parameter $\rho$, the pressure $p$, and the statefinder parameters. Our analysis revealed that the constrained current value of the effective EoS parameter, $\omega_{eff}^{0}=-0.68\pm0.06$ for both the CC and Pantheon datasets, points towards a quintessence phase. Moreover, at redshift $z=0$, the deceleration parameter, $q_0 = -0.61^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, indicates that the present Universe is undergoing accelerated expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics in mergers of binary neutron star (BNS) systems depend sensitively on the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter. This has profound implications on the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) and the ejection of matter in the merger and post-merger phases and is thus of high interest for multi-messenger astronomy. Today, a variety of nuclear EOSs are available with various underlying microphysical models. This calls for a study to focus on EOS effects from different physical nuclear matter properties and their influence on BNS mergers. We perform simulations of equal-mass BNS mergers with a set of 9 different EOSs based on Skyrme density functionals. In the models, we systematically vary the effective nucleon mass, incompressibility, and symmetry energy at saturation density. This allows us to investigate the influence of specific nuclear matter properties on the dynamics of BNS mergers. We analyze the impact of these properties on the merger dynamics, the fate of the remnant, disk formation, ejection of matter, and gravitational wave emission. Our results indicate that some aspects of the merger are sensitive to the EOS around saturation density while others are sensitive to the behavior towards higher densities, e.g., characterized by the slope of the pressure as a function of density. The detailed density dependence of the EOS thus needs to be taken into account to describe its influence on BNS mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Advancements in space telescopes have opened new avenues for gathering vast amounts of data on exoplanet atmosphere spectra. However, accurately extracting chemical and physical properties from these spectra poses significant challenges due to the non-linear nature of the underlying physics. This paper presents novel machine learning models developed by the AstroAI team for the Ariel Data Challenge 2023, where one of the models secured the top position among 293 competitors. Leveraging Normalizing Flows, our models predict the posterior probability distribution of atmospheric parameters under different atmospheric assumptions. Moreover, we introduce an alternative model that exhibits higher performance potential than the winning model, despite scoring lower in the challenge. These findings highlight the need to reevaluate the evaluation metric and prompt further exploration of more efficient and accurate approaches for exoplanet atmosphere spectra analysis. Finally, we present recommendations to enhance the challenge and models, providing valuable insights for future applications on real observational data. These advancements pave the way for more effective and timely analysis of exoplanet atmospheric properties, advancing our understanding of these distant worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a data-driven model for abundances of Fe, Sr, Ba, and Eu in metal-poor (MP) stars. The production patterns for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are derived from the data of Holmbeck et al. (arXiv:2007.00749) on [Sr/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] for 195 stars. Nearly all the data can be accounted for by mixtures of contributions from these two sources. We find that on average, the Sr contribution to an MP star from BNSMs is $\approx 3$ times that from CCSNe. Our model is also consistent with the solar inventory of Fe, Sr, Ba, and Eu. We carry out a parametric $r$-process study to explore the conditions that can give rise to our inferred production patterns and find that such conditions are largely consistent with those from simulations of CCSNe and BNSMs. Our model can be greatly enhanced by accurate abundances of many $r$-process elements in a large number of MP stars, and future results from this approach can be used to probe the conditions in CCSNe and BNSMs in much more detail.

 We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN~2022crv, a stripped envelope supernova in NGC~3054, discovered within 12 hrs of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest SN~2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between SNe Ib and SNe IIb. A high-velocity hydrogen feature ($\sim$$-$20,000 -- $-$16,000 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) was conspicuous in SN~2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared around maximum light. By comparing with hydrodynamic modeling, we find that a hydrogen envelope of $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun{} can reproduce the behaviour of the hydrogen feature observed in SN~2022crv. The early light curve of SN~2022crv did not show envelope cooling emission, implying that SN~2022crv had a compact progenitor with extremely low amount of hydrogen. The analysis of the nebular spectra shows that SN~2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of $\sim$4.5 -- 5.6 \msun{} that has evolved from a $\sim$16 -- 22 \msun{} zero-age main sequence star in a binary system with about 1.0 -- 1.7 \msun{} of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. The high metallicity at the supernova site indicates that the progenitor experienced a strong stellar wind mass loss. In order to retain a small amount of residual hydrogen at such a high metallicity, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than $\sim$1000~$\rm R_{\odot}$. The near-infrared spectra of SN~2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of He I line at $\sim$1.005~$\mu$m. This is the first time that such a feature has been observed in a Type Ib/IIb, and could be due to \ion{Sr}{2}. Further detailed modelling on SN~2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the near infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerocapture is a maneuver which uses aerodynamic drag to slow down a spacecraft in a single pass through the atmosphere. All planetary orbiters to date have used propulsive orbit insertion. Aerocapture is a promising alternative, especially for small satellite missions and missions to the ice giants. The large {\Delta}V requirement makes it practically impossible for small satellites to enter low circular orbits. Aerocapture can enable insertion of low-cost satellites into circular orbits around Mars and Venus. For ice giant missions, aerocapture can enable orbit insertion from fast arrival trajectories which are impractical with propulsive insertion. By utilizing the atmospheric drag to impart the {\Delta}V, aerocapture can offer significant propellant mass and cost savings for a wide range of planetary missions. The present study analyzes the performance benefit offered by aerocapture for a set of design reference missions and their applications to future Solar System exploration from Venus to Neptune. The estimated performance benefit for aerocapture in terms of delivered mass increase are: Venus (92%), Earth (108%), Mars (17%), and Titan (614%), Uranus (35%), and Neptune (43%). At Uranus and Neptune, aerocapture is a mission enabling technology for orbit insertion from fast arrival interplanetary trajectories.

 - **Abstract**
 The effective mirror area of an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope is a crucial key parameter for trigger threshold determination and energy calibration. It is usually calculated by 3D ray-tracing simulation using a simplified telescope model, and the result is used in Monte Carlo simulations. However, simplified telescope and camera models are not adequate for the Schwarzschild-Couder configuration to be used in Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array. This is because the complex 3D structure of the secondary mirror, telescope masts, and camera body block a significant fraction of Cherenkov and night-sky photons. To evaluate the effective mirror area of an SST and to finalize its camera body design with minimal shadowing, a complex 3D model was built and simulated using the ROBAST ray-tracing library. A camera body size of 570 mm and a window size of 430 mm were selected for the final camera design based on the evaluation of shadowing by simulation. A non-axisymmetric effective area distribution was determined via the modeling of the complex telescope structure, while meeting the SST effective area requirement.

 - **Abstract**
 Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) have a few advantages over conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) used in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The first notable characteristic is their higher photon detection efficiency (PDE) of up to about 60%, which is roughly 1.2-1.5 times better than that of PMTs in the 300-450 nm range, enabling us to lower the energy threshold of gamma-ray observations and increase the photon statistics. The second advantage is that SiPMs are chemically stable after exposure to long and bright illumination, while PMTs can cause gain and quantum efficiency degradation after the same exposure. Therefore, the use of SiPMs under bright or full moon conditions may extend the total observation time in the highest energy coverage region of individual telescopes. However, the SiPM PDE is too high in wavelengths longer than 500 nm; hence, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the Cherenkov signal over the night-sky background (NSB) is not necessarily superb. This is because the Cherenkov signal is dominant over the wavelength of 300-500 nm, while the NSB is brighter in the region of 550 nm or longer. To improve the S/N with minimal and cost-effective additional hardware, we have developed multilayer coating designs with only 8 layers and applied them to the specular surfaces of light concentrators. The layers were designed to reflect more photons in the 300-500 nm range but fewer in 550-800 nm. Using a prototype light concentrator fabricated with the novel multilayer design, we demonstrated that a SiPM array exhibits ~50% better photon collection efficiency at 403 nm than that obtained with PMTs, agreeing with the result of a ray-tracing simulation. The efficiency measured at 830 nm was also successfully reduced by 30-50%.
#### Study on the gain and photon detection efficiency drops of silicon  photomultipliers under bright background conditions

 - **Abstract**
 The use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes is expected to extend the observation times of very-high-energy gamma-ray sources, particularly within the highest energy domain of 50-300 TeV, where the Cherenkov signal from celestial gamma rays is adequate even under bright moonlight background conditions. Unlike conventional photomultiplier tubes, SiPMs do not exhibit quantum efficiency or gain degradation, which can be observed after long exposures to bright illumination. However, under bright conditions, the photon detection efficiency of a SiPM can be undergo temporary degradation because a fraction of its avalanche photodiode cells can saturate owing to photons from the night-sky background (NSB). In addition, the large current generated by the high NSB rate can increase the temperature of the silicon substrate, resulting in shifts in the SiPM breakdown voltages and consequent gain changes. Moreover, this large current changes the effective bias voltage because it causes a voltage drop across the protection resistor of 100-1000 {\Omega}. Hence, these three factors, namely the avalanche photodiode (APD) saturation, Si temperature, and voltage drop must be carefully compensated for and/or considered in the energy calibration of Cherenkov telescopes with SiPM cameras. In this study, we measured the signal output charge of a SiPM and its variation as a function of different NSB-like background conditions up to 1 GHz/pixel. The results verify that the product of the SiPM gain and photon detection efficiency is well characterized by these three factors.
#### Metallicity and Spectral Evolution of WASP-39 b: The Limited Role of  Hydrodynamic Escape

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09605
 - **Abstract**
 The recent observations on WASP-39 b by JWST have revealed hints of high metallicity within the atmosphere compared to its host star (Feinstein et al. 2022; Ahrer et al. 2023; Alderson et al. 2023; Rustamkulov et al. 2023; Tsai et al. 2023). There are various theories on how these high metallic atmospheres emerge. In this study, we closely investigate the impact of extreme escape in the form of hydrodynamic escape to see its impact on atmospheric metallicity and spectral features such as CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and SO$_2$. We perform a grid simulation, with an adapted version of MESA that includes hydrodynamic escape (Kubyshkina et al. 2018; 2020), to fully evolve planets with similar masses and radii to the currently observed WASP-39 b estimates. By making use of (photo-)chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, we evaluate the transmission spectra at various time intervals throughout the simulation. Our results indicate that the massive size of WASP-39 b limits the metal enhancement to a maximum of ~1.23 the initial metallicity. When incorporating metal drag, this enhancement factor is repressed to an even greater degree, resulting in an enrichment of at most ~0.4%. As a consequence, when assuming an initial solar metallicity, metal-enriched spectral features like SO$_2$ are still missing after ~9 Gyr into the simulation. This paper, thus, demonstrates that hydrodynamic escape cannot be the primary process behind the high metallicity observed in the atmosphere of WASP-39 b, suggesting instead that a metal-enhanced atmosphere was established during its formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of molecular line observations performed toward the NGC 2068 and NGC 2071 regions of the Orion B cloud as the TRAO-FUNS project to study the roles of the filamentary structure in the formation of dense cores and stars in the clouds. Gaussian decomposition for the C$^{18}$O spectra with multiple velocity components and application of a Friends-of-Friends algorithm for the decomposed components allowed us to identify a few tens of velocity coherent filaments. We also identified 48 dense cores from the observations of N$_2$H$^{+}$ using a core finding tool, FellWalker. We made the virial analysis for these filaments and dense cores, finding that the filaments with N$_2$H$^{+}$ dense core are thermally supercritical, and the filaments with larger ratio between the line mass and the thermal critical line mass tend to have more dense cores. We investigated the contribution of the nonthermal motions in dense cores and filaments, showing the dense cores are mostly in transonic/subsonic motions while their natal filaments are mostly in supersonic motions. This may indicates that gas turbulent motions in the filaments have been dissipated at the core scale to form the dense cores there. The filaments with (dynamically evolved) dense cores in infalling motions or with NH$_2$D bright (or chemically evolved) dense cores are all found to be gravitationally critical. Therefore, the criticality of the filament is thought to provide a key condition for its fragmentation, the formation of dense cores, and their kinematical and chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme, in mass and size, molecular outflows in the Milky Way. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows which are formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems.We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics,and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. Line and continuum emission are studied at a wavelength of 3.6\,mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include ($J= 1-0$) transitions of HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, H$_2$CO, CCH tracing different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high-velocity resolution ($\sim$ 0.8 km s$^{-1}$). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of ~3" ($\sim$ 0.02 pc). Integrated intensity maps of the HCO$^+$ emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blue- and red-shifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from $\sim80$ to 20$^{\circ}$ for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, "filament-like" structures expected in explosive outflows. N$_2$H$^+$ emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow is more consistent with that of a typical bipolar outflow instead of an explosive counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Milky Way is a prime site to search for signals of dark matter (DM) annihilation due to its proximity and expected high concentration of DM. The amplification of the dispersion velocity of DM particles in the Galactic center (GC), caused by baryonic contraction and feedback, makes this particular region of the sky an even more promising target for exploring velocity-dependent DM models. Here we demonstrate that current GC observations with the H.E.S.S. telescope, presently the most sensitive TeV-scale gamma-ray telescope in operation in this region of the sky, set the strongest constraints on velocity-dependent annihilating DM particles with masses above 200 GeV. For p-wave annihilations, they improve the current constraints by a factor of $\sim$4 for a DM mass of 1 TeV. For the spatial distribution of DM, we use the results of the latest FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulation of Milky Way-size halos. In addition, we utilize the newest version of the GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation framework to simulate the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission in the GC. We have found that p-wave (d-wave) DM particles with a mass of approximately 1.7 TeV and annihilating into the $W^+$$W^-$ channel exhibit a velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section upper limit of 4.6$\times$ 10$^{-22}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ (9.2$\times$10$^{-17}$ cm$^3$s$^{- 1}$) at a 95\% confidence level. This is about 460 (2$\times$ 10$^{6}$) times greater than the thermal relic cross-section for p-wave (d-wave) DM models.

 The first prototype of LST (LST-1) for the Cherenkov Telescope Array has been in commissioning phase since 2018 and already started scientific observations with the low energy threshold around a few tens of GeV. In 2021, LST-1 observed BL Lac following the alerts based on multi-wavelength observations and detected prominent gamma-ray flares. In addition to the daily flux variability, LST-1 also detected sub-hour-scale intra-night variability reaching 3-4 times higher than the gamma-ray flux from the Crab Nebula above 100 GeV. In this proceeding, we will report the analysis results of LST-1 observations of BL Lac in 2021, especially focusing on flux variability.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the key limitations of large-scale structure surveys of the current and future generation, such as Euclid, LSST-Rubin or Roman, is the influence of feedback processes on the distribution of matter in the Universe. This effect, called baryonic feedback, modifies the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales much stronger than any cosmological parameter of interest. Constraining these modifications is therefore key to unlock the full potential of the upcoming surveys, and we propose to do so with the help of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs are short, astrophysical radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the large-scale-structure, leading to delayed arrival times at different frequencies characterised by the dispersion measure (DM). Since the dispersion measure is sensitive to the integrated line-of-sight electron density, it is a direct probe of the baryonic content of the Universe. We investigate how FRBs can break the degeneracies between cosmological and feedback parameters by correlating the observed Dispersion Measure with the weak gravitational lensing signal of a Euclid-like survey. In particular we use a simple one-parameter model controlling baryonic feedback, but we expect similar findings for more complex models. Within this model we find that $\sim 10^4$ FRBs are sufficient to constrain the baryonic feedback 10 times better than cosmic shear alone. Breaking this degeneracy will tighten the constraints considerably, for example we expect a factor of two improvement on the sum of neutrino masses

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the physical aspects of the inflection-point inflation scenario and assess its observational viability in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The model we consider encapsulates the inflaton with a pseudo-scalar (the dark matter candidate) in a complex neutral scalar singlet. The cosmological constraints on the parameters of inflation derived at a high energy scale are translated to a low energy scale by running these parameters. Ensuring the entire Lagrangian to be invariant under a $Z_3$ symmetry with the adequate transformation of the fields, the imaginary part of the singlet decouples from the other scalars of the model. We then investigate if the observational viability of inflation is also compatible with this pseudo-scalar being the dark matter component. We show that the CMB constraints on the inflationary parameters assure that the pseudo-scalar is stable and provides the correct relic dark matter abundance, regardless of whether it is thermally or non-thermally produced.
#### Probing the nature of the X-ray source IGR J16327-4940 with Chandra

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the results of a Chandra observation of the source IGRJ16327-4940, suggested to be a high mass X-ray binary hosting a luminous blue variable star (LBV). The source field was imaged by ACIS-I in 2023 to search for X-ray emission from the LBV star and eventually confirm this association. No X-ray emission is detected from the LBV star, with an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of L$_{\rm 0.5-10 keV}<2.9(^{+1.6} _{-1.1})\times10^{32}$ erg/s (at the LBV distance d=12.7$^{+3.2} _{-2.7}$ kpc). We detected 21 faint X-ray sources, 8 of which inside the INTEGRAL error circle. The brightest one is the best candidate soft X-ray counterpart of IGRJ16327-4940, showing a hard power law spectrum and a flux corrected for the absorption UF$_{\rm 0.5-10 keV}$=$2.5\times10^{-13}$ erg/cm2/s, mplying a luminosity of $3.0\times10^{33}$ d$_{10~kpc}^2$ erg/s. No optical/near-infrared counterparts have been found. Previous X--ray observations of the source field with Swift/XRT and ART-XC did not detect any source consistent with the INTEGRAL position. These findings exclude the proposed LBV star as the optical association, and pinpoint the most likely soft X-ray counterpart. In this case, the source properties suggest a low mass X-ray binary, possibly a new member of the very faint X-ray transient class.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extension to a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) selected cluster catalog based on observations from the South Pole Telescope (SPT); this catalog extends to lower signal-to-noise than the previous SPT-SZ catalog and therefore includes lower mass clusters. Optically derived redshifts, centers, richnesses and morphological parameters together with catalog contamination and completeness statistics are extracted using the multi-component matched filter algorithm (MCMF) applied to the S/N>4 SPT-SZ candidate list and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) photometric galaxy catalog. The main catalog contains 811 sources above S/N=4, has 91% purity and is 95% complete with respect to the original SZE selection. It contains 50% more total clusters and twice as many clusters above z=0.8 in comparison to the original SPT-SZ sample. The MCMF algorithm allows us to define subsamples of the desired purity with traceable impact on catalog completeness. As an example, we provide two subsamples with S/N>4.25 and S/N>4.5 for which the sample contamination and cleaning-induced incompleteness are both as low as the expected Poisson noise for samples of their size. The subsample with S/N>4.5 has 98% purity and 96% completeness, and will be included in a combined SPT cluster and DES weak-lensing cosmological analysis. We measure the number of false detections in the SPT-SZ candidate list as function of S/N, finding that it follows that expected from assuming Gaussian noise, but with a lower amplitude compared to previous estimates from simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a Hubble Space Telescope imaging search for low-mass binary and planetary companions to 33 nearby brown dwarfs with spectral types of T8-Y1. Our survey provides new photometric information for these faint systems, from which we obtained model-derived luminosities, masses and temperatures. Despite achieving a deep sensitivity to faint companions beyond 0.2-0.5'', down to mass ratios of 0.4-0.7 outside ~5 au, we find no companions to our substellar primaries. From our derived survey completeness, we place an upper limit of f < 4.9% at the 1-sigma level (< 13.0% at the 2-sigma level) on the binary frequency of these objects over the separation range 1-1000 au and for mass ratios above q = 0.4. Our results confirm that companions are extremely rare around the lowest-mass and coldest isolated brown dwarfs, continuing the marginal trend of decreasing binary fraction with primary mass observed throughout the stellar and substellar regimes. These findings support the idea that if a significant population of binaries exist around such low-mass objects, it should lie primarily below 2-3 au separations, with a true peak possibly located at even tighter orbital separations for Y dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and analysis of transient astronomical sources is of great importance to understand their time evolution. Traditional pipelines identify transient sources from difference (D) images derived by subtracting prior-observed reference images (R) from new science images (N), a process that involves extensive manual inspection. In this study, we present TransientViT, a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) - vision transformer (ViT) model to differentiate between transients and image artifacts for the Kilodegree Automatic Transient Survey (KATS). TransientViT utilizes CNNs to reduce the image resolution and a hierarchical attention mechanism to model features globally. We propose a novel KATS-T 200K dataset that combines the difference images with both long- and short-term images, providing a temporally continuous, multidimensional dataset. Using this dataset as the input, TransientViT achieved a superior performance in comparison to other transformer- and CNN-based models, with an overall area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 and an accuracy of 99.44%. Ablation studies demonstrated the impact of different input channels, multi-input fusion methods, and cross-inference strategies on the model performance. As a final step, a voting-based ensemble to combine the inference results of three NRD images further improved the model's prediction reliability and robustness. This hybrid model will act as a crucial reference for future studies on real/bogus transient classification.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TOI-1420b, an exceptionally low-density ($\rho = 0.08\pm0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$) transiting planet in a $P = 6.96$ day orbit around a late G dwarf star. Using transit observations from TESS, LCOGT, OPM, Whitin, Wendelstein, OAUV, Ca l'Ou, and KeplerCam along with radial velocity observations from HARPS-N and NEID, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_p$ = 11.9 $\pm$ 0.3 $R_\Earth$ and a mass of $M_p$ = 25.1 $\pm$ 3.8 $M_\Earth$. TOI-1420b is the largest-known planet with a mass less than $50M_\Earth$, indicating that it contains a sizeable envelope of hydrogen and helium. We determine TOI-1420b's envelope mass fraction to be $f_{env} = 82^{+7}_{-6}\%$, suggesting that runaway gas accretion occurred when its core was at most $4-5\times$ the mass of the Earth. TOI-1420b is similar to the planet WASP-107b in mass, radius, density, and orbital period, so a comparison of these two systems may help reveal the origins of close-in low-density planets. With an atmospheric scale height of 1950 km, a transmission spectroscopy metric of 580, and a predicted Rossiter-McLaughlin amplitude of about $17$ m s$^{-1}$, TOI-1420b is an excellent target for future atmospheric and dynamical characterization.
#### Impact of Galactic dust non-Gaussianity on searches for B-modes from  inflation

 - **Abstract**
 A key challenge in the search for primordial B-modes is the presence of polarized Galactic foregrounds, especially thermal dust emission. Power-spectrum-based analysis methods generally assume the foregrounds to be Gaussian random fields when constructing a likelihood and computing the covariance matrix. In this paper, we investigate how non-Gaussianity in the dust field instead affects CMB and foreground parameter inference in the context of inflationary B-mode searches, capturing this effect via modifications to the dust power-spectrum covariance matrix. For upcoming experiments such as the Simons Observatory, we find no dependence of the tensor-to-scalar ratio uncertainty $\sigma(r)$ on the degree of dust non-Gaussianity or the nature of the dust covariance matrix. We provide an explanation of this result, noting that when frequency decorrelation is negligible, dust in mid-frequency channels is cleaned using high-frequency data in a way that is independent of the spatial statistics of dust. We show that our results hold also for non-zero levels of frequency decorrelation that are compatible with existing data. We find, however, that neglecting the impact of dust non-Gaussianity in the covariance matrix can lead to inaccuracies in goodness-of-fit metrics. Care must thus be taken when using such metrics to test B-mode spectra and models, although we show that any such problems can be mitigated by using only cleaned spectrum combinations when computing goodness-of-fit statistics.
