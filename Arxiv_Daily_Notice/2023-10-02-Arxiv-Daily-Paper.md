#### A Lagrangian theory for galaxy shape statistics

 - **Abstract**
 We formulate the Lagrangian perturbation theory of galaxy intrinsic alignments and compute the resulting auto and cross power spectra of galaxy shapes, densities and matter to 1-loop order. Our model represents a consistent effective-theory description of galaxy shape including the resummation of long-wavelength displacements which damp baryon acoustic oscillations, and includes one linear, three quadratic and two cubic dimensionless bias coefficients at this order, along with counterterms and stochastic contributions whose structure we derive. We compare this Lagrangian model against the three-dimensional helicity spectra of halo shapes measured in N-body simulations by Akitsu et al (2023) and find excellent agreement on perturbative scales while testing a number of more restrictive bias parametrizations. The calculations presented are immediately relevant to analyses of both cosmic shear surveys and spectroscopic shape measurements, and we make a fast FFTLog-based code spinosaurus publicly available with this publication.

 - **Abstract**
 A pulsar's pulse profile gets broadened at low frequencies due to dispersion along the line of sight or due to multi-path propagation. The dynamic nature of the interstellar medium makes both of these effects time-dependent and introduces slowly varying time delays in the measured times-of-arrival similar to those introduced by passing gravitational waves. In this article, we present a new method to correct for such delays by obtaining unbiased dispersion measure (DM) measurements by using low-frequency estimates of the scattering parameters. We evaluate this method by comparing the obtained DM estimates with those, where scatter-broadening is ignored using simulated data. A bias is seen in the estimated DMs for simulated data with pulse-broadening with a larger variability for a data set with a variable frequency scaling index, $\alpha$, as compared to that assuming a Kolmogorov turbulence. Application of the proposed method removes this bias robustly for data with band averaged signal-to-noise ratio larger than 100. We report, for the first time, the measurements of the scatter-broadening time and $\alpha$ from analysis of PSR J1643$-$1224, observed with upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. These scattering parameters were found to vary with epoch and $\alpha$ was different from that expected for Kolmogorov turbulence. Finally, we present the DM time-series after application of the new technique to PSR J1643$-$1224.

 - **Abstract**
 Establishing a human colony on Mars is one of the most ambitious endeavors of our time. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the challenges and solutions related to Mars colonization, emphasizing sustainability, efficiency, and the well-being of colonists. We begin by analyzing the Martian environment, focusing on challenges such as radiation, dust storms, temperature variations, and low atmospheric pressure. The discourse then transitions into technological solutions, exploring innovations in infrastructure, energy production, transportation, and life support systems. Special attention is paid to harnessing in-situ resources and recent advancements like Martian concrete, aeroponics, and algae bioreactors. The human dimension is addressed, from the psychological implications of prolonged isolation to physiological considerations in reduced gravity. Economic considerations encapsulate the cost-benefit analysis of in-situ resource utilization versus Earth transport and the potential incentives for private sector investment. The paper culminates in recommendations for future research, highlighting areas pivotal for refining the blueprint of Mars colonization. This work serves as a foundational guide for researchers, policymakers, and visionaries aiming to make humanity's interplanetary future a reality.
#### Europa's Coupled Ice-Ocean System: Temporal Evolution of a Pure Ice  Shell
 - **Authors:** Nicole C. Shibley, Jeremy Goodman

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16821
 - **Abstract**
 Europa's icy surface likely overlies an ocean, but the ice thickness is not known. Here we model the temporal growth of a Europan shell of pure ice subject to varying ice-ocean heat fluxes, ice rheologies, and internal heating rates. Both constant and viscosity-dependent internal heating rates are included, yielding similar results for particular viscosities. A growing shell starting from an ice-free initial state transitions from conduction to convection at O(10$^5$) to O(10$^7$) years, with thicknesses O(1-10) km. For low ice-ocean heat fluxes and larger viscosities, the time to reach a steady-state thickness exceeds the estimated age of Europa's surface, whence the shell may still be growing. We conclude by presenting a method for inferring ice-ocean heat fluxes and vertical ocean velocities from the ice-thickness measurements expected from the upcoming Clipper mission, assuming the shell is in a conductive steady state.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the first detailed infrared chemical analysis of five binary members (S277, S997, S975, S1031, and S1195) in the open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). These stars are located outside (bluer and/or brighter than) the main-sequence turnoff region in M67. High-resolution (R ~ 45,000) near-infrared spectra were obtained with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) at the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith Telescope, providing full spectral coverage of the H and K bands. The abundances of C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni are measured using neutral atomic absorption lines. We detect v sin i greater than or equal to 25 km s-1 in three of our program stars: S1031, S975, and S1195. We find our derived abundances to be in good agreement with turnoff star abundances, similar to published analyses of blue straggler stars in M67 from optical spectra. Detection of a carbon enhancement or depletion resulting from mass transfer is difficult due to the uncertainties in the carbon abundance and the relatively modest changes that may occur through red giant and asymptotic giant branch evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Hercules X-1 is a nearly edge-on X-ray binary with a warped, precessing accretion disk, which manifests through a 35-day cycle of alternating High and Low flux states. This disk precession introduces a changing line of sight towards the X-ray source, through an ionized accretion disk wind. The sightline variation allows us to uniquely determine how the wind properties vary with height above the disk. All the previous wind measurements were made in the brighter Main High state of Her X-1. Here, we analyze the only Chandra observation during the fainter `Short' High state, and significantly detect blueshifted ionized absorption. We find a column density of $2.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1}\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, an ionization parameter $\log (\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1})=3.41_{-0.12}^{+0.15}$ and an outflow velocity of $380 \pm 40$ km/s. The properties of the outflow measured during the Short High state are in good agreement with those measured at equivalent precession phases during Main High. We conclude that we are sampling the same wind structure, seen during both Main and Short High, which is precessing alongside with the warped accretion disk every 35 days. Finally, the high spectral resolution of Chandra gratings above 1 keV in this observation enabled us to measure the abundances of certain elements in the outflow. We find Mg/O$=1.5_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$, Si/O$=1.5 \pm 0.4$ and S/O$=3.0_{-1.1}^{+1.2}$, whereas in our previous study of Her X-1 with XMM-Newton, we found an over-abundance of N, Ne and Fe compared with O. These peculiar abundance ratios were likely introduced by pollution of the donor by the supernova which created Her X-1.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a proposal for the construction and development of a new instrument for radio astronomical observations based on interferometric techniques, that will provide high angular resolution in the 21 cm band, with the intention of improving and extending the current performance of the instruments used at the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy. This will allow internationally competitive scientific research and the acquisition of cutting-edge scientific and technological know-how in the aforementioned techniques, enabling interferometric measurements and the development of very long baseline or VLBI techniques. This project is called MIA, an acronym for "Multipurpose Interferometric Array".

 - **Abstract**
 Arcus is a concept for a probe class mission to deliver high-resolution FUV and X-ray spectroscopy. For X-rays, it combines cost-effective silicon pore optics (SPO) with high-throughput critical-angle transmission (CAT) gratings to achieve $R> 3000$ in a bandpass from 12-50 Angstroem. We show in detail how the X-ray and the UV spectrographs (XRS and UVS) on Arcus will be aligned to each other. For XRS we present ray-tracing studies to derive performance characteristics such as the spectral resolving power and effective area, study the effect of misalignments on the performance, and conclude that most tolerances can be achieved with mechanical means alone. We also present an estimate of the expected on-orbit background.

 - **Abstract**
 With increasing number of contact binary discoveries and the recognition that luminous red novae are the result of contact binary merger events, there has been a significant increase in the number of light curve solutions appearing in the literature. One of the key elements of such solutions is the assignment and fixing of the effective temperature of the primary component (T1). Sometimes much is made of the assigned value with expectation of significantly different light curve solutions even though theoretical considerations suggest that absolute value of T1 has little influence on the geometric elements of the light curve solution. In this study we show that assigning T1 over a range of 1000K has no significant influence on the light curve solutions of two extreme low mass ratio contact binary systems. In addition, we explore the use of photometric spectral energy distribution as a potential standard for assigning T1 in the absence of spectroscopic observations.
#### Effect of irradiation on the spin of millisecond pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 A millisecond pulsar (MSP) is an old neutron star (NS) that has accreted material from its companion star, causing it to spin up, which is known as the recycling scenario. During the mass transfer phase, the system manifests itself as an X-ray binary. PSR J1402+13 is an MSP with a spin period of $5.89~{\rm ms}$ and a spin period derivative of $\log\dot{P}_{\rm spin}=-16.32$. These properties make it a notable object within the pulsar population, as MSPs typically exhibit low spin period derivatives. In this paper, we aim to explain how an MSP can posses high spin period derivative by binary evolution. By utilizing the stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA}, we examine the effects of irradiation on the companion star and the propeller effect on the NS during binary evolution. We demonstrate that irradiation can modify the spin period and mass of an MSP, resulting in a higher spin period derivative. These results suggest that the irradiation effect may serve as a key factor in explaining MSPs with high spin period derivatives.

 - **Abstract**
 ASASSN-21qj is a distant Sun-like star that recently began an episode of deep dimming events after no prior recorded variability. Here we examine archival and newly obtained optical and near-infrared data of this star. The deep aperiodic dimming and absence of previous infrared excess are reminiscent of KIC 8462852 (``Boyajian's Star''). The observed occultations are consistent with a circumstellar cloud of sub-micron-sized dust grains composed of amorphous pyroxene, with a minimum mass of $1.50~\pm~0.04\times10^{-9}~M_{\oplus}$ derived from the deepest occultations, and a minimum grain size of $0.29^{+0.01}_{-0.18}~\mu$m assuming a power law size distribution. We further identify the first evidence of near-infrared excess in this system from NEOWISE 3.4 and 4.6~$\mu$m observations. The excess emission implies a total circumstellar dust mass of around $10^{-6} M_{\oplus}$, comparable to the extreme, variable discs associated with terrestrial planet formation around young stars. The quasiperiodic recurrence of deep dips and the inferred dust temperature (ranging from 1800 to 700~K across the span of observations) independently point to an orbital distance of $\simeq$0.2~au for the dust, supporting the occulting material and excess emission being causally linked. The origin of this extended, opaque cloud is surmised to be the breakup of one or more exocometary bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Large blue tilted spectral index axionic isocurvature perturbations can be produced when the axion sector is far out of equilibrium during inflation through an initial Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking field displacement along a nearly flat direction in the effective potential. As a companion to a previous work, we present analytic formulae for the blue isocurvature spectrum for the case of the kinetic energy density of the PQ symmetry breaking field being larger than the quartic power of the final spontaneous PQ symmetry breaking scale. It corresponds to a regime in which the nonlinearities of the classical potential become important many times during the formation of the axion isocurvature quantum perturbations leading to interesting resonant behavior. One consequence of this nonlinearity-driven resonance is the chaotic nature of the map that links the underlying Lagrangian parameters to the isocurvature amplitudes. We point out an accidental duality symmetry between the perturbation equations and the background field equations that can be used to understand this. Finally, we present two types of analytic results. The first relies on a computation utilizing an effective potential wherein fast time scale fluctuations have been integrated out. The second is grounded in a functional ansatz, requiring only a limited set of fitting parameters. Both analytic results should be useful for carrying out forecasts and fits to the data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the timing and spectral analysis of the HMXB source 4U 1538-522 using NuSTAR observations. One of the observations partially covers the X-ray eclipse of the source along with eclipse ingress. The source is found to spin down at the rate of 0.163 $\pm$ 0.002 s $\text{yr}^{-1}$ between $\sim$ (54973-58603) MJD. It is evident that at time $\sim$ 58620 MJD, a torque reversal occurred, thereafter the source exhibited a spin-up trend at the rate - (0.305 $\pm$ 0.018) s $\text{yr}^{-1}$ until 59275 MJD. A recent NuSTAR observation finds the pulse period of the source: (526.2341 $\pm$ 0.0041) s. The pulse profile exhibits a transition from double-peaked to single-peaked nature above $\sim$ 30 keV. We analyzed the overall trend of the temporal evolution of fundamental Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF), $\text{E}_\text{cyc}$, incorporating recent NuSTAR measurements. Initially, during the time span $\sim$ (50452.16-55270.8) MJD, the cyclotron line energy is found to increase at a rate of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.03 keV $\text{yr}^{-1}$ which is further followed by a decrease at a rate - 0.14 $\pm$ 0.01 keV $\text{yr}^{-1}$ between (55270.8-59267) MJD. The combined measurements in the time span (50452.16-59267) MJD reveal that the cyclotron line energy is increasing linearly at a rate of 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02 keV $\text{yr}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of OH$^+$ are used to infer the interstellar cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse atomic clouds, thereby constraining the propagation of cosmic rays through and the shielding by interstellar clouds, as well as the low energy cosmic ray spectrum. In regions where the H$_2$ to H number density ratio is low, dissociative recombination (DR) is the dominant destruction process for OH$^+$ and the DR rate coefficient is important for predicting the OH$^+$ abundance and inferring the cosmic ray ionization rate. We have experimentally studied DR of electronically and vibrationally relaxed OH$^+$ in its lowest rotational levels, using an electron--ion merged-beams setup at the Cryogenic Storage Ring. From these measurements, we have derived a kinetic temperature rate coefficient applicable to diffuse cloud chemical models, i.e., for OH$^+$ in its electronic, vibrational, and rotational ground level. At typical diffuse cloud temperatures, our kinetic temperature rate coefficient is a factor of $\sim 5$ times larger than the previous experimentally derived value and a factor of $\sim 33$ times larger than the value calculated by theory. Our combined experimental and modelling results point to a significant increase for the cosmic ray ionization rate inferred from observations of OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$, corresponding to a geometric mean of $(6.6 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is more than a factor of two larger than the previously inferred values of the cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse atomic clouds. Combined with observations of diffuse and dense molecular clouds, these findings indicate a greater degree of cosmic ray shielding in interstellar clouds than has been previously inferred.

 - **Abstract**
 The deployment of the Baikal-GVD deep underwater neutrino telescope is in progress now. About 3500 deep underwater photodetectors (optical modules) arranged into 12 clusters are operating in Lake Baikal. For increasing the efficiency of cascade-like neutrino event detection, the telescope deployment scheme was slightly changed. Namely, the inter-cluster distance was reduced for the newly deployed clusters and additional string of optical modules are added between the clusters. The first inter-cluster string was installed in 2022 and two such strings were installed in 2023. This paper presents a Monte Carlo estimate of the impact of these configuration changes on the cascade detection efficiency as well as technical implementation and results of in-situ tests of the inter-cluster strings.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last two decades, we have intensified our search for a ghost particle, with the hope that it would provide us with information on the darkest places of our Universe. This quest has been conducted from the deep caves of the Earth, up to the upper layers of our atmosphere, and from one Pole to another. In this review, I will summarize the odyssey of the search for astrophysical neutrinos. I will focus on the recent discoveries and technical developments that led us to the point where we stand now. I will highlight the different types of neutrino detectors, and their performances enabling the discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and the understanding of their sources behind. Finally, I will present some possible paths to the remaining uncharted territory of the ultra-high-energy neutrino astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The survival time of a star cluster depends on its total mass, density, and thus size, as well as on the environment in which it was born and in which lies. Its dynamical evolution is influenced by various factors such as gravitational effects of the Galactic bar, spiral structures, and molecular clouds. Overall, the factors that determine the longevity of a cluster are complex and not fully understood. This study aims to investigate if open clusters and field stars respond differently to the perturbations that cause radial migration. In particular, we aim at understanding the nature of the oldest surviving clusters. We compared the time evolution of the kinematic properties of two Gaia DR3 samples: the first sample is composed of $\sim$40 open clusters and the second one of $\sim$66,000 MSTO field stars. Both selected samples are composed of stars selected with the same quality criterion, belonging to the thin disc, in a similar metallicity range, located in the same Galactocentric region [7.5-9 kpc] and with ages >1 Gyr. We performed a statistical analysis comparing the properties of the samples of field stars and of open clusters. A qualitative comparison of kinematic and orbital properties reveals that clusters younger than 2-3 Gyr are more resistant to perturbations than field stars and they move along quasi-circular orbits. Conversely, clusters older than approximately 3 Gyr have more eccentric and inclined orbits than isolated stars in the same age range. Such orbits lead them to reach higher elevations on the Galactic plane, maximising their probability to survive several Gyr longer. A formal statistical analysis reveals that there are differences among the time evolution of most of the kinematic and orbital properties of field stars and open clusters. Our results suggest that oldest survived clusters are usually more massive and move on orbits with higher eccentricity.

 - **Abstract**
 The development of the first X-ray polarimeter, based on the photoelectric effect 20 years ago and implemented thanks to advances in gas amplification structures and readout techniques, had a significant impact in opening a new window for X-ray polarimetry. This system measures the X-ray polarization by reconstructing the initial direction of the photoelectron, emitted by the interaction of an incident photon with an atomic electron, in a gas mixture from an ionization track collected on a two-dimensional plane. However, actual X-ray polarimeters, are still requiring relatively long exposure time and cannot coupled with high effective area mirrors or concentrators. In this context, the high yield polarimetry experiment in X-rays (Hype-X) project is currently underway, aiming to improve the sensitivity of the next generation X-ray polarimetry detectors taking advantage of the recent advancements in imaging techniques for high-resolution time projection chambers. In particular, we are evaluating the use of TIMEPIX3 to be applied for the read-out of a gas detector, which will allow us to obtain a three-dimensional image of the photoelectron track. To evaluate the improvement achievable by using a 3D track reconstruction, in this paper, we have reproduced a three-dimensional photoelectron track from a 'Geant4' Monte Carlo simulation and examined the sensitivity of X-ray polarimetry using a new three-dimensional track reconstruction algorithm. We report the improvement of the modulation factor with three-dimensional track reconstruction as $\sim5\%$ (relative) in the 2-8 keV range and $\sim17\%$ (relative) in the 2-4 keV range compared to the current two-dimensional polarimetry system. This is equivalent to add a further telescope to the three-telescope systems now employed in space on board the IXPE mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Isobutene ((CH$_3$)$_2$C=CH$_2$) is one of the four isomers of butene (C$_4$H$_8$). Given the detection of propene (CH$_3$CH=CH$_2$) toward TMC-1, and also in the warmer environment of the solar-type protostellar system IRAS 16293$-$2422, one of the next alkenes, isobutene, is a promising candidate to be searched for in space. We aim to extend the limited line lists of the main isotopologue of isobutene from the microwave to the millimetre region in order to obtain a highly precise set of rest frequencies and to facilitate its detection in the interstellar medium. We investigated the rotational spectrum of isobutene in the 35$-$370 GHz range using absorption spectroscopy at room temperature. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate vibrational frequencies. We determined new or improved spectroscopic parameters for isobutene up to a sixth-order distortion constant. These new results enabled its detection in the G+0.693 molecular cloud for the first time, where propene was also recently found. The propene to isobutene column density ratio was determined to be about 3:1. The observed spectroscopic parameters for isobutene are sufficiently accurate that calculated transition frequencies should be reliable up to 700 GHz. This will further help in observing this alkene in other, warmer regions of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 The Global Cosmic-ray Observatory (GCOS) is a proposed large-scale observatory for studying ultra-high-energy cosmic particles, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), photons, and neutrinos. Its primary goal is to characterise the properties of the highest-energy particles in Nature with unprecedented accuracy, and to identify their elusive sources. With an aperture at least a ten-fold larger than existing observatories, this next-generation facility should start operating after 2030, when present-day detectors will gradually cease their activities. Here we briefly review the scientific case motivating GCOS. We present the status of the project, preliminary ideas for its design, and some estimates of its capabilities.
#### A Babcock-Leighton dynamo model of the Sun incorporating toroidal flux  loss and the helioseismically-inferred meridional flow

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether the Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamo model remains in agreement with observations if the meridional flow profile is taken from helioseismic inversions. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the loss of toroidal flux through the solar surface. We employ the 2D flux-transport BL dynamo framework. We use the helioseismically-inferred meridional flow profile, and include toroidal flux loss in a way that is consistent with the amount of poloidal flux generated by Joy's law. Our model does not impose a preference for emergences at low latitudes, but we do require that the model produces such a preference. We can find solutions in general agreement with observations, including the equatorward drift of the butterfly wings and the cycle's 11 year period. The most important free parameters in the model are the depth to which the radial turbulent pumping extends and the turbulent diffusivity in the lower half of the convection zone. We find that the pumping needs to extend to depths of about $0.80R_{\odot}$ and the bulk turbulent diffusivity needs to be around 10 km$^2$/s or less. We find that the emergences are restricted to low latitudes without the need to impose such a preference. The flux-transport BL model, incorporating the helioseismically inferred meridional flow and toroidal field loss term, is compatible with the properties of the observed butterfly diagram and with the observed toroidal loss rate. Reasonably tight constraints are placed on the remaining free parameters. The pumping needs to be to just below the depth corresponding to the location where the meridional flow changes direction. Our linear model does not however reproduce the observed "rush to the poles" of the diffuse surface radial field resulting from the decay of sunspots -- reproducing this might require the imposition of a preference for flux to emerge near the equator.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology is a powerful tool that may be applied to shed light on stellar interiors and stellar evolution. Mixed modes, behaving as acoustic waves in the envelope and buoyancy modes in the core, are remarkable because they allow for probing the radiative cores and evanescent zones of red-giant stars. Here, we have developed a neural network that can accurately infer the coupling strength, a parameter related to the size of the evanescent zone, of solar-like stars in $\sim$5 milliseconds. In comparison with existing methods, we found that only $\sim$43\% inferences were in agreement to within a difference of 0.03 on a sample of $\sim$1,700 \textit{Kepler} red giants. To understand the origin of these differences, we analyzed a few of these stars using independent techniques such as the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method and Echelle diagrams. Through our analysis, we discovered that these alternate techniques are supportive of the neural-net inferences. We also demonstrate that the network can be used to yield estimates of coupling strength and large period separation in stars with structural discontinuities. Our findings suggest that the rate of decline in the coupling strength in the red-giant branch is greater than previously believed. These results are in closer agreement with calculations of stellar-evolution models than prior estimates, further underscoring the remarkable success of stellar-evolution theory and computation. Additionally, we show that the uncertainty in measuring large-period separation increases rapidly with diminishing coupling strength.
#### The Surface Mass Density of the Milky Way: Does the Traditional $K_Z$  Approach Work in the Context of New Surveys?

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the classical $K_Z$ problem -- determination of the vertical force and implied total mass density distribution of the Milky Way disk -- for a wide range of Galactocentric radius and vertical height using chemically selected thin and thick disk samples based on APOGEE spectroscopy combined with the Gaia astrometry. We derived the velocity dispersion profiles in Galactic cylindrical coordinates, and solved the Jeans Equation for the two samples separately. The result is surprising that the total surface mass density as a function of vertical height as derived for these two chemically distinguished populations are different. The discrepancies are larger in the inner compared to the outer Galaxy, with the density calculated from thick disk being larger, independent of the Galactic radius. Furthermore, while there is an overall good agreement between the total mass density derived for the thick disk population and the Standard Halo Model for vertical heights larger than 1 kpc, close to the midplane the mass density observed using the thick disk population is larger than the predicted from the Standard Halo Model. We explore various implications of these discrepancies, and speculate their sources, including problems associated with the assumed density laws, velocity dispersion profiles, and the Galactic rotation curve, potential non-equilibrium of the Galactic disk, or a failure of the NFW dark matter halo profile for the Milky Way. We conclude that the growing detail in hand on the chemodynamical distributions of Milky Way stars challenges traditional analytical treatments of the $K_Z$ problem.
#### Experimental demonstration of spectral linear dark field control at  NASA's high contrast imaging testbeds

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the low flux of exoEarths, long exposure times are required to spectrally characterize them. During these long exposures, the contrast in the dark hole will degrade as the the optical system drifts from its initial DH state. To prevent such contrast drift, a wavefront sensing and control (WFSC) algorithm running in parallel to the science acquisition can stabilize the contrast. However, pairwise probing (PWP) cannot be reused to efficiently stabilize the contrast since it relies on strong temporal modulation of the intensity in the image plane, which would interrupt the science acquisition. The use of small amplitude probes has been demonstrated but requires multiple measurements from each science sub-band to converge. Conversely, spectral linear dark field control (LDFC) takes advantage of the linear relationship between the change in intensity of the post-coronagraph out-of-band image and small changes in wavefront in the science band to preserve the DH region during science exposures. In this paper, we show experimental results that demonstrate spectral LDFC stabilizes the contrast to levels of a few $10^{-9}$ on a Lyot coronagraph testbed which is housed in a vacuum chamber. Promising results show that spectral LDFC is able to correct for disturbances that degrade the contrast by more than 100$\times$. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of spectral LDFC and the first demonstration of spatial or spectral LDFC on a vacuum coronagraph testbed and at contrast levels less than $10^{-8}$.
