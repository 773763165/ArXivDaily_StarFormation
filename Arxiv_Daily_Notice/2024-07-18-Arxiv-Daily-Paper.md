 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations reported evidence of a nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB) compatible with an adiabatically inspiraling population of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). Despite the large uncertainties, the relatively flat spectral slope of the recovered signal suggests a possible prominent role of MBHB dynamical coupling with the environment or/and the presence of an eccentric MBHB population. This work aims at studying the capabilities of future PTA experiments to detect single MBHBs under the realistic assumption that the sGWB is originated from an eccentric binary population coupled with its environment. To this end, we generalize the standard signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher Information Matrix calculations used in PTA for circular MBHBs to the case of eccentric systems. We consider an ideal 10-year MeerKAT and 30-year SKA PTAs and apply our method over a wide number of simulated eccentric MBHB populations. We find that the number of resolvable MBHBs for the SKA (MeerKAT) PTA is ${\sim}\,30$ ($4$) at $\rm SNR\,{>}\,5$ (${>}\,3$), featuring an increasing trend for larger eccentricity values of the MBHB population. This is the result of eccentric MBHBs at ${\lesssim}\,10^{-9}\, \rm Hz$ emitting part of their power at high harmonics, thus reaching the PTA sensitivity band. Our results also indicate that resolved MBHBs do not follow the eccentricity distribution of the underlying MBHB population, but prefer low eccentricity values (${<}\,0.6$). Finally, the recovery of binary intrinsic properties and sky-localization do not depend on the system eccentricity, while orbital parameters such as eccentricity and initial orbital phase show clear trends. Although simplified, our results show that SKA will enable the detection of tens of MBHBs, projecting us into the era of precision gravitational wave astronomy at nano-Hz frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of the sub-Neptune GJ 1214 b suggest that it hosts a high-metallicity (>100x solar), hazy atmosphere. Emission spectra of the planet show molecular absorption features, most likely due to atmospheric H2O. In light of this new information, we conduct a thorough reevaluation of the planet's internal structure. We consider interior models with mixed H/He/H2O envelopes of varying composition, informed by atmospheric constraints from the JWST phase curve, in order to determine possible bulk compositions and internal structures. Self-consistent atmospheric models consistent with the JWST observations are used to set boundary conditions for the interior. We find that a total envelope mass fraction of at least 8.1% is required to explain the planet's mass and radius. Regardless of H2O content, the maximum H/He mass fraction of the planet is 5.8%. We find that a 1:1 ice-to-rock ratio along with 3.4-4.8% H/He is also a permissible solution. In addition, we consider a pure H2O (steam) envelope and find that such a scenario is possible, albeit with a high ice-to-rock ratio of at least 3.76:1, which may be unrealistic from a planet formation standpoint. We discuss possible formation pathways for the different internal structures that are consistent with observations. Since our results depend strongly on the atmospheric composition and haze properties, more precise observations of the planet's atmosphere would allow for further constraints on its internal structure. This type of analysis can be applied to any sub-Neptune with atmospheric constraints to better understand its interior.

          The multiple nature of CC Com: one of the ultra-short orbital period late-type contact binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 The study of very short-period contact binaries provides an important laboratory in which the most important and problematic astrophysical processes of stellar evolution take place. Short-period contact systems, such as CC Com are particularly important for binary evolution. Close binary systems, especially those with multiple system members, have significant period variations, angular momentum loss mechanisms predominance, and pre-merger stellar evolution, making them valuable astrophysical laboratories. In this study, observations of CC Com, previously reported as a binary system, and new observations from the TÜBİTAK National Observatory (TUG) and the space-based telescope TESS have revealed that there is a third object with a period of about eight years and a fourth object with a period of about a century orbiting the binary system. From simultaneous analysis of all available light curves and radial velocities, the sensitive orbital and physical parameters of the system components are derived. The orbital parameters of the components are P$_{\rm A}=0.221\pm0$ days, P$_{\rm B}=7.9\pm0.1$ yr, P$_{\rm C}=98\pm5$ yr, $e_3$ = 0.06, $e_4$ = 0.44 and the physical parameters as M$_{\rm A1}=0.712\pm0.009$ M$_{\odot}$, M$_{\rm A2}=0.372\pm0.005$ M$_{\odot}$, $m_{B;i'=90^\circ}$=0.074 M$_{\odot}$, $m_{C;i'=90^\circ}$=0.18 M$_{\odot}$, R$_{\rm A1}=0.693\pm0.006$ R$_{\odot}$, R$_{\rm A2}=0.514\pm0.005$ R$_{\odot}$, L$_{\rm A1}$ = 0.103 L$_\odot$, L$_{\rm A2}$ = 0.081 L$_\odot$. Finally, the evolutionary status of the multiple system CC Com and its component stars is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is a barred spiral galaxy shaped by tidal interactions with its satellites. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy (Sgr) are the dominant influences at the present day. This paper presents a suite of four 10^9 particle N-body simulations, illustrating the response of the MW's stellar disc to the close approach of the LMC and the merger of Sgr into the MW. The suite is intended to provide a resource for others to study the complex interactions between the MW and its satellites independently and combined, in comparison to an isolated disc control simulation. Such high resolution simulations are vital to understand the kinematics and morphology of the MW taking into account the effects of each satellite. In our preliminary analysis, we find that the influences from the LMC and Sgr on the MW's disc appear distinct, additive and separable within our tailored simulations. Notably, the corrugations induced by Sgr reproduce the large radial velocity wave seen in the data Eilers+20. Overall, our findings emphasise the need to include both satellites when modelling the present-day state of the MW structure and kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-time ($\sim$ year) radio follow-up of optically-discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) is increasingly resulting in detections at radio wavelengths, and there is growing evidence for this late-time radio activity to be common to the broad class of sub-relativistic TDEs. Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multi-epoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically-discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742-1032\,MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000\,days for some events. Overall, we find that at least $22^{+15}_{-11}$\% of the population of optically-discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (2 epochs separated by $\sim 3\,$ years) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence ($\sim 2$\,months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients (VAST) survey can detect $\sim 20$ TDEs in its operational span (4\,yrs), given the current rate from optical surveys.

          Maximum-likelihood regression with systematic errors for astronomy and the physical sciences: I. Methodology and goodness-of-fit statistic of Poisson data

 - **Abstract**
 The paper presents a new statistical method that enables the use of systematic errors in the maximum-likelihood regression of integer-count Poisson data to a parametric model. The method is primarily aimed at the characterization of the goodness-of-fit statistic in the presence of the over-dispersion that is induced by sources of systematic error, and is based on a quasi-maximum-likelihood method that retains the Poisson distribution of the data. We show that the Poisson deviance, which is the usual goodness-of-fit statistic and that is commonly referred to in astronomy as the Cash statistics, can be easily generalized in the presence of systematic errors, under rather general conditions. The method and the associated statistics are first developed theoretically, and then they are tested with the aid of numerical simulations and further illustrated with real-life data from astronomical observations. The statistical methods presented in this paper are intended as a simple general-purpose framework to include additional sources of uncertainty for the analysis of integer-count data in a variety of practical data analysis situations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study a static, spherically charged AdS black hole within a modified cosmological Chaplygin gas (MCG), adhering to the calorific equation of state, as a unified dark fluid model of dark energy and dark matter. We explore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the MCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCGMBH), including the geodesic structure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow silhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds. We then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature, remnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCGMBH. Quasinormal modes are also investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the MCGMBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, suggesting that MCGMBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical BH.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of Solar System evolution is closely tied to interpretations of asteroid composition, particularly the M-class asteroids. These asteroids were initially thought to be the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, a hypothesis based on their spectral similarity to iron meteorites. However, recent astronomical observations have revealed hydration on their surface through the detection of 3-$\mu$m absorption features associated with OH and potentially H2O. We present evidence of hydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1 - 6.63 $\mu$m. Our observations include two detections of the full 3-$\mu$m feature associated with OH and H2O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6-$\mu$m feature uniquely associated with H2O across two observations. We observe 3-$\mu$m depths of between 4.3 and 6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates on other airless bodies of 250 - 400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on the water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6-$\mu$m feature region. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for Psyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated impactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more similar to E-or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to the outer main belt.

          Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients

 - **Abstract**
 The current perspective about the explosions of blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (> ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The SKYSURF project constrained extragalactic background light (EBL) and diffuse light with the vast archive of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Thermal emission from HST itself introduces an additional uncertain background and hinders accurate measurement of the diffuse light level. Here, we use archival WFC3/IR engineering data to investigate and model changes in the temperature of various components in HST's optical path as a function of time (solar cycle) and time of the year (Earth-Sun distance). We also specifically investigate changes in temperature with HST's orbital phase and time since Earth occultation. We investigate possible correlations between HST component temperature and year, and temperature and month. The thermal background changes by less than one Kelvin in the WFC3 pick-off mirror, one of the most important contributors to the thermal background. We model these data to describe the impact that orbital phase, year, and time of year have on the HST and WFC3 component temperatures, and use this to derive the impact on the thermal dark signal and the resulting diffuse light measurements. Based on this improved modeling, we provide new upper limits on the level of diffuse light of 21 nW m-2 sr-1, 32 nW m-2 sr-1, and 25 nW m-2 sr-1 for F125W, F140W, and F160W. Additionally, by accounting for all known sources of measurement uncertainty, we report lower limits on the level of diffuse light of 12 nW m-2 sr-1, 20 nW m-2 sr-1, and 2 nW m-2 sr-1 for F125W, F140W, and F160W.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a direct measurement of extinction curves using corrected $Gaia$ XP spectra of the common sources in $Gaia$ DR3 and LAMOST DR7. Our analysis of approximately 370 thousand high-quality samples yielded a high-precision average extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared photometric data from 2MASS and WISE, the extinction curve spans wavelengths from 0.336 to 4.6 $\mu$m. We determine an average $R_{55}$ of $2.730 \pm 0.007$, corresponding to $R_V= 3.073 \pm 0.009$, and a near-infrared power-law index $\alpha$ of $1.935 \pm 0.037$. Our study confirmed some intermediate-scale structures within the optical range. Two new features were identified at 540 and 769 nm, and their intensities exhibited a correlation with extinction and $R_V$. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the characteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way stars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.

 - **Abstract**
 With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|<1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way's rotation curve.

          Milky Way: New Galactic mass model for orbit computations

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate observational data on the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) are very well understood using the gravitational potentials of the baryonic matter (Pouliasis et al., 2017) and the interpolating function presented by McGaugh et al. (2016). In this way we couple the spherically symmetric mass distribution of the dark matter (DM) to the mass distribution of the baryonic matter (BM). A commonly used model of the dark matter distribution can be understood as an approximation of our model. Creation of a new Galactic mass model for orbit computations based on the coupling of the DM with an improved BM model respecting the theoretical fit of the Galactic rotation curve. The theoretical approach is based on a slight improvement of the BM model by Pouliasis et al. (2017) and on replacement of their DM model by the model based on the interpolating function by McGaugh et al. (2016). The theoretical results are validated by the comparison with observational data. New Galactic mass model for orbit computations is created. DM distribution is given and the rotation curve for the MW is consistent with observational data. The Tully-Fisher relation holds and the values of several characteristics of the MW for the region of the Sun are given, e.g., rotation speed $v_0$ = ($228.8 \pm 0.2$) ~ \mbox{km} \mbox{s}$^{-1}$, Oort constants $A=(+14.73 \pm 0.03) ~\mbox{km} ~\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\mbox{kpc}^{-1} $, $B=(-13.01 \pm 0.03) ~\mbox{km} ~\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\mbox{kpc}^{-1}$ and the mass density of the baryonic matter $(0.087 \pm 0.001) ~\mbox{M}_{\odot} ~\mbox{pc}^{-3} $. Important MW characteristics are the total BM mass $M_{BM}$ $=$ (8.43 $\pm$ 0.01) $\times$ 10$^{10}$ $\mbox{M}_{\odot}$, the total DM mass $M_{DM}$ $\doteq$ (1.34 $\pm$ 0.01) $\times$ 10$^{12}$ $\mbox{M}_{\odot}$, virial radius and virial mass of the MW, $M_{vir}$ $\doteq$ $M_{DM}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Light emission in the first hours and days following core-collapse supernovae is dominated by the escape of photons from the expanding shock-heated envelope. In preceding papers, we provided a simple analytic description of the time-dependent luminosity, $L$, and color temperature, $T_{\rm col}$, as well as of the small ($\simeq10\%$) deviations of the spectrum from blackbody at low frequencies, $h\nu< 3T_{\rm col}$, and of `line dampening' at $h\nu> 3T_{\rm col}$, for explosions of red supergiants (RSGs) with convective polytropic envelopes (without significant circum-stellar medium). Here, we extend our work to provide similar analytic formulae for explosions of blue supergiants with radiative polytropic envelopes. The analytic formulae are calibrated against a large set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent) calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use the opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. They reproduce the numeric $L$ and $T_{\rm col}$ to within 10\% and 5\% accuracy, and the spectral energy distribution to within $\sim20-40\%$. The accuracy is similar to that achieved for RSG explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched in March 2021 to a sun-synchronous LEO at an altitude of 550 km to perform an in-orbit demonstration of a novel gamma-ray burst detector developed for CubeSats. VZLUSAT-2 followed ten months later in a similar orbit carrying as a secondary payload a pair of identical detectors as used on the first mission. These instruments detecting gamma-rays in the range of 30-900 keV consist of a 56 cm2 5 mm thin CsI(Tl) scintillator read-out by a row of multi-pixel photon counters (MPPC or SiPM). The scientific motivation is to detect gamma-ray bursts and other HE transient events and serve as a pathfinder for a larger constellation of nanosatellites that could localize these events via triangulation. At the beginning of July 2024, GRBAlpha detected 140 such transients, while VZLUSAT-2 had 83 positive detections, confirmed by larger GRB missions. Almost a hundred of them are identified as gamma-ray bursts, including extremely bright GRB 221009A and GRB 230307A, detected by both satellites. We were able to characterize the degradation of SiPMs in polar orbit and optimize the duty cycle of the detector system also by using SatNOGS radio network for downlink.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.2\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d<l<60d; |b|<1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy. We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d<l<36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d<l<28d, 36d<l<60d and |b|<1d. Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz). The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analyses of recurrent outbursting black hole sources GX 339$-$4 and H 1743$-$322 using available AstroSat and NuSTAR archival observations during 2016-2024. The nature of the outburst profiles of both sources are examined using long-term MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT lightcurves, and failed as well as successful outbursts are classified. Wide-band (0.5-60 keV) spectral modelling with disc (diskbb) and Comptonized (Nthcomp) components indicates that GX 339-4 transits from hard ($kT_{bb}=0.12-0.77$ keV, $\Gamma_{nth}=1.54-1.74$ and $L_{bol}=0.91-11.56$\% $L_{Edd}$) to soft state ($kT_{in}~[\approx{kT}_{bb}]=0.82-0.88$ keV, $\Gamma_{nth}=1.46-3.26$, $L_{bol}=19.59-30.06\%L_{Edd}$) via intermediate state ($kT_{in}~[\approx{kT}_{bb}]=0.56-0.88$ keV, $\Gamma_{nth}=1.76-2.66$, $L_{bol}=2.90-16.09\%L_{Edd}$), whereas H 1743-322 transits from quiescent to hard state ($\Gamma_{nth}=1.57-1.71$, $L_{bol}=2.08-3.48\%L_{Edd}$). We observe type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in GX 339-4 with increasing frequencies ($0.10-5.37$ Hz) along with harmonics. For H 1743-322, prominent type-C QPOs are observed in frequency range 0.22-1.01 Hz along with distinct harmonics. Energy-dependent power spectral studies reveal that fundamental QPO and harmonics disappear beyond 20 keV in GX 339-4, whereas fundamental QPO in H 1743-322 persists up to 40 keV. We also observe that type-C $QPO_{rms}\%$ decreases with energy for both sources although such variations appear marginal for type-B QPOs. Additionally, we report non-monotonic behavior of photon index with plasma temperature and detection of annihilation line. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the observational findings in the context of accretion dynamics around black hole binaries.

          Dynamical Consequence of Shadows Cast to the Outer Protoplanetary Disks: I. Two-dimensional Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 There has been increasing evidence of shadows from scattered light observations of outer protoplanetary disks (PPDs) cast from the (unresolved) disk inner region, while in the meantime these disks present substructures of various kinds in the submillimeter. As stellar irradiation is the primary heating source for the outer PPDs, the presence of such shadows thus suggest inhomogeneous heating of the outer disk in azimuth, leading to a "thermal forcing" with dynamical consequences. We conduct a suite of idealized 2D disk simulations of the outer disk with azimuthally-varying cooling prescription to mimic the effect of shadows, generally assuming the shadow is static or slowly-rotating. The linear response to such shadows is two-armed spirals with the same pattern speed as the shadow. Towards the nonlinear regime, we find that shadows can potentially lead to the formation of a variety of types of substructures including rings, spirals and crescents, depending on viscosity, cooling time, etc. We have conducted systematic and statistical characterization of the simulation suite, and as thermal forcing from the shadow strengthens, the dominant form of shadow-induced disk substructures change from spirals to rings, and eventually to crescents/vortices. Our results highlight the importance of properly modeling the dynamical impact of inhomogeneous stellar irradiation, while call for more detailed modeling incorporating more realistic disk physics.

          Neutrino Halo profiles: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Using the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations, we computed neutrino profiles within virialized dark matter haloes. These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\sim 4\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M_\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M_\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\hmpc was found.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rossby wave instability (RWI) is the fundamental non-axisymmetric radial shear instability in disks. The RWI can facilitate disk accretion, set the shape of planetary gaps and produce large vortices. It arises from density and/or temperature features, such as radial gaps, bumps or steps. A general, sufficient condition to trigger the RWI is lacking, which we address by studying the linear RWI in a suite of simplified models, including incompressible and compressible shearing sheets and global, cylindrical disks. We focus on enthalpy amplitude and width as the fundamental properties of disk features with various shapes. We find analytic results for the RWI boundary and growth rates across a wide parameter space, in some cases with exact derivations and in others as a description of numerical results. Features wider than a scale-height generally become unstable about halfway to Rayleigh instability, i.e.\ when the squared epicyclic frequency is about half the Keplerian value, reinforcing our previous finding. RWI growth rates approximately scale as enthalpy amplitude to the 1/3 power, with a weak dependence on width, across much of parameter space. Global disk curvature affects wide planetary gaps, making the outer gap edge more susceptible to the RWI. Our simplified models are barotropic and height-integrated, but the main results should carry over to more complex and realistic scenarios.

          Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum-Optimal Coronagraph Using Spatial Mode Sorters

 - **Abstract**
 An ideal direct imaging coronagraph, which selectively rejects the fundamental mode of a telescope, has been shown to achieve the quantum information limits for exoplanet detection and localization. In this study, we experimentally implement this quantum-optimal coronagraph using spatial mode (de)multiplexing. Our benchtop system includes a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter, designed to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined, enabling direct imaging of a faint companion. We develop a probabilistic measurement model that accounts for combined effects of fundamental shot noise and experimental noise specific to our benchtop setup, such as modal cross-talk, dark noise, and ambient background illumination. We leverage this measurement model to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimator of the exoplanet position given an image captured with the coronagraph. Using this approach, we successfully localize an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances $(<\sigma)$ from its host star under a 1000:1 star-planet contrast ratio. Our system accurately localizes the exoplanet up to an absolute error $<0.03\sigma$ over the separation range $[0,\,0.6]\sigma$. Finally, we numerically evaluate the precision of our experimental coronagraph against state-of-the-art coronagraphs subject to comparable noise models.
