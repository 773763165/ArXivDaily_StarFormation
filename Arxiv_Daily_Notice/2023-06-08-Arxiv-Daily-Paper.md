 - **Abstract**
 A future Galactic Supernova (SN) explosion can lead to a gamma-ray signal induced by ultralight Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) thermally produced in the SN core and converted into high-energy photons in the Galactic magnetic field. The detection of such a signal is in the reach of the Large Area Telescope aboard the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. The observation of gamma-ray emission from a future SN has a sensitivity to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 4\times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for a SN at fiducial distance of $10$ kpc and would allow us to reconstruct the ALP-photon coupling within a factor of $\sim2$, mainly due to the uncertainties on the modeling of the Galactic magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream is unique to sample the MW potential from ~50 kpc to 300 kpc, and is also unique in constraining the LMC mass, an increasingly important question for the Local Group/Milky Way modeling. Here we compare strengths and weaknesses of the two types of models (tidal and ram-pressure) of the Magellanic Stream formation. I will present our modeling for the formation of the Magellanic System, including those of the most recent discoveries in the Stream, in the Bridge and at the outskirts of Magellanic Clouds. This model has been successful in predicting most recent observations in both properties of stellar and gas phase. It appears that it is an over-constrained model and provides a good path to investigate the Stream properties. In particular, this model requires a LMC mass significantly smaller than 110^{11} Msun
#### Three-Dimensional General-Relativistic Simulations of Neutrino-Driven  Winds from Magnetized Proto-Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Formed in the aftermath of a core-collapse supernova or neutron star merger, a hot proto-neutron star (PNS) launches an outflow driven by neutrino heating lasting for up to tens of seconds. Though such winds are considered potential sites for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements via the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process), previous work has shown that unmagnetized PNS winds fail to achieve the necessary combination of high entropy and/or short dynamical timescale in the seed nucleus formation region. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of PNS winds which include the effects of a dynamically strong ($B \gtrsim 10^{15}$ G) dipole magnetic field. After initializing the magnetic field, the wind quickly develops a helmet-streamer configuration, characterized by outflows along open polar magnetic field lines and a ``closed'' zone of trapped plasma at lower latitudes. Neutrino heating within the closed zone causes the thermal pressure of the trapped material to rise in time compared to the polar outflow regions, ultimately leading to the expulsion of this matter from the closed zone on a timescale of $\sim$60 ms, consistent with the predictions of \citet{Thompson03}. The high entropies of these transient ejecta are still growing at the end of our simulations and are sufficient to enable a successful 2nd-peak $r$-process in at least a modest $\gtrsim 1\%$ of the equatorial wind ejecta.
#### MOBSTER -- VII. Using light curves to infer magnetic and rotational  properties of stars with centrifugal magnetospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Early-type B stars with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation form centrifugal magnetospheres (CMs), as the relatively weak stellar wind becomes magnetically confined and centrifugally supported above the Kepler co-rotation radius. CM plasma is concentrated at and above the Kepler co-rotation radius at the intersection between the rotation and magnetic field axis. Stellar rotation can cause these clouds of material to intersect the viewer's line-of-sight, leading to photometric eclipses. However, for stars with strong ($\sim 10\,{\rm kG}$) magnetic fields and rapid rotation, CMs can become optically thick enough for emission to occur via electron scattering. Using high-precision space photometry from a sample of stars with strong H$\alpha$ emission, we apply simulated light curves from the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model to directly infer magnetic and rotational properties of these stars. By comparing the values inferred from photometric modelling to those independently determined by spectropolarimetry, we find that magnetic obliquity angle $\beta$, viewer inclination $i$ and critical rotation fraction $W$ can be approximately recovered for 3 of the 4 stars studied here. However, there are large discrepancies between the optical depth at the Kepler radius $\tau_{\rm K}$ expected from magnetometry, and the values required to match the observations. We show that $\tau_{\rm K}$ of order unity is needed to reasonably match the light curve morphology of our sample stars.

 - **Abstract**
 A large sample of long-period giant planets has been discovered thanks to long-term radial velocity surveys, but only a few dozen of these planets have a precise radius measurement. Transiting gas giants are crucial targets for the study of atmospheric composition across a wide range of equilibrium temperatures and for shedding light on the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Indeed, compared to hot Jupiters, the atmospheric properties and orbital parameters of cooler gas giants are unaltered by intense stellar irradiation and tidal effects. We identify long-period planets in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data as duo-transit events. To solve the orbital periods of TESS duo-transit candidates, we use the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) to observe the highest-probability period aliases in order to discard or confirm a transit event at a given period. We also collect spectroscopic observations with CORALIE and HARPS in order to confirm the planetary nature and measure the mass of the candidates. We report the discovery of a warm transiting Neptune-mass planet orbiting TOI-5678. After four non-detections corresponding to possible periods, CHEOPS detected a transit event matching a unique period alias. Joint modeling reveals that TOI-5678 hosts a 47.73 day period planet. TOI-5678 b has a mass of 20 (+-4) Me and a radius of 4.91 (+-0.08 Re) . Using interior structure modeling, we find that TOI-5678 b is composed of a low-mass core surrounded by a large H/He layer with a mass of 3.2 (+1.7, -1.3) Me. TOI-5678 b is part of a growing sample of well-characterized transiting gas giants receiving moderate amounts of stellar insolation (11 Se). Precise density measurement gives us insight into their interior composition, and the objects orbiting bright stars are suitable targets to study the atmospheric composition of cooler gas giants.
#### Framework for Multi-messenger Inference from Neutron Stars: Combining  Nuclear Theory Priors

 - **Abstract**
 We construct an efficient parameterization of the pure neutron-matter equation of state (EoS) that incorporates the uncertainties from both chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and phenomenological potential calculations. This parameterization yields a family of EoSs including and extending the forms based purely on these two calculations. In combination with an agnostic inner core EoS, this parameterization is used in a Bayesian inference pipeline to obtain constraints on the e os parameters using multi-messenger observations of neutron stars. We specifically considered observations of the massive pulsar J0740+6620, the binary neutron star coalescence GW170817, and the NICER pulsar J0030+0451. Constraints on neutron star mass-radius relations are obtained and compared. The Bayes factors for the different EoS models are also computed. While current constraints do not reveal any significant preference among these models, the framework developed here may enable future observations with more sensitive detectors to discriminate them.
#### Implications of a Possible Spectral Structure of Cosmic-ray Protons  Unveiled by the DAMPE

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observations revealed that the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum showed a complex structure: the hardening at $\rm \sim 200\,GeV$ and softening at $\rm \sim 10\,TeV$. However, so far the physical origins of this spectral feature remain strongly debated. In this work, we simulate the acceleration of cosmic-ray protons in a nearby Supernova remnant (SNR) by solving numerically the hydrodynamic equations and the equation for the quasi-isotropic CR momentum distribution in the spherically symmetrical case to derive the spectrum of protons injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), and then simulate the propagation process of those accelerated CR particles to calculate the proton fluxes reaching the Earth. Besides, we use the DRAGON numerical code to calculate the large-scale cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Our simulated results are in good agreement with the observed data (including the observed data of proton fluxes and dipole anisotropy). We conclude that the spectral feature of cosmic-ray protons in this energy band may originate from the superposition of the distribution from the nearby SNR and background diffusive cosmic-ray component. We find that the release of particles from this nearby SNR has a time delay. Besides, it can be found that the nonlinear response of energetic particles, release time of CR protons, and age of the local SNR can leave strong signatures in the spectrum of the resulting CR proton fluxes.
