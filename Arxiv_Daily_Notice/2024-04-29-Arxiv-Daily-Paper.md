 - **Abstract**
 We present in this paper a compilation of solar atlases from $\lambda$ 3000 {\AA} to $\lambda$ 8800 {\AA} with spectral lines identified by the Moore table and with the corresponding equivalent Lande factors g*. We used two spectra at disk centre ($\mu$ = 1.0), from Delbouille and Kurucz, and two spectra at the limb from Stenflo and Gandorfer, respectively at $\mu$ = 0.145 and $\mu$ = 0.10.

 - **Abstract**
 Sigma Orionis is an open cluster in the nearest giant star formation site - Orion. Its youth (3-5 Myr), low reddening, and relative vicinity make it an important benchmark cluster to study stellar and substellar formation and evolution. Young star-forming sites are complex and hierarchical. Precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 enables the exploration of their fine structure. We used the modified convergent point technique to kinematically re-evaluate the members in the Sigma Orionis cluster and its vicinity. We present clear evidence for three kinematically distinct groups in the Sigma Orionis region. The second group, the RV Orionis association, is adjacent to the Sigma Orionis cluster and is composed only of low-mass stars. The third group, the Flame association, whose age is comparable to that of Sigma Orionis, overlaps with the younger NGC 2024 in the Flame Nebula. In total, we have discovered 105 members of this complex not previously found in the literature (82 in Sigma Orionis, 19 in the Flame association, and 4 in the RV Orionis association).
#### Notes on the Practical Application of Nested Sampling: MultiNest,  (Non)convergence, and Rectification

 - **Abstract**
 Nested sampling is a promising tool for Bayesian statistical analysis because it simultaneously performs parameter estimation and facilitates model comparison. MultiNest is one of the most popular nested sampling implementations, and has been applied to a wide variety of problems in the physical sciences. However, MultiNest results are frequently unreliable, and accompanying convergence tests are a necessary component of any analysis. Using simple, analytically tractable test problems, I illustrate how MultiNest (1) can produce systematically biased estimates of the Bayesian evidence, which are more significantly biased for problems of higher dimensionality; (2) can derive posterior estimates with errors on the order of $\sim100\%$; (3) is more likely to underestimate the width of a credible interval than to overestimate it - to a minor degree for smooth problems, but much more so when sampling noisy likelihoods. Nevertheless, I show how MultiNest can be used to jump-start Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or more rigorous nested sampling techniques, potentially accelerating more trustworthy measurements of posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences, and overcoming the challenge of Markov chain Monte Carlo initialization.
#### Quick recipes for gravitational-wave selection effects

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modeling of selection effects is a key ingredient to the success of gravitational-wave astronomy. The detection probability plays a crucial role in both statistical population studies, where it enters the hierarchical Bayesian likelihood, and astrophysical modeling, where it is used to convert predictions from population-synthesis codes into observable distributions. We review the most commonly used approximations, extend them, and present some recipes for a straightforward implementation. These include a closed-form expression capturing both multiple detectors and noise realizations written in terms of the so-called Marcum Q-function and a ready-to-use mapping between signal-to-noise ratio thresholds and false-alarm rates from state-of-the-art detection pipelines. The bias introduced by approximating the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio with the optimal signal-to-noise ratio is not symmetric: sources that are nominally below threshold are more likely to be detected than sources above threshold are to be missed. Using both analytical considerations and software injections in detection pipelines, we confirm that including noise realizations when estimating the selection function introduces an average variation of a few %. This effect is most relevant for large catalogs and specific subpopulations of sources at the edge of detectability (e.g. high redshifts).
#### Action-Angle Variables for Axisymmetric Potentials via Birkhoff  Normalization
 - **Authors:** Sam Hadden
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16941
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16941
 - **Abstract**
 We describe a method for calculating action-angle variables in axisymmetric galactic potentials using Birkhoff normalization, a technique from Hamiltonian perturbation theory. An advantageous feature of this method is that it yields explicit series expressions for both the forward and inverse transformations between the action-angle variables and position-velocity data. It also provides explicit expressions for the Hamiltonian and dynamical frequencies as functions of the action variables. We test this method by examining orbits in a Miyamoto-Nagai model potential and compare it to the popular St\"ackel approximation method. When vertical actions are not too large, the Birkhoff normalization method achieves fractional errors smaller than a part in $10^{3}$ and outperforms the St\"ackel approximation. We also show that the range over which Birkhoff normalization provides accurate results can be extended by constructing Pad\'e approximants from the perturbative series expressions developed with the method. Numerical routines in Python for carrying out the Birkhoff normalization procedure are made available.

 - **Abstract**
 An analysis of calibrations of extensive air showers with zenith angles $\theta \le 50^{\circ}$ and energies $E_{\text{SD}} \le 10^{18.5}$ eV was carried out in experiments at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array. The values of $E_{\text{SD}}$ were determined from particle densities measured with ground-based scintillation detectors at a distance $r = 800$~m from shower axis. Measured densities were compared with the values obtained in simulations preformed with the use of CORSIKA code within the framework of QGSJet-II.04 hadron interaction model for primary protons. For showers with $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ the $E_{\text{SD}}$ estimates of both arrays are very close, and their energy spectra are similar in shape and absolute value. Another Telescope Array calibration, based on measuring the EAS fluorescent radiation with optical detectors, gives underestimated energy $E_{\text{FD}} = 0.787 \times E_{\text{SD}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 LP~349$-$25 is a well studied close stellar binary system comprised of two late M dwarf stars, both stars close to the limit between star and brown dwarf. This system was previously identified as a source of GHz radio emission. We observed LP~349$-$25AB in 11 epochs in 2020$-$2022, detecting both components in this nearby binary system using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We fit simultaneously the VLBA absolute astrometric positions together with existing relative astrometric observations derived from optical/infrared observations with a set of algorithms that use non-linear least-square, Genetic Algorithm and Markov Chain Montecarlo methods to determine the orbital parameters of the two components. We find the masses of the primary and secondary components to be 0.08188 $\pm$ 0.00061 $M\odot$, and 0.06411 $\pm$ 0.00049 $M_\odot$, respectively, representing one of the most precise mass estimates of any UCDs to date. The primary is an UCD of 85.71$\pm$0.64 M$_{Jup}$, while the secondary has a mass consistent with being a Brown Dwarf of 67.11 $\pm$ 0.51 $M_{Jup}$. This is one of the very few direct detections of a Brown Dwarf with VLBA observations. We also find a distance to the binary system of 14.122 $\pm$ 0.057 pc. Using Stellar Evolutionary Models, we find the model-derived stellar parameters of both stars. In particular, we obtain a model-derived age of 262 Myr for the system, which indicates that LP~349$-$25AB is composed of two pre-main-sequence stars. In addition, we find that the secondary star is significantly less evolved that the primary star.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an overview of the high-redshift extragalactic science case for the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) far-infrared NASA probe-class mission concept. Enabled by its 14m primary reflector, SALTUS offers enormous gains in spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity over previous far-IR missions. SALTUS would be a versatile observatory capable of responding to the scientific needs of the extragalactic community in the 2030s, and a natural follow-on to the near- and mid-IR capabilities of JWST. Key early-universe science goals for SALTUS focus on understanding the role of galactic feedback processes in regulating galaxy growth across cosmic time, and charting the rise of metals and dust from the early universe to the present. This paper summarizes these science cases and the performance metrics most relevant for high-redshift observations.
#### On the Existence of "Maia variables"

 - **Abstract**
 There are different classes of pulsating stars in the H-R diagram. While many of those classes are undisputed, some remain a mystery such as the objects historically called "Maia variables." Whereas the presence of such a class was suggested seven decades ago, no pulsational driving mechanism is known that could excite short-period oscillations in these late B to early A-type stars. Alternative hypotheses that would render the reports of variability of those stars erroneous have been proposed, such as incorrect effective temperatures, binarity or rapid rotation, but no certain conclusions have been reached yet. Therefore, the existence of these variables as a homogeneous class of pulsating star is still under discussion. Meanwhile, many new candidates of these variables have been claimed especially by using photometric observations from space telescopes. In this study, we examined 31 objects that are alleged members of this hypothetical group and carried out detailed spectroscopic and photometric analyses to test the proposed hypotheses for their cause of variability. The $T_{eff}$, log$(g)$, $v$ sin $i$, and chemical abundances of the targets were determined and the $TESS$ photometric data were examined. As a result, we found that most of these targets are located inside the $\delta$ Scuti, $\beta$ Cephei, or SPB star instability strips, a few show evidence for binarity, and others exhibit rapid rotation. We give arguments that none of the apparently rapid pulsations in our targets is caused by a star outside any known instability strip. By extrapolation, we argue that most stars proposed as pulsators outside well-established instability domains are misclassified. Hence there is no sufficient evidence justifying the existence of a class of pulsating stars formerly known as the "Maia variables."

 - **Abstract**
 As part of an intensive effort to observe the predicted 2022 Tau Herculids outburst, we recorded almost 800 individual meteor streaks on May 30th and 31st, 2022, using a high-sensitivity Sony~$\alpha$7 camera. The video recordings were obtained under perfect conditions at the McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA. The meteor sample is dominated by the predicted Tau Herculids shower, however, we also noted significant activity of sporadic meteors and other possible weak showers. We found that the time of the maximum activity matched very well the predictions, while we note the large fraction of faint meteors that were not detectable visually. We determined the radiant, and the time evolution of the activities and currently we are working on the determination of the brightness statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of spectral line width measurements from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on {\it Hinode}. We used spectral line profiles of Fe {\sc xvi} 262.984 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 264.787 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 270.519 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 274.203 {\AA}, and Fe {\sc xv} 284.160 {\AA}, and studied 11 active regions. Previous studies of spectral line widths have shown that in hot loops in the cores of active regions, the observed non-thermal velocities are smaller than predicted from models of reconnection jets in the corona or shock heating associated with Alfv\'{e}n waves. The observed line widths are also inconsistent with models of chromospheric evaporation due to coronal nanoflares. We show that recent advances in higher resolution Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence modeling enables us to obtain non-thermal velocities similar to those measured in active regions. The observed non-thermal velocities for the 11 active regions in our study are in the range of 17$-$30 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$, consistent with the spectral line non-thermal widths predicted from our model of 16 interacting flux tubes, which are in the range of ~15$-$37 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling the interaction between ionizing photons emitted from massive stars and their environment is essential to further our understanding of galactic ecosystems. We present a hybrid Radiation-Hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that couples an SPH code to a grid-based Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code. The coupling is achieved by using the particle positions as generating sites for a Voronoi grid, and applying a precise mapping of particle-interpolated densities onto the grid cells that ensures mass conservation. The mapping, however, can be computationally infeasible for large numbers of particles. We introduce our tree-based algorithm for optimizing coupled RHD codes. Astrophysical SPH codes typically utilize tree-building procedures to sort particles into hierarchical groups (referred to as nodes) for evaluating self-gravity. Our algorithm adaptively walks the gravity tree and transforms the extracted nodes into pseudo-SPH particles, which we use for the grid construction and mapping. This method allows for the temporary reduction of fluid resolution in regions that are less affected by the radiation. A neighbour-finding scheme is implemented to aid our smoothing length solver for nodes. We show that the use of pseudo-particles produces equally accurate results that agree with benchmarks, and achieves a speed-up that scales with the reduction in the final number of particle-cell pairs being mapped.
#### Exploring the properties of photosphere and emission lines for tidal  disruption events based on the global solution of slim disk and winds

 - **Abstract**
 The theoretical debris supply rate from a tidal disruption of stars can exceed about one hundred times of the Eddington accretion rate for a $10^{6-7}M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is believed that a strong wind will be launched from the disk surface due to the radiation pressure in the case of super-Eddington accretion, which may be one of the mechanisms for formation of the envelope as observed in tidal disruption events (TDEs). In this work, we explore the evolution of the envelope that formed from the optical thick winds by solving the global solution of the slim-disk model. Our model can roughly reproduce the typical temperature, luminosity and size of the photosphere for TDEs. Based on \texttt{CLOUDY} modeling, we find that, if only considering the radiation-driven disk wind, the emission line luminosities are normally much lower than the typical observational results due to the limited atmosphere mass outside the envelope. We propose that the ejection of the outflow from the self-collision of the stellar debris during the circularization may provide enough matter outside the disk-wind photosphere. Our calculated spectra can roughly reproduce the main properties of several typical emission lines (e.g., $\rm H\alpha$, $\rm H\beta$ and \ion{He}{2}), which was applied well to a TDE candidate AT2018dyb.

 - **Abstract**
 A hypothetical photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$, can produce a frequency-dependent vacuum dispersion of light, which leads to an additional time delay between photons with different frequencies when they propagate through a fixed distance. The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological model based on the fundamental postulate of the masslessness of photons, here we employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of $m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 2.0 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 6.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 3.6 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$) at the $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence level. This is the first cosmology-independent photon mass limit derived from extragalactic sources.
#### Discovery of evolving low-frequency QPOs in hard X-rays ($\sim 100$ keV)  observed in black hole Swift J1727.8-1613 with $AstroSat$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of evolving Low-Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillation (LFQPO) frequencies in hard X-rays upto $100$ keV with $AstroSat/LAXPC$ during `unusual' outburst phase of Swift J1727.8-1613 in hard-intermediate state (HIMS). The observed LFQPO in $20 - 100$ keV has a centroid $\nu_{_{\rm QPO}}=1.43$ Hz, a coherence factor $Q= 7.14$ and an amplitude ${\rm rms_{_{\rm QPO}}} = 10.95\%$ with significance $\sigma = 5.46$. Type-C QPOs ($1.09-2.6$ Hz) are found to evolve monotonically during HIMS of the outburst with clear detection in hard X-rays ($80 - 100$ keV), where ${\rm rms_{_{\rm QPO}}}$ decreases ($\sim 12-3\%$) with energy. Further, $\nu_{_{\rm QPO}}$ is seen to correlate (anti-correlate) with low (high) energy flux in $2-20$ keV ($15-50$ keV). Wide-band ($0.7 - 40$ keV) energy spectrum of $NICER/XTI$ and $AstroSat/LAXPC$ is satisfactorily described by the `dominant' thermal Comptonization contribution ($\sim 88\%$) in presence of a `weak' signature of disk emissions ($kT_{\rm in} \sim 0.36$ keV) indicating the harder spectral distribution. Considering source mass $M_{\rm BH}=10M_\odot$ and distance $1.5 < {\rm d~(kpc)} < 5$, the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity is estimated as $\sim 0.03-0.92\%L_{\rm Edd}$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of accretion dynamics around black hole X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 While Tycho's supernova remnant is one of the most studied type Ia Galactic supernova remnants, a global view of the physical properties of its ejecta is lacking, to understand its mysteries. In particular, the spatial distribution of the Si-rich ejecta line-of-sight velocity presents a large-scale unexplained asymmetry, with the north dominantly blueshifted and the south redshifted. To investigate the origin of this line-of-sight velocity asymmetry in the ejecta, we carry out a detailed X-ray spatially-resolved spectral analysis of the entire shocked ejecta in Tycho's SNR to determine the physical properties of its various components. This study is based on the archival deep X-ray observations from the Chandra space telescope. The spatially-resolved spectral analysis in 211 regions over the entire SNR is based on a tesselation method applied to the line-of-sight velocity map. A Bayesian tool is used to conduct the fitting, using a nested sampling algorithm. It allows us to obtain a complete view of the statistical landscape. We provide maps of the physical parameters of the various components across the SNR ejecta. The Doppler shift map confirms spectrally the large-scale north-south asymmetry in the line-of-sight velocity. We reveal different spatial distributions of temperature and ionization time for IMEs and for iron-rich ejecta, but none of these maps shows structure associated to the large-scale north-south asymmetry in the line-of-sight velocity distribution. The abundance maps show spatial variations, depending on the element, perhaps due to an origin in different layers during the explosion. We compare these abundances with some nucleosynthesis models. In addition, we observe for the first time an emission line at 0.654 keV possibly related to oxygen. Its spatial distribution differs from the other elements, so that this line may arise in the ambient medium.
#### Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial  abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC>10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, a kinetic energy recovery system for large telescopes is presented, with the Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST) as a possible target application. The system consists of supercapacitors integrated in the DC-link of motor inverters through a bidirectional DC-DC converter. The optimal system design, based on the energy flow analysis within the telescope's power electronics, is introduced. The proposed system is simulated as part of the telescope's drives, providing not only a significant reduction in energy consumption of the telescope due to motion, but also remarkably reducing (or shaving) grid power peaks. We find that the system presented here can contribute to making both current and future observatories more sustainable.

 - **Abstract**
 Promptly after high-resolution experiments harbinger the field of precision cosmology low- and high-redshift observations abruptly gave rise to a tension in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe ($H_0$) and the clustering of matter ($S_8$). The statistically significant discrepancies between the locally measured values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ and the ones inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background assuming the canonical $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model have become a new cornerstone of theoretical physics. $\Lambda_s$CDM is one of the many beyond Standard Model setups that have been proposed to simultaneously resolve the cosmological tensions. This setup relies on an empirical conjecture, which postulates that $\Lambda$ switched sign (from negative to positive) at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. We reexamine a stringy model that can describe the transition in the vacuum energy hypothesized in $\Lambda_s$CDM. The model makes use of the Casimir forces driven by fields inhabiting the incredible bulk of the dark dimension scenario. Unlike the $\Lambda_s$CDM setup the model deviates from $\Lambda$CDM in the early universe due to the existence of relativistic neutrino-like species. Using the Boltzmann solver CLASS in combination with MontePython we confront predictions of the stringy model to experimental data (from the Planck mission, Pantheon+ supernova type Ia, BAO, and KiDS-1000). We show that the string-inspired model provides a satisfactory fit to the data and can resolve the cosmological tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are well-motivated candidates for dark matter. One signature of galactic WIMPs is the annual modulation expected in a detector's interaction rate, which arises from Earth's rotation around the Sun. Over two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has observed such modulation with 250 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators, in accordance with WIMP expectations but inconsistent with the negative results of other experiments. The signal, however, depends on the target, so in order to either validate or refute the DAMA signal it is necessary to replicate the experiment using the same material. This is the goal of the ANAIS-112 experiment, currently underway since August 2017 with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl). In this work, we present a reanalysis of three years of data employing an improved analysis chain to enhance the experimental sensitivity. The results presented here are consistent with the absence of modulation and inconsistent with DAMA's observation at nearly 3$\sigma$ C.L., with the potential to reach a 5$\sigma$ level within 8 years of data collection. Additionally, we explore the impact of different scintillation quenching factors in the comparison between ANAIS-112 and DAMA/LIBRA.

 - **Abstract**
 The Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE) project is aimed at digitising astronomical photographic plates from three major German plate collections, making them accessible through integration into the International Virtual Observatory (IVO). Photographic plates and related materials (logbooks, envelopes, etc.) were scanned with commercial flatbed scanners. Astrometric and photometric calibrations were carried out with the developed PyPlate software, using Gaia EDR3 data as a reference. The APPLAUSE data publication complies with IVO standards. The latest data release contains images and metadata from 27 plate collections from the partner institutes in Hamburg, Bamberg, and Potsdam, along with digitised archives provided by Tautenburg, Tartu, and Vatican observatories. Altogether, over two billion calibrated measurements extracted from about 70,000 direct photographic plates can readily be used to create long-term light curves. For instance, we constructed the historic light curve of the enigmatic dipping star KIC 8462852. We found no evidence of previously assumed variations on timescales of decades in our light curve. Potential uses of APPLAUSE images for transient sources can be appreciated by following the development of the nova shell of GK Per (1901) over time and the change in brightness of two extragalactic supernovae. The database holds about 10,000 spectral plates. We made use of objective prism plates to follow the temporal changes of Nova DN Gem through 1912 and 1913, highlighting an outburst in early 1913.

 - **Abstract**
 The star formation rate (SFR), the number of stars formed per unit of time, is a fundamental quantity in the evolution of the Universe. While turbulence is believed to play a crucial role in setting the SFR, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Turbulence promotes star formation by compressing the gas, but also slows it down by stabilizing the gas against gravity. Most widely-used analytical models rely on questionable assumptions, including: $i)$ integrating over the density PDF, a one-point statistical description that ignores spatial correlation, $ii)$ selecting self-gravitating gas based on a density threshold that often ignores turbulent dispersion, $iii)$ assuming the freefall time as the timescale for estimating SFR without considering the need to rejuvenate the density PDF, $iv)$ assuming the density PDF to be lognormal. Improving upon the only existing model that incorporates the spatial correlation of the density field, we present a new analytical model. We calculate the time needed to rejuvenate density fluctuations of a given density and spatial scale, revealing that it is generally much longer than the freefall time, rendering the latter inappropriate for use. We make specific predictions regarding the role of the Mach number, $ M $, and the driving scale of turbulence divided by the mean Jeans length. At low to moderate Mach numbers, turbulence does not reduce and may even slightly promote star formation by broadening the PDF. However, at higher Mach numbers, most density fluctuations are stabilized by turbulent dispersion, leading to a steep drop in the SFR as the Mach number increases.

 - **Abstract**
 Einstein's field equations with a background source term that induces perturbations and the applications of this new formalism to a compact dense matter relativistic star are presented. We introduce a new response kernel in the field equations between the metric and fluid perturbations. A source term which drives or induces the sub-hydro mesoscopic scales perturbations in the astrophysical system, is of importance here. Deterministic as well as stochastic perturbations for the radial case are worked out as solutions of field equations. We also touch upon polar perturbations that are deterministic with oscillatory parts. The stochastic perturbation are of significance in terms of two point or point separated correlations which form the building blocks for studying equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics for the system. Our main aim is to build a theory for intermediate scale physics, for dense exotic matter and investigate structure of the compact astrophysical objects. Specifically, turbulence which connects various scales in superfluid matter in the dense stars is an area gaining importance. The work presented here is the starting point for new theoretical frame work that touches upon various yet unexplored scales where mechanical and dynamical effects interior to the matter of the star are of significance. Thus there is scope for extending studies in asteroseismology to mesoscopic effects at the new intermediate scales in the cold dense matter fluid . This is expected to enable us to probe astrophysical features at refined scales through theoretical formulations as well as for observational consequences.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel methodology is developed to extract accurate skeletal reaction models for nuclear combustion. Local sensitivities of isotope mass fractions with respect to reaction rates are modeled based on the forced optimally time-dependent (f-OTD) scheme. These sensitivities are then analyzed temporally to generate skeletal models. The methodology is demonstrated by conducting skeletal reduction of constant density and temperature burning of carbon and oxygen relevant to SNe Ia. The 495-isotopes Torch model is chosen as the detailed reaction network. A map of maximum production of $^{56}\text{Ni}$ in SNe Ia is produced for different temperatures, densities, and proton to neutron ratios. The f-OTD simulations and the sensitivity analyses are then performed with initial conditions from this map. A series of skeletal models are derived and their performances are assessed by comparison against currently existing skeletal models. Previous models have been constructed intuitively by assuming the dominance of $\alpha$-chain reactions. The comparison of the newly generated skeletal models against previous models is based on the predicted energy release and $^{44}\text{Ti}$ and $^{56}\text{Ni}$ abundances by each model. The consequences of $\mathtt{y}_e \neq 0.5$ in the initial composition are also explored where $\mathtt{y}_e$ is the electron fraction. The simulated results show that $^{56}\text{Ni}$ production decreases by decreasing $\mathtt{y}_e$ as expected, and that the $^{43}\text{Sc}$ is a key isotope in proton and neutron channels toward $^{56}\text{Ni}$ production. It is shown that an f-OTD skeletal model with 150 isotopes can accurately predict the $^{56}\text{Ni}$ abundance in SNe Ia for $\mathtt{y}_e \lesssim 0.5$ initial conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Small rocky planets, as well as larger planets that suffered extensive volatile loss, tend to be drier and have thinner atmospheres as compared to Earth. Such planets probably outnumber worlds better endowed with volatiles, being the most common habitable planets. For the subgroup of fast rotators following eccentric orbits, atmospheres suffer radiative forcing and their heat capacity provides a method for gauging atmospheric thickness and surface conditions. We further explore the model presented in a previous paper and apply it to real and hypothetical exoplanets in the habitable zone of various classes of stars, simulating atmospheric and orbital characteristics. For planetary eccentricities e ~0.3, the forcing-induced hypothetical temperature variation would reach ~80 K for airless planets and ~10 K for planets with substantial atmospheres. For Kepler-186 f and Kepler-442 b, assuming e ~0.1, temperature variations can reach ~24 K. We also consider habitable exomoons in circular orbits around gas giants within the habitable zone, which suffer radiative forcing due to their epicyclic motion. We study several combinations of parameters for the characterization of planets (mass, eccentricity and semi-major axis) and exomoons (mass, orbital radius, albedo and atmospheric characteristics) for different stellar types. For e ~0.3, exomoon temperature varies up to ~90 K, while for ~0.6 variations can reach ~200 K. Such exomoons may plausibly retain their volatiles by continued volcanic activity fueled by tidal dissipation. Although currently undetectable, such effects might be within reach of future ELT-class telescopes and space missions with mid-infrared and coronagraphic capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the long-studied radial velocity (RV) target HD26965 using recent observations from the NASA-NSF 'NEID' precision Doppler facility. Leveraging a suite of classical activity indicators, combined with line-by-line RV analyses, we demonstrate that the claimed 45-day signal previously identified as a planet candidate is most likely an activity-induced signal. Correlating the bulk (spectrally-averaged) RV with canonical line activity indicators confirms a multi-day 'lag' between the observed activity indicator time series and the measured RV. When accounting for this lag, we show that much of the observed RV signal can be removed by a linear detrending of the data. Investigating activity at the line-by-line level, we find a depth-dependent correlation between individual line RVs and the bulk RVs, further indicative of periodic suppression of convective blueshift causing the observed RV variability, rather than an orbiting planet. We conclude that the combined evidence of the activity correlations and depth dependence is consistent with a radial velocity signature dominated by a rotationally-modulated activity signal at a period of $\sim$42 days. We hypothesize that this activity signature is due to a combination of spots and convective blueshift suppression. The tools applied in our analysis are broadly applicable to other stars, and could help paint a more comprehensive picture of the manifestations of stellar activity in future Doppler RV surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of extragalactic fast optical transients (eFOTs) as potential multi-messenger sources is one of the main challenges in time-domain astronomy. However, recent developments have allowed for probes of rapidly-evolving transients. With the increasing number of alert streams from optical time-domain surveys, the next paradigm is building technologies to rapidly identify the most interesting transients for follow-up. One effort to make this possible is the fitting of objects to a variety of eFOT lightcurve models such as kilonovae and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. In this work, we describe a new framework designed to efficiently fit transients to light curve models and flag them for further follow-up. We describe the pipeline's workflow and a handful of performance metrics, including the nominal sampling time for each model. We highlight as examples ZTF20abwysqy, the shortest long gamma ray burst discovered to date, and ZTF21abotose, a core-collapse supernova initially identified as a potential kilonova candidate.
#### Forming Mercury from excited initial conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Mercury is notoriously difficult to form in solar system simulations, due to its small mass and iron-rich composition. Smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions have found that a Mercury-like body could be formed by one or multiple giant impacts, but due to the chaotic nature of collisions it is difficult to create a scenario where such impacts will take place. Recent work has found more success forming Mercury analogues by adding additional embryos near Mercury's orbit. In this work, we aim to form Mercury by simulating the formation of the solar system in the presence of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. We test out the effect of an inner disk of embryos added on to the commonly-used narrow annulus of initial material. We form Mercury analogues with core-mass fractions (CMF) $> 0.4$ in $\sim 10\%$ of our simulations, and twice that number of Mercury analogues form during the formation process, but are unstable and do not last to the end of the simulations. Mercury analogues form at similar rates for both disks with and without an inner component, and most of our Mercury analogues have lower CMF than that of Mercury, $\sim 0.7$, due to significant accretion of debris material. We suggest that a more in-depth understanding of the fraction of debris mass that is lost to collisional grinding is necessary to understand Mercury's formation, or some additional mechanism is required to stop this debris from accreting.
#### [OI] fine structure line profiles in Mon R2 and M17 SW: the puzzling  nature of cold foreground material identified by [12CII] self-absorption

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent studies of the optical depth comparing [12CII] and [13CII] line profiles in Galactic star-forming regions revealed strong self-absorption in [12CII] by low excitation foreground material, implying a large column density of C+ corresponding to an equivalent AV of a few, up to about 10 mag. Aims. As the nature and origin of such a large column of cold C+ foreground gas are difficult to explain, it is essential to constrain the physical conditions of this material. Methods. We conducted high-resolution observations of [OI] 63 um and [OI] 145 um lines in M17 SW and Mon R2. The [OI] 145 um transition traces warm PDR-material, while the [OI] 63 um line traces foreground material as manifested by absorption dips. Results. Comparison of both [OI] line profiles with [CII] isotopic lines confirms warm PDR-origin background emission and a significant column of cold foreground material causing self-absorption visible in [12CII] and [OI] 63 um profiles. In M17 SW, the C+ and O column densities are comparable for both layers. Mon R2 exhibits larger O columns compared to C+, indicating additional material where the carbon is neutral or in molecular form. Small-scale spatial variation of the foreground absorption profiles and the large column density (around 1E18 cm-2 ) of the foreground material suggest emission from high-density regions associated with the cloud complex, not a uniform diffuse foreground cloud. Conclusions. The analysis confirms that the previously detected intense [CII] foreground absorption is attributable to a large column of low excitation dense atomic material, where carbon is ionized, and oxygen is in neutral atomic form.

 - **Abstract**
 Improved polarization measurements at frequencies below 70 GHz with degree-level angular resolution are crucial for advancing our understanding of the Galactic synchrotron radiation and the potential polarized anomalous microwave emission and ultimately benefiting the detection of primordial $B$ modes. In this study, we present sensitivity-improved 40 GHz polarization maps obtained by combining the CLASS 40 GHz and WMAP $Q$-band data through a weighted average in the harmonic domain. The decision to include WMAP $Q$-band data stems from similarities in the bandpasses. Leveraging the accurate large-scale measurements from WMAP $Q$ band and the high-sensitivity information from CLASS 40 GHz band at intermediate scales, the noise level at $\ell\in[30, 100]$ is reduced by a factor of $2-3$ in the map space. A pixel domain analysis of the polarized synchrotron spectral index ($\beta_s$) using WMAP $K$ band and the combined maps (mean and 16/84th percentile across the $\beta_s$ map: $-3.08_{-0.20}^{+0.20}$) reveals a stronger preference for spatial variation (PTE for a uniform $\beta_s$ hypothesis smaller than 0.001) than the results obtained using WMAP $K$ and $Ka$ bands ($-3.08_{-0.14}^{+0.14}$). The cross-power spectra of the combined maps follow the same trend as other low-frequency data, and validation through simulations indicates negligible bias introduced by the combination method (sub-percent level in the power spectra). The products of this work are publicly available on $\mathtt{LAMBDA}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $3.2 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 16 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($<1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P>10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e>0.6$). Such progenitors do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are essentially determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\approx$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t>10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z<0.01$) populations to be $4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$, representing $\approx 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\sim 3000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\sim 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3 alike. Gaia BH3-like systems represent a common product of isolated binary evolution at low metallicity ($Z<0.01$), but given the steep density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one in the halo at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Considering the estimated formation efficiency for both the isolated and dynamical formation channel, we conclude that they are almost equally likely to explain the origin of Gaia BH3.
