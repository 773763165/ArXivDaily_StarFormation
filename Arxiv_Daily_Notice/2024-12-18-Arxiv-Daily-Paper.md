 - **Abstract**
 During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy & Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the scope of our occupation. Since 2021, thinking on this subject has progressed significantly, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This year was an opportunity to take stock of the main areas of reflection that we need to keep in mind in order to implement a fair, collective and effective environmental transition. This proceeding summarizes the key points from the plenary session related to the environmental transition special session. The purpose of the messages disseminated here is to suggest ideas for reflection and inspiration, so as to initiate, stimulate, and foster discussions within the A&A research community, towards the implementation of concrete measures to mitigate our environmental footprint.

 - **Abstract**
 Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, as a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. In order to constrain the parameter space of the model, the $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraint of Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 data as well as the reheating parameters such as the duration $N_{\rm{re}}$, the temperature $T_{\rm{re}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, are employed. In addition, a model independent bound on the duration of the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$ is applied to improve the parameter space. Furthermore, the density spectra of relic gravitational waves (GWs) in light of the sensitivity domains of GW detectors, for specific inflationary durations $N$, are analyzed. Finally, by combining constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), reheating, RD era, and relic GWs, the permissible inflationary duration is constrained to $46\leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1\leq N\leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161\leq\alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217\leq\alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL).

          The redshift dependence of the inferred $H_0$ in a local void solution to the Hubble tension

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy number counts suggest that we are located within the Gpc-scale KBC void. The Hubble tension might arise due to gravitationally driven outflow from this void, as explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We explore how the impact of the void on redshift decays at large distances. We define $H_0(z)$ as the present expansion rate $H_0$ that would be inferred from observations in a narrow redshift range centred on $z$. We find $H_0(z)$ in three different ways, all of which give similar results. We then compare these results with the observations of Jia et al., who were careful to minimise the impact of correlations between $H_0$ measurements from data in different redshift bins. We find reasonable agreement with their results for the Gaussian and Exponential void underdensity profiles, although the agreement is less good in the Maxwell-Boltzmann case. The latter profile causes severe disagreement with the observed bulk flow curve at $z < 0.1$ (Mazurenko et al.), so the tension with higher redshift data further highlights that the deepest part of the KBC void is probably near its centre. The observations show a decline of $H_0(z)$ towards the background $Planck$ value in qualitative agreement with the considered models, even if we use a larger void. The good overall agreement with the recent results of Jia et al. suggests that the local supervoid evident from the galaxy luminosity density out to a Gpc might also solve the Hubble tension while retaining a low background $H_0$ consistent with $Planck$ data, assuming enhanced structure formation on $>100$ Mpc scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the Milky Way disk is rapidly improving with the recent advent of the high quality and vast amount of observational data. We summarize our current view of the structure of the Milky Way disk, such as the masses and sizes of the gas and stellar disks, and the position and motion of the Sun in the disk. We also discuss the different definitions of the thick and thin disks of the Milky Way, the non-axisymmetric structures of the stellar disk, such as the bar and spiral arms, and the radial migration which can be triggered by these non-axisymmetric stellar structures. After the revolutionary data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, our view of the Milky Way disk has been transformed to a non-equilibrium system with many complicated structures in stellar kinematic distribution. We also summarize the recent findings of Galactoseismology research. These detailed observational data provide the archaeological information for us to unveil the formation and evolution history of the Milky Way disk, with the aid of the high-resolution numerical simulations of the Milky Way-like galaxy formation. We also discuss the current view of the formation history of the Milky Way disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity studies greatly benefit from focusing on M dwarfs because they are often paired in a variety of configurations with both stellar and substellar objects, including exoplanets. We aim to address the observed multiplicity of M dwarfs by conducting a systematic analysis using the latest available astrophotometric data. For every star in a sample of 2214 M dwarfs from the CARMENES catalogue, we investigated the existence of resolved and unresolved physical companions in the literature and in all-sky surveys, especially in Gaia DR3 data products. We covered a very wide range of separations, from known spectroscopic binaries in tight arrangements $\sim$0.01 au to remarkably separated ultra-wide pairs ($\sim$10$^5$ au). We identified 835 M dwarfs in 720 multiple systems, predominantly binaries. Thus, we propose 327 new binary candidates based on Gaia data. If these candidates are finally confirmed, we expect the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs to be 40.3$^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ %. When only considering the systems already identified, the multiplicity fraction is reduced to 27.8$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ %. This result is in line with most of the values published in the literature. We also identified M-dwarf multiple systems with FGK, white dwarf, ultra-cool dwarf, and exoplanet companions, as well as those in young stellar kinematic groups. We studied their physical separations, orbital periods, binding energies, and mass ratios. We argue that based on reliable astrometric data and spectroscopic investigations from the literature (even when considering detection biases), the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs could still be significantly underestimated. This calls for further high-resolution follow-up studies to validate these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino quantum kinetics in dense astrophysical environments is investigated relying on the mean-field approximation. However, it remains to be understood whether mean-field corrections could hinder flavor instabilities that are otherwise foreseen. In this paper, we heuristically explore whether beyond-mean-field effects due to neutrino degeneracy can affect the flavor conversion physics. We find that these corrections shift the stability regions for a suite of (anti)neutrino distributions; a configuration of angular distributions that is stable in the mean-field case can become unstable, or the flavor conversion of previously unstable ensembles can be damped. Our work should serve as a motivation for further understanding the limitations of the mean-field treatment.

          Uncovering Correlations and Biases in Parameter Inference from Neutron-Star Pulse Profile Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling of X-ray pulse profiles from millisecond pulsars offers a promising method of inferring the mass-to-radius ratios of neutron stars. Recent observations with NICER resulted in measurements of radii for three neutron stars using this technique. In this paper, we explore correlations between model parameters and the degree to which individual parameters can be inferred from pulse profiles, using an analytic model that allows for an efficient and interpretable exploration. We introduce a new set of model parameters that reduce the most prominent correlations and allow for an efficient sampling of posteriors. We then demonstrate that the degree of beaming of radiation emerging from the neutron star surface has a large impact on the uncertainties in the inferred model parameters. Finally, we show that the uncertainties in the model parameters for neutron stars for which the polar cap temperature falls outside of the NICER energy range are significantly degraded.

          A Counterintuitive Correlation Between Neutron-Star Radii Inferred from Pulse Modeling and Surface Emission Beaming

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, shaped by gravitational lensing and the beaming of the surface radiation, provides critical insights into neutron star properties. This approach has been the focus of observations with the NICER mission. Using a semi-analytic model to calculate pulse profiles, we investigate the effects of adopting incorrect beaming models on the inferred compactness of neutron stars. We demonstrate that assuming a more centrally peaked beaming pattern when fitting data from a more isotropic emitter leads to an underestimation of compactness in the case of two antipodal polar caps. We present a detailed analysis of this counterintuitive result, offering both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates. If the atmospheric heating in the millisecond pulsars observed with NICER is shallow, the inferred radii for these sources could be significantly overestimated, with important implications for neutron star structure and equation-of-state constraints.

          Towards detecting Primordial non-Gaussianity in the CMB using Spherical Convolutional Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores a novel application of spherical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect primordial non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a key probe of inflationary dynamics. While effective, traditional estimators encounter computational challenges, especially when considering summary statistics beyond the bispectrum. We propose spherical CNNs as an alternative, directly analysing full-sky CMB maps to overcome limitations in previous machine learning (ML) approaches that relied on data summaries. By training on simulated CMB maps with varying amplitudes of non-Gaussianity, our spherical CNN models show promising alignment with optimal error bounds of traditional methods, albeit at lower-resolution maps. While we explore several different architectures, results from DeepSphere CNNs most closely match the Fisher forecast for Gaussian test sets under noisy and masked conditions. Our study suggests that spherical CNNs could complement existing methods of non-Gaussianity detection in future datasets, provided additional training data and parameter tuning are applied. We discuss the potential for CNN-based techniques to scale with larger data volumes, paving the way for applications to future CMB data sets.

 - **Abstract**
 Data visualisation is an essential ingredient of scientific analysis, discovery, and communication. Along with a human (to do the looking) and the data (something to look at), an image display device is a key component of any data visualisation workflow. For the purpose of this work, standard displays include combinations of laptop displays, peripheral monitors, tablet and smartphone screens, while the main categories of advanced displays are stereoscopic displays, tiled display walls, digital domes, virtual/mixed reality (VR/MR) head-mounted displays, and CAVE/CAVE2-style immersive rooms. We present the results of the second Advanced Image Displays for Astronomy (AIDA) survey, advertised to the membership of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) during June-August 2021. The goal of this survey was to gather background information on the level of awareness and usage of advanced displays in astronomy and astrophysics research. From 17 complete survey responses, sampled from a population of ~750 ASA members, we infer that: (1) a high proportion of ASA members use standard displays but do not use advanced displays; (2) a moderate proportion have seen a VR/MR HMD, and may also have used one -- but not for research activities; and (3) there is a need for improved knowledge in general about advanced displays, along with relevant software or applications that can target specific science needs. We expect that this is compatible with the experiences of much of the international astronomy and astrophysics research community. We suggest that VR/MR head-mounted displays have now reached a level of technical maturity such that they could be used to replicate or replace the functionality of most other advanced displays.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, with diverse time-frequency patterns and emission properties that require explanation. Since FRBs are only detected in the radio, analyzing their dynamic spectra is crucial to disentangling the physical processes governing their generation and propagation. Furthermore, comparing FRB morphologies provides insights into possible differences among their progenitors and environments. This study applies unsupervised learning and deep learning techniques to investigate FRB dynamic spectra, focusing on two approaches: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) enhanced by an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB) layer. PCA served as a computationally efficient baseline, capturing broad trends, identifying outliers, and providing valuable insights into large datasets. However, its linear nature limited its ability to reconstruct complex, non-linear structures in FRB signals. In contrast, the IOB-augmented CAE demonstrated exceptional performance in capturing intricate burst features, achieving high reconstruction accuracy and robust denoising, even at modest signal-to-noise ratios. The IOB layer's ability to prioritize relevant features enabled efficient data compression, preserving key morphological characteristics with minimal latent variables. When applied to real FRBs from CHIME, the IOB-CAE generalized effectively, revealing a latent space that highlighted the continuum of FRB morphologies and the potential for distinguishing intrinsic differences between burst types. This framework demonstrates that while FRBs may not naturally cluster into discrete groups, advanced representation learning techniques can uncover meaningful structures, offering new insights into the diversity and origins of these bursts.

          Creating Pileups of Eccentric Planet Pairs Wide of MMRs Through Divergent Migration

 - **Abstract**
 Observed pileups of planets with period ratios $\approx 1\%$ wide of strong mean motion resonances (MMRs) pose an important puzzle. Early models showed that they can be created through sustained eccentricity damping driving a slow separation of the orbits, but this picture is inconsistent with elevated eccentricities measured through Transit Timing Variations. We argue that any source of divergent migration (tides, planet-disk interactions etc.) will cause planets that encounter an MMR to both jump over it (piling up wide of resonance) and get a kick to their free eccentricity. We find that the jumps in eccentricity expected from slow MMR crossings are sufficient (but mostly too large) to explain the free eccentricities measured through TTVs. We argue that this mechanism can be brought in line with observations if MMR crossings are not adiabatic and/or through residual eccentricity damping.

          Wolf-Rayet Colliding Wind Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet stars embody the final stable phase of the most massive stars immediately before their evolution is terminated in a supernova explosion. They are responsible for some of the most extreme and energetic phenomena in stellar physics, driving fast and dense stellar winds that are powered by extraordinarily high mass-loss rates arising from their near Eddington limit luminosity. When found in binary systems comprised of two hot wind-driving components, a colliding wind binary (CWB) is formed, manifesting dramatic observational signatures from the radio to X-rays. Among the wealth of rare and exotic phenomenology associated with CWBs, perhaps the most unexpected is the production of copious amounts of warm dust. A necessary condition seems to be one binary component being a carbon-rich WR star -- providing favorable chemistry for dust nucleation from the wind -- however a detailed understanding of the physics underlying this phenomenon has not been established.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar molecules are excellent tools for studying the physical and chemical environments of massive star-forming regions. In particular, vibrationally excited HC$_3$N (HC$_3$N*) lines are the key tracers for probing hot cores environments. We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 3 mm observations of HC$_3$N* lines in 60 hot cores, aiming to investigate how physical conditions affect the excitation of HC$_3$N* transitions. We have used the XCLASS for line identification. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), we derived the rotation temperature and column density of HC$_3$N* transitions in hot cores. Additionally, we calculated the H$_2$ column density and number density, along with the abundance of HC$_3$N* relative to H$_2$, to enable a comparison of the physical properties of hot cores with different numbers of HC$_3$N* states. We have detected HC$_3$N* lines in 52 hot cores, in which 29 cores showing more than one vibrationally excited state. Hot cores with higher gas temperatures have more detections of these vibrationally excited lines. The excitation of HC$_3$N* requires dense environments, with its spatial distribution influenced by the presence of UC Hii regions. The observed column density of HC$_3$N* contributes to the number of HC$_3$N* states in hot core environments. After analyzing the various factors influencing HC$_3$N* excitation in hot cores, we conclude that the excitation of HC$_3$N* is mainly driven by mid-IR pumping, while collisional excitation is ineffective.

          Modeling the UV/Optical light curve of re-brightening tidal disruption events

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a new subclass of tidal disruption events (TDEs) was reported from the literature. The light curve of these TDEs show a re-brightening feature in the decline phase after the first peak, which then leads to a second flare. The re-brightening TDEs challenges the existing light curve fitting tools, which are designed to handle single flare. In this work, we present a model, aimed at reproducing of the light curve of the re-brightening TDEs, based on the scenario that the consecutive flares are produced by the same star who experienced two partial disruptions (PTDEs). We also develop a fitting code from this model, and apply it to two re-brightening TDEs: AT 2022dbl and AT 2023adr. The light curve of both TDEs are well fitted. Finally, we forecast the time and peak brightness of the next flare for these two TDEs, so that the observers could get prepared in advance and make an examination on our model.

          A Simplified Analytical Approach for Determining Eclipses of Satellites Occulted by a Celestial Body

 - **Abstract**
 The primary objective of this paper is to construct an analytical model for determining the total duration of eclipse events of satellites. The approach assumes that the trace formed in the orbital plane, cutting body shadow under the classical conical shadow model, can be described as an ellipse. This allows for the derivation of its parameters through the use of classical orbital elements and solar position in the body-centric frame. Consequently, the problem of identifying satellite occultation events is simplified to searching for points of intersection between two ellipses: the satellite orbit and the shadow. The developed model has been demonstrated to be applicable for a wide range of inclinations, with the exception of cases where the orbital plane of the satellite motion coincides with that of the sun in the body-centric frame. It is shown that the shadow function constructed under the aforementioned assumptions can be simplified in the cylindrical shadow model. Several simplifications to the proposed model are presented in the study. The paper also considers extending the model to account for non-spherical shapes of celestial bodies, i.e., bodies with oblateness, and presents an algorithm that accounts for changes in eclipse duration due to the heliocentric motion of these celestial bodies. The model has been validated through numerous tests with a numerical algorithm and satellite real data, as well as with other analytical models.

          Minute-cadence observations on Galactic plane with Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST): Overview, methodology and early results

 - **Abstract**
 As the time-domain survey telescope of the highest survey power in the northern hemisphere currently, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is scheduled to hourly/daily/semi-weekly scan northern sky up to ~23 mag in four optical (ugri) bands. Unlike the observation cadences in the forthcoming regular survey missions, WFST performed "staring" observations toward Galactic plane in a cadence of $\approx$1 minute for a total on-source time of about 13 hours, during the commissioning and pilot observation phases. Such an observation cadence is well applied in producing densely sampling light curves and hunting for stars exhibiting fast stellar variabilities. Here we introduce the primary methodologies in detecting variability, periodicity, and stellar flares among a half million sources from the minute-cadence observations, and present the WFST g-/r-band light curves generated from periodic variable stars and flaring stars. Benefit from high photometric precisions and deep detection limits of WFST, the observations have captured several rare variable stars, such as a variable hot white dwarf (WD) and an ellipsoidal WD binary candidate. By surveying the almost unexplored parameter spaces for variables, WFST will lead to new opportunities in discovering unique variable stars in the northern sky.

          Testing inhomogeneous cosmography in our cosmic neighborhood using CosmicFlows-4

 - **Abstract**
 The convergence of the general cosmographic expansion of the luminosity distance is studied in a model of our cosmic neighborhood based on publicly available density and velocity fields obtained from CosmicFlows-4 data. The study confirms earlier findings that indicate divergence of the expansion at low redshifts, well before $z\sim 0.1$. By being based on a realistically placed observer in a model constructed from a real map of our cosmic neighborhood, the presented results firmly establish that the range of convergence must be an important focus when using the general cosmographic expansion. The study also highlights the loss of information we face when using the traditional cosmographic expansion based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker models. Specifically, sky maps of effective Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters showing strong fluctuations of these across the sky are presented. These fluctuations and their meaning cannot be established using the framework of standard cosmology. It is suggested that the general cosmographic expansion should be studied at higher order and in recast forms to scrutinize the possibility of obtaining convergence at higher redshift. In addition, the general cosmographic expansion in its current form may have faster rate of convergence when applied to other datasets. It is therefore suggested that the use of general cosmographic expansions should be accompanied by realistic assessments of the expansion's precision for the given dataset, e.g. by employing the modeling procedure used here to make a synthetic model universe based on the data. A poor convergence does not necessarily mean that the information extracted by fitting data to the general cosmographic expansion is useless. It simply means that we must be careful when interpreting the results and e.g. consider what scales the expansion coefficients are probing.

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}<3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.

 Radial drift of icy pebbles can have a large impact on the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Compact dust disks ($\lesssim$50 au) are suggested to have a higher (cold) H$_2$O flux than more extended disks, likely due to efficient radial drift bringing H$_2$O-rich material to the inner disk, where it can be observed with JWST. We present JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the disk CX Tau taken as a part of the Mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO program, a prime example of a drift-dominated disk. This compact disk seems peculiar: the source possesses a bright CO$_2$ feature instead of the bright H$_2$O expected based on its efficient radial drift. We aim to provide an explanation for this finding. We detect molecular emission from H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and OH in this disk, and even demonstrate a potential detection of CO$^{18}$O. Analysis of the $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ emission shows the former to be tracing a temperature of $\sim$450 K, whereas the $^{13}$CO$_2$ traces a significantly colder temperature ($\sim$200 K). H$_2$O is also securely detected both at shorter and longer wavelengths, tracing a similar temperature of $\sim$500-600 K as the CO$_2$ emission. We also find evidence for a colder, $\sim$200 K H$_2$O component at longer wavelengths, which is in line with this disk having strong radial drift. The cold $^{13}$CO$_2$ and H$_2$O emission indicate that radial drift of ices likely plays an important role in setting the chemistry of the inner disk of CX Tau. Potentially, the H$_2$O-rich gas has already advected onto the central star, which is now followed by an enhancement of comparatively CO$_2$-rich gas reaching the inner disk, explaining the enhancement of CO$_2$ emission in CX Tau. The comparatively weaker H$_2$O emission can be explained by the source's low accretion luminosity. (abridged)

          Can quasars, triggered by mergers, account for NANOGrav's stochastic gravitational wave background?

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) recently discovered by several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is consistent with arising from a population of coalescing super-massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The amplitude of the background is somewhat higher than expected in most previous population models or from the local mass density of SMBHs. SMBHBs are expected to be produced in galaxy mergers, which are also thought to trigger bright quasar activity. Under the assumptions that (i) a fraction $f_{bin} \sim 1$ of all quasars are associated with SMBHB mergers, (ii) the typical quasar lifetime is $t_{Q} \sim 10^{8} yr$, and (iii) adopting Eddington ratios $f_{Edd} \sim 0.3$ for the luminosity of bright quasars, we compute the GWB associated directly with the empirically measured quasar luminosity function (QLF). This approach bypasses the need to model the cosmological evolution of SMBH or galaxy mergers from simulations or semi-analytical models. We find a GWB amplitude approximately matching the value measured by NANOGrav. Our results are consistent with most quasars being associated with SMBH binaries and being the sources of the GWB, and imply a joint constraint on $t_{Q}$, $f_{Edd}$ and the typical mass ratio $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1}$. The GWB in this case would be dominated by relatively distant $\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ SMBHs at $z \approx 2 - 3$, at the peak of quasar activity. Similarly to other population models, our results remain in tension with the local SMBH mass density.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity stars and peculiar G objects orbit the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Together, the G objects and high-velocity stars constitute the S cluster. In contrast with theoretical predictions, no binary system near Sgr A* has been identified. Here, we report the detection of a spectroscopic binary system in the S cluster with the masses of the components of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.50 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.14 M$_{\odot}$, assuming an edge-on configuration. Based on periodic changes in the radial velocity, we find an orbital period of 372 $\pm$ 3 days for the two components. The binary system is stable against the disruption by Sgr A* due to the semi-major axis of the secondary being 1.59 $\pm$ 0.01 AU, which is well below its tidal disruption radius of approximately 42.4 AU. The system, known as D9, shows similarities to the G objects. We estimate an age for D9 of 2.7$^{+1.9}_{-0.3}$ x 10$^6$ yr that is comparable to the timescale of the SMBH-induced von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycle period of about 10$^6$ yr, causing the system to merge in the near future. Consequently, the population of G objects may consist of pre-merger binaries and post-merger products. The detection of D9 implies that binary systems in the S cluster have the potential to reside in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* for approximately 10$^6$ years.

          Detection of Enhanced Germanium in a New Cool Extreme Helium Star A 980: Insights and Implications

 - **Abstract**
 A fine abundance analysis of a recently discovered hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, A 980, is presented. Based on the observed high-resolution optical spectrum, we ascertain that A 980 is a cool extreme helium (EHe) star and not an HdC. Singly-ionized germanium Ge II lines are identified in A 980's optical spectrum. These are the first-ever detections of germanium lines in an EHe's observed spectrum, and provide the first measurements of germanium abundance in an EHe star. The overabundance of germanium in A 980's atmosphere provides us with evidence for the synthesis of germanium in EHe stars. Among the known cool EHe stars, A 980 exhibits a maximum enhancement of the s-process elements based on significant number of transitions. The measured elemental abundances reveal signs of H-burning, He-burning, and specifically the nucleosyntheses of the key elements: Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. The nucleosyntheses of these key elements are discussed in light of asymptotic giant branch evolution and the expectation from the accretion of an He white dwarf by a C-O white dwarf or by a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass function (IMF) of stars and the corresponding cloud mass function (CMF), traditionally considered universal, exhibit variations that are influenced by the local environment. Notably, these variations are apparent in the distribution's tail, indicating a possible relationship between local dynamics and mass distribution. Our study is designed to examine how the gas PDF , the IMF and the CMF depend on the local turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations on small star-forming sections of the ISM under varying turbulence conditions, characterized by Mach numbers of 1, 3.5, and 10, and with two distinct mean densities. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of different turbulence levels on the formation of stellar and cloud masses. The study demonstrates a clear correlation between the dynamics of the cloud and the IMF. In environments with lower levels of turbulence likely dominated by gravitational collapse, our simulations showed the formation of more massive structures with a powerlaw gas PDF, leading to a top-heavy IMF and CMF. On the other hand environment dominated by turbulence result in a lognormal PDF and a Salpeter-like CMF and IMF. This indicates that the turbulence level is a critical factor in determining the mass distribution within star-forming regions.

          Confirmation of the planetary nebula nature of HaTr 5. Not the remnant of Nova Sco 1437

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of the nebula HaTr 5 with the shell remnant of the historic Nova Sco 1437 around the low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable 2MASS J17022815-4306123 has been used in the framework of the hibernation scenario to set an upper limit of <580 yr to the transition time from a nova-like binary to a dwarf nova. This work aims at clarifying the nature of HaTr 5, which has also previously been proposed to be a possible planetary nebula. Intermediate- and high-dispersion long-slit spectra of HaTr\,5 have been obtained and analyzed in conjunction with archival optical and infrared images to investigate its spectral properties using photoionization models, to derive its H-alpha flux and ionized mass, and to determine its spatio-kinematic by means of 3D models to clarify its true nature. The H-alpha flux of HaTr 5 implies an ionized mass of 0.059 M_Sun at the 0.99 kpc distance of J170228, i.e., about 1000 times the typical ejecta of a nova. If HaTr\,5 were actually an unrelated planetary nebula, its H-alpha flux implies a distance of 2.25 kpc and an ionized mass of 0.47 M_Sun. The expansion velocity of HaTr 5 is found to be of 27 km/s, with a heliocentric radial velocity of -1 km/. The ionized mass of HaTr 5 and its expansion velocity (and associated kinematic age) are clearly inconsistent with those expected for a nova remnant, which all strongly support a planetary nebula nature. The association of J170228 with HaTr 5 is further called into question by their differing radial velocities and almost orthogonal motions on the plane of the sky. It is concluded that HaTr 5 is an old, evolved planetary nebula unrelated to the remnant of Nova Sco 1437 and to the cataclysmic variable J170228, the latter being by chance projected onto HaTr 5.

 - **Abstract**
 We present simulation results examining the presence and behavior of standing shocks in zero-energy low angular momentum advective accretion flows and explore their (in)stabilities properties taking into account various specific angular momentum, $\lambda_0$. Within the range $10-50R_g$ (where $R_g$ denotes the Schwarzschild radius), shocks are discernible for $\lambda_0\geq 1.75$. In the special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) simulation when $\lambda_0 = 1.80$, we find the merger of two shocks resulted in a dramatic increase in luminosity. We present the impact of external and internal flow collisions from the funnel region on luminosity. Notably, oscillatory behavior characterizes shocks within $1.70 \leq \lambda_0 \leq 1.80$. Using free-free emission as a proxy for analysis, we shows that the luminosity oscillations between frequencies of $0.1-10$ Hz for $\lambda_0$ range $1.7 \leq \lambda_0 \leq 1.80$. These findings offer insights into quasi-periodic oscillations emissions from certain black hole X-ray binaries, exemplified by GX 339-4. Furthermore, for the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center, Sgr A*, oscillation frequencies between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$ Hz were observed. This frequency range, translating to one cycle every few days, aligns with observational data from the X-ray telescopes such as Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton.

 - **Abstract**
 The Comprehensive Research with Echelles on the Most interesting Eclipsing binaries (CRÉME) projects was aimed to collect high-resolutions spectra of about 380 detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), which mostly do not have literature RV data. From this vast observational material we were able to estimate masses of components of 325 double-lined system. Since the launch of the TESS mission we have been collecting 2-min cadence photometry for the CRÉME targets through successful GI proposals. As by Sector 85, we obtained data for $>$330 of them. We are thus now in the process of comprehensively analyzing our targets. This paper presents the recent status of the CRÉME project and its space photometry counterpart, and describes several sub-projects within CRÉME that focus on specific classes of targets.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic disk warp has been widely characterized by stellar distributions and stellar kinematics but has not been traced by stellar chemistry. Here, we use a sample with over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars selected from LAMOST and APOGEE first to establish a correlation between the north-south asymmetry in metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the disk warp. Our results indicate that the height of the [Fe/H] mid-plane for the whole RC sample stars is accurately described as $Z_{w}$ = 0.017 ($R$ $-$ 7.112)$^{2}$ sin($\phi$ $-$ 9.218). This morphology aligns closely with the warp traced by Cepheids, suggesting that the disk north-south asymmetry in [Fe/H] may serve as a new tracer for the Galactic warp. Our detailed analysis of the young/thin disk stars of this RC sample suggests that its warp is well-modeled as $Z_{w}$ = 0.016 ($R$ $-$ 6.507)$^{2}$ sin($\phi$ $-$ 4.240), indicating that the line of node (LON) of the Galactic warp is oriented at 4.240$_{-1.747}^{+1.641}$ degree.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center provides a unique opportunity to observe a galactic core, objects in close proximity to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and star formation channels that exhibit imprints of this peculiar environment. This habitat hosts, in addition to the SMBH Sgr A*, a surprisingly young cluster with the so-called S-stars. These stars orbit the SMBH on timescales of a few years with thousands of km/s. While the presence of high-velocity stars in the S-cluster already raises a variety of scientific questions, the observation of several bright L-band emission sources has resulted in a rich discussion of their nature. The detection of a prominent Doppler-shifted Br$\gamma$ line accompanies most of these sources that seem to be embedded in a dusty envelope. Using the radiative-transfer model HYPERION, we find strong indications of the presence of a stellar low-mass population embedded in the S-cluster. We revisit this intriguing cluster and its dusty members that orbit the supermassive black hole Sgr A* on bound Keplerian trajectories. Among these cluster members, there is one source that initiated the studies of this analysis: G1. We find that the flux density of G1 in the NIR and MIR resembles a spectral energy distribution of a Class I YSO, which contributes to the "Paradox of Youth".

          A prediction for 25th solar cycle using visibility graph and Hathaway function

 - **Abstract**
 We apply a complex network approach to analyse the time series of five solar parameters, and propose an strategy to predict the number of sunspots for the next solar maximum, and when will this maximum will occur. The approach is based on the Visibility Graph (VG) algorithm, and a slightly modified version of it, the Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG), which map a time series into a complex network. Various network metrics exhibit either an exponential or a scale-free behavior, and we find that the evolution of the characteristic decay exponents is consistent with variations of the sunspots number along solar cycles. During solar minimum, the sunspots number and the solar index time series have characteristic decay exponents that correlate well with the next maximum sunspots number, suggesting that they may be good precursors of the intensity of the next solar maximum. Based on this observation, we find that, based on current data, the algorithm predicts a number of 179 sunspots for cycle 25. Combining this with the Hathaway function, adjusted to yield such maximum sunspots number, we find that the maximum for solar cycle 25 will occur in December 2024/January 2025.

 - **Abstract**
 A numerical integration of the equations of motion of the Sun-planets-an object system is used to study the evolution of orbits close to the orbit of the P/1996 R2 object, which is a Jupiter-crossing object, and to the asteroidal orbit of the P/1996 N2 object, which, at the moment of its detection, had a tail similar to a cometary one. Small variations in the initial data considerably affect the evolution of orbits close to that of the P/1996 R2 object. The time elapsed up to the ejection of the object into a hyperbolic orbit varied from 3*10^4 to 2.7*10^7 yr. Some objects were in resonances with Jupiter and Saturn for a long time. For about 20 percent of the runs, objects reached the Earth's orbit during evolution. Orbital elements of the P/1996 N2 object changed quasi-periodically over the considered time span of 200 Myr. Variations in the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination were equal to 0.04 AU, 0.11 deg, and 3.5 deg, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains unresolved in fundamental physics. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could explain the nature of dark matter, can be captured by celestial bodies like the Sun or Earth, leading to enhanced self-annihilation into Standard Model particles including neutrinos detectable by neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. This article presents a search for muon neutrinos from the center of the Earth performed with 10 years of IceCube data using a track-like event selection. We considered a number of WIMP annihilation channels ($\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$/$W^+W^-$/$b\bar{b}$) and masses ranging from 10 GeV to 10 TeV. No significant excess over background due to a dark matter signal was found while the most significant result corresponds to the annihilation channel $\chi\chi\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ for the mass $m_{\chi}=250$~GeV with a post-trial significance of $1.06\sigma$. Our results are competitive with previous such searches and direct detection experiments. Our upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP scattering are world-leading among neutrino telescopes for WIMP masses $m_{\chi}>100$~GeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have recently provided strong evidence for the signal of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz-frequency band. These experiments have shown a statistical preference for the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation between pulsars, which is widely regarded as a definitive signature of the SGWB. Using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of four different models that go beyond the standard cosmological framework and influence the overlap reduction function. Specifically, we analyze ultralight vector dark matter (DM), spin-2 ultralight DM, massive gravity, and a folded non-Gaussian component to the SGWB. We find that the spin-2 ultralight DM and the massive gravity model are statistically equivalent to the HD prediction, and there is weak evidence in favor of the non-Gaussian component and the ultralight vector DM model. We also perform a non-parametric test using the Genetic Algorithms, which suggests a weak deviation from the HD curve. However, improved data quality is required before drawing definitive conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares are abundant in space photometric light curves. As they are now available in large enough numbers, the statistical study of their overall temporal morphology is timely. We use light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the shapes of stellar flares beyond a simple parameterization by duration and amplitude, and reveal possible connections to astrophysical parameters. We retrain and use the flatwrm2 long-short term memory neural network to find stellar flares in 2-min cadence TESS light curves from the first five years of the mission (sectors 1-69). We scale these flares to a comparable standard shape, and use principal component analysis to describe their temporal morphology in a concise way. We investigate how the flare shapes change along the main sequence, and test whether individual flares hold any information about their host stars. We also apply similar techniques to solar flares, using extreme ultraviolet irradiation time series. Our final catalog contains ~120,000 flares on ~14,000 stars. Due to the strict filtering and the final manual vetting, this sample contains virtually no false positives, although at the expense of reduced completeness. Using this flare catalog, we detect a dependence of the average flare shape on the spectral type. These changes are not apparent for individual flares, only when averaging thousands of events. We find no strong clustering in the flare shape space. We create new analytical flare templates for different types of stars, present a technique to sample realistic flares, and a method to locate flares with similar shapes. The flare catalog, along with the extracted flare shapes, and the data used to train flatwrm2 are publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 When the ejecta of supernovae interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby supernovae provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-supernova evolution. Here we present late-time, multi-epoch optical and Chandra} X-ray spectra of the core-collapse supernova SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in July 2017 and August 2021 show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of $\pm 4500$ km s$^{-1}$. Red-shifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blue-shifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the supernova ejecta. Broad $\pm 2400$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\alpha$ is also seen which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower density environment. Though originally identified as a SN IIn, based upon late time optical emission line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a SN IIb/Ib.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars are unique bodies of the Universe where self-gravity compress matter to such high temperature and density that several nuclear fusion reactions ignite, providing enough feedback against further compression for a time that can be even larger than the age of the universe. The main property of a star is its mass because it determines its structure, evolutionary history, age, and ultimate fate. Depending on this quantity, stars are broadly classified as low-mass stars, like our Sun, intermediate mass stars as the variable star Delta Cephei, and massive stars as Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in Orion constellation. Here we will introduce the basic notions useful to understand stellar evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. This mass range (0.1 M$_{\odot}$ - 10.0 M$_{\odot}$) deserves special attention, as it contains most of the stars in the universe. This chapter will focus on how these stars form, the processes that drive their evolution, and key details regarding their structure. Finally, we will discuss the death of such stars, emphasizing the unique fates associated with low- and intermediate-mass stars.

 In this Letter, we use the latest results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey to measure the Hubble constant. Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations released by the DESI survey, allow us to determine $H_0$ from the first principles. Our method is purely data-driven and relies on unanchored luminosity distances reconstructed from SN Ia data and $H(z)$ reconstruction from cosmic chronometers. Thus it circumvents calibrations related to the value of the sound horizon size at the baryon drag epoch or intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia. We find $H_0=68.4^{+1.0}_{-0.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ at 68% C.L., which provides the Hubble constant at an accuracy of 1.3% with minimal assumptions. Our assessments of this fundamental cosmological quantity using the BAO data spanning the redshift range $z=0.51-2.33$ agree very well with Planck's results and TRGB results within $1\sigma$. This result is still in a $4.3\sigma$ tension with the results of the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES).

Unlike cosmic rays, $\gamma$ rays can be used to probe their production sites in the Galaxy and to find which type of astrophysical sources is able to accelerated particles up to PeV energies. Twenty years of observations with current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS) provided an unprecedented view of the very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray sky and a large variety of Galactic sources which are prominent TeV emitters, such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, massive stellar clusters and binary systems, in addition to a large fraction of unidentified TeV sources. For a long time, supernova remnants were the most promising candidates for the main source of Galactic cosmic rays, but the new window of ultra-high-energy $\gamma$ rays recently opened by HAWC and LHAASO gave unexpected results and demonstrated the need to re-evaluate some scenarios and to revise some of our definitions. The highest-energy $\gamma$-ray sources are not associated with standard candidates for the main source of Galactic cosmic rays and challenged our usual paradigms, highlighting the vastness of what needs to be explored and understood in the next decades.

 - **Abstract**
 We present eight cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like system that include suppression of the linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$, and/or velocity-dependent DM self-interactions, as the third installment of the COZMIC suite. We consider a model featuring a massive dark photon that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark fermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter perturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which ultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a velocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a cross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first time, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal evolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with present-day virial masses below $\approx 10^9~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. In simulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass (sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of core-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression. In particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints almost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less extreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\approx 20\%$ of subhalos and $\approx 5\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, and also increase the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos relative to SIDM. These results reveal a complex interplay between early and late-universe DM physics, revealing new discovery scenarios in the context of upcoming small-scale structure measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, $\alpha$-poor VMP ($\alpha$PVMP) stars that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for Mg and other $\alpha$ elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 $\alpha$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority ($82\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a ejecta can also explain most ($76\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a and PISN can fit $41\%$ and $29\%$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that $\alpha$PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a.

 - **Abstract**
 During the various steps of stellar evolution are formed convectives zones that alter the chemical stratification in stars. Usually, in astrophysics is used the Mixing Length Theory (MLT) for modeling the convective movement and, in general, it is used with the Schwarzschild instability criterion, which neglects the impact of chemical composition gradients in the development of convection. However, towards the end of central helium burning and during the thermal pulses in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) are produced stratification processes with inversions in the chemical gradient that would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion. These instabilities would alter the chemical profile in the white dwarfs, with respect to the one predicted by MLT, having observable consequences in the pulsational modes of such objects. In the present work we will explore an extension of MLT in which we will consider the chemical instabilities as generators of convectives and non-convectives instabilities. This theory will be applied in stellar evolution models in comparison with standard MLT and a double diffusive mixing theory, discussing the benefits and shortcomings of each one.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectra of the supernova (SN) impostor AT 2016blu spanning over a decade. This transient exhibits quasiperiodic outbursts with a $\sim$113 d period, likely triggered by periastron encounters in an eccentric binary system where the primary star is a luminous blue variable (LBV). The overall spectrum remains fairly consistent during quiescence and eruptions, with subtle changes in line-profile shapes and other details. Some narrow emission features indicate contamination from a nearby H II region in the host galaxy, NGC 4559. Broader H$\alpha$ profiles exhibit Lorentzian shapes with full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) values that vary significantly, showing no correlation with photometric outbursts or the 113 d phase. At some epochs, H$\alpha$ exhibits asymmetric profiles with a stronger redshifted wing, while broad and sometimes multicomponent P Cygni absorption features occasionally appear, but are again uncorrelated with brightness or phase. These P Cygni absorptions have high velocities compared to the FWHM of the H$\alpha$ emission line, perhaps suggesting that the absorption component is not in the LBV's wind, but is instead associated with a companion. The lack of phase dependence in line-profile changes may point to interaction between a companion and a variable or inhomogeneous primary wind, in an orbit with only mild eccentricity. Recent photometric data indicate that AT 2016blu experienced its 20th outburst around May/June 2023, as predicted based on its period. This type of quasiperiodic LBV remains poorly understood, but its spectra and erratic light curve resemble some pre-SN outbursts like those of SN 2009ip.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct-detection searches for dark matter are insensitive to dark matter particles that have large interactions with ordinary matter, which are stopped in the atmosphere or the Earth's crust before reaching terrestrial detectors. We use ``dark'' calibration images taken with the HgCdTe detectors in the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to derive novel constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that scatter off electrons. We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to remove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all previously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some parameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as $\sim$0.01%.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams from disrupted globular clusters are dynamically cold structures that are sensitive to perturbations from dark matter subhalos, allowing them in principle to trace the dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. We model, within the context of $\Lambda$CDM, the likelihood of dark matter subhalos to produce a significant feature in a GD-1-like stream and analyze the properties of such subhalos. We generate a large number of realizations of the subhalo population within a Milky Way mass host halo, accounting for tidal stripping and dynamical friction, using the semi-analytic code SatGen. The subhalo distributions are combined with a GD-1-like stream model, and the impact of subhalos that pass close to the stream are modeled with Gala. We find that subhalos with masses in the range $5\times 10^6 M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at the time of the stream-subhalo encounter, corresponding to masses of about $4 \times 10^7 M_{\odot} - 8 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at the time of infall, are the likeliest to produce gaps in a GD-1-like stream. We find that gaps occur on average $\sim$1.8 times per realization of the host system. These gaps have typical widths of $\sim(7 - 27)$ deg and fractional underdensities of $\sim (10 - 30)\%$, with larger gaps being caused by more-massive subhalos. The stream-subhalo encounters responsible for these have impact parameters $(0.1 - 1.5)$ kpc and relative velocities $\sim(170 - 410)$ km/s. For a larger host-halo mass, the number of subhalos increases, as do their typical velocities, inducing a corresponding increase in the number of significant stream-subhalo encounters.

          Anisotropic tidal dissipation in misaligned planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Tides are the main driving force behind the long-term evolution of planetary systems. The associated energy dissipation and momentum exchanges are commonly described by Love numbers, which relate the exciting potential to the tidally perturbed potential. These transfer functions are generally assumed to depend solely on tidal frequency and body rheology, following the isotropic assumption, which presumes invariance of properties by rotation about the centre of mass. We examine the limitations of the isotropic assumption for fluid bodies, where Coriolis acceleration breaks spherical symmetry, resulting in rotational scattering and complex tidal responses. Using angular momentum theory, we derive a new formalism to calculate the tidal rates of energy and momentum transfers in non-isotropic cases. We apply this formalism to the Earth-Moon system to assess the effects of anisotropy in planet-satellite systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta. Our findings indicate that the isotropic assumption can introduce significant errors in planetary evolution models, particularly in the dynamical tide regime. These errors stem from forced wave resonances, with inaccuracies in energy dissipation scaling in proportion to resonance amplification factors.

 - **Abstract**
 The dipole anisotropy induced by our peculiar motion in the sky distribution of cosmologically distant sources is an important consistency test of the standard FLRW cosmology. In this work, we formalize how to compute the kinematic matter dipole in redshift bins. Apart from the usual terms arising from angular aberration and flux boosting, there is a contribution from the boosting of the redshifts that becomes important when considering a sample selected on observed redshift, leading to non-vanishing correction terms. We discuss examples and provide expressions to incorporate arbitrary redshift selection functions. We also discuss the effect of redshift measurement uncertainties in this context, in particular in upcoming surveys for which we provide estimates of the correction terms. Depending on the shape of a sample's redshift distribution and on the applied redshift cuts, the correction terms can become substantial, even to the degree that the direction of the dipole is reversed. Lastly, we discuss how cuts on variables correlated with observed redshift, such as color, can induce additional correction terms.

 - **Abstract**
 Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not fully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the progenitors is needed. $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova exploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\mathrm{NGC\,2146}$, which is also the host galaxy of $\mathrm{SN\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we have found a red source ($\mathrm{m_{F814W} \sim 25}$) near the location (angular distance $\leq 0.2"$) of $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ before its explosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of this source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by interstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of $\mathrm{10M_{\odot}}$--$\mathrm{16\,M_{\odot}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations of binary stars in globular clusters are essential to shed light on the poorly constrained period, eccentricity, and mass ratio distributions and to develop an understanding of the formation of peculiar stellar objects. 47 Tuc (NGC 104) is one of the most massive Galactic globular clusters, with a large population of blue stragglers and with many predicted but as-yet elusive stellar-mass black holes. This makes it an exciting candidate for binary searches. We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 47 Tuc with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph to determine radial velocity variations for 21,699 stars. We find a total binary fraction in the cluster of $(2.4\pm1.0)\%$, consistent with previous photometric estimates, and an increased binary fraction among blue straggler stars, approximately three times higher than the cluster average. We find very few binaries with periods below three days, and none with massive dark companions. A comparison with predictions from state-of-the-art models shows that the absence of such short-period binaries and of binaries with massive companions is surprising, highlighting the need to improve our understanding of stellar and dynamical evolution in binary systems.
