#### Title:
          Is your stochastic signal really detectable?

 - **Abstract**
 Separating a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from noise is a challenging statistical task. One approach to establishing a detection criterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes factor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold, the signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the averaged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties. As an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and generate the corresponding \textit{bayesian sensitivity curve}. Unlike existing methods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the signal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative. This flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational wave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.

          Observational constraints on freezing quintessence in a non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the freezing quintessence scenario in late-time cosmic expansion using a non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity model, $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We consider a solution for this model using an appropriate parametrization of the scale factor, and then the model is constrained by observational datasets, including CC, Pantheon+ (SN), and CC+SN+BAO. Our analysis yields results aligning closely with observational data. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, matter-energy density, and EoS parameter of our model exhibit expected trends over cosmic time, supporting its physical validity. Furthermore, the model demonstrates consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM model in late times, displaying freezing behavior in the $\omega - \omega'$ plane and stability against density perturbations. Our findings suggest that the modified $f(R, L_m)$ gravity model is a credible approach to describing the universe's accelerating phase.

          Uncertainty estimation for time series classification: Exploring predictive uncertainty in transformer-based models for variable stars

 - **Abstract**
 Classifying variable stars is key for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. With the demands of large astronomical surveys, machine learning models, especially attention-based neural networks, have become the state-of-the-art. While achieving high accuracy is crucial, enhancing model interpretability and uncertainty estimation is equally important to ensure that insights are both reliable and comprehensible. We aim to enhance transformer-based models for classifying astronomical light curves by incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques to detect misclassified instances. We tested our methods on labeled datasets from MACHO, OGLE-III, and ATLAS, introducing a framework that significantly improves the reliability of automated classification for the next-generation surveys. We used Astromer, a transformer-based encoder designed for capturing representations of single-band light curves. We enhanced its capabilities by applying three methods for quantifying uncertainty: Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), Hierarchical Stochastic Attention (HSA), and a novel hybrid method combining both approaches, which we have named Hierarchical Attention with Monte Carlo Dropout (HA-MC Dropout). We compared these methods against a baseline of deep ensembles (DEs). To estimate uncertainty estimation scores for the misclassification task, we selected Sampled Maximum Probability (SMP), Probability Variance (PV), and Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) as uncertainty estimates. In predictive performance tests, HA-MC Dropout outperforms the baseline, achieving macro F1-scores of 79.8+-0.5 on OGLE, 84+-1.3 on ATLAS, and 76.6+-1.8 on MACHO. When comparing the PV score values, the quality of uncertainty estimation by HA-MC Dropout surpasses that of all other methods, with improvements of 2.5+-2.3 for MACHO, 3.3+-2.1 for ATLAS and 8.5+-1.6 for OGLE-III.

          Conformal Prediction for Astronomy Data with Measurement Error

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers often deal with data where the covariates and the dependent variable are measured with heteroscedastic non-Gaussian error. For instance, while TESS and Kepler datasets provide a wealth of information, addressing the challenges of measurement errors and systematic biases is critical for extracting reliable scientific insights and improving machine learning models' performance. Although techniques have been developed for estimating regression parameters for these data, few techniques exist to construct prediction intervals with finite sample coverage guarantees. To address this issue, we tailor the conformal prediction approach to our application. We empirically demonstrate that this method gives finite sample control over Type I error probabilities under a variety of assumptions on the measurement errors in the observed data. Further, we demonstrate how the conformal prediction method could be used for constructing prediction intervals for unobserved exoplanet masses using established broken power-law relationships between masses and radii found in the literature.

          B2 1308+326: a changing-look blazar or not?

 - **Abstract**
 In our previous study, we identified a shift in the synchrotron peak frequency of the blazar B2 1308$+$326 from 10$^{12.9}$ Hz to 10$^{14.8}$ Hz during a flare, suggesting it could be a changing-look blazar (CLB). In this work, we investigate the CL behaviour of B2 1308+326 by analysing a newly acquired optical spectrum and comparing it with an archival spectrum. We find that between the two epochs, the continuum flux increased by a factor of $\sim$4.4, while the Mg II emission line flux decreased by a factor of 1.4$\pm$0.2. Additionally, the equivalent width of the Mg II line reduced from $\sim 20$ Å\ to $\sim 3$ Å, indicating an apparent shift from a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) class to a BL Lacertae (BL Lac) class. Despite this apparent change, the ratio of accretion disk luminosity to Eddington luminosity remains $>$ 10$^{-2}$ during both epochs, indicating efficient accretion persists in B2 1308$+$326. The measured black hole mass remains consistent with an average $\log M_{\rm BH} = 8.44$ M$_{\odot}$. Our findings suggest that B2 1308$+$326 is not a genuine CLB, but rather an intrinsic FSRQ that emerges as a BL Lac during high-flux states due to enhanced non-thermal emission.

          DeepWiener: Neural Networks for CMB polarization maps and power spectrum computation

 - **Abstract**
 To study the early Universe, it is essential to estimate cosmological parameters with high accuracy, which depends on the optimal reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps and the measurement of their power spectrum. In this paper, we generalize the neural network developed for applying the Wiener Filter, initially presented for temperature maps in previous work, to polarization maps. Our neural network has a UNet architecture, including an extra channel for the noise variance map, to account for inhomogeneous noise, and a channel for the mask. In addition, we propose an iterative approach for reconstructing the E and B-mode fields, while addressing the E-to-B leakage present in the maps due to incomplete sky coverage. The accuracy achieved is satisfactory compared to the Wiener Filter solution computed with the standard Conjugate Gradient method, and it is highly efficient, enabling the computation of the power spectrum of an unknown signal using the optimal quadratic estimator. We further evaluate the quality of the reconstructed maps at the power spectrum level along with their corresponding errors, finding that these errors are smaller than those obtained using the well-known pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach. Our results show that increasing complexity in the applied mask presents a more significant challenge for B-mode reconstruction.

          The central engine of low-luminosity radio galaxy 3C 270

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We present the polarization spectra of the nucleus of 3C 270. We confirm that the polarization angle of both the continuum and the emission lines are close to perpendicular to the jet direction after careful correction of interstellar polarization, which indicates polar scattering. The Stokes flux spectrum resembles the total flux spectrum, with no need for a broad component from the Broad Line Region. Over 94% of the Seyfert I type broad line profile would be significantly detected if present in our polarized flux spectrum. We favor that we are mostly likely observing beamed synchrotron instead of Big Blue Bump, and the innermost Narrow Line Region through reflection. This makes 3C 270 the third known case, after NGC 4258 and Centaurus A, where only narrow lines (and beamed continuum, if present) are scattered, with no evidence of an underlying Big Blue Bump.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for impulsive, astrophysical transients are often highly computationally demanding. A notable example is the dedispersion process required for performing blind searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in radio telescope data. We introduce a novel approach - Efficient Summation of Arbitrary Masks (ESAM) - which efficiently computes 1-D convolution of many arbitrary 2-D masks, and can be used to carry out dedispersion over thousands of dispersion trials efficiently. Our method matches the accuracy of the traditional brute force technique in recovering the desired Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) while reducing computational cost by around a factor of 10. We compare its performance with existing dedispersion algorithms, such as the Fast Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm, and demonstrate how ESAM provides freedom to choose arbitrary masks and further optimise computational cost versus accuracy. We explore the potential applications of ESAM beyond FRB searches.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe some of our group's recent work on common envelopes. Our goal is to understand the onset and outcomes of dynamically unstable mass transfer, including the properties of the binaries left behind and the outflows during the common envelope stage. We have also started thinking about light curves of common envelope events. During a talk at StanFest, a meeting in honour of Stan Owocki's retirement held in Leuven in July, 2024, the first author reported on some of the results we recently obtained and briefly outlined future prospects.

          Dust Scattering Albedo at Millimeter-Wavelengths in the TW Hya Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary bodies are formed by coagulation of solid dust grains in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, it is crucial to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the dust grains. In this study, we measure the dust albedo at mm-wavelength, which depends on dust properties at the disk midplane. Since the albedo and dust temperature are generally degenerate in observed thermal dust emission, it is challenging to determine them simultaneously. We propose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically-thin molecular lines as a dust-albedo independent thermometer. In practice, we employ pressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line. We model the CO $J=2-1$ and $3-2$ spectra observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) at the inner region ($r<6\ {\rm au}$) of the TW Hya disk and successfully derived the midplane temperature. Combining multi-band continuum observations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at $0.9-3$ mm for the first time without assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high, $\sim0.5-0.8$, and broadly consistent with the Ricci et al. (2010), DIANA, and DSHARP dust models. Even without assuming dust composition, we estimate the maximum grain size to be $\sim 340\ \mu m$, the power law index of the grain size distribution to be $>-4.1$, and porosity to be $<0.96$. The derived dust size may suggest efficient fragmentation with the threshold velocity of $\sim 0.08\ {\rm m\ s^{-1}}$. We also note that the absolute flux uncertainty of $\sim10\%$ ($1\sigma$) is measured and used in the analysis, which is approximately twice the usually assumed value.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume, that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be, unstable and quantify the decay using the life-time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small this http URL find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA-I Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.1\%$ and $4.64\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.01 $ and $\Gamma = 0.074 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to its peculiar and highly variable nature, the blazar 3C 454.3 has been extensively monitored by the WEBT team. Here, we present for the first time these long-term optical flux and color variability results using data acquired in B, V, R, and I bands over a time span of $\sim$ 2 decades. We include data from WEBT collaborators and public archives such as SMARTS, Steward Observatory, and ZTF. The data are binned and segmented to study the source over this long term when more regular sampling was available. During our study, the long-term spectral variability reveals a redder when brighter (RWB) trend, which, however, stabilizes at a particular brightness cutoff $\sim$ 14.5 mag in the I-band, after which it saturates and evolves into a complex state. This trend indicates increasing jet emission dominance over accretion disk emission until jet emission completely dominates. Plots of the spectral index variation (following $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$) reveal a bimodal distribution using a one-day binning. These correlate with two extreme phases of 3C 454.3, an outburst or high flux state and quiescent or low flux state, which are respectively jet and accretion disk dominated. We have also conducted intra-day variability studies of nine light curves and found that six of them are variable. Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) analysis between different optical waveband pairs peak at zero lags, indicating co-spatial emission in different optical bands.

          OB associations: from stellar to galactic scales

 - **Abstract**
 Low-density and unbound stellar groups, OB associations have been historically delineated through their bright and massive members. They have been analysed for decades, but the arrival of Hipparcos, and more recently of Gaia led to a change of paradigm by allowing the identification of more reliable members using parallaxes and proper motions. This renewed interest offers an opportunity to emphasize the role of OB associations across many areas of astronomy. In this review, I highlight their importance across multiple scales: how OB associations constitute suitable sites to study massive stars and stellar multiplicity, their relation with star clusters, their interactions with the interstellar medium through the feedback of their massive members, and how they shape the structure and evolution of the Milky Way and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine lengthy radio light curves of the flat spectrum radio galaxy 3C 454.3 for possible quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The data used in this work were collected at five radio frequencies, 4.8, 8.0, 14.5, 22.0, and 37.0 GHz between 1979--2013 as observed at the University of Michigan Radio Astronomical Observatory, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and Aalto University Mets{ä}hovi Radio Observatory. We employ generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet transform analyses to search for periodicities in these light curves. We confirm a QPO period of $\sim$ 2000 day to be at least 4$\sigma$ significant using both methods at all five radio frequencies between 1979 and 2007, after which a strong flare changed the character of the light curve. We also find a $\sim$~600 day period which is at least 4$\sigma$ significant, but only in the 22.0 and 37.0 GHz light curves. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms capable of producing such variations.

          The symbiotic star V694 Mon has transitioned from the accreting-only state to the steady burning phase

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the drastic photometric and spectroscopic changes affecting the symbiotic star V694 Mon since 2018, are due to its transition from the accreting-only state to steady hydrogen-burning on the surface of the white dwarf, closely mimicking the pattern followed by V4368 Sgr. The phase of peak optical brightness and weakest emission lines has probably been reached in early 2024. The high-velocity absorptions powered by jet-ejection and the wild flickering, which dominated the century-long quiescence, should not reappear as long has nuclear burning will hold (time-scale of decades). The 3500 Lsun burning luminosity suggests a mass of 0.60 Msun for the WD.

          Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.

          Planet formation theory: an overview

 - **Abstract**
 The standard model for planet formation is a bottom-up process in which the origin of rocky and gaseous planets can be traced back to the collision of micron-sized dust grains within the gas-rich environment of protoplanetary disks. Key milestones along the way include disk formation, grain growth, planetesimal formation, core growth, gas accretion, and planetary system evolution. I provide an introductory overview of planet formation, emphasizing the main ideas and reviewing current theoretical understanding. Many of the phases of planet formation have a well-developed physical understanding, though the complexity of the problem means that few can be quantitatively modeled with complete confidence. Transformative advances in disk imaging and exoplanet detection provide the first direct information on the initial conditions for planet formation, and have motivated new formation models that are faster, more efficient, and lead to a more diverse set of architectures than their Solar System inspired forebears. Much remains to be learned, and I close with a personal, incomplete list, of open problems.

 - **Abstract**
 IGR J17591--2342, a transient accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar, was discovered during its 2018 outburst. Here, we present a timing and spectral analysis of the source using {\it AstroSat} data of the same outburst. From the timing analysis, we obtain updated values of binary orbital parameters, which reveal an average pulsar spin frequency of 527.4256984(8) Hz. The pulse profiles can be fit well with four harmonically related sinusoidal components with fractional amplitudes of fundamental and second, third, and fourth harmonics as $\sim13$\%, $\sim$6\%, $\sim$0.9\%, $\sim$0.2\%, respectively. The energy-dependent study of pulse profiles in the range of $3-20$ keV shows that the fractional amplitude of both the fundamental and first overtone is consistent with being constant across the considered energy band. Besides, a decaying trend has been observed for both the fundamental and first overtone in the phase-delay versus energy relation resulting in soft X-ray (2.8-3.3 keV) phase lags of $\sim$0.05 and $\sim$0.13 with respect to $\leq 15$ keV photons, for the fundamental and first overtone, respectively. The combined spectra from the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters and the Soft X-ray Telescope aboard {\it AstroSat} in the $1-18$ keV range can be fit well with an absorbed model consisting of a Comptonization, a blackbody and a Gaussian emission line component yielding as best-fit parameters a blackbody seed photon temperature $kT_{\rm bb}$ $\sim 0.95 \pm 0.03$ keV, and an electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ $\sim 1.54 \pm0.03$ keV. The spectral aspects suggest the scattering of photons from the accretion disc or the neutron star's surface.

 We continue to present the results of a Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). In this work we present the results of the search and further detailed investigation of the objects, found in the course of the BNBIS survey in the southern part of the Mon R2 association. For the search of HH objects the narrow band images, obtained with the 1-m Schmidt telescope of the Byurakan Observatory, were used. Newly found objects were imaged in optical and near-IR range with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 meter telescope, and observed spectrally with long-slit spectrograph and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer on 6 m telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences using SCORPIO-2. We found three new HH groups: HH 1233, HH 1234 and HH 1235, two of them represent extended collimated flows. HH 1233 is the C-shape bipolar outflow system associated with the 2MASS 06084223$-$0657385 source star. HH 1234 is the helical chain of HH knots near the star V963 Mon. HH 1235 is a separate compact knot, connected with the visible only in mid- and far-IR source WISE J060856.57$-$070103.5. We found also several molecular hydrogen outflows, one of which coincides with HH 1233 and two other are associated with the deeply embedded IR sources in the same field. One more probable bipolar H$_2$ outflow is related to WISE J060856.57$-$070103.5. The emission spectra and spectral energy distributions of the source stars were analyzed. According to them they should be under rather early evolutional stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters host large populations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) due to their high gravitational encounter rates, producing many binary systems and thus MSPs via the recycling process. Seven pulsars with spin periods ranging from 3 ms to 134 ms have been discovered in Terzan 1, which was targeted for pulsar searches with the Green Bank Telescope after Australia Telescope Compact Array imaging revealed steep-spectrum point sources in the cluster core. We have obtained timing observations over seven years, for the first seven Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discoveries (Terzan 1 A through G), using the GBT and Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. All seven pulsars are isolated, consistent with Terzan 1's classification as a core-collapsed cluster (core collapse is predicted to disrupt, or ionize, binaries). With these timing solutions, we measured the positions and observed period derivatives, dP/dt, for each pulsar. The measured dP/dt values are composed of intrinsic spin-down and accelerations experienced by the pulsars (primarily from the cluster's gravitational potential), and they can be used to infer line-of-sight accelerations. We attempted to constrain the radius and density of the cluster core using these inferred accelerations. A wide range of radii and densities are possible, pointing to the need for continued timing as well as new discoveries to better constrain these cluster properties. We additionally find that Ter 1 A may be younger than the cluster and thus may have formed via a formation channel other than a core-collapse supernova. Theoretical formation mechanisms such as electron-capture supernovae from accretion- or merger-induced collapse of white dwarfs could potentially explain these pulsars' origins. It may therefore be a member of a small but growing class of globular cluster pulsars that appear to be significantly younger than their host clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first $\textit{NuSTAR}$ X-ray observation of EF Eri, a well-known polar system. The $\textit{NuSTAR}$ observation was conducted in conjunction with $\textit{NICER}$, shortly after EF Eri entered a high accretion state following an unprecedented period of low activity lasting 26 years since 1997. $\textit{NuSTAR}$ detected hard X-ray emission up to 50 keV with an X-ray flux of $1.2\times10^{-10}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\rm{-}50 keV$). Folded X-ray lightcurves exhibit a single peak with $\sim65\%$ spin modulation throughout the $3\rm{-}50$ keV band. We found no evidence of QPO signals at $\nu = 0.1\rm{-}100$ Hz with an upper limit on the QPO amplitude below $5\%$ ($90\%$ CL) at $\nu \sim 0.5$ Hz where the optical QPO was previously detected. Our 1-D accretion column model, called ${\tt MCVSPEC}$, was fitted to the $\textit{NuSTAR}$ spectral data, yielding an accurate WD mass measurement of $M = (0.55\rm{-}0.58) M_\odot$. $\texttt{MCVSPEC}$ accounts for radiative cooling by thermal bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission, X-ray reflection off the WD surface, and a previously constrained range of the accretion column area. The derived WD mass range is in excellent agreement with the previous measurement of $M = (0.55\rm{-}0.60) M_\odot$ in the optical band. This demonstrates a combination of broadband X-ray spectral analysis and the ${\tt MCVSPEC}$ model that can be employed in our ongoing $\textit{NuSTAR}$ observation campaign of other polars to determine their WD masses accurately.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity contamination of radial velocity (RV) data is one of the top challenges plaguing the field of extreme precision RV (EPRV) science. Previous work has shown that photometry can be very effective at removing such signals from RV data, especially stellar activity caused by rotating star spots and this http URL exact utility of photometry for removing RV activity contamination, and the best way to apply it, is not well known. We present a combination photometric and RV study of eight Kepler/K2 FGK stars with known stellar variability. We use NEID RVs acquired simultaneously with TESS photometry, and we perform injection recovery tests to quantify the efficacy of recent TESS photometry versus archival Kepler/K2 photometry for removing stellar variability from RVs. We additionally experiment with different TESS sectors when training our models in order to quantify the real benefit of simultaneously acquired RVs and photometry. We conclude that Kepler photometry typically performs better than TESS at removing noise from RV data when it is available, likely due to longer baseline and precision. In contrast, for targets with available K2 photometry, especially those most active, and with high precision ($\sigma_{NEID}$ $<$ 1 m s$^{-1}$) NEID RVs, TESS may be the more informative dataset. However, contrary to expectations, we have found that training on simultaneous photometry does not always achieve the best results.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting a pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (SNR) and/or pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is crucial for unraveling its formation history and pulsar wind dynamics, yet the association with a radio pulsar is observed only in a small fraction of known SNRs and PWNe. In this paper, we report the discovery of a young pulsar J1631$-$4722, associated with the Galactic SNR G336.7$+$0.5 using Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. It is also potentially associated with a PWN revealed by the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This 118 ms pulsar has a high dispersion measure of 873 $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ and a rotation measure of $-$1004 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$. Because of such a high DM, at frequencies below 2 GHz, the pulse profile is significantly scattered, making it effectively undetectable in previous pulsar surveys at $\sim$1.4 GHz. Follow-up observations yield a period derivative of $\dot{P} = 3.6 \times 10^{-15}$, implying a characteristic age, $\tau_{c} = 33\,$kyr, and spin-down luminosity, $\dot{E} = 1.3\times10^{36}\,$erg$\,s^{-1}$. PSR$\,$J1631$-$4722, with its high spin-down luminosity and potential link to a PWN, stands out as a promising source of the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission observed in the region.

 - **Abstract**
 The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) and cosmic HI density ($\Omega_{\rm HI}$) at $0 \leq z \leq 0.088$ from the Looking at the Distant Universe with MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey. Using LADUMA Data Release 1 (DR1), we analyze the HIMF via a new "recovery matrix" (RM) method that we benchmark against a more traditional Modified Maximum Likelihood (MML) method. Our analysis, which implements a forward modeling approach, corrects for survey incompleteness and uses extensive synthetic source injections to ensure robust estimates of the HIMF parameters and their associated uncertainties. This new method tracks the recovery of sources in mass bins different from those in which they were injected and incorporates a Poisson likelihood in the forward modeling process, allowing it to correctly handle uncertainties in bins with few or no detections. The application of our analysis to a high-purity subsample of the LADUMA DR1 spectral line catalog in turn mitigates any possible biases that could result from the inconsistent treatment of synthetic and real sources. For the surveyed redshift range, the recovered Schechter function normalization, low-mass slope, and "knee" mass are $\phi_\ast = 3.56_{-1.92}^{+0.97} \times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ dex$^{-1}$, $\alpha = -1.18_{-0.19}^{+0.08}$, and $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) = 10.01_{-0.12}^{+0.31}$, respectively, which together imply a comoving cosmic HI density of $\Omega_{\rm HI}=3.09_{-0.47}^{+0.65}\times 10^{-4}$. Our results show consistency between RM and MML methods and with previous low-redshift studies, giving confidence that the cosmic volume probed by LADUMA, even at low redshifts, is not an outlier in terms of its HI content.

 - **Abstract**
 Event-based sensors detect only changes in brightness across a scene, each pixel producing an asynchronous stream of spatial-temporal data, rather than recording frames of overall illumination like a traditional frame-based sensor. This is advantageous for implementing into a wavefront sensor, which benefits from high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. The determination of tip-tilt in particular is still a problem in laser guide star adaptive optics as there is no current technological capabilities to measure it. This study characterised the behaviour of an event-based sensor in the context of tip-tilt sensing,investigating if the high temporal resolution of the event streams could address these challenges. Different conditions of tip-tilt and background illumination levels are explored and found to be a strong contender for tip-tilt sensing with laser guide stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength (near-infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray) observations of the Galactic X-ray black hole binary MAXI J1820+070 performed in 2019 May 10-13, $\sim 60$ days after the onset of the first rebrightening phase. It showed a much larger optical-to-X-ray luminosity ratio ($\sim 8$) than in the initial outburst epoch. The primary components of the spectral energy distribution (SED) can be best interpreted by radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) spectrum showing a luminosity peak in the optical band. By comparison with theoretical calculations, we estimate the mass accretion rate to be $\dot{M}/(8 L_{\rm Edd}/c^2) \sim 10^{-3}$, where $c$ is the light speed and $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. In addition to the RIAF emission, a blue power-law component is detected in the optical-UV SED, which is most likely synchrotron radiation from the jet. The optical spectrum taken at the Seimei telescope shows a weak and narrow H$\alpha$ emission line, whose emitting region is constrained to be $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^{4}$ times the gravitational radius. We suggest that the entire disk structure cannot be described by a single RIAF solution but cooler material responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission must exist at the outermost region.

 - **Abstract**
 Secondary cosmic ray fluxes are important probes of the propagation and interaction of high-energy particles in the Galaxy. Recent measurements of primary and secondary cosmic ray nuclei have revealed unexpected spectral features that demand a deeper understanding. In this work we report the direct measurement of the cosmic ray boron spectrum from 10 TeV/n to 8 TeV/n with eight years of data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) mission. The measured spectrum shows an evident hardening at $182\pm24$ GeV/n with a spectral power index of $\gamma_1 = 3.02 \pm 0.01$ before the break and an index change of $\Delta \gamma = 0.31 \pm 0.05$ after the break. A simple power law model is disfavored at a confidence level of 8$\sigma$. Compared with the hardenings measured in the DAMPE proton and helium spectra, the secondary boron spectrum hardens roughly twice as much as these primaries, which is consistent with a propagation related mechanism to interpret the spectral hardenings of cosmic rays observed at hundreds of GeV/n.

 - **Abstract**
 The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectrocopy Imager (RHESSI) $\gamma$-ray observations of the extraordinary GOES X25 flare SOL2003-10-28T11:10 are revisited to investigate previously reported conclusions that flare-accelerated electrons and protons precipitate along spatially separated flare loops. In contrast to previous works which reconstructed 2.223 MeV images over extended time periods ($\sim$20 minutes), we selected shorter integration times of the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Using simulations of the 2.223 MeV profile by Murphy et al. (2003) in combination with observations of the prompt $\gamma$-ray lines from the INTEGRAL mission, we obtain two separated integration time ranges representing the peak of the flare and the start of the decay, respectively. The resulting $\gamma$-ray images are then compared to GONG white-light (WL) observations to identify where along the flaring ribbons electrons and protons precipitation occurs. We point out that previously reported results comparing RHESSI hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray images only hold if the relative time evolution in the two energy ranges is the same. As the decay times for the 28 October 2003 is different at the considered two energy ranges (200-300 keV and around 2.223 MeV), the previously published conclusion that electrons and protons precipitate at different locations is an overstatement. Using shorter integration times reveals that the $\gamma$-ray and HXR sources spatially coincide with the WL flare ribbons. Our key conclusion is that electron and proton precipitation sites coincide with the flare ribbons, suggesting that the electron and proton precipitation sites are the same, at least within RHESSI's imaging capabilities. This result solves the twenty-years-long mystery around the previously reported different electron and proton precipitation sites.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display complex features, including plateaus and flares, that challenge theoretical models. Here, we study the properties of flares that are observed in the early afterglow phase (up to a few thousand of seconds). We split the sample into two groups: bursts with and without X-ray plateau. We find that the distributions of flare properties are similar in each group. Specifically, the peak time ($t_{\rm pk}$) of the flares and the ratio of the flare width to the flare peak time ($w/t_{\rm pk}$) which is found to be $\approx 1$, regardless of the presence of a plateau. We discuss these results in view of the different theoretical models aimed at explaining the origin of the plateau. These results are difficult to explain by viewing angle effects or late-time energy injection, but do not contradict the idea that GRBs with X-ray plateau have low Lorentz factor, of the order of tens. For these GRBs, the dissipation processes that produce the flares naturally occur at smaller radii compared to GRBs with higher Lorentz factors, while the flares maintain a similar behaviour. Our results therefore provide an independent support for the idea that many GRBs have a Lorentz factor of a few tens rather than a few hundreds.

 Context. The Stardust flyby mission to Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 81P/Wild 2 (hereafter, 81P) captured its dense quasicircular depressions. Nevertheless, the formation mechanism remains a subject of ongoing debate. Aims. We aimed to study how cometary activity contributed to the formation and enlargement of these depressions by analyzing Stardust flyby images and ground-based observation data. Methods. We calculated the time-dependent water production rate of 81P inside the snow line (<3 au) and compared it with the observational data. In addition, we estimated the fallback debris mass using an observation-based model, where a dust ejection from 81P was considered to reproduce ground-based observations of the dust tail. We compared the total excavated volume of water and dust with the total depression volume derived using the 81P shape model. Results. We find that the total excavated volume after 81P was injected into the inner Solar System accounts for up to only 30 % of the depression volume. This insufficiency suggests that a large portion (>70 %) of the depressions had already existed before the comet was injected into the current orbit. In addition, we estimate the dust-to-ice mass ratio for 81P to be 2-14. Conclusions. We suggest that most depressions were formed in the source region of the Kuiper-belt objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Spider pulsars constitute a distinct subset within the domain of radio millisecond pulsars, divided further into the categories of black widows and redbacks. Evident across multiple wavelengths, these pulsars manifest periodic variations and reside within binary systems. Investigating and discovering additional spider-type pulsars carries significant implications for comprehending the evolution of high-mass stars. Particularly crucial is the validation of the "Recycling" theory of millisecond pulsar genesis. In this investigation, we systematically explore spider pulsar binary systems utilizing time-domain variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, in conjunction with Fermi unassociated gamma-ray sources sourced from the 4FGL-DR3 catalog. We have implemented a time-domain data processing pipeline utilizing the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram algorithm, integrated with the wget data crawling technology. This approach has led to the identification of 194 ellipsoidal variables and irradiation-type binary stars. Subsequent refinement through the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram has culled a selection of 24 spider pulsar gold sample candidates. By incorporating the 4FGL 95\% confidence error ellipse, the pool was narrowed down to 19 gold sample candidates. Utilizing the Gaia color-reduced proper motion diagram further refined the selection to 9 gold sample candidates. These newly identified spider pulsar candidates will inform subsequent observational campaigns across radio, X-ray, and optical spectroscopy, thereby facilitating a deeper validation of their physical characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 The first JWST/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15 $\mu m$, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15 $\mu m$ were acquired as part of GTO time that included a twin program at 12.8 $\mu m$ in order to have a measurement in and outside the CO$_2$ absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 $\mu m$. We perform a global fit of the 10 eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1-$\sigma$ error of 452 $\pm$ 86 ppm and 775 $\pm$ 90 ppm at 12.8 $\mu m$ and 15 $\mu m$, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes fits well the data. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2 atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2 feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet's atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.

 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the Aditya-L1 mission is designed to observe the Sun across 200-400 nm wavelength. The telescope used 16 dichroic filters tuned at specific wavelengths in various combinations to achieve its science goals. For accurate measurements and interpretation, it is important to characterize these filters for spectral variations as a function of spatial location and tilt angle. Moreover, we also measured out-of-band and in-band transmission characteristics with respect to the inband transmissions. In this paper, we present the experimental setup, test methodology, and the analyzed results. Our findings reveal that the transmission properties of all filters meet the expected performance for spatial variation of transmission and the transmission band at a specific tilt angle. The out-of-band transmission for all filters is below 1% with respect to in-band, except for filters BB01 and NB01. These results confirm the capabilities of SUIT to effectively capture critical solar features in the anticipated layer of the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Subdwarf B stars are a well-known class of hot, low-mass stars thought to be formed through interactions in stellar binary systems. While different formation channels for subdwarf B stars have been studied through a binary population synthesis approach, it has also become evident that the characteristics of the found populations depend on the initial set of assumptions that describe the sometimes poorly constrained physical processes, such as common envelope episodes or angular momentum loss during mass transfer events. In this work we present a parameter study of subdwarf B populations, including a novel analytic prescription that approximates the evolution of subdwarf B stars with hydrogen-rich outer shells, an element previously overlooked in rapid binary population synthesis. We find that all studied parameters strongly impact the properties of the population, with the possibility of igniting helium below the expected core-mass value near the tip of the red giant branch strongly affecting the total number of subdwarf B candidates. Critically, our newly proposed prescription for the evolution of subdwarf B stars with hydrogen-shells helps to reconcile theoretical predictions of surface gravity and effective temperature with observational results. Our prescription is useful in the context of rapid binary population synthesis studies and can be applied to other rapid binary population synthesis codes' output.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the properties of 26 PNe with PG1159-type central stars known till date and compare them with the properties of PNe having [WR], $wels$ and hydrogen-rich central stars published earlier. We use archival photometric measurements of $2MASS$ for near-IR analysis and $WISE$ and $IRAS$ data for mid- and far-IR analysis and derive the IR properties of PG1159-PNe. We analyze the IR colour-colour diagrams of PG1159-PNe and compare them with the other three groups of PNe. Similar to the [WR]-PNe, many PG1159-PNe also show large amount of near-IR emission from the hot-dust component but their AGB dust is relatively cooler. We also report here the dust colour temperatures, dust masses, dust-to-gas mass ratios, IR luminosities and IR excess of PG1159-PNe and plot them against their surface H$\beta$ brightness (age) and compare them with the distribution of other groups of PNe. The IR luminosity and dust temperature show strong correlation with surface H$\beta$ brightness, however, the dust-to-gas mass ratio and IR excess do not show any trend. While the mean dust mass has a lower value for PG1159-PNe, in compared to other groups, the average dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be marginally larger for PG1159-PNe. An analysis of the number distribution of different groups of PNe against surface H$\beta$ brightness shows that a) younger [WR]-, $wels$- and normal-PNe have a similar distribution indicating that they all have evolved from the AGB in a similar way, b) while there is an overlap of surface H$\beta$ brightness between [WR]- and PG1159-PNe, showing an evolutionary connection between them, there exists a significant gap between the values derived for $wels$- and PG1159-PNe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\sim8-40\,\mu$m SOFIA-FORCAST images of seven regions of ``clustered" star formation as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. We identify a total of 34 protostar candidates and build their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We fit these SEDs with a grid of radiative transfer models based on the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory to derive key protostellar properties, including initial core mass, $M_c$, clump environment mass surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and current protostellar mass, $m_*$. We also carry out empirical graybody (GB) estimation of $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, which allows a case of restricted SED fitting within the TCA model grid. We also release version 2.0 of the open-source Python package \emph{sedcreator}, designed to automate the aperture photometry and SED building and fitting process for sources in clustered environments, where flux contamination from close neighbors typically complicates the process. Using these updated methods, SED fitting yields values of $M_c\sim30-200\:M_{\odot}$, $\Sigma_{\text{cl,SED}}\sim0.1-3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$, and $m_*\sim4-50\:M_{\odot}$. The graybody fitting yields smaller values of $\Sigma_{\text{cl,GB}}\lesssim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$. From these results, we do not find evidence for a critical $\Sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ needed to form massive ($\gtrsim 8\:M_\odot$) stars. However, we do find tentative evidence for a dearth of the most massive ($m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$) protostars in the clustered regions suggesting a potential impact of environment on the stellar initial mass function.

          ALMA detections of circumstellar disks in the giant Hii region M17. Probing the intermediate- to high-mass pre-main-sequence population

 - **Abstract**
 Our current understanding is that intermediate- to high-mass stars form in a way similar to low-mass stars, that is, through disk accretion. However, the physical conditions that play a role in disk formation, evolution, and the possibility of (sub)stellar companion formation, are significantly different. We search for the mm counterparts of four intermediate- to high-mass (4-10 Solar mass) young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant Hii region M17 at a distance of 1.7 kpc. These objects expose their photospheric spectrum such that their location on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) is well established. They have a circumstellar disk that is likely remnant of the formation process. With ALMA we have detected, for the first time, these four YSOs in M17, in Band 6 and 7, as well as four other serendipitous objects. Besides the flux measurements, the source size and spectral index provide important constraints on the physical mechanism(s) producing the observed emission. We apply different models to estimate the dust and gas mass contained in the disks. All our detections are spatially unresolved, constraining the source size to <120 au, and have a spectral index in the range 0.5-2.7. The derived (upper limits on the) disk dust masses are on the order of a few Earth masses and estimations of the upper limits on the gas mass vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$ Solar mass. In two objects (B331 and B268) free-free emission indicates the presence of ionized material around the star. The four serendipitous detections are likely (low-mass) YSOs. We compare the derived disk masses of our M17 targets to those obtained for YSOs in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) and Herbig stars, as a function of stellar mass, age, luminosity, and outer disk radius. The M17 sample, though small, is both the most massive and the youngest sample, yet has the lowest mean disk mass.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to test a potential application of lognormal seminumerical simulations to recover the thermal parameters and Jeans length. This could be suitable for generating large number of synthetic spectra with various input data and parameters, and thus ideal for interpreting the high-quality data obtained from QSO absorption spectra surveys. We use a seminumerical approach to simulate absorption spectra of quasars at redshifts $ 3 \leq z \leq 5$. These synthetic spectra are compared with the 1D flux power spectra and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis method we determine the temperature at mean density, slope of the temperature-density relation and Jeans length. Our best-fit model is also compared with the evolution of the temperature of the intergalactic medium from various UVB models. We show that the lognormal simulations can effectively recover thermal parameters and Jeans length. Besides, by comparing the synthetic flux power spectra with observations from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey we found, that such an approach can be also used for the cosmological parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary target of the \Euclid space mission is to constrain early-universe physics by searching for deviations from a primordial Gaussian random field. A significant detection of primordial non-Gaussianity would rule out the simplest models of cosmic inflation and transform our understanding of the origin of the Universe. This paper forecasts how well field-level inference of galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$), within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, in the upcoming \Euclid data. We design and simulate mock data sets and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses using a full-field forward modelling approach. By including the formation history of the cosmic matter field in the analysis, the method takes into account all available probes of primordial non-Gaussianity, and goes beyond statistical summary estimators of $f_{NL}$. Probes include, for example, two-point and higher-order statistics, peculiar velocity fields, and scale-dependent galaxy biases. Furthermore, the method simultaneously handles systematic survey effects, such as selection effects, survey geometries, and galaxy biases. The forecast shows that the method can reach precision levels of up to $\sigma (f_{NL}) = 2.3$ (68.3\% CI, and at the grid resolution $\Delta L = 62.5\,h^{-1}$Mpc) with \Euclid data. We also provide data products, including realistic $N$-body simulations with nonzero values of $f_{NL}$ and maps of adiabatic curvature fluctuations. The results underscore the feasibility and advantages of field-level inference to constrain $f_{NL}$ in galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach consistently captures all the information available in the large-scale structure to constrain $f_{NL}$, and resolves the degeneracy between early-universe physics and late-time gravitational effects, while mitigating the impact of systematic and observational effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the highest energy messenger from space, with energies exceeding 1 EeV. Although UHECRs were discovered over 60 years ago, their origin still remains a mystery. Pinpointing sources of UHECRs is crucial for understanding the extreme astrophysical processes that accelerate particles to such extraordinary energies. We searched for UHECR multiplets via analyzing 17 years of data with energies greater than 40 EeV from the Pierre Auger Observatory. A spatial association is found between a multiplet of $25.7^{+6.2}_{-7.0}$ cosmic rays and the Sombrero galaxy with a local (global) significance of $4.5~\sigma~(3.3~\sigma)$. The Sombrero galaxy hosts a supermassive central black hole with a mass of $\sim1\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and exhibits large-scale radio lobes and jets. Our finding provides critical evidence on active supermassive black holes as the source of the highest-energy cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric energy transport is central to the cooling of primordial magma oceans. Theoretical studies of atmospheres on lava planets have assumed that convection is the only process involved in setting the atmospheric temperature structure. This significantly influences the ability for a magma ocean to cool. It has been suggested that convective stability in these atmospheres could preclude permanent magma oceans. We develop a new 1D radiative-convective model in order to investigate when the atmospheres overlying magma oceans are convectively stable. Using a coupled interior-atmosphere framework, we simulate the early evolution of two terrestrial-mass exoplanets: TRAPPIST-1 c and HD 63433 d. Our simulations suggest that the atmosphere of HD 63433 d exhibits deep isothermal layers which are convectively stable. However, it is able to maintain a permanent magma ocean and an atmosphere depleted in H2O. It is possible to maintain permanent magma oceans underneath atmospheres without convection. Absorption features of CO2 and SO2 within synthetic emission spectra are associated with mantle redox state, meaning that future observations of HD 63433 d may provide constraints on the geochemical properties of a magma ocean analogous with the early Earth. Simulations of TRAPPIST-1 c indicate that it is expected to have solidified within 100 Myr, outgassing a thick atmosphere in the process. Cool isothermal stratospheres generated by low molecular-weight atmospheres can mimic the emission of an atmosphere-less body. Future work should consider how atmospheric escape and chemistry modulates the lifetime of magma oceans, and the role of tidal heating in sustaining atmospheric convection

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects of hyperons, delta baryons, and quark matter phase transitions on f-mode oscillations in neutron stars. Using the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with astrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS, reducing maximum masse, while phase transition to the quark matter further softens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. f-mode frequencies, calculated using both the Cowling approximation and the general relativistic (GR) frameworks, reveal a significant overestimation by the Cowling method of about 10-30%, with discrepancies decreasing for more massive stars. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of the f-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability, finding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. Empirical relations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided, highlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling. These findings highlight the potential of gravitational wave asteroseismology to constrain neutron star EoSs and internal structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a class of homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies within the family of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, where the scalar field features an inhomogeneous profile but it preserves a translational symmetry that is realised as a combination of spatial translations and internal shifts. The spatial gradient of the scalar field introduces a preferred direction, so the resulting cosmologies are of the axisymmetric Bianchi I type. The momentum density of these configurations exhibits a universal evolution and an additional component with non-vanishing momentum density is required to have non-trivial effects. We show the relation of these scenarios with cosmologies of non-comoving components and, in particular, we explain how they provide a specific realisation of moving dark energy models. Among the class of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, we analyse in more detail the case of Kinetic Gravity Braiding with emphasis on its application to moving dark energy models and its effects on large scale dark flows as well as the CMB dipole and quadrupole.

 - **Abstract**
 New radio interferometers such as MeerKAT, SKA, ngVLA, and DSA-2000 drive advancements in software for two key reasons. First, handling the vast data from these instruments requires subdivision and multi-node processing. Second, their improved sensitivity, achieved through better engineering and larger data volumes, demands new techniques to fully exploit it. This creates a critical challenge in radio astronomy software: pipelines must be optimized to process data efficiently, but unforeseen artefacts from increased sensitivity require ongoing development of new techniques. This leads to a trade-off among (1) performance, (2) flexibility, and (3) ease-of-development. Rigid designs often miss the full scope of the problem, while temporary research code is unsuitable for production. This work introduces a framework for developing radio astronomy techniques while balancing the above trade-offs. It prioritizes flexibility and ease-of-development alongside acceptable performance by leveraging Open Source data formats and software. To manage growing data volumes, data is distributed across multiple processors and nodes for parallel processing, utilizing HPC and cloud infrastructure. We present two Python libraries, Dask-MS and Codex Africanus, which enable distributed, high-performance radio astronomy software with Dask. Dask is a lightweight parallelization and distribution framework that integrates with the PyData ecosystem, addressing the "Big Data" challenges of radio astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.

 The DarkNESS (Dark Matter Nano-satellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors) mission aims to deploy a skipper-CCD CubeSat Observatory to search for dark matter (DM) from Low Earth Orbit. This mission will employ novel skipper-CCDs to investigate O(keV) X-rays from decaying DM, as well as electron recoils from strongly-interacting sub-GeV DM. The DarkNESS mission will be the first space deployment of skipper-CCDs, and the DarkNESS team is developing a skipper-CCD instrument that is compatible with the CubeSat platform. DarkNESS has recently progressed from laboratory validation to a Critical Design Review (CDR) phase, with a launch opportunity anticipated in late 2025. The implementation of the DarkNESS skipper-CCD payload on the CubeSat platform will pave the way for future demonstrators of space-based imagers for X-ray and single-electron counting applications.
