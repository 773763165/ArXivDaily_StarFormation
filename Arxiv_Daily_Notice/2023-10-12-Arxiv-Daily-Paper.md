 - **Abstract**
 The origin of an anomalous excess of high-energy (about 100 GeV and higher) positrons in cosmic rays is one of the rare problems in this field, which is proposed to be solved with dark matter (DM). Attempts to solve this problem are faced with the issue of having to satisfy the data on cosmic positrons and cosmic gamma radiation, which inevitably accompanies positron production, such as FSR (final state radiation), simultaneously. We have been trying to come up with a solution by means of two approaches: making assumptions (*) about the spatial distribution of the dark matter and (**) about the physics of its interactions. This work is some small final step of a big investigation regarding the search for gamma suppression by employing the second approach, and a model with a doubly charged particle decaying into two positrons (X++ $\rightarrow$ e+ e+) is suggested as the most prospective one from those considered before.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.
#### Halfway to the peak: Spatially resolved star formation and kinematics in  a z=0.54 dusty galaxy with JWST/MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/MIRI/MRS observations of an infrared luminous disk galaxy, FLS1, at z=0.54. With a lookback time of 5 Gyr, FLS1 is chronologically at the midpoint between the peak epoch of star formation and the present day. The MRS data provide maps of the atomic fine structure lines [Ar II]6.99 micron, [Ar III]8.99 micron, [Ne II]12.81 micron, and [Ne III]15.55 micron, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features at 3.3 micron, 6.2 micron, and 11.3 micron, and the warm molecular gas indicators H2S(5) and H2S(3); all these emission features are spatially resolved. We find that the PAH emission is more extended along the Northern side of the galaxy when compared to the well-studied star-formation tracer [Ne II]. The H2 rotational lines, which are shock indicators, are strongest and most extended on the Southern side of the galaxy. [Ar II] is the second brightest fine structure line detected in FLS1 and we show that it is a useful kinematic probe which can be detected with JWST out to z=3. Velocity maps of [Ar II] show a rotating disk with signs of turbulence. Our results provide an example of how spatially resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy can allow us to better understand the star formation and ISM conditions in a galaxy halfway back to the peak epoch of galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 NectarCAM is a Cherenkov camera that will be installed on Medium-Sized Telescopes of the northern array of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It is composed of 265 modules, each of which includes 7 photo-multiplier tubes, a Front-End Board and a camera trigger system for data collection. The first NectarCAM unit is currently being integrated at CEA Paris-Saclay in France. Once installed at the CTAO's northern site, the NectarCAM's timing abilities will be crucial for reducing noise in images, improving image cleaning, and distinguishing between gamma-ray photons and cosmic-ray background. Additionally, it will enable coincidence identification with neighboring telescopes for stereoscopic observations. The timing system of NectarCAM has been tested in a dark room with various light sources. The results of the tests, including timing precision and accuracy of the trigger arrival relative to a laser source, and the timing of individual and multiple pixel signals, will be presented.
#### Tracing the Snowball bifurcation of aquaplanets through time reveals a  fundamental shift in critical-state dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 The instability with respect to global glaciation is a fundamental property of the climate system caused by the positive ice-albedo feedback. The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at which this Snowball bifurcation occurs changes through Earth's history because of the slowly increasing solar luminosity. Quantifying this critical CO$_2$ level is not only interesting from a climate dynamics perspective, but also a prerequisite for understanding past Snowball Earth events as well as the conditions for habitability on Earth and other planets. Earlier studies are limited to investigations with simple climate models for Earth's entire history, or studies of individual time slices carried out with a variety of more complex models and for different boundary conditions, making comparisons and the identification of secular changes difficult. Here we use a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity to trace the Snowball bifurcation of an aquaplanet through Earth's history in one consistent model framework. We find that the critical CO$_2$ concentration decreases more or less logarithmically with increasing solar luminosity until about 1 billion years ago, but drops faster in more recent times. Furthermore, there is a fundamental shift in the dynamics of critical states about 1.2 billion years ago, driven by the interplay of wind-driven sea-ice dynamics and the surface energy balance: For critical states at low solar luminosities, the ice line lies in the Ferrel cell, stabilised by the poleward winds despite moderate meridional temperature gradients under strong greenhouse warming. For critical states at high solar luminosities on the other hand, the ice line rests at the Hadley-cell boundary, stabilised against the equatorward winds by steep meridional temperature gradients resulting from the increased solar energy input at lower latitudes and stronger Ekman transport in the ocean.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully employed for augmenting low-resolution cosmological simulations with small-scale information, a task known as "super-resolution". So far, these cosmological super-resolution models have relied on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can achieve highly realistic results, but suffer from various shortcomings (e.g. low sample diversity). We introduce denoising diffusion models as a powerful generative model for super-resolving cosmic large-scale structure predictions (as a first proof-of-concept in two dimensions). To obtain accurate results down to small scales, we develop a new "filter-boosted" training approach that redistributes the importance of different scales in the pixel-wise training objective. We demonstrate that our model not only produces convincing super-resolution images and power spectra consistent at the percent level, but is also able to reproduce the diversity of small-scale features consistent with a given low-resolution simulation. This enables uncertainty quantification for the generated small-scale features, which is critical for the usefulness of such super-resolution models as a viable surrogate model for cosmic structure formation.
#### Cosmic-ray energy reconstruction using machine learning techniques

 - **Abstract**
 HAWC is a ground-based observatory consisting of 300 water Cherenkov detectors, which observes the extensive air showers induced by cosmic rays from some TeV to a few PeV and, in particular, gamma rays from 300 GeV to more than 100 TeV. One of the crucial features required for a detector of extensive air showers is the estimation of the primary energy of the events to study the spectra of cosmic and gamma rays. For HAWC there are currently two gamma-ray energy estimators: one relies on a ground density parameter, while the other utilizes an artificial neural network. For the cosmic ray energy estimation, there is only one estimator based on maximum likelihood procedures and measurements of the lateral charge distribution of the events. It is worthwhile to update the cosmic-ray energy estimator due to recent improvements of the extensive air shower offline-reconstruction techniques in HAWC. Therefore, we implemented an artificial neural network to reconstruct the primary energy of hadronic events trained with several observables that characterize the air showers. We trained several models and evaluated their performance against the existing cosmic ray energy estimator. In this work, we present the features and performance of these models.
#### An Investigation of New Brown Dwarf Spectral Binary Candidates From the  Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Initiative

 - **Abstract**
 We present three new brown dwarf spectral binary candidates: CWISE J072708.09$-$360729.2, CWISE J103604.84$-$514424.4, and CWISE J134446.62$-$732053.9, discovered by citizen scientists through the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 project. Follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy shows that each of these objects is poorly fit by a single near-infrared standard. We constructed binary templates and found significantly better fits, with component types of L7+T4 for CWISE J072708.09$-$360729.2, L7+T4 for CWISE J103604.84$-$514424.4, and L7+T7 for CWISE J134446.62$-$732053.9. However, further investigation of available spectroscopic indices for evidence of binarity and large amplitude variability suggests that CWISE J072708.09$-$360729.2 may instead be a strong variability candidate. Our analysis offers tentative evidence and characterization of these peculiar brown dwarf sources, emphasizing their value as promising targets for future high-resolution imaging or photometric variability studies.

 - **Abstract**
 PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is the ESA M3 space mission dedicated to detect and characterise transiting exoplanets including information from the asteroseismic properties of their stellar hosts. The uninterrupted and high-precision photometry provided by space-borne instruments such as PLATO require long preparatory phases. An exhaustive list of tests are paramount to design a mission that meets the performance requirements, and as such, simulations are an indispensable tool in the mission preparation. To accommodate PLATO's need of versatile simulations prior to mission launch - that at the same time describe accurately the innovative but complex multi-telescope design - we here present the end-to-end PLATO simulator specifically developed for the purpose, namely \texttt{PlatoSim}. We show step-by-step the algorithms embedded into the software architecture of \texttt{PlatoSim} that allow the user to simulate photometric time series of CCD images and light curves in accordance to the expected observations of PLATO. In the context of the PLATO payload, a general formalism of modelling, end-to-end, incoming photons from the sky to the final measurement in digital units is discussed. We show the strong predictive power of \texttt{PlatoSim} through its diverse applicability and contribution to numerous working groups within the PLATO Mission Consortium. This involves the on-going mechanical integration and alignment, performance studies of the payload, the pipeline development and assessments of the scientific goals. \texttt{PlatoSim} is a state-of-the-art simulator that is able to produce the expected photometric observations of PLATO to a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate that \texttt{PlatoSim} is a key software tool for the PLATO mission in the preparatory phases until mission launch and prospectively beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival data from the 42 foot telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we produce daily stacks of aligned giant pulses for the Crab pulsar, to study changes to the daily profiles between April 2012 to December 2016. From these, we identify echoes, where intervening material away from the line of sight causes pulsed emission to be redirected towards the observer, with delay corresponding to the increased distance of travel, resulting in additional profile components. These observations show that such echoes may be far more common than implied by the previous rate of detections. All the observed echoes are consistent with approaching zero-delay at their closest approach to the normal giant pulse emission. This indicates that the structures responsible for producing these events must be highly anisotropic, with typical lengths greater than $\sim 4\textrm{AU}$, typical widths on the sky of $\sim 0.1 \textrm{AU}$ and typical depths of $\sim 5\textrm{AU}$, given the previously observed electron densities of the nebular filaments, on the order of 1000 cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that these inhomogeneities are likely to be offshoot substructure from the larger nebular filaments of the Crab nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity stellar collisions driven by a supermassive black hole (BH) or BH-driven disruptive collisions, in dense, nuclear clusters can rival the energetics of supergiant star explosions following gravitational collapse of their iron core. Here, starting from a sample of red-giant star collisions simulated with the hydrodynamics code AREPO, we generate photometric and spectroscopic observables using the nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Collisions from more extended giants or stronger collisions (higher velocity or smaller impact parameter) yield bolometric luminosities on the order of 1e43 erg/s at 1d, evolving on a timescale of a week to a bright plateau at ~1e41 erg/s, before plunging precipitously after 20-40d at the end of the optically-thick phase. This luminosity falls primarily in the UV in the first days, thus when it is at its maximum, and shifts to the optical thereafter. Collisions at lower velocity or from less extended stars produce ejecta that are fainter but may remain optically thick for up to 40d if they have a small expansion rate. These collision debris show a similar spectral evolution as that observed or modeled for blue-supergiant star explosions of massive stars, differing only in the more rapid transition to the nebular phase. Such BH-driven disruptive collisions should be detectable by high-cadence surveys in the UV like ULTRASAT.
#### Mean-Motion Resonances in the Quadrantid Meteoroid Stream and Dynamic  Evolution of Dust Trail of (196256) 2003 EH1

 - **Abstract**
 The paper presents numerical models of mean-motion resonances detected in the Quadrantid meteoroid stream consisting of particles of mass 0.003 to 0.03 g, which helps to prove the presence of the following mean-motion resonances: the 1:9 resonance with Venus, 1:5 resonance with Earth, 1:3 and 3:8 resonances with Mars, and 2:1,7:3, 9:4 resonances with Jupiter. Resonance particles create dust trails far from the Earth orbit. Indeed, there is no observational support for resonant effects in the observed Quadrantid meteoroid stream.
#### The classical field approximation of ultra light dark matter: quantum  breaktimes, corrections, and decoherence

 - **Abstract**
 The classical field approximation is widely used to better understand the predictions of ultra-light dark matter. Here, we use the truncated Wigner approximation method to test the classical field approximation of ultra-light dark matter. This method approximates a quantum state as an ensemble of independently evolving realizations drawn from its Wigner function. The method is highly parallelizable and allows the direct simulation of quantum corrections and decoherence times in systems many times larger than have been previously studied in reference to ultra-light dark matter. Our study involves simulation of systems in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions. We simulate three systems, the condensation of a Gaussian random field in three spatial dimensions, a stable collapsed object in three spatial dimensions, and the merging of two stable objects in two spatial dimensions. We study the quantum corrections to the classical field theory in each case. We find that quantum corrections grow exponentially during nonlinear growth with the timescale being approximately equal to the system dynamical time. In stable systems the corrections grow quadratically. We also find that the primary effect of quantum corrections is to reduce the amplitude of fluctuations on the deBroglie scale in the spatial density. Finally, we find that the timescale associated with decoherence due to gravitational coupling to Baryonic matter is at least as fast as the quantum corrections due to gravitational interactions. These results strongly imply that quantum corrections do not impact the predictions of the classical field theory.
#### Temperature measurements with the relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect

 - **Abstract**
 At temperatures above ~5 keV, the non-relativistic approximation used to derive the classical thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect spectrum begins to fail. When relativistic effects are included, the spectrum becomes temperature-dependent. This leads to both a problem and an opportunity: a problem, because when the temperature dependence is not accounted for the Compton-y estimate is biased; and an opportunity, because it represents a new way to measure the temperature of the intracluster medium independently of X-ray observations. This work presents current results from investigating the impact of relativistic effects on Planck cluster observations, and projections for future measurements of cluster temperatures using the Atacama Large Aperture Sub-millimetre Telescope.
#### The Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy  (SCALES): driving science cases and expected outcomes

 - **Abstract**
 The Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) is a $2-5~\mu$m, high-contrast integral field spectrograph (IFS) currently being built for Keck Observatory. With both low ($R\lesssim250$) and medium ($R\sim3500-7000$) spectral resolution IFS modes, SCALES will detect and characterize significantly colder exoplanets than those accessible with near-infrared ($\sim1-2~\mu$m) high-contrast spectrographs. This will lead to new progress in exoplanet atmospheric studies, including detailed characterization of benchmark systems that will advance the state of the art of atmospheric modeling. SCALES' unique modes, while designed specifically for direct exoplanet characterization, will enable a broader range of novel (exo)planetary observations as well as galactic and extragalactic studies. Here we present the science cases that drive the design of SCALES. We describe an end-to-end instrument simulator that we use to track requirements, and show simulations of expected science yields for each driving science case. We conclude with a discussion of preparations for early science when the instrument sees first light in $\sim2025$.
#### X-ray spectral variations of Circinus X-1 observed with NICER throughout  an entire orbital cycle

 - **Abstract**
 Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) is a neutron star binary with an elliptical orbit of 16.6~days. The source is unique for its extreme youth, providing a key to understanding early binary evolution. However, its X-ray variability is too complex to reach a clear interpretation. We conducted the first high cadence (every 4 hours on average) observations covering one entire orbit using the NICER X-ray telescope. The X-ray flux behavior can be divided into stable, dip, and flaring phases. The X-ray spectra in all phases can be described by a common model consisting of a partially covered disk black body emission and the line features from a highly-ionized photo-ionized plasma. The spectral change over the orbit is attributable to rapid changes of the partial covering medium in the line-of-sight and gradual changes of the disk black body emission. Emission lines of the H-like and He-like Mg, Si, S, and Fe are detected, most prominently in the dip phase. The Fe emission lines change to absorption in the course of the transition from the dip phase to the flaring phase. The estimated ionization degree indicates no significant changes, suggesting that the photo-ionized plasma is stable over the orbit. We propose a simple model in which the disk black body emission is partially blocked by such a local medium in the line-of-sight that has spatial structures depending on the azimuth of the accretion disk. Emission lines upon the continuum emission are from the photo-ionized plasma located outside of the blocking material.
#### Asteroseismology applied to constrain structure parameters of δ  Scuti stars

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe the structure of stars. Space-borne instruments like CoRoT, Kepler and TESS have observed the oscillations of numerous stars, among which {\delta} Scutis are particularly interesting owing to their fast rotation rates and complex pulsation mechanisms. In this work, we inferred model-dependent masses, metallicities and ages of 60 {\delta} Scuti stars from their photometric, spectroscopic and asteroseismic observations using least-squares minimization. These statistics have the potential to explain why only a tiny fraction of {\delta} Sct stars pulsate in a very clean manner. We find most of these stars with masses around 1.6 {M_\odot} and metallicities below Z = 0.010. We observed a bimodality in age for these stars, with more than half the sample younger than 30 Myr, while the remaining ones were inferred to be older, i.e., hundreds of Myrs. This work emphasizes the importance of the large-frequency separation ({\Delta\nu}) in studies of {\delta} Scuti stars. We also designed three machine learning (ML) models that hold the potential for inferring these parameters at lower computational cost and much more rapidly. These models further revealed that constraining dipole modes can help in significantly improving age estimation and that radial modes succinctly encode information pertaining to stellar luminosity and temperature. Using the ML models, we also gained qualitative insight into the importance of stellar observables in estimating mass, metallicity, and age. The effective surface temperature T eff strongly affects the inference of all structure parameters and the asteroseismic offset parameter {\epsilon} plays an essential role in the inference of age.
#### A survey of SiO $J=$ 1 -- 0 emission toward massive star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 The application of silicon monoxide (SiO) as a shock tracer arises from its propensity to occur in the gas phase as a result of shock-induced phenomena, including outflow activity and interactions between molecular clouds and expanding HII regions or supernova remnants. We searched for indications of shocks toward 366 massive star-forming regions by observing the ground rotational transition of SiO ($v=0$, $J=1-0$) at 43 GHz with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) 21 m telescopes to extend our understanding on the origins of SiO in star-forming regions. We detected SiO emission toward 104 regions that consist of 57 IRDCs, 21 HMPOs, and 26 UCHIIs. The determined median SiO column density, $N$(SiO), and abundance, $X$(SiO), relative to $N$(H$_2$) are $8.12\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.28\times10^{-10}$, respectively. These values are similar to those obtained toward other star-forming regions and also consistent with predicted values from shock models with low-velocity shocks ($\lesssim$10 - 15 km s$^{-1}$). While the $X$(SiO) does not exhibit any strong correlation with the evolutionary stages of their host clumps, $L_{\rm SiO}$ is highly correlated with dust clump mass, and $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ also has a strong negative correlation with $T_{\rm dust}$. This shows that colder and younger clumps have high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ suggestive of an evolutionary trend. This trend is not due to excess emission at higher velocities, such as SiO wing features, as the colder sources with high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios lack wing features. Comparing SiO emission with H$_2$O and Class I CH$_3$OH masers, we find a significant correlation between $L_{\rm SiO}$/$L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm CH_3OH}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios, whereas no similar correlation is seen for the H$_2$O maser emission. This suggests a similar origin for the SiO and Class I CH$_3$OH emission in these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks exhibit a vertical gradient in angular momentum, rendering them susceptible to the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). The most important condition for the onset of this mechanism is a short timescale of thermal relaxation ($\lesssim 0.1$ orbital timescales). Simulations of fully VSI active disks are characterized by turbulent, vertically extended dust layers. This is in contradiction with recent observations of the outer regions of some protoplanetary disks, which appear highly settled. In this work, we demonstrate that the process of dust coagulation can diminish the cooling rate of the gas in the outer disk and extinct the VSI activity. Our findings indicate that the turbulence strength is especially susceptible to variations in the fragmentation velocity of the grains. A small fragmentation velocity of $\approx 100 \mathrm{\, cm \,s^{-1}}$ results in a fully turbulent simulation, whereas a value of $\approx 400 \mathrm{\, cm \,s^{-1}}$ results in a laminar outer disk, being consistent with observations. We show that VSI turbulence remains relatively unaffected by variations in the maximum particle size in the inner disk regions. However, we find that dust coagulation can significantly suppress the occurrence of VSI turbulence at larger distances from the central star.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides an important source for the study of weak gravitational lensing. The lensed CMB can be used to constrain cosmological parameters, but it also has smoothing effect on the original CMB. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB has sharper acoustic peaks and more prominent damping tails, allowing for improved inferences of cosmological parameters affecting these characteristics. Although delensing reduces the B-mode power spectrum, it aids the search for primordial gravitational waves and allows for lower variance reconstruction of lensing and other sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we investigate whether the deep learning methods, concretely the U-Net++ algorithm here, can play a crucial role in CMB delensing. We consider three fields, i.e., T, Q and U sky maps, present the angular power spectra of CMB delensed TT, EE and BB, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. The results show that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB processed by U-Net++ is in great agreement with the unlensed CMB angular power spectrum. Therefore, the U-Net++ based CMB delensing can efficiently eliminate the effects caused by weak gravitational lensing and shed new light on the CMB power spectrum for future CMB experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Mini-EUSO is a wide Field-of-View (FoV, 44$^{\circ}$) telescope currently in operation from a nadia-facing UV-transparent window in the Russian Zvezda module on the International Space Station (ISS). It is the first detector of the JEM-EUSO program deployed on the ISS, launched in August 2019. The main goal of Mini-EUSO is to measure the UV emissions from the ground and atmosphere, using an orbital platform. Mini-EUSO is mainly sensitive in the 290-430 nm bandwidth. Light is focused by a system of two Fresnel lenses of 25 cm diameter each on the Photo- Detector-Module (PDM), which consists of an array of 36 Multi-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs), for a total of 2304 pixels working in photon counting mode, in three different time resolutions of 2.5 ${\mu}$s, 320 ${\mu}$s, 40.96 ms operation in parallel. In the longest time scale, the data is continuously acquired to monitor the UV emission of the Earth. It is best suited for the observation of ground sources and therefore has been used for the observational campaigns of the Mini-EUSO. In this contribution, we present the assembled UV flasher, the operation of the field campaign and the analysis of the obtained data. The result is compared with the overall efficiency computed from the expectations which takes into account the atmospheric attenuation and the parameterization of different effects such as the optics efficiency, the MAPMT detection efficiency, BG3 filter transmittance and the transparency of the ISS window.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytic model of nonlinear correlators of galaxy/halo ellipticities in redshift space. The three-dimensional ellipticity field is not affected by the redshift-space distortion (RSD) at linear order, but by the nonlinear one, known as the Finger-of-God effect, caused by the coordinate transformation from real to redshift space. Adopting a simple Gaussian damping function to describe the nonlinear RSD effect and the nonlinear alignment model for the relation between the observed ellipticity and underlying tidal fields, we derive analytic formulas for the multipole moments of the power spectra of the ellipticity field in redshift space expanded in not only the associated Legendre basis, a natural basis for the projected galaxy shape field, but also the standard Legendre basis, conventionally used in literature. The multipoles of the corresponding correlation functions of the galaxy shape field are shown to be expressed by a simple Hankel transform, as is the case for those of the conventional galaxy density correlations. We measure these multipoles of the power spectra and correlation functions of the halo ellipticity field using large-volume N-body simulations. We then show that the measured alignment signals can be better predicted by our nonlinear model than the existing linear alignment model. The formulas derived here have already been used to place cosmological constraints using from the redshift-space correlation functions of the galaxy shape field measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Okumura and Taruya, 2023).

 The second generation Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super-Pressure Balloon (EUSO-SPB2) mission is a stratospheric balloon mission developed within the Joint Exploratory Missions for Extreme Universe Space Observatory (JEM-EUSO) program. The Fluorescence Telescope (FT) is one of the two separate Schmidt telescopes of EUSO-SPB2, which aims at measuring the fluorescence emission of extensive air showers from cosmic rays above the energy of 1 EeV, looking downwards onto the atmosphere from the float altitude of 33 km. The FT measures photons with a time resolution of 1.05 $\mu$s in two different modes: single photon counting (PC) and charge integration (KI). In this paper, we describe the latter and report on the measurements of its characteristics. We also present a new trigger based on this channel, the so-called KI trigger, which allows to measure additional types of events, namely very short and intense light pulses. We report on the tests of this trigger mode in the laboratory and at the TurLab facility, and its implementation in the EUSO-SPB2 mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from LHAASO and Tibet AS$\gamma$ suggest that the Crab Nebula's gamma-ray spectrum extends to the PeV energy range, however the production mechanisms of this highest energy emission remain unclear. It has been postulated that a secondary component of hadronic emission could explain the highest energy gamma-ray flux points, however the origin and acceleration mechanism for this hadronic population has yet to be explained. We postulate one scenario in which hadrons diffuse over time into the Crab pulsar wind nebula from the surrounding supernova ejecta, and are subsequently re-accelerated by the pulsar wind termination shock. We present results of direct particle transport simulations (including radial evolution) to determine if this scenario is viable over the lifetime of the Crab system.

 - **Abstract**
 During the outbursts of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs), their accretion flows transition through several states. The source luminosity rises in the hard state, dominated by non-thermal emission, before transitioning to the blackbody-dominated soft state. As the luminosity decreases, the source transitions back into the hard state and fades to quiescence. This picture does not always hold, as $\approx$ 40$\%$ of the outbursts never leave the hard state. Identifying the physics that govern state transitions remains one of the outstanding open questions in black hole astrophysics. In this paper we present an analysis of archival RXTE data of multiple outbursts of GX 339-4. We compare the properties of the X-ray variability and time-averaged energy spectrum and demonstrate that the variability (quantified by the power spectral hue) systematically evolves $\approx$ 10-40 days ahead of the canonical state transition (quantified by a change in spectral hardness); no such evolution is found in hard state only outbursts. This indicates that the X-ray variability can be used to predict if and when the hard-to-soft state transition will occur. Finally, we find a similar behavior in ten outbursts of four additional BHXRBs with more sparse observational coverage. Based on these findings, we suggest that state transitions in BHXRBs might be driven by a change in the turbulence in the outer regions of the disk, leading to a dramatic change in variability. This change is only seen in the spectrum days to weeks later, as the fluctuations propagate inwards towards the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently detected stochastic signal by several pulsar timing array collaborations, offers an opportunity to scrutinize the fundamental properties of gravity, including the potential mass of the graviton. In this study, we analyze the NANOGrav 15-year data set to search for a stochastic gravitational wave background with modified Hellings-Downs correlations predicted by massive gravity. While the Bayesian analysis comparing the massive gravity to massless gravity within the effective searchable mass range of $m_g\in [3\times 10^{-25}, 8 \times 10^{-24}]\,\rm{eV}/c^2$ does not yield an explicit upper bound as all the Bayes factors are smaller than $3$, the combined consideration of the minimum frequency inherent in a massive gravity and the observed spectrum leads to an upper limit of $m_g<8.2\times 10^{-24}\,\rm{eV}/c^2$.

 - **Abstract**
 There is compelling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a late phase of accelerated expansion. One of the simplest explanations for this behaviour is the presence of dark energy. A plethora of microphysical models for dark energy have been proposed. The hope is that, with the ever increasing precision of cosmological surveys, it will be possible to precisely pin down the model. We show that is unlikely and that, at best, we will have a phenomenological description for the microphysics of dark energy. Furthermore, we argue that the current phenomenological prescriptions are ill-equipped for shedding light on the fundamental theory of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of exoplanets detected using gravitational microlensing technique is currently larger than 200, which enables population studies. Microlensing is uniquely sensitive to low-mass planets orbiting at separations of several astronomical units, a parameter space that is not accessible to other planet-detection techniques, as well as free-floating planets, not orbiting around any star. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge on the demographics of exoplanets detected with microlensing, with a particular emphasis on their occurrence rates. We also summarize the current knowledge about free-floating planets, an elusive population of objects that seem to be more common than ordinary, gravitationally bound exoplanets.
#### New methods for radial-velocity measurements of double-lined binaries,  and detection of a circumbinary planet orbiting TIC 172900988

 - **Abstract**
 Ongoing ground-based radial-velocity observations seeking to detect circumbinary planets focus on single-lined binaries even though over nine in every ten binary systems in the solar-neighbourhood are double-lined. Double-lined binaries are on average brighter, and should in principle yield more precise radial-velocities. However, as the two stars orbit one another, they produce a time-varying blending of their weak spectral lines. This makes an accurate measure of radial velocities difficult, producing a typical scatter of 10-15m/s. This extra noise prevents the detection of most orbiting circumbinary planets. We develop two new data-driven approaches to disentangle the two stellar components of a double-lined binary, and extract accurate and precise radial-velocities. Both approaches use a Gaussian Process regression, with the first one working in the spectral domain, whereas the second works on cross-correlated spectra. We apply our new methods to TIC 172900988, a proposed circumbinary system with a double-lined binary, and detect a circumbinary planet with an orbital period of 150 days, different than previously proposed. We also measure a significant residual scatter, which we speculate is caused by stellar activity. We show that our two data-driven methods outperform the traditionally used TODCOR and TODMOR, for that particular binary system.

 The detection of astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube in the TeV-PeV energy range motivates the development of instruments for observing these particles at higher energies. Moreover, the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) neutrinos could potentially bring constraints on ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) source models. Tau neutrinos skimming the Earth under a shallow angle can be detected through the decay of a tau resulting in an extensive air shower (EAS) in the atmosphere. The EAS can be detected by capturing some of the optical Cherenkov signal originating from the EAS particles. To assess the feasibility of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes, we developed a Cherenkov telescope which was deployed on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) from Wanaka, NZ, on May $13^{th}$. It is a precursor for the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. The 1m diameter Cherenkov telescope for EUSO-SPB2 had a focal plane comprised of 512 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) covering a 6.4 x 12.8 square degree field of view coupled to a 100 MS/s readout based on the GET switch capacitor ring sampler. We discuss the calibration and commissioning of the telescope and its in-flight performance.

 - **Abstract**
 In previous hydrodynamical simulations, we found a mechanism for nearly circular binary stars, like Kepler-413, to trap two planets in a stable 1:1 resonance. Therefore, the stability of coorbital configurations becomes a relevant question for planet formation around binary stars. Here, we investigate the coorbital planet stability using a Kepler-413 analogue as example and then expanding the parameters to study general n-body stability of planet pairs in eccentric horseshoe orbits around binaries. The stability is tested by evolving the planet orbits for $10^5$ binary periods with varying initial semi-major axes and planet eccentricities. The unstable region of a single circumbinary planet is used as a comparison to the investigated coorbital configurations in this work. We confirm previous findings on the stability of single planets and find a first order linear relation between orbit eccentricity and pericentre to identify stable orbits for various binary configurations. Such a linear relation is also found for the stability of 1:1 resonant planets around binaries. Stable orbits for eccentric horseshoe configurations exist with a pericentre closer than seven binary separations and, in the case of Kepler-413, the pericentre of the first stable orbit can be approximated by $r_{c,peri} = (2.88 e_p + 2.46) a_{bin}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recovering the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) is crucial for shading light on Cosmic Inflation. Methods with different characteristics should be developed and optimized. We aim to use a neural network called CENN and train it for recovering the E and B modes of the CMB. We train the network with realistic simulations of 256x256 pixel squared patches at 100, 143 and 217 GHz Planck channels, which contain the CMB, thermal dust, synchrotron, PS and noise. We make several trainings sets: 30, 25 and 20 arcmin resolution patches at the same position in the sky. After being trained, CENN is able to recover the CMB signal at 143 GHz in Q and U patches. Then, we use NaMaster for estimating the EE and BB power spectrum for each input and output patches in the test dataset, as well as the difference between input and output power spectra and the residuals. We also test the methodology using a different foreground model at 5 arcmin resolution without noise. We recover the E-mode generally founding residuals bellow the input signal at all scales. In particular, we found a value of about 0.1 muK2 at l<200, decreasing below 0.01 muK2 at smaller scales. For the B-mode, we similarly recover the CMB with residuals between 0.01 and 0.001 muK2. We also train the network with 5 arcmin Planck simulations without noise, obtaining clearly better results with respect the previous cases. For a different foreground model, the recovery is similar, although B-mode residuals increase above the input signal. In general, we found that, the network performs better when training with the same resolution used for testing. Based on the results, CENN seems to be a promising for recovering both E and B modes at sub-degree scales in ground-base experiments such as POLARBEAR, SO and CMB-S4. Once extending its applicability at all sky, it could be an alternative component separation method for LiteBIRD satellite.

 LHAASO J2108+5157 is a recently discovered source, detected in the Ultra-High-Energy band by the LHAASO collaboration. Two molecular clouds were identified in the direction coincident with LHAASO J2108+5157 and, from the spectra reported by LHAASO, there is no sign of an energy cutoff up to 200 TeV. This source makes a promising galactic PeVatron candidate. In 2021, the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Observatory, collected about 50 hours of quality-selected data on LHAASO J2108+5157. Through these observations, we managed to compute stringent upper limits on the source emission in the multi-TeV band. Together with the analysis of XMM-Newton data and 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, we performed a multi-wavelength study of the source, investigating different possible scenarios of particle acceleration. In this contribution, we will present the results of the analysis, as well as the multi-wavelength modeling, and consequent interpretation of different possible scenarios of emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present RF-ICE, a novel readout platform for microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), optimized for use on millimeter-wavelength telescopes. The RF-ICE system extends ICE, a versatile, mature signal processing platform currently in use on telescopes around the world, into a new operational domain with MKIDs biased with gigahertz carriers. The system couples the FPGA-based ICE motherboard with a radio-frequency digitization daughterboard to enable direct digital synthesis from 0 to 6 GHz without the need for external mixing. The system operates two independent readout modules, each with 1024 frequency-multiplexed readout channels spaced across 500 MHz of carrier bandwidth. The system, which is under active development, is in operation with prototype detector wafers and will be deployed for the upcoming SPT-SLIM and SPT-3G+ experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A$^*$, and its accretion disk, occasionally produces high energy flares seen in X-ray, infrared and radio. One mechanism for observed flares is the formation of compact bright regions that appear within the accretion disk and close to the event horizon. Understanding these flares can provide a window into black hole accretion processes. Although sophisticated simulations predict the formation of these flares, their structure has yet to be recovered by observations. Here we show the first three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an emission flare in orbit recovered from ALMA light curves observed on April 11, 2017. Our recovery results show compact bright regions at a distance of roughly 6 times the event horizon. Moreover, our recovery suggests a clockwise rotation in a low-inclination orbital plane, a result consistent with prior studies by EHT and GRAVITY collaborations. To recover this emission structure we solve a highly ill-posed tomography problem by integrating a neural 3D representation (an emergent artificial intelligence approach for 3D reconstruction) with a gravitational model for black holes. Although the recovered 3D structure is subject, and sometimes sensitive, to the model assumptions, under physically motivated choices we find that our results are stable and our approach is successful on simulated data. We anticipate that in the future, this approach could be used to analyze a richer collection of time-series data that could shed light on the mechanisms governing black hole and plasma dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The first JWST observations of hot Jupiters showed an unexpected detection of SO2 in their hydrogen-rich atmospheres. We investigate how much sulphur can be expected in the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets and which sulphur molecules can be expected to be most abundant and detectable by transmission spectroscopy. We run thermo-chemical equilibrium models at the crust-atmosphere interface, considering surface temperatures 500 to 5000 K, surface pressures 1 to 100 bar, and various sets of element abundances based on common rock compositions. Between 1000 K and 2000 K, we find gaseous sulphur concentrations of up to 25 percent above the rock in our models. SO2, SO, H2S and S2 are by far the most abundant sulphur molecules. SO2 shows potentially detectable features in transmission spectra at about 4 micron, between 7 and 8 micron, and beyond 15 micron. In contrast, the sometimes abundant H2S molecule is difficult to detect in these spectra, which are mostly dominated by H2O and CO2. Although the molecule PS only occurs with concentrations below 300 ppm, it can cause a strong absorption feature between 0.3 and 0.65 micron in some of our models for high surface pressures. The detection of sulphur molecules would enable a better characterisation of the planetary surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last decade, precise exoplanet transmission spectroscopy has revealed the atmospheres of dozens of exoplanets, driven largely by observatories like the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope. One major discovery has been the ubiquity of atmospheric aerosols, often blocking access to exoplanet chemical inventories. Tentative trends have been identified, showing that the clarity of planetary atmospheres may depend on equilibrium temperature. Previous work has often grouped dissimilar planets together in order to increase the statistical power of any trends, but it remains unclear from observed transmission spectra whether these planets exhibit the same atmospheric physics and chemistry. We present a re-analysis of a smaller, more physically similar sample of 15 exo-Neptune transmission spectra across a wide range of temperatures (200-1000 K). Using condensation cloud and hydrocarbon haze models, we find that the exo-Neptune population is best described by very low cloud sedimentation efficiency ($\mathrm{f_{sed}}\sim0.01$) and high metallicity ($100\times$ Solar). There is an intrinsic astrophysical scatter of $\sim0.5$ scale height, perhaps evidence of stochasticity in these planets' formation processes. Observers should expect significant attenuation in transmission spectra of Neptune-size exoplanets, up to 6 scale heights for equilibrium temperatures between 500 and 800~K. With JWST's greater wavelength sensitivity, colder ($<500$~K) planets should be high-priority targets given their comparative rarity, clearer atmospheres, and the need to distinguish between the ``super-puffs'' and more typical gas-dominated planets.
