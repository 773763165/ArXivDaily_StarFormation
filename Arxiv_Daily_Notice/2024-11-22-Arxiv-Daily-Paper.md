 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the large-scale shock front in Stephan's Quintet, a byproduct of past and ongoing interactions. Using integral-field spectroscopy from the new William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE), recent 144 MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival data from the Very Large Array and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we obtain new measurements of key shock properties and determine its impact on the system. Harnessing the WEAVE large integral field unit's (LIFU) field of view (90 $\times$ 78 arcsec$^{2}$), spectral resolution ($R\sim2500$) and continuous wavelength coverage across the optical band, we perform robust emission line modeling and dynamically locate the shock within the multi-phase intergalactic medium (IGM) with higher precision than previously possible. The shocking of the cold gas phase is hypersonic, and comparisons with shock models show that it can readily account for the observed emission line ratios. In contrast, we demonstrate that the shock is relatively weak in the hot plasma visible in X-rays (with Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 2 - 4$), making it inefficient at producing the relativistic particles needed to explain the observed synchrotron emission. Instead, we propose that it has led to an adiabatic compression of the medium, which has increased the radio luminosity ten-fold. Comparison of the Balmer line-derived extinction map with the molecular gas and hot dust observed with JWST suggests that pre-existing dust may have survived the collision, allowing the condensation of H$_{2}$ - a key channel for dissipating the shock energy.

 - **Abstract**
 In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant {\it only} if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.

 - **Abstract**
 {We present the radial metallicity gradients within the Galactic thin disc population through main-sequence stars selected on the chemical plane using GALAH DR3 accompanied with Gaia DR3 astrometric data. The [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Mg/H] radial gradients are estimated for guiding radius as $-0.074\pm 0.006$, $+0.004\pm0.002$, $-0.074\pm0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ and for the traceback early orbital radius as $-0.040\pm0.002$, $+0.003\pm 0.001$, $-0.039\pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ for 66,545 thin-disc stars, respectively. Alteration of the chemical structure within the Galactic disc caused by the radial orbital variations complicates results for the radial metallicity gradient. The effect of radial orbital variations on the metallicity gradients as a function on time indicates the following results: (i) The presence of a gradient along the disc throughout the time for which the model provides similar prediction, (ii) the radial orbital variations becomes more pronounced with the age of the stellar population and (iii) the effect of radial orbital variations on the metallicity gradients is minimal. The effect of radial orbital variations is found to be at most 6\% which does not statistically affect the radial gradient results. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the chemical evolution within the Galactic disc and provide an important basis for further research.

          Asymmetry of the tidal tails of open star clusters in direct N-body integrations in Milgrom-law dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical QUMOND-simulations of star clusters orbiting in a Galactic disk potential show that the leading tidal arm of open star clusters contains tendentially more members than the trailing arm. However, these type of simulations are performed by solving the field-equations of QUMOND and already become non-practical for star cluster masses at around 5000 Msun. Nearby star clusters have masses of 1000 Msun or ~1000 particles and less/fewer and can currently not be simulated reliably in field-theoretical formulations of MOND. In order to handle particle numbers below the QUMOND-limit the star cluster is simulated in Milgrom-law dynamics (MLD): Milgrom's law is postulated to be valid for discrete systems in vectorial form. In order to suppress the Newtonisation of compact subsystems in the star cluster the gravitational force is softened below particle distances of 0.001 pc ~206 AU. Thus, MLD can only be considered as an approximation of a full MOND-theoretical description of discrete systems which are internally in the MOND regime. The MLD equations of motion are integrated by the standard Hermite scheme generally applied to Newtonian N-body systems, which is extended to solve for the accelerations and jerks associated with Milgrom's law. It is found that the tidal tails of a low-mass star cluster are populated asymmetrically in the MLD-treatment, very similar to the QUMOND simulations of the higher-mass star clusters. In the MLD-simulations the leading tail hosts up to twice as many members than the trailing arm and the low-mass open star cluster dissolves approximately 25% faster than in the respective Newtonian case.

          Chemical evolution of an evaporating lava pool

 - **Abstract**
 Many known rocky exoplanets are so highly irradiated that their dayside surfaces are molten, and `silicate atmospheres', composed of rock-forming elements, are generated above these lava pools. The compositions of these `lava planet' atmospheres are of great interest because they must be linked to the composition of the underlying rocky interiors. It may be possible to investigate these atmospheres, either by detecting them directly via emission spectroscopy or by observing the dust tails which trail the low mass `catastrophically evaporating planets'. In this work, we develop a simple chemical model of the lava pool--atmosphere system under mass loss, to study its evolution. Mass loss can occur both into space and from the day to the nightside. We show that the system reaches a steady state, where the material in the escaping atmosphere has the same composition as that melted into the lava pool from the mantle. We show that the catastrophically evaporating planets are likely to be in this evolved state. This means that the composition of their dust tails is likely to be a direct trace of the composition of the mantle material that is melted into the lava pool. We further show that, due to the strength of day-to-nightside atmospheric transport, this evolved state may even apply to relatively high-mass planets (>1 Earth Mass). Moreover, the low pressure of evolved atmospheres implies that non-detections may not be due to the total lack of an atmosphere. Both conclusions are important for the interpretation of future observations.

 MICADO, the European Extremely Large Telescope first light imager will feature a dedicated high contrast imaging mode specifically designed for observing and characterizing exoplanets and circumstellar disks. Its improved sensitivity and angular resolution, compared to existing instruments will significantly increase our knowledge on these planetary systems. MICADO will include three classical Lyot coronagraphs, one vector phase-apodized pupil plane (vAPP) and two sparse apertures. After rapidly describing the final design of MICADO high contrast mode, we will describe the current state of development of the coronographic components and the testing of the first Lyot coronagraph prototypes.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectroscopic study of mature giant planets and low mass planets (Neptune-like, Earth-like) requires instruments capable of achieving very high contrasts ($10^{-10}-10^{-11}$) at short angular separations. To achieve such high performance on a real instrument, many limitations must be overcome: complex component defects (coronagraph, deformable mirror), optical aberrations and scattering, mechanical vibrations and drifts, polarization effects, etc. To study the overall impact on a complete system representative of high contrast instruments, we have developed a test bench at Paris Observatory, called THD2. In this paper, we focus on the polarization effects that are present on the bench which creates differential aberrations between the two linear polarization states. We compare the recorded beam positions of the two polarization states with the predicted from the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, both of which cause spatial shifts and angular deviations of the beam, longitudinal and transverse respectively. Although these effects have already been studied in the literature from the optical and quantum mechanical points of view, their measurement and impact on a complete optical bench are rather rare, although they are crucial for high-contrast instruments. After describing the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects and estimating their amplitude on the THD2 bench, we present the protocol we used to measure these effects of polarization on the light beam. We compare predictions and measurements and we conclude on the most limiting elements on our bench polarization-wise.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding of the formation and evolution of the Solar System requires understanding key and common materials found on and in planetary bodies. Mineral mixing and its implications on planetary body formation is a topic of high interest to the planetary science community. Previous work establishes a case for the use of Optical PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) in planetary science and introduces and demonstrates the technique's capability to study planetary materials. In this paper, we performed a measurement campaign on granular materials relevant to planetary science, such as minerals found in lunar and martian soils. These laboratory measurements serve to start a database of O-PTIR measurements. We also present FTIR absorption measurements of the materials we observed in O-PTIR for comparison purposes. We find that the O-PTIR technique suffers from granular orientation effects similar to other IR techniques, but in most cases, is is directly comparable to commonly used absorption spectroscopy techniques. We conclude that O-PTIR would be an excellent tool for the purpose of planetary material identification during in-situ investigations on regolith and bedrock surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the Compton scattering in the optically thick uniform spherical corona around a neutron star in an X-ray binary. In the scattering, the low energy seed photons (0.1 - 2.5 keV) are scattered in low energy electrons (2.5 - 10 keV) in the corona in two conditions, i.e. initial seed photons are scattered in a whole corona and scattered in every layer of the corona that are supposed to be divided into many this http URL the same number of input seed photons, the same corona parameters and the same energy distribution of all photons in the two conditions are considered, the approximately same number of output photons can be obtained, which means that there is approximately a transform invariance of layering the Comptonized corona. Thus the scattering in the layers of a multi-layered corona is approximately equal to the scattering in the whole corona by dividing the whole corona into several this http URL means that Compton scattering for the initial seed photons scattered in a whole optically thick spherical corona with uniformly distributed electrons also can be considered as that the multiple Compton scatterings take place in the layers of a multi-layered corona in order approximately, which can be used to explore some physical process in one part of a corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]$_{\rm solar}$ - [X/Fe]$_{\rm star}$) versus condensation temperature ($T_c$) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative $T_c$ trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant-planet-host stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between $T_c$ trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.

          G321.93-0.01: A Rare Site of Multiple Hub-Filament Systems with Evidence of Collision and Merging of Filaments

 - **Abstract**
 Hub-filament systems (HFSs) are potential sites of massive star formation (MSF). To understand the role of filaments in MSF and the origin of HFSs, we conducted a multi-scale and multi-wavelength observational investigation of the molecular cloud G321.93-0.01. The $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) data reveal multiple HFSs, namely, HFS-1, HFS-2, and a candidate HFS (C-HFS). HFS-1 and HFS-2 exhibit significant mass accretion rates ($\dot{M}_{||}$ $> 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) to their hubs (i.e., Hub-1 and Hub-2, respectively). Hub-1 is comparatively massive, having higher $\dot{M}_{||}$ than Hub-2, allowing to derive a relationship $\dot{M}_{||} \propto M^{\beta}_{\rm{hub}}$, with $\beta \sim1.28$. Detection of three compact HII regions within Hub-1 using MeerKAT 1.28 GHz radio continuum data and the presence of a clump (ATL-3), which meets Kauffmann & Pillai's criteria for MSF, confirm the massive star-forming activity in HFS-1. We find several low-mass ALMA cores (1-9 $M_{\odot}$) inside ATL-3. The presence of a compact HII region at the hub of C-HFS confirms that it is active in MSF. Therefore, HFS-1 and C-HFS are in relatively evolved stages of MSF, where massive stars have begun ionizing their surroundings. Conversely, despite a high $\dot{M}_{||}$, the non-detection of radio continuum emission toward Hub-2 suggests it is in the relatively early stages of MSF. Analysis of $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) data reveals that the formation of HFS-1 was likely triggered by the collision of a filamentary cloud about 1 Myr ago. In contrast, the relative velocities ($\gtrsim 1$ km s$^{-1}$) among the filaments of HFS-2 and C-HFS indicate their formation through the merging of filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the application of the image coaddition algorithm, Up-sampling and PSF Deconvolution Coaddition (UPDC), for stacking multiple exposure images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). By addressing the point spread function (PSF) effect, UPDC provides visually enhanced and sharper images. Furthermore, the anti-aliasing and super-resolution capabilities of UPDC make it easier to deblend sources overlapped on images, yielding a higher accuracy of aperture photometry. We apply this algorithm to the SMACS J0723 imaging data. Comparative analysis with the Drizzle algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in detecting faint sources, achieving accurate photometry, and effectively deblending (super-resolution) closely packed sources. {As a result, we have newly detected a pair of close binary stars that were previously unresolvable in the original exposures or the Drizzled image.} These improvements significantly benefit various scientific projects conducted by JWST. The resulting dataset, named "UPdec-Webb", can be accessible through the official website of the Chinese Virtual Observatory (ChinaVO).

          Collisional damping in debris discs: Only significant if collision velocities are low

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Dusty debris discs around main sequence stars are observed to vary widely in terms of their vertical thickness. Their vertical structure may be affected by damping in inelastic collisions. Although kinetic models have often been used to study the collisional evolution of debris discs, these models have not yet been used to study the evolution of their vertical structure. Aims. We extend an existing implementation of a kinetic model of collisional evolution to include the evolution of orbital inclinations and we use this model to study the effects of collisional damping in pre-stirred discs. Methods. We evolved the number of particles of different masses, eccentricities, and inclinations using the kinetic model and used Monte Carlo simulations to calculate collision rates between particles in the disc. We considered all relevant collisional outcomes including fragmentation, cratering, and growth. Results. Collisional damping is inefficient if particles can be destroyed by projectiles that are of much lower mass. If that is the case, catastrophic disruptions shape the distributions of eccentricities and inclinations, and their average values evolve slowly and at the same rate for all particle sizes. Conclusions. The critical projectile-to-target mass ratio (Yc) and the collisional timescale jointly determine the level of collisional damping in debris discs. If Yc is much smaller than unity, a debris disc retains the inclination distribution that it is born with for much longer than the collisional timescale of the largest bodies in the disc. Such a disc should exhibit a vertical thickness that is independent of wavelength even in the absence of other physical processes. Collisional damping is efficient if Yc is of order unity or larger. For millimetre-sized dust grains and common material strength assumptions, this requires collision velocities of lower than ~40 m/s. Abridged

          Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or non-repeaters. However, observational limitations may lead to misclassifications, suggesting a larger proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalog, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and HDBSCAN), we successfully segregate repeaters and non-repeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}T_B$, and $r - \gamma$ correlations, which provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope marks a significant step forward in radio astronomy, presenting new opportunities and challenges for data analysis. Traditional visual models pretrained on optical photography images may not perform optimally on radio interferometry images, which have distinct visual characteristics. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising approach to address this issue, leveraging the abundant unlabeled data in radio astronomy to train neural networks that learn useful representations from radio images. This study explores the application of SSL to radio astronomy, comparing the performance of SSL-trained models with that of traditional models pretrained on natural images, evaluating the importance of data curation for SSL, and assessing the potential benefits of self-supervision to different domain-specific radio astronomy datasets. Our results indicate that, SSL-trained models achieve significant improvements over the baseline in several downstream tasks, especially in the linear evaluation setting; when the entire backbone is fine-tuned, the benefits of SSL are less evident but still outperform pretraining. These findings suggest that SSL can play a valuable role in efficiently enhancing the analysis of radio astronomical data. The trained models and code is available at: \url{this https URL}

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars lead the ionization and mechanical feedback within young star-forming regions. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal galaxy for studying individual massive stars and quantifying their feedback contribution to the environment. We analyze eight exemplary targets in LMC N11 B from the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program, using novel spectra from HST (COS and STIS) in the UV, and from VLT (X-shooter) in the optical. We model the spectra of early to late O-type stars by using state-of-the-art PoWR atmosphere models. We determine the stellar and wind parameters (e.g., $T_\star$, $\log g$, $L_{\star}$, $\dot{M}$, $v_\infty$) of the analyzed objects, chemical abundances (C, N, O), ionizing and mechanical feedback ($Q_\mathrm{H}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$, $L_\mathrm{mec}$) and X-rays. We report ages of $2-4.5$ Myr and masses of $30-60$ $M_\odot$ for the analyzed stars in N11 B, consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation. We note that the observed wind-momentum luminosity relation is consistent with theoretical predictions. We detect nitrogen enrichment in most of the stars, up to a factor of seven. However, we do not find a correlation between nitrogen enrichment and projected rotational velocity. Finally, based on their spectral type, we estimate the total ionizing photons injected from the O-type stars in N11 B into its environment. We report $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{H}$)$=50.5$ ph s$^{-1}$, $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$)$=49.6$ ph s$^{-1}$ and $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$)$=44.4$ ph s$^{-1}$, consistent with the total ionizing budget in N11.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved model-independent method for determining the cosmic curvature using the observations of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) and the Hubble parameter. The purpose of this work is to provide insights into late-universe curvature measurements using available observational data and techniques. Thus, we use two sources of BAO data sets, BOSS/eBOSS and latest DESI DR1, and two reconstruction methods, Gaussian process (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN). It is important to highlight that our method circumvents influence induced by the sound horizon in BAO observations and the Hubble constant. Combining BAO data from BOSS/eBOSS plus DESI DR1, we find that the constraint on the cosmic curvature results in $\Omega_K=-0.040^{+0.142}_{-0.145}$ with an observational uncertainty of $1\sigma$ in the framework of GP method. This result changes to $\Omega_K=-0.010^{+0.405}_{-0.424}$ when the ANN method is applied. Further comparative analysis of samples from two BAO data sources, we find that there is almost no difference between the two samples. Although the curvature values obtained from the data samples using DESI DR1 are on the slightly positive and the samples using BOSS/eBOSS are on the slightly negative, these results both report that our universe has a flat spatial curvature within uncertainties, and the precision of constraining the curvature with two BAO samples is almost equal.

 - **Abstract**
 $H_0$ tension in the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model is reevaluated by employing three sets of non-Planck CMB data, namely WMAP, WMAP+ACT, and WMAP+SPT, in conjunction with DESI BAO data and non-DESI BAO datasets including 6dFGS, SDSS DR7, and SDSS DR16. Our analysis yields $H_0 = 68.86\pm 0.68~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+DESI BAO, $H_0 = 68.72\pm 0.51~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+ACT+DESI BAO, and $H_0 = 68.62\pm 0.52~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+SPT+DESI BAO. The results of non-Planck CMB+DESI BAO exhibit a $3.4\sigma$, $3.7\sigma$, and $3.8\sigma$ tension with the SH0ES local measurement respectively which are around $1 \sigma$ lower in significance for the Hubble tension compared to Planck CMB+DESI BAO. Moreover, by combining DESI BAO data+non-Planck CMB measurements, we obtain a more stringent constraint on the Hubble constant compared to non-DESI BAO data+non-Planck CMB data, as well as reducing the significance of the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how stellar feedback from the first stars (Population III) distributes metals through the interstellar and intergalactic medium using the star-by-star cosmological hydrodynamics simulation, Aeos. We find that energy injected from the supernovae of the first stars is enough to expel a majority of gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass $M_* \lesssim 10^7$ M$_\odot$, regardless of the number of supernovae. This prevents self-enrichment and results in a non-monotonic increase in metallicity at early times. Most minihalos ($M \gtrsim 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$) do not retain significant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until they have grown to halo masses of $M \gtrsim 10^7 \, \rm M_\odot$. The loss of metals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched star formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can persist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic channels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest redshift $z=14.3$), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all elements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch winds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be important at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for early chemical enrichment which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to trace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from Population III to Population II stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\pm 40\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.

          Observing planetary gaps in the gas of debris disks

 - **Abstract**
 Recent ALMA observations discovered consequent amounts (i.e., up to a few $10^{-1}\; \rm M_\oplus$) of CO gas in debris disks that were expected to be gas-free. This gas is in general estimated to be mostly composed of CO, C, and O (i.e., $\rm H_2$-poor), unlike the gas present in protoplanetary disks ($\rm H_2$-rich). At this stage, the majority of planet formation already occurred, and giant planets might be evolving in these disks. While planets have been directly observed in debris disks (e.g., $\beta$ Pictoris), their direct observations are challenging due to the weak luminosity of the planets. In this paper, with the help of hydrodynamical simulations (with FARGO3D) coupled with a radiative transfer code (RADMC-3D) and an observing tool (CASA), we show that planet-gas interactions can produce observable substructures in this late debris disk stage. While it is tricky to observe gaps in the CO emission of protoplanetary disks, the unique properties of the gaseous debris disks allow us to observe planetary gaps in the gas. Depending on the total mass of the gaseous debris disk, kinks can also be observed. We derive a simple criterion to estimate in which conditions gaps would be observable and apply it to the known gaseous debris disk surrounding HD138813. In our framework, we find that planets as small as $0.5 \; \rm M_J$ can produce observable gaps and investigate under which conditions (i.e., gas and planets characteristics) the substructure become observable with ALMA. The first observations of planet-gas interactions in debris disks can lead to a new way to indirectly detect exoplanets, reaching a population that could not be probed before, such as giant planets that are too cold to be detected by direct imaging.

          Revisiting the BE99 method for the study of outflowing gas in protostellar jets

 - **Abstract**
 An established method measuring the hydrogen ionisation fraction in shock excited gas is the BE99 method, which utilises six bright forbidden emission lines of [SII]6716, 6731, [NII]6548, 6583, and [OI]6300, 6363. We aim to extent the BE99 method by including more emission lines in the blue and near-infrared part of the spectrum ($\lambda$ = 3500-11000A), and considering higher hydrogen ionisation fractions ($x_e > 0.3$). In addition, we investigate how a non-equilibrium state of the gas and the presence of extinction influence the BE99 technique. We find that plenty additional emission line ratios can in principle be exploited as extended curves (or stripes) in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. If the BE99 equilibrium is reached and extinction is corrected for, all stripes overlap in one location in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram indicating the existing gas parameters. The application to the Par Lup 3-4 outflow shows that the classical BE99 lines together with the [NI]5198+5200 lines do not meet in one locationin the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. This indicates that the gas parameters derived from the classical BE99 method are not fully consistent with other observed line ratios. A multi-line approach is necessary to determine the gas parameters. From our analysis we derive $n_e \sim$ 45 000 cm^-3 - 53000 cm^-3 , $T_e$ = 7600K - 8000K, and $x_e \sim$ 0.027 - 0.036 for the Par Lup 3-4 outflow. For the 244-440 Proplyd we were able to use the line ratios of [SII]6716+6731, [OI]6300+6363, and [OII]7320, 7330 in the BE99 diagram to estimate the ionisation fraction at knot E3 ($x_e = 0.58 \pm 0.05$). In conclusion, exploiting new line ratios reveals more insights on the state of the gas. Our analysis indicates, however, that a multi-line approach is more robust in deriving gas parameters, especially for high density gas.

 - **Abstract**
 A considerable number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission indicative of the presence of a binary companion. AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine their companions, making almost impossible their identification. Y Gem has been known to be a far-UV- and X-ray-bright AGB star for some decades now, but the nature of its companion, whether it is a main-sequence star or a white dwarf (WD) in a symbiotic system (SySt), is disputed. Our goal is to uncover the true nature of Y Gem to help us peer into the possible misidentified population of SySts. Multi-wavelength IR, optical, UV and X-ray observations have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in Y Gem. In particular, an optical spectrum of Y Gem is presented here for the first time, while X-ray data are interpreted by means of reflection models produced by an accretion disk and material in its vicinity. The optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to narrow recombination and forbidden emission lines. The presence of the emission lines and the analysis of the extinction-corrected UV spectrum suggest a hot component with $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$60,000 K, $L$=140 L$_{\odot}$, and $R$=0.11 R$_{\odot}$, very likely an accreting WD. The late component is found to be an 1.1 M$_\odot$ AGB star with $T_\mathrm{eff}$=3350 K and $R$=240 R$_\odot$. Using IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data, we found that Y Gem is a S-type SySt whose compact component is accreting at an estimated mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}=2.3\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At such accretion rate, the accreting WD has reached the stable and steady burning phase where no recurrent events are expected.

          Examining the evolution of the Supersoft X-ray Source RX J$0513.9-6951$

 - **Abstract**
 Supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) are thought to be accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems, with thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. The SSS RX J$0513.9-6951$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibits cyclic variations between optical low and high states, which are anti-correlated with its X-ray flux. This behaviour is believed to result from the periodic expansion and contraction of the WD due to variations in the accretion rate in the system. We analyse eight high-resolution XMM and six grating Chandra spectra of RX J$0513.9-6951$ with our grid of model atmosphere spectra of hot WDs computed under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our aim is to test a contraction model of the source variability by tracking the evolution of the WD properties. The used grid of hot WD model atmospheres spans a wide range of effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}=100-1000\,\rm kK$ in steps of $25\,\rm kK$) and eight values of surface gravity $\log g$. The LMC chemical composition was assumed. The obtained fitting parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, and bolometric luminosity $L$) evolve on the $T_{\rm eff}- \log g$ and $T_{\rm eff}- L$ planes. This evolution follows the model tracks of WDs with masses of $1.05-1.15\,M_{\odot}$ and thermonuclear burning on the surface. The analysis has showed that the optical brightness of the system is lower when the WD is larger, more luminous, and more effectively illuminates the accretion disc. These results contradict the contraction model, which predicts the opposite behaviour of the source. We use a model, that assumes that the far UV/soft X-ray flux is reprocessed into the optical band due to multiple scattering in the cloud system above the accretion disc. More significant illumination can lead to rarefying of the cloud slab, thereby reducing the reprocessing efficiency and making the source fainter in the optical band.

 - **Abstract**
 Single-frequency emission from an accretion disk around a black hole is broadened into a line profile due to gravitational redshift and the motion of the disk's particles relative to the observer. The ensemble of relativistically broadened emission frequencies from the disk elements forms the spectrum viewed by an observer. Over the past decades, the broadened spectra of accreting systems have been used to constrain the spin of the black hole, the observer's inclination, and the astrophysical model parameters of the system. These inferences are usually made under the assumption that the accretion disk consists of particles orbiting around the black hole on stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane. Under this Standard disk model, in this work, we revisit line profile morphology, i.e., its extent, kinks, and fall-off. We provide a unified analytical explanation for these line profile morphological features, which encode the black hole spin, viewing inclination, and locations of the disk's inner and outer edges. We then show that these features, however, are model-dependent, by parametrically relaxing some of the astrophysical assumptions. In particular, we explore how allowing the disk particles to deviate from stable circular orbits rapidly degenerates the characteristic features of the line profile under the Standard disk model. Our results further demonstrate how sensitive our understanding of black hole and system properties can be to assumptions we make when interpreting these types of measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The marked power spectrum - a two-point correlation function of a transformed density field - has emerged as a promising tool for extracting cosmological information from the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analytical study of the marked power spectrum's sensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) of the non-local type. We extend previous effective field theory frameworks to incorporate PNG, developing a complete theoretical model that we validate against the Quijote simulation suite. Through a systematic Fisher analysis, we compare the constraining power of the marked power spectrum against traditional approaches combining the power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We explore different choices of mark parameters to evaluate their impact on parameter constraints, particularly focusing on equilateral and orthogonal PNG as well as neutrino masses. Our analysis shows that while marking up underdense regions yields optimal constraints in the low shot-noise regime, the marked power spectrum's performance for discrete tracers with BOSS-like number densities does not surpass that of P+B analysis at mildly non-linear scales ($k \lesssim 0.25 \,h/\text{Mpc}$). However, the marked approach offers several practical advantages, including simpler estimation procedures and potentially more manageable systematic effects. Our theoretical framework reveals how the marked power spectrum incorporates higher-order correlation information through terms resembling tree-level bispectra and power spectrum convolutions. This work establishes a robust foundation for applying marked statistics to future large-volume surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Parameter inference is a crucial task in modern cosmology that requires accurate and fast computational methods to handle the high precision and volume of observational datasets. In this study, we explore a hybrid vision transformer, the Convolution vision Transformer (CvT), which combines the benefits of vision transformers and convolutional neural networks. We use this approach to infer the $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameters from simulated dark matter and halo fields. Our experiments indicate that the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ obtained using CvT are better than the traditional vision transformer (ViT) and CNN, using either dark matter or halo fields. For CvT, pretraining on dark matter fields proves advantageous for improving constraints using halo fields compared to training a model from the beginning. However, ViT and CNN do not show these benefits. The CvT is more efficient than ViT since, despite having more parameters, it requires a training time similar to that of ViT and has similar inference times.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal radiation of neutron stars in soft X-ray transients (SXTs) in a quiescent state is believed to be powered by the heat deposited in the stellar crust due to nuclear reactions during accretion. Confronting observations of this radiation with simulations helps to verify theoretical models of the dense matter in neutron stars. We simulate the thermal evolution of the SXTs with theoretical models of the equation of state and composition of the accreted crust. The new family of such models were recently developed within a thermodynamically consistent approach by modeling the nuclear evolution of an accreted matter as it sinks toward the stellar center, starting from representative thermonuclear ash compositions. The crust cooling curves computed with the traditional and modern theory are compared with observations of SXTs MXB 1659-29 and IGR J17480-2446. We show that the new and traditional models of the accreted neutron star crusts are similar in their capability to explain the thermal evolution of neutron stars in SXTs. Both kinds of models require inclusion of additional ingredients not supplied by the current theory, such as the shallow heating and variation of thermal conductivity, to fit observations.

          Combining summary statistics with simulation-based inference for the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization will be observed with the up-coming Square Kilometer Array (SKA). SKA should yield a full tomography of the signal which opens the possibility to explore its non-Gaussian properties. How can we extract the maximum information from the tomography and derive the tightest constraint on the signal? In this work, instead of looking for the most informative summary statistics, we investigate how to combine the information from two sets of summary statistics using simulation-based inference. To this purpose, we train Neural Density Estimators (NDE) to fit the implicit likelihood of our model, the LICORICE code, using the Loreli II database. We train three different NDEs: one to perform Bayesian inference on the power spectrum, one to do it on the linear moments of the Pixel Distribution Function (PDF) and one to work with the combination of the two. We perform $\sim 900$ inferences at different points in our parameter space and use them to assess both the validity of our posteriors with Simulation-based Calibration (SBC) and the typical gain obtained by combining summary statistics. We find that our posteriors are biased by no more than $\sim 20 \%$ of their standard deviation and under-confident by no more than $\sim 15 \%$. Then, we establish that combining summary statistics produces a contraction of the 4-D volume of the posterior (derived from the generalized variance) in 91.5 % of our cases, and in 70 to 80 % of the cases for the marginalized 1-D posteriors. The median volume variation is a contraction of a factor of a few for the 4D posteriors and a contraction of 20 to 30 % in the case of the marginalized 1D posteriors. This shows that our approach is a possible alternative to looking for sufficient statistics in the theoretical sense.
