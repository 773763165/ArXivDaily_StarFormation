#### Variation of the high-mass slope of the stellar initial mass function:  Theory meets observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence of the correlation between the high-mass slope of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in young star clusters and their stellar surface density, $\sigma_{*}$. When the high-mass end of the IMF is described by a power law of the form $dN/d{\rm log}{M_{*}}\propto M_{*}^{-\Gamma}$, the value of $\Gamma$ is seen to weakly decrease with increasing $\sigma_{*}$, following a $\Gamma=1.31~\sigma_{*}^{-0.095}$ relation. We also present a model that can explain these observations. The model is based on the idea that the coalescence of protostellar cores in a protocluster forming clump is more efficient in high density environments where cores are more closely packed. The efficiency of the coalescence process is calculated as a function of the parental clump properties and in particular the relation between its mass and radius as well as its core formation efficiency. The main result of this model is that the increased efficiency of the coalescence process leads to shallower slopes of the IMF in agreement with the observations of young clusters, and the observations are best reproduced with compact protocluster forming clumps. These results have significant implications for the shape of the IMF in different Galactic and extragalactic environments and have very important consequences for galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work on the characterization of small exoplanets has allowed us to accumulate growing evidence that the sub-Neptunes with radii greater than $\sim2.5\,R_\oplus$ often host H$_2$/He-dominated atmospheres both from measurements of their low bulk densities and direct detections of their low mean-molecular-mass atmospheres. However, the smaller sub-Neptunes in the 1.5-2.2 R$_\oplus$ size regime are much less understood, and often have bulk densities that can be explained either by the H$_2$/He-rich scenario, or by a volatile-dominated composition known as the "water world" scenario. Here, we report the detection of water vapor in the transmission spectrum of the $1.96\pm0.08$ R$_\oplus$ sub-Neptune GJ9827d obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We observed 11 HST/WFC3 transits of GJ9827d and find an absorption feature at 1.4$\mu$m in its transit spectrum, which is best explained (at 3.39$\sigma$) by the presence of water in GJ9827d's atmosphere. We further show that this feature cannot be caused by unnoculted star spots during the transits by combining an analysis of the K2 photometry and transit light-source effect retrievals. We reveal that the water absorption feature can be similarly well explained by a small amount of water vapor in a cloudy H$_2$/He atmosphere, or by a water vapor envelope on GJ9827d. Given that recent studies have inferred an important mass-loss rate ($>0.5\,$M$_\oplus$/Gyr) for GJ9827d making it unlikely to retain a H-dominated envelope, our findings highlight GJ9827d as a promising water world candidate that could host a volatile-dominated atmosphere. This water detection also makes GJ9827d the smallest exoplanet with an atmospheric molecular detection to date.
#### Young nearby open clusters and their luminosity functions

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Open clusters are groups of coeval stars sharing properties such as distance and metallicity, and they are key to understanding stellar evolution. Aims. Our main goal is to study the evolution of open clusters with a special focus on the universality of the luminosity function. Methods. We applied an upgraded version of the convergent point technique on about 50 open clusters. The selection of cluster members was based purely on the exquisite astrometry of the Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos catalogues in the five-dimensional or full six-dimensional space. Results. We present updated lists of bona fide members of ~50 open clusters within 500 pc and younger than 1 Gyr, exploiting the full depth of the third Gaia data release complemented by Hipparcos at the bright end, excluding regions in the Galactic plane. Our catalogues also are complemented by optical and infrared photometry from the major large-scale public surveys. All the data will be made available on a dedicated webpage with interactive plots and a direct link to Aladin and Vizier hosted at the Centre de Donn\'ees de Strasbourg. We derived luminosity functions for all bound clusters and compared them in three age groups of ~50 Myr, ~150 Myr, and ~600 Myr, discussing similarities and differences to constrain their dynamical evolution. Conclusions. Luminosity functions of clusters at 50 Myr are more likely similar to each other and show a greater degree of similarity than older clusters. We explain this observation with the universal luminosity function within the volume of our sample (500 pc). Luminosity functions of clusters with ages similar to the Pleiades or Hyades are more diverse, perhaps due to internal dynamical evolution, but more work is needed to provide additional evidence.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) provides a unique testing ground for connecting fundamental physics to astronomical observations. Modelling the LSS requires numerical $N$-body simulations or perturbative techniques that both come with distinct shortcomings. Here we present the first unified numerical approach, enabled by new time integration and discreteness reduction schemes, and demonstrate its convergence at the field level. In particular, we show that our simulations (1) can be initialised directly at time zero, and (2) can be made to agree with high-order Lagrangian perturbation theory in the fluid limit. This allows fast, self-consistent, and UV-complete forward modelling of LSS observables.

 - **Abstract**
 de Grijs and Bono compiled 211 independent measurements of the distance to galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster from 15 different tracers and reported the arithmetic mean of a subset of this compilation as the best estimate of the distance. We compute three different central estimates -- the arithmetic mean, weighted mean, and the median -- and corresponding statistical uncertainty for the full data set as well as two sub-compilations. We find that for all three central estimates the error distributions show that the data sets are significantly non-Gaussian. As a result, we conclude that that the median is the most reliable of the three central estimates, as median statistics does not assume Gaussianity. We use median statistics to determine the systematic error on the distance by analyzing the scatter in the 15 tracer subgroup distances. From the 211 distance measurements, we recommend a summary M87 distance modulus of $31.08^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ (statistical) ${}^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ (systematic) mag, or combining the two errors in quadrature $31.08^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ mag, rounded to $16.4^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ Mpc, all at $68.27\%$ significance.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planet migration appears widespread among planetary systems in our Galaxy. However, the timescales of this process, which reflect the underlying dynamical mechanisms, are not well constrained, even within the solar system. Since planetary migration scatters smaller bodies onto intersecting orbits, it would have resulted in an epoch of enhanced bombardment in the solar system's asteroid belt. To accurately and precisely quantify the timescales of migration, we interrogate thermochronologic data from asteroidal meteorites, which record the thermal imprint of energetic collisions. We present a database of 40K-40Ar system ages from chondrite meteorites and evaluate it with an asteroid-scale thermal code coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion. Simulations require bombardment in order to reproduce the observed age distribution and identify a bombardment event beginning ~11 million years after the Sun formed. Our results associate a giant planet instability in our solar system with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of a planet's atmosphere depends strongly on its host star's properties. When their host stars are younger, planets can experience stronger winds and EUV emissions. This is particularly true for planets orbiting M-dwarfs due to their close proximity to the host star. To determine if these planets retain an atmosphere, we consider the impacts from stellar wind and EUV fluxes in driving atmospheric escape throughout the planet's lifetime. For this, we determined the atmospheric mass loss due to stellar wind and photoevaporation on 4 planets in close orbit and 34 in their star's habitable zone (HZ). The M-dwarf host stars' wind velocity, density, and EUV flux were calculated through rotation period and X-ray flux scaling over time. The mass loss rate due to stellar wind and photoevaporation was then computed as a function of time and accumulated throughout the planet's age to determine the total atmospheric mass loss of the planet's initial H/He envelope. We find that for HZ planets at orbits $<$ 0.1 AU, stellar wind can only remove $\leq 1\%$ of the H/He envelope, while photoevaporation is essential for completely removing the H/He envelope of most targets. Moreover, due to either mechanism, most planets orbiting at $>$ 0.1 AU do not have their primordial envelope stripped. Overall, out of the 38 planets studied, 13 were predicted to have lost the primordial envelope due to photoevaporation, while 2 planets lost the envelope due to both stellar wind and photoevaporation.
#### Temporal and Spectral Analysis of 1ES 2344+514 in Two Flaring States  Observed by VERITAS

 - **Abstract**
 VERITAS observed the bright blazar 1ES 2344+514 during two flaring periods, one from Dec. 17 to Dec. 18, 2015 (MJD 57373-57374) with a peak flux of ~60% of the Crab and another from Nov. 28 to Dec. 3, 2021 (MJD 59546-59551) with a peak flux of ~20% of the Crab. This blazar, located at a redshift of z = 0.044, is classified as an extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object (HBL). It is known to be variable, including several previous day-scale flares: Whipple on Dec. 20, 1995, VERITAS on Dec. 7, 2007, and MAGIC on Aug. 11, 2016. The VERITAS near-nightly monitoring of 1ES 2344+514 during the 2015-2016 and 2021-2022 seasons provides good coverage of the pre- and post-flare flux as well as the rise/fall time of the flares. We present the multiwavelength light curves of each flare as well as the very high-energy spectra in the two flare states and the two pre-flare states.
#### Statistical analysis of the gravitational anomaly in {\it Gaia} wide  binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of the low acceleration $a<a_{0}$ regime, where $a_{0}=1.2 \times 10^{-10}$m s$^{-1}$ is the acceleration scale of MOND around which gravitational anomalies at galactic scale appear, has recently been extended to the much smaller mass and length scales of local wide binaries thanks to the availability of the {\it Gaia} catalogue. Statistical methods to test the underlying structure of gravity using large samples of such binary stars and dealing with the necessary presence of kinematic contaminants in such samples have also been presented. However, an alternative approach using binary samples carefully selected to avoid any such contaminants, and consequently much smaller samples, has been lacking a formal statistical development. In the interest of having independent high quality checks on the results of wide binary gravity tests, we here develop a formal statistical framework for treating small, clean, wide binary samples in the context of testing modifications to gravity of the form $G \to \gamma G$. The method is validated through extensive tests with synthetic data samples, and applied to recent {\it Gaia} DR3 binary star observational samples of relative velocities and internal separations on the plane of the sky, $v_{2D}$ and $r_{2D}$, respectively. Our final results for a high acceleration $r_{2D}<0.01$pc region are of $\gamma=1.000 \pm 0.096$, in full accordance with Newtonian expectations. For a low acceleration $r_{2D}>0.01$pc region however, we obtain $\gamma=1.512 \pm 0.199$, inconsistent with the Newtonian value of $\gamma=1$ at a $2.6 \sigma$ level, and much more indicative of MOND AQUAL predictions of close to $\gamma=1.4$.
#### A Gigantic Mid-Infrared Outburst in an Embedded Class-I Young Stellar  Object J064722.95+031644.6

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a giant mid-infrared (MIR) outburst from a previously unknown source near a star-forming region in the constellation Monoceros. The source gradually brightened by a factor of 5 from 2014 to 2016 before an abrupt rise by a factor of more than 100 in 2017. A total amplitude increase of >500 at 4.5 microns has since faded by a factor of about 10. Prior to the outburst, it was only detected at wavelengths longer than 1.8 microns in UKIDSS, Spitzer, and Herschel with a spectral energy distribution of a Class I Young Stellar Object (YSO). It has not been detected in recent optical surveys, suggesting that it is deeply embedded. With a minimum distance of 3.5 kpc, the source has a bolometric luminosity of at least 9 $L_\odot$ in the quiescent state and 400 $L_\odot$ at the peak of the eruption. The maximum accretion rate is estimated to be at least a few $10^{-5}$ $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$. It shares several common properties with another eruptive event, WISE~J142238.82-611553.7: exceptionally large amplitude, featureless near-infrared spectrum with the exception of H_2 lines, intermediate eruption duration, an embedded Class I YSO, and a low radiative temperature (<600-700 K) in outburst. We interpret that the radiation from the inner accretion disk and young star is obscured and reprocessed by either an inflated outer disk or thick dusty outflow on scales > 6.5 AU during the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Negative superhumps (NSHs) are signals a few percent shorter than the orbital period of a binary star and are considered to originate from the reverse precession of the tilted disk. Based on TESS photometry, we find nine new cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) with NSHs. Three (ASAS J1420, TZ Per, and V392 Hya) of these stars similar to AH Her still have NSHs during dwarf nova outbursts, and the NSH amplitude varies with the outburst. The variation in the radius of the accretion disk partially explains this phenomenon. However, it does not explain the rebound of the NSH amplitude after the peak of the outburst and the fact that the NSH amplitude of the quiescence is sometimes not the largest, and it is necessary to combine the disk instability model (DIM) and add other ingredients. Therefore, we suggest that the variation of NSH amplitude with outburst can be an essential basis for studying the origin of NSHs and improving the DIM. The six ( ASASSN-V J1137, ASASSN-V J0611, 2MASS J0715, LAMOST J0925, ASASSN-17qj, and ZTF18acakuxo) remaining stars have been poorly studied, and for the first time we determine their orbital periods, NSHs and Superorbital signal (SOR) periods. The NSH periods and amplitudes of ASASSN-V J1137 and ASASSN-17qj vary with the SOR, and based on the comparison of the observations with the theory, we suggest that a single change in tilted disk angle does not explain the observations of the SOR and that other ingredients need to be considered as well.
#### The development of HISPEC for Keck and MODHIS for TMT: science cases and  predicted sensitivities

 - **Abstract**
 HISPEC is a new, high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph being designed for the W.M. Keck II telescope. By offering single-shot, R=100,000 between 0.98 - 2.5 um, HISPEC will enable spectroscopy of transiting and non-transiting exoplanets in close orbits, direct high-contrast detection and spectroscopy of spatially separated substellar companions, and exoplanet dynamical mass and orbit measurements using precision radial velocity monitoring calibrated with a suite of state-of-the-art absolute and relative wavelength references. MODHIS is the counterpart to HISPEC for the Thirty Meter Telescope and is being developed in parallel with similar scientific goals. In this proceeding, we provide a brief overview of the current design of both instruments, and the requirements for the two spectrographs as guided by the scientific goals for each. We then outline the current science case for HISPEC and MODHIS, with focuses on the science enabled for exoplanet discovery and characterization. We also provide updated sensitivity curves for both instruments, in terms of both signal-to-noise ratio and predicted radial velocity precision.
#### Optimal map-making with singularities

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the optimal map-making technique for the linear system $\bm{d}=\bm{A}\bm{x}+\bm{n}$ while carefully taking into account singularities that may come from either the covariance matrix $\bm{C} = \<\bm{n}\bm{n}^t\>$ or the main matrix $\bm{A}$. We first describe the general optimal solution, which is quite complex, and then use the modified pseudo inverse to create a near-optimal solution, which is simple, robust, and can significantly alleviate the unwanted noise amplification during map-making. The effectiveness of the nearly optimal solution is then compared to that of the naive co-adding solution and the standard pseudo inverse solution, showing noticeable improvements. Interestingly, all one needs to get the near-optimal solution with singularity is just a tiny change to the traditional optimal solution that is designed for the case without singularity.
#### X-ray - cosmic shear cross-correlations: first detection and constraints  on baryonic effects

 - **Abstract**
 We report a first detection, at very high significance ($25\sigma$), of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and the diffuse X-ray background, using data from the Dark Energy Survey and the ROSAT satellite. The X-ray cross-correlation signal is sensitive to the distribution of the surrounding gas in dark matter haloes. This allows us to use our measurements to place constraints on key physical parameters that determine the impact of baryonic effects in the matter power spectrum. In particular, we determine the mass of haloes in which feedback has expelled half of their gas content on average to be $\log_{10}(M_c/M_\odot)=13.643^{+0.081}_{-0.12}$, and the polytropic index of the gas to be $\Gamma = 1.231^{+0.015}_{-0.011}$. This represents a first step in the direct use of X-ray cross-correlations to obtain improved constraints on cosmology and the physics of the intergalactic gas.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of five ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with central object likely being a black hole, using archival {\it XMM-Newton} observations. These sources, namely NGC 1313 X-1, NGC 5408 X-1, NGC 6946 X-1, M82 X-1 and IC 342 X-1, reveal short-term variability with fractional variance of $1.42-27.28\%$ and exhibit QPOs with frequency $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 8-667$ mHz. Long-term evolution of ULXs energy spectra ($0.3 - 10$ keV; excluding M82 X$-$1) are described satisfactorily with a model combination that comprises a thermal Comptonization component (\texttt{nthComp}, yielding $\Gamma_{\rm nth} \sim 1.48 - 2.65$, $kT_{\rm e} \sim 1.62 - 3.76$ keV, $\tau \sim 8 - 20$, y-par $\sim 1.16 - 6.24$) along with a standard disc component (\texttt{diskbb}, $kT_{\rm in} \sim 0.16 - 0.54$ keV). We find that these ULXs generally demonstrate anti-correlation between disc luminosity and inner disc temperature as $L_{\rm disc} \propto T_{\rm in}^\alpha$, where $\alpha = - 3.58 \pm 0.04$ for NGC 1313 X-1 and IC 342 X-1, $\alpha = - 8.93 \pm 0.11$ for NGC 6946 X-1, and $\alpha = - 10.31 \pm 0.10$ for NGC 5408 X-1. We also obtain a linear correlation between bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm nth}$ that indicates spectral softening of the sources when $L_{\rm bol}$ increases. We observe that in presence of QPO, Comptonized seed photon fraction varies in between $\sim 5 - 20 \%$, while the Comptonized flux contribution ($50 - 90\%$) dominates over disc flux. Utilizing $\nu_{\rm QPO}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$, we constrain ULXs mass by varying their spin ($a_{\rm k}$) and accretion rate ($\dot m$). We find that NGC 6946 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1 seem to accrete at sub-Eddington accretion rate provided their central sources are rapidly rotating, whereas IC 342 X-1 and NGC 1313 X-1 can accrete in sub/super-Eddington limit irrespective to their spin values.

 - **Abstract**
 Hard X-/soft Gamma-ray astronomy (> 100 keV) is a crucial field for the study of important astrophysical phenomena such as the 511 keV positron annihilation line in the Galactic center region and its origin, gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, nuclear lines from SN explosions and more. However, several key questions in this field require sensitivity and angular resolution that are hardly achievable with present technology. A new generation of instruments suitable to focus hard X-/soft Gamma-rays is necessary to overcome the technological limitations of current direct-viewing telescopes. One solution is using Laue lenses based on Bragg's diffraction in a transmission configuration. To date, this technology is in an advanced stage of development and further efforts are being made in order to significantly increase its technology readiness level (TRL). To this end, massive production of suitable crystals is required, as well as an improvement of the capability of their alignment. Such a technological improvement could be exploited in stratospheric balloon experiments and, ultimately, in space missions with a telescope of about 20 m focal length, capable of focusing over a broad energy pass-band. We present the latest technological developments of the TRILL (Technological Readiness Increase for Laue Lenses) project, supported by ASI, devoted to the advancement of the technological readiness of Laue lenses. We show the method we developed for preparing suitable bent Germanium and Silicon crystals and the latest advancements in crystals alignment technology.

 - **Abstract**
 A new detection system for X-/Gamma-ray broad energy passband detectors for astronomy has been developed. This system is based on Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) coupled with scintillator bars; the SDDs act as a direct detector of soft (<30 keV) X-ray photons, while hard X-/Gamma-rays are stopped by the scintillator bars and the scintillation light is collected by the SDDs. With this configuration, it is possible to build compact, position sensitive detectors with unprecedented energy passband (2 keV - 10/20 MeV). The X and Gamma-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XGIS) on board the THESEUS mission, selected for Phase 0 study for M7, exploits this innovative detection system. The Wide Field Monitor - Imager and Spectrometer (WFM-IS) of the ASTENA (Advanced Surveyor of Transient Events and Nuclear Astrophysics) mission concept consists of 12 independent detection units, also based on this new technology. For the WFM-IS, a coded mask provides imaging capabilities up to 150 keV, while above this limit the instrument will act as a full sky spectrometer. However, it is possible to extend imaging capabilities above this limit by alternatively exploiting the Compton kinematics reconstruction or by using the information from the relative fluxes measured by the different cameras. In this work, we present the instrument design and results from MEGAlib simulations aimed at evaluating the effective area and the imaging performances of the WFM-IS above 150 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 Shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical sources, many of which involve relativistic bulk motions, leading to the formation of relativistic shocks. Such relativistic shocks have so far been studied mainly in one dimension, for simplicity, but the complex nature of the relevant astrophysical flows often requires higher dimensional studies. Here we study the two-dimensional problem of the reflection of a planer shock off of a wall for a general incidence angle and a cold unshocked medium. We use primarily relativistic hydrodynamic numerical simulations, and elaborately compare the results to an analytic treatment. The simulations are performed both in the rest frame S of the unshocked fluid, where the dimensionless proper speed of the singly shocked fluid is $u_1=\Gamma_1\beta_1$ and the shock incidence angle is $\alpha_1$, and in the rest frame S$^\prime$ of the point P of intersection of the incident shock and the wall for regular reflection (RR). Good agreement is obtained between the simulations in these two frames and with the analytic solution. The establishment of a steady flow in frame S$^\prime$ is explored, along with the transition between the strong and weak shock RR solutions. The transition line between RR and Mach reflection (MR) is studied numerically in the $u_1$-$\alpha_1$ plane and found to coincide with the analytic detachment/sonic line. The flow properties along the sonic line are investigated in detail focusing on how they vary between the Newtonian and relativistic limits.

 - **Abstract**
 Small metal-containing molecules have been detected and recognized as one of the hybrid species efficiently formed in space; especially in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. It has been predicted also that more complex hybrid species like those formed by metals and fullerenes (metallofullerenes) could be present in such circumstellar environments. Recently, quantum-chemical simulations of metallofullerenes have shown that they are potential emitters contributing to the observed mid-IR spectra in the fullerene-rich circumstellar environments of different types of evolved stars. Here we present the individual simulated mid-IR (~5-50 um) spectra of twenty-eight metallofullerene species; both neutral and charged endo- and exohedral metallofullerenes for seven different metals (Li, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Ti, and Fe) have been considered. The changes induced by the metal-C60 interaction on the intensity and position of the spectral features are highlighted using charge density difference maps and electron density partitioning. Our calculations identify the fundamental IR spectral regions where, depending on the metal binding nature, there should be a major spectral contribution from each of the metallofullerenes. The metallofullerenes IR spectra are made publicly available to the astronomical community, especially James Webb Space Telescope users, for comparisons that could eventually lead to the detection of these species in space.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate cosmological consequences of a generalized early dark energy (EDE) model where a scalar field behaves as dark energy at various cosmological epochs for a broad range of parameters such as the energy scale and the initial field value. We consider power-law and axion-type potentials for such an EDE field and study how it affects the cosmological evolution. We show that gravitational wave background can be significantly enhanced to be detected in future observations such as LISA and DECIGO in some parameter space. Implications of the EDE model are also discussed for a scenario where a blue-tilted inflationary tensor power spectrum can explain the recent NANOGrav 15-year signal. We argue that the bounds on the reheating temperature can be relaxed compared to the case of the standard thermal history.
#### Relativistic Shock Reflection using Integral Conservation Laws

 - **Abstract**
 The reflection of shock waves from a wall or other obstacles has been extensively studied in the Newtonian limit. In this limit the flow can always be analysed in a frame $S'$ where it is in steady state, which greatly simplifies the problem. Consider a planar incident shock front moving at a velocity $v_{s1}$ along its normal and making an angle $\alpha_1$ relative to a planar reflecting wall, in the lab frame $S$ where the unshocked fluid is at rest. The point $P$ of its intersection with the wall moves along the wall at a velocity $v_p=v_{s1}/\sin\alpha_1$, and a boost along the wall at $v_p$ transforms to the steady-state rest frame $S'$. However, there is a "super-luminal" regime where $v_p>c$ and therefore such a steady-state rest frame does not exist (as well as in the limiting case $v_p=c$). In the Newtonian regime it corresponds to very small incidence angles, $\alpha_1\approx\sin\alpha_1<\beta_{s1}=v_{s1}/c\ll1$, and is therefore usually ignored. However, in the relativistic regime (where $\Gamma_{s1}=(1-\beta_{s1}^2)^{-1/2}\gg1$), which is of interest in astrophysics, it corresponds to almost all incidence angles, $\tan\alpha_1<\Gamma_{s1}\beta_{s1}\approx\Gamma_{s1}$. Therefore, a new approach is needed to solve this problem. We formulate the integral conservation laws in the lab frame $S$ for the case of regular reflection (RR), either a. for a fixed volume, or b. for a fixed fluid, showing the equivalence between them and with the steady-state oblique shock jump conditions in frame $S'$ in the sub-luminal regime ($v_p<c$). Using this formalism we find that both the weak and strong shock RR solutions are bounded by the detachment line on the higher incidence angles side, while the strong shock solution is also bounded by the luminal line on the lower incidence angles side, and exists only between these two critical lines, in the sub-luminal attachment region.

 - **Abstract**
 The next-generation ground-based gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will consist of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) of three different sizes distributed in two sites. The Large-Sized Telescopes will cover the low-energy end of the CTA energy range, starting at about 20 GeV. After its first years of operation at the CTA northern site, the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) is in the final stage of its commissioning phase, having collected a significant amount of scientific data to date. In this contribution, we present the physics performance of the telescope using low-zenith Crab Nebula observations and Monte Carlo simulations fine-tuned accordingly. We show performance figures of merit such as the energy threshold, effective area, energy and angular resolution, and sensitivity based on the standard Hillas-parameters approach and following the source-independent and dependent analysis methods. The analysis threshold is estimated at 30 GeV. The energy resolution is around 30%, and the angular resolution is 0.3 degrees at 100 GeV. The best integral sensitivity of LST-1 is about 1.1% of the Crab Nebula flux above 250 GeV for 50 hours of observations. We also show the spectral energy distribution and light curve from Crab Nebula observations, which agree with results from other IACTs and link smoothly with Fermi-LAT when considering statistical and systematic uncertainties near the energy threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possible anisotropy of the universe using the most up-to-date type Ia supernovae, i.e. the Pantheon+ compilation. We fit the full Pantheon+ data with the dipole-modulated $\Lambda$CDM model, and find that it is well consistent with a null dipole. We further divide the full sample into several subsamples with different high-redshift cutoff $z_c$. It is shown that the dipole appears at $2\sigma$ confidence level only if $z_c\leq 0.1$, and in this redshift region the dipole is very stable, almost independent of the specific value of $z_c$. For $z_c=0.1$, the dipole amplitude is $D=1.0_{-0.4}^{+0.4}\times 10^{-3}$, pointing towards $(l,b)=(334.5_{\ -21.6^{\circ}}^{\circ +25.7^{\circ}},16.0_{\ -16.8^{\circ}}^{\circ +27.1^{\circ}})$, which is about $65^{\circ}$ away from the CMB dipole. This implies that the full Pantheon+ is consistent with a large-scale isotropic universe, but the low-redshift anisotropy couldn't be purely explained by the peculiar motion of the local universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the distance sum rule (DSR) method to constrain the spatial curvature of the Universe with a large sample of 161 strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems, whose distances are calibrated from the Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using deep learning. To investigate the possible influence of mass model of the lens galaxy on constraining the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, we consider three different lens models. Results show that a flat Universe is supported in the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model with the parameter $\Omega_k=0.049^{+0.147}_{-0.125}$. While in the power-law (PL) model, a closed Universe is preferred at $\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level, with the parameter $\Omega_k=-0.245^{+0.075}_{-0.071}$. In extended power-law (EPL) model, the 95$\%$ confidence level upper limit of $\Omega_k$ is $<0.011$. As for the parameters of the lens models, constrains on the three models indicate that the mass profile of the lens galaxy could not be simply described by the standard SIS model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next-generation observatory in the field of very-high-energy (20 GeV to 300 TeV) gamma-ray astroparticle physics. The traditional approach to data analysis in this field is to apply quality cuts, optimized using Monte Carlo simulations, on the data acquired to maximize sensitivity. Subsequent steps of the analysis typically use the surviving events to calculate one set of instrument response functions (IRFs) to physically interpret the results. However, an alternative approach is the use of event types, as implemented in experiments such as the Fermi-LAT. This approach divides events into sub-samples based on their reconstruction quality, and a set of IRFs is calculated for each sub-sample. The sub-samples are then combined in a joint analysis, treating them as independent observations. In previous works we demonstrated that event types, classified using Machine Learning methods according to their expected angular reconstruction quality, have the potential to significantly improve the CTA angular and energy resolution of a point-like source analysis. Now, we validated the production of event-type wise full-enclosure IRFs, ready to be used with science tools (such as Gammapy and ctools). We will report on the impact of using such an event-type classification on CTA high-level performance, compared to the traditional procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last years there has been a substantial increase in the number of the reported massive and luminous star-forming regions with related explosive outflows thanks to the superb sensitivity and angular resolution provided by the new radio, infrared, and optical facilities. Here, we report one more explosive outflow related with the massive and bright star-forming region IRAS 12326$-$6245 using Band 6 sensitive and high angular resolution ($\sim$0.2$"$) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We find over 10 molecular and collimated well-defined streamers, with Hubble-Lemaitre like expansion motions, and pointing right to the center of a dusty and molecular shell (reported for the first time here) localized in the northern part of the UCHII region known as G301.1A. The estimated kinematic age, and energy for the explosion are $\sim$700 yrs, and 10$^{48}$ erg, respectively. Taking into account the recently reported explosive outflows together with IRAS 12326$-$6245, we estimate an event rate of once every 90 yr in our Galaxy, similar to the formation rate of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a hot Jupiter on a 3.28-day orbit around a 1.08 M$_{Sun}$ G0 star that is the secondary component in a loose binary system. Based on follow-up radial velocity observations of TOI-858 B with CORALIE on the Swiss 1.2 m telescope and CHIRON on the 1.5 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), we measured the planet mass to be $1.10\pm 0.08$ M$_{J}$ . Two transits were further observed with CORALIE to determine the alignment of TOI-858 B b with respect to its host star. Analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal from the planet shows that the sky-projected obliquity is $\lambda = 99.3\pm 3.8$. Numerical simulations show that the neighbour star TOI-858 A is too distant to have trapped the planet in a Kozai-Lidov resonance, suggesting a different dynamical evolution or a primordial origin to explain this misalignment. The 1.15 Msun primary F9 star of the system (TYC 8501-01597-1, at $\rho$ ~11") was also observed with CORALIE in order to provide upper limits for the presence of a planetary companion orbiting that star.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) recently detected by the PTA collaborations could be the gravitational waves (GWs) induced by curvature perturbations. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) might be overproduced if the SGWB is explained by the GWs induced by the curvature perturbations that follow the Gaussian distribution. This motivates models associated with the non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbations that suppress the PBH production rate. In this work, we show that the axion curvaton model can produce the curvature perturbations that induce GWs for the detected SGWB while preventing the PBH overproduction with the non-Gaussianity.

 - **Abstract**
 After the initial suggestion by Zahnle and Walker (1987) that the torque accelerating the spin rate of the Earth and produced by the heating of the atmosphere by the Sun could counteract the braking lunir-solar gravitational torque in the Precambrian, several authors have recently revisited this hypothesis. In these studies, it is argued that the geological evidences of the past spin state of the Earth play in favor of this atmospheric tidal locking of the length of the day (LOD). In the present review of the recent literature, we show that the drawn conclusions depend crucially on the consideration of the stromatolite geological LOD estimates obtained by Pannella at 1.88 and 2.0 Ga, which are subject to large uncertainties. When only the most robust cyclostatigraphic estimates of the LOD are retained, the LOD locking hypothesis is not supported. Moreover, the consideration of the published General Circulation Model numerical simulations and of new analytical models for the thermal atmospheric tides suggest that the atmospheric tidal resonance, which is the crucial ingredient for the LOD locking in the Precambrian, was never of sufficiently large amplitude to allow for this tidal LOD lock.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-detection of a coma surrounding 1I/`Oumuamua, the first discovered interstellar object (ISO), has prompted a variety of hypotheses to explain its nongravitational acceleration. Given that forthcoming surveys are poised to identify analogues of this enigmatic object, it is prudent to devise alternative approaches to characterization. In this study, we posit X-ray spectroscopy as a surprisingly effective probe of volatile ISO compositions. Heavily ionized metals in the solar wind interact with outgassed neutrals and emit high-energy photons in a process known as charge exchange, and charge exchange induced X-rays from comets and planetary bodies have been observed extensively in our Solar System. We develop a model to predict the X-ray flux of an ISO based on its chemical inventory and ephemeris. We find that while standard cometary constituents, such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and dust are best probed via optical or infrared observations, we predict strong X-ray emission generated by charge exchange with extended comae of H$_2$ and N$_2$ -- species which lack strong infrared fluorescence transitions. We find that XMM-Newton would have been sensitive to charge exchange emission from 1I/`Oumuamua during the object's close approach to Earth, and that constraints on composition may have been feasible. We argue for follow-up X-ray observations of newly discovered ISOs with close-in perihelia. Compositional constraints on the general ISO population could reconcile the apparently self-conflicting nature of 1I/`Oumuamua, and provide insight into the earliest stages of planet formation in extrasolar systems.
#### First detection of CO$_2$ emission in a Centaur: JWST NIRSpec  observations of 39P/Oterma

 - **Abstract**
 Centaurs are minor solar system bodies with orbits transitioning between those of Trans-Neptunian Scattered Disk objects and Jupiter Family comets. 39P/Oterma is a frequently active Centaur that has recently held both Centaur and JFC classifications and was observed with the JWST NIRSpec instrument on 2022 July 27 UTC while it was 5.82 au from the Sun. For the first time, CO$_2$ gas emission was detected in a Centaur, with a production rate of Q$_{CO_2}$ = (5.96 $\pm$ 0.80) $\times$ 10$^{23}$ molecules s$^{-1}$. This is the lowest detection of CO$_2$ of any Centaur or comet. CO and H$_2$O were not detected down to constraining upper limits. Derived mixing ratios of Q$_{CO}$/Q$_{CO_2}$ $\leq$2.03 and Q$_{CO_2}$/Q$_{H_2O}$ $\geq$0.60 are consistent with CO$_2$ and/or CO outgassing playing large roles in driving the activity, but not water, and show a significant difference between the coma abundances of 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, another Centaur at a similar heliocentric distance, which may be explained by thermal processing of 39P's surface during its previous Jupiter-family comet orbit. To help contextualize the JWST data we also acquired visible CCD imaging data on two dates in July (Gemini North) and September (Lowell Discovery Telescope) 2022. Image analysis and photometry based on these data are consistent with a point source detection and an estimated effective nucleus radius of 39P in the range of $R_{nuc}= $2.21 to 2.49~km.

 - **Abstract**
 An intriguing pattern among exoplanets is the lack of detected planets between approximately $1.5$ R$_\oplus$ and $2.0$ R$_\oplus$. One proposed explanation for this "radius gap" is the photoevaporation of planetary atmospheres, a theory that can be tested by studying individual planetary systems. Kepler-105 is an ideal system for such testing due to the ordering and sizes of its planets. Kepler-105 is a sun-like star that hosts two planets straddling the radius gap in a rare architecture with the larger planet closer to the host star ($R_b = 2.53\pm0.07$ R$_\oplus$, $P_b = 5.41$ days, $R_c = 1.44\pm0.04$ R$_\oplus$, $P_c = 7.13$ days). If photoevaporation sculpted the atmospheres of these planets, then Kepler-105b would need to be much more massive than Kepler-105c to retain its atmosphere, given its closer proximity to the host star. To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously analyzed radial velocities (RVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs) of the Kepler-105 system, measuring disparate masses of $M_b = 10.8\pm2.3$ M$_\oplus$ ($ \rho_b = 0.97\pm0.22$ g cm$^{-3}$) and $M_c = 5.6\pm1.2$ M$_\oplus $ ($\rho_c = 2.64\pm0.61$ g cm$^{-3}$). Based on these masses, the difference in gas envelope content of the Kepler-105 planets could be entirely due to photoevaporation (in 76\% of scenarios), although other mechanisms like core-powered mass loss could have played a role for some planet albedos.

 - **Abstract**
 Expansions in the oscillation modes of tidally perturbed bodies provide a useful framework for representing tidally induced flows. However, recent work has demonstrated that such expansions produce inaccurate predictions for secular orbital evolution when mode damping rates are computed independently. We explore the coupling of collectively driven modes by frictional and viscous dissipation, in tidally perturbed bodies that are both non-rotating and rigidly rotating. This exploration leads us to propose an alternative approach to treating the damping of tidally driven oscillations that accounts for dissipative mode coupling, but which does not require any information beyond the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of adiabatic modes.
