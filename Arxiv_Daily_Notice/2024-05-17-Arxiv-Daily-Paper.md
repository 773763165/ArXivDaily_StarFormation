 - **Abstract**
 Dark Matter (DM) can become captured, deposit annihilation energy, and hence increase the heat flow in exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Detecting such a DM-induced heating in a population of exoplanets in the inner kpc of the Milky Way thus provides potential sensitivity to the galactic DM halo parameters. We develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to investigate the feasibility of DM discovery with exoplanets and examine future prospects to recover the spatial distribution of DM in the Milky Way. We reconstruct from mock exoplanet datasets observable parameters such as exoplanet age, temperature, mass, and location, together with DM halo parameters, for representative choices of measurement uncertainty and the number of exoplanets detected. We find that detection of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ exoplanets in the inner Galaxy can yield quantitative information on the galactic DM density profile, under the assumption of 10% measurement uncertainty. Even as few as $\mathcal{O}(10)$ exoplanets can deliver meaningful sensitivities if the DM density and inner slope are sufficiently large.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple fields can become dynamical during the inflationary epoch. We consider an example where a light field acquires isocurvature fluctuations during inflation and contributes to the dark matter abundance at late times. Interactions between the light field and the adiabatic sector contribute to mixed adiabatic-isocurvature non-Gaussianity (NG). We show the resulting form of NG has a different kinematic dependence than the 'local shape' commonly considered, and highlight the parameter space where a dedicated search is expected to significantly improve the current $\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. We interpret our results in the context of the QCD axion and illustrate how the proposed NG searches can improve upon the existing searches for isocurvature power spectrum and bispectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars that evaporate from their star cluster by the energy equipartition process end up either in a leading or a trailing tidal tail. In Newtonian gravitation and for open star clusters in the Solar vicinity, the tidal threshold, or prah, for escape is symmetrical, such that the leading and trailing tails are equally populated. The data by six independent teams that applied the convergent point method to map out the tidal tails of four open clusters (the Hyades, the Praesepe, Coma Berenices and COIN-Gaia13) using Gaia DR2 and DR3 are here applied to test for the expected symmetry. All tidal tails contain more stars in the leading tail. The combined confidence amounts to an 8 sigma falsification of the prah symmetry. The same test using Milgromian dynamics leads to consistency with the data. More effort needs to be exerted on this matter, but the data indicate with high confidence that the tidal prah of an open star cluster is asymmetrical with the corresponding confidence that Newtonian gravitation is falsified. Open star clusters depopulate more rapidly in Milgromian than in Newtonian dynamics and the COIN-Gaia13 cluster is here found to be nearly completely dissolved. In view of these results, the wide-binary star test and the Keplerian Galactic rotation curve finding are briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets from accreting supermassive black holes at cosmological distances can be powerful emitters of $\gamma$-rays. However, the precise mechanisms and locations responsible for the dissipation of energy within these jets, leading to observable $\gamma$-ray radiation, remain elusive. We detect evidence for an intrinsic absorption feature in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum at energies exceeding $10\,$GeV, presumably due to the photon-photon pair production of $\gamma$-rays with low ionization lines at the outer edge of Broad-line region (BLR), during the high-flux state of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424$-$418. The feature can be discriminated from the turnover at higher energies resulting from $\gamma$-ray absorption in the extragalactic background light. It is absent in the low-flux states supporting the interpretation that powerful dissipation events within or at the edge of the BLR evolve into fainter $\gamma$-ray emitting zones outside the BLR, possibly associated with the moving VLBI radio knots. The inferred location of $\gamma$-ray emission zone is consistent with the observed variability time scale of the brightest flare, provided that the flare is attributed to external Compton scattering with BLR photons.

 - **Abstract**
 In this talk, based on arXiv:2301.11345, arXiv:2305.16388, arXiv:2311.12694, we discuss the production of primordial gravitational waves (GW) sourced by graviton bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. For reheating, we consider inflaton decays and annihilations into pairs of bosons or fermions, assuming an inflaton $\phi$ that oscillates around a generic monomial potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$. The GW spectrum exhibits distinct features depending on the underlying reheating dynamics, which is controlled by the inflaton potential and the type of coupling between the inflaton and the matter fields. We show that the produced stochastic GW background could be probed in next-generation GW detectors, especially at high frequencies. We further highlight the potential of bremsstrahlung-induced GW to probe the underlying dynamics of reheating.

 - **Abstract**
 In the Nice model of solar system formation, Uranus and Neptune undergo an orbital upheaval, sweeping through a planetesimal disk. The region of the disk from which material is accreted by the ice giants during this phase of their evolution has not previously been identified. We perform direct N-body orbital simulations of the four giant planets to determine the amount and origin of solid accretion during this orbital upheaval. We find that the ice giants undergo an extreme bombardment event, with collision rates as much as ~3 per hour assuming km-sized planetesimals, increasing the total planet mass by up to ~0.35%. In all cases, the initially outermost ice giant experiences the largest total enhancement. We determine that for some plausible planetesimal properties, the resulting atmospheric enrichment could potentially produce sufficient latent heat to alter the planetary cooling timescale according to existing models. Our findings suggest that substantial accretion during this phase of planetary evolution may have been sufficient to impact the atmospheric composition and thermal evolution of the ice giants, motivating future work on the fate of deposited solid material.

          The tangled warp of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the influence of the Milky Way's warp on the kinematics of stars across the disc, and therefore measure its precession rate and line of nodes under different assumptions. We do this by applying Jeans' first equation to a model of a rigidly precessing warp. The predictions of these models are fit to the average vertical velocities of stars with measured line-of-sight velocities in Gaia DR3 data. We test models in which the warp's line of nodes and precession speed are fixed, and models in which they are allowed to vary linearly with radius. We also test models in which the velocity of stars radially in the disc is included in Jeans' equation. The kinematic data is best fit by models with a line of nodes that is 40 degrees offset from the Sun's Galactic azimuth, significantly leading the line of nodes found from the positions of stars. These models have a warp precession speed of around 13 km/s/kpc in the direction of Galactic rotation, close to other recent estimates. We find that including the velocity of stars radially in the disc in our kinematic model leads to a significantly worse fit to the data, and implausible warp parameters. We conclude that the Milky Way's warp appears to be rapidly precessing, but the structure and kinematics of the warped disc are not consistent within the approximation of a fixed, precessing, warp shape. This implies that the Milky Way's warp is dynamically evolving, which is a challenge to models of the warp's creation, and must be considered in the context of other known disturbances of the disc.

          Dynamical coupling of Keplerian orbits in a hierarchical four-body system: from the Galactic Centre to compact planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 This study focuses on the long-term evolution of two bodies in nearby initially coplanar orbits around a central dominant body perturbed by a fourth body on a distant Keplerian orbit. Our previous works that considered this setup enforced circular orbits by adding a spherical potential of extended mass, which dampens Kozai--Lidov oscillations; it led to two qualitatively different modes of the evolution of the nearby orbits. In one scenario, their mutual interaction exceeds the effect of differential precession caused by a perturbing body. This results in a long-term coherent evolution, with nearly coplanar orbits experiencing only small oscillations of inclination. We extend the previous work by (i) considering post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of the central body, either instead of or in addition to the potential of extended mass, (ii) relaxing the requirement of strictly circular orbits, and (iii) removing the strict requirement of complete Kozai--Lidov damping. Thus, we identify the modes of inter-orbital interaction described for the zero-eccentricity case in the more general situation, which allows for its applicability to a much broader range of astrophysical systems than considered initially. In this work, we scale the systems to the orbits of S-stars; we consider the clockwise disc to represent the perturbing body, with post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of Sagittarius A* playing the role of damping potential. Considering post-Newtonian corrections, even stellar-mass central bodies in compact planetary systems can allow for the coupled evolution of Keplerian orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the 3D structure of the Milky Way is a crucial step in deriving properties of the star-forming regions, as well as the Galaxy as a whole. We present a novel 3D map of the Milky Way plane that extends to 10 kpc distance from the Sun. We leverage the wealth of information in the near-IR APOGEE dataset and combine that with our state-of-the-art 3D mapping technique using Bayesian statistics and the Gaussian process to provide a large-scale 3D map of the dust in the Milky Way. Our map stretches across 10 kpc along both the X and Y axes, and 750 pc in the Z direction, perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Our results reveal multi-scale over-densities as well as large cavities in the Galactic plane and shed new light on the Galactic structure and spiral arms. We also provide a catalogue of large molecular clouds identified by our map with accurate distance and volume density estimates. Utilising volume densities derived from this map, we explore mass distribution across various Galactocentric radii. A general decline towards the outer Galaxy is observed, followed by local peaks, some aligning with established features like the Molecular Ring and segments of the spiral arms. Moreover, this work explores extragalactic observational effects on derived properties of molecular clouds by demonstrating the potential biases arising from column density measurements in inferring properties of these regions, and opens exciting avenues for further exploration and analysis, offering a deeper perspective on the complex processes that shape our galaxy and beyond.

          Open Effective Field Theories for cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 When energy is not conserved, imprints of new physics on observable cosmology might not follow the rules of local effective actions. By capturing dissipative and diffusive effects, open effective field theories account for the possibly non-Hamiltonian evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities interacting with an unspecified environment. In this proceeding, we briefly discuss recent progress made towards their implementation in primordial cosmology. Our approach recovers the usual effective field theory of inflation in a certain limit and extends it to account for local dissipation and noises. Non-Gaussianities are generated that peak in the equilateral configuration for large dissipation and in the folded configurations for small dissipation. The construction provides an embedding for local dissipative models of inflation and a framework to study quantum information aspects of the inflationary models.

          Unleashing cosmic shear information with the tomographic weak lensing PDF

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we demonstrate the constraining power of the tomographic weak lensing convergence PDF for StageIV-like source galaxy redshift bins and shape noise. We focus on scales of $10$ to $20$ arcmin in the mildly nonlinear regime, where the convergence PDF and its changes with cosmological parameters can be predicted theoretically. We model the impact of reconstructing the convergence from the shear field using the well-known Kaiser-Squires formalism. We cross-validate the predicted and the measured convergence PDF derived from convergence maps reconstructed using simulated shear catalogues. Employing a Fisher forecast, we determine the constraining power for $(\Omega_{m},S_{8},w_{0})$. We find that adding a 5-bin tomography improves the $\kappa-$PDF constraints by a factor of $\{3.8,1.3,1.6\}$ for $(\Omega_{m}, S_{8},w_{0})$ respectively. Additionally, we perform a joint analysis with the shear two-point correlation functions, finding an enhancement of around a factor of $1.5$ on all parameters with respect to the two-point statistics alone. These improved constraints come from disentangling $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from $w_0$ by extracting non-Gaussian information, in particular, including the PDF skewness at different redshift bins. We also study the effect of varying the number of parameters to forecast, in particular we add $h$, finding that the convergence PDF maintains its constraining power while the precision from two-point correlations degrades by a factor of $\{1.7,1.4,1.8\}$ for $\{\Omega_{\rm m},S_8,w_0\}$, respectively.

          Feedback in emerging extragalactic star clusters, FEAST: The relation between 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission and Star Formation Rate traced by ionized gas in NGC 628

 - **Abstract**
 We present maps of ionized gas (traced by Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\alpha$) and 3.3 $\mu$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, derived from new JWST/NIRCam data from the FEAST survey. With this data, we investigate and calibrate the relation between 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission and star formation rate (SFR) in and around emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) on a scale of ${\sim}40$ pc. We find a tight (correlation coefficient $\rho$${\sim}$0.9) sub-linear (power-law exponent $\alpha$${\sim}$0.75) relation between the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH luminosity surface density and SFR traced by Br$\alpha$ for compact, cospatial (within 0.16$''$ or ${\sim}$7 pc) peaks in Pa$\alpha$, Br$\alpha$, and 3.3 $\mu$m (eYSC-I). The scatter in the relationship does not correlate well with variations in local interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity due to a radial metallicity gradient, but rather is likely due to stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and variations in the PAH heating and age of our sources. The deviation from a linear relation may be explained by PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments, variations in age, and IMF stochasticity at intermediate to low luminosities. We test our results with various continuum subtraction techniques using combinations of NIRCam bands and find that they remain robust with only minor differences in the derived slope and intercept. An unexpected discrepancy is identified between the relations of hydrogen recombination lines (Pa$\alpha$ versus Br$\alpha$; H$\alpha$ versus Br$\alpha$).

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) hold great potential for an unobscured view of protoneutron stars (PNSs) formed as a result of stellar collapses. While waiting for discovery, deepening the understanding of GW emission in theory is beneficial for both optimizing searching strategies and deciphering the eventual data. One significant aspect is the spatially dependent contribution to the overall GW signal extracted from sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations. I present the proper way to perform the spatial decomposition of GW strain with the quadrupole formula in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation. Then I demonstrate the approach using the results of a 2D axisymmetric pseudo-Newtonian hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse supernova. I discuss the possible misleading interpretation based on the incorrect method in the literature that favors the dominant contribution by the PNS convective layer. Moreover, with the correct approach, the GW spatial profiles agree well with those calculated from a consistent perturbative method. This work re-emphasizes the global emission picture of GWs from PNS and motivates future prudent analyses with 3D simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line quasars (BALs) exhibit blueshifted absorption relative to a number of their prominent broad emission features. These absorption features can contribute to quasar redshift errors and add absorption to the Lyman-alpha (LyA) forest that is unrelated to large-scale structure. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of BALs on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results with the LyA forest from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The baseline strategy for the first year analysis is to mask all pixels associated with all BAL absorption features that fall within the wavelength region used to measure the forest. We explore a range of alternate masking strategies and demonstrate that these changes have minimal impact on the BAO measurements with both DESI data and synthetic data. This includes when we mask the BAL features associated with emission lines outside of the forest region to minimize their contribution to redshift errors. We identify differences in the properties of BALs in the synthetic datasets relative to the observational data, as well as use the synthetic observations to characterize the completeness of the BAL identification algorithm, and demonstrate that incompleteness and differences in the BALs between real and synthetic data also do not impact the BAO results for the LyA forest.

 - **Abstract**
 As the catalogue of gravitational-wave transients grows, several entries appear "exceptional" within the population. Tipping the scales with a total mass of $\approx 150 M_\odot$, GW190521 likely contained black holes in the pair-instability mass gap. The event GW190814, meanwhile, is unusual for its extreme mass ratio and the mass of its secondary component. A growing model-building industry has emerged to provide explanations for such exceptional events, and Bayesian model selection is frequently used to determine the most informative model. However, Bayesian methods can only take us so far. They provide no answer to the question: does our model provide an adequate explanation for the data? If none of the models we are testing provide an adequate explanation, then it is not enough to simply rank our existing models - we need new ones. In this paper, we introduce a method to answer this question with a frequentist $p$-value. We apply the method to different models that have been suggested to explain GW190521: hierarchical mergers in active galactic nuclei and globular clusters. We show that some (but not all) of these models provide adequate explanations for exceptionally massive events like GW190521.

          The metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b from Gemini-S/IGRINS

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with Gemini-S/IGRINS. We detected the presence of H$_{2}$O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise rations of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and C/O$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ($V_{sys}$) and Keplerian ($K_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $V_{sys}$ for H$_{2}$O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H$_{2}$O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.

          Energy dependence of the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in Swift J1727.8-1613

 - **Abstract**
 Based on observations from the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT), an analysis of Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed during the outburst of the new black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 in 2023 was conducted. This analysis scrutinized the QPO's evolution throughout the outburst, particularly noting its rapid frequency escalation during two flare events. Utilizing the energy range covered by Insight-HXMT, a dependency of the QPO frequency on energy was observed. Below approximately 3 Hz, minimal variations in frequency with energy were noted, whereas clear variations with photon energy were observed when it exceeded approximately 3 Hz. Additionally, a sharp drop in the rate of change was observed when the frequency exceeded approximately 8 Hz. This behavior, similar to several previously reported sources, suggests the presence of a common underlying physical mechanism. Moreover, the QPO rms-frequency relationship can be explained by the Lense-Thirring precession model. The relationship between rms-energy and phase lag with frequency suggests the black hole system as a high-inclination source.

          Supermassive black hole formation from Affleck-Dine mechanism with suppressed clustering on large scales

 - **Abstract**
 We study a primordial black hole (PBH) formation model based on the framework of the inhomogeneous Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism, which can explain the seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). This model, however, predicts strong clustering of SMBHs that is inconsistent with the observation of angular correlation of quasars. In this paper, we propose a modified model that can significantly reduce the PBH clustering on large scales by considering a time-dependent Hubble-induced mass during inflation. The quasar angular correlation is suppressed by the large Hubble-induced mass in the early stage of inflation while the small Hubble-induced mass in the late stage leads to the AD field fluctuations large enough for PBH formation as in the original model. As a result, the modified scenario can successfully explain the seeds of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar spectra from LAMOST Medium Resolution Survey can be used to search for compact objects in binaries. The LAMOST DR10 catalog includes > 980, 000 targets with multiple medium resolution spectra. We select the targets with large or rapid radial velocity variation, and obtained an input-sample of 1822 sources. We use light curves and spectra to identify and exclude eclipsing binaries and double-lined spectroscopic binaries in the input-sample. We finally derive a catalog of 89 candidates with well-folded radial velocity, which are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries, indicating an unseen companion residing in each system. The mass function of each system can be well constrained based on the radial velocity curve. In our sample, 26 sources have mass function higher than 0.1 $M_{\odot}$, among which 18 sources have ellipsoidal type light curves. In our opinion, compact objects are likely existent in all these 26 binaries, which are worth follow-up identification.

 - **Abstract**
 We have discovered that the Halpha emission line star Haro 5-2, located in the 3-6 Myr old Ori OB1b association, is a young quadruple system. The system has a 2+2 configuration with an outer separation of 2.6 arcseconds and with resolved subarcsecond inner binary components. The brightest component, Aa, dominates the A-binary, it is a weakline T Tauri star with spectral type M2.5pm1. The two stars of the B component are equally bright at J, but the Bb star is much redder. Optical spectroscopy of the combined B pair indicates a rich emission line spectrum with a M3pm1 spectral type. The spectrum is highly variable and switches back and forth between a classical and a weakline T Tauri star. In the near-infrared, the spectrum shows Paschen beta and Brackett gamma in emission, indicative of active accretion. A significant mid-infrared excess reveals the presence of circumstellar or circumbinary material in the system. Most multiple systems are likely formed during the protostellar phase, involving flybys of neighboring stars followed by an in-spiraling phase driven by accretion from circumbinary material and leading to compact sub-systems. However, Haro 5-2 stands out among young 2+2 quadruples as the two inner binaries are unusually wide relative to the separation of the A and B pair, allowing future studies of the individual components. Assuming the components are coeval, the system could potentially allow stringent tests of PMS evolutionary models.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of Super-Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanets relies heavily on our understanding of their formation and evolution. In this study, we link a model of planet formation by pebble accretion to the planets' long-term observational properties by calculating the interior evolution, starting from the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk. We investigate the evolution of the interior structure in 5-20 Earth masses planets, accounting for silicate redistribution caused by convective mixing, rainout (condensation and settling), and mass loss. Specifically, we have followed the fate of the hot silicate vapor that remained in the planet's envelope after planet formation, as the planet cools. We find that disk dissipation is followed by a rapid contraction of the envelope within 10 Myr. Subsequent cooling leads to substantial growth of the planetary core through silicate rainout, accompanied by inflated radii, in comparison to the standard models of planets that formed with core-envelope structure. We examine the dependence of rainout on the planet's envelope mass, distance from its host star, its silicate mass, and the atmospheric opacity. We find that the population of planets formed with polluted envelopes can be roughly divided in three groups, based on the mass of their gas envelopes: bare rocky cores that have shed their envelopes, super-Earth planets with a core-envelope structure, and Neptune-like planets with diluted cores that undergo gradual rainout. For polluted planets formed with envelope masses below 0.4 Earth mass, we anticipate that the inflation of the planet's radius caused by rainout will enhance mass loss by a factor of 2-8 compared to planets with non-polluted envelopes. Our model provides an explanation for bridging the gap between the predicted composition gradients in massive planets and the core-envelope structure in smaller planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent imaging observations with ALMA and other telescopes found widespread signatures of planet presence in protoplanetary discs at tens of au separations from their host stars. Here we point out that the presence of very massive planets at 0.1 au sized orbits can be deduced for protostars accreting gas at very high rates, when their discs display powerful Thermal Instability bursts. Earlier work showed that a massive planet modifies the nature of this instability, with outbursts triggered at the outer edge of the deep gap opened by the planet. We present simulations of this effect, finding two types of TI outbursts: downstream and upstream of the planet, which may or may not be causally connected. We apply our model to the outburst in Gaia20eae. We find that the agreement between the data and our disc thermal instability model is improved if there is a planet of 6 Jupiter masses orbiting the star at 0.062 au separation. Gaia20eae thus becomes the second episodically erupting star, after FU Ori, where the presence of a massive planet is strongly suspected. Future observations of similar systems will constrain the mode and the frequency of planet formation in such an early epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 First stars play crucial roles in development of the universe, influencing events like cosmic reionization and the chemical enrichment. While first stars are conventionally thought to form at around $z \sim 20-30$ in the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, observational constraints on small-scale density fluctuations remain limited, possibly differing significantly from the scale-invariant fluctuations assumed in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Should this be the case, the formation of first stars could occur much earlier than typically predicted. In this study, we investigate the formation process of first stars in the extremely early epochs of $z \gtrsim 100$ in the post-recombination universe. At such early times, the effects of the warm cosmic microwave background (CMB) become significant. We calculate the collapse of primordial star-forming clouds using a one-zone thermo-chemical model that accounts for CMB influences on radiative heating, Compton cooling, and photodissociation reactions. We found that the impact of the CMB on the evolution is limited at $z \lesssim 100$, with the temperature evolution closely resembling the conventional model. However, within the range $100 \lesssim z \lesssim 400$, the formation of H$_2$ via the H$^-$ channel is impeded by H$^-$ photodetachment induced by the CMB, leading to higher temperatures compared to standard one. Consequently, first stars with masses exceeding $1000 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ can emerge at $z \gtrsim 100$. Furthermore, at $z \gtrsim 500$, the temperature evolution becomes nearly isothermal solely due to atomic cooling, as H$_2$ formation is entirely suppressed. In such cases, supermassive stars with masses around $\sim 10^5 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ are expected to form solely via atomic cooling. These findings emphasize the significant variation in the typical mass of the first stars depending on the epoch of formation.

          The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator for the 21-cm power spectrum from MWA drift scan observations I: Validation and preliminary results

 - **Abstract**
 Drift scan observations provide the broad sky coverage and instrumental stability needed to measure the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal. In such observations, the telescope's pointing center (PC) moves continuously on the sky. The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator (TTGE) combines observations from different PC to estimate $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ the 21-cm power spectrum, centered on a tracking center (TC) which remains fixed on the sky. The tapering further restricts the sky response to a small angular region around TC, thereby mitigating wide-field foregrounds. Here we consider $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ ($z = 8.2$) Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations. The periodic pattern of flagged channels, present in MWA data, is known to introduce artefacts which pose a challenge for estimating $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$. We demonstrate that the TTGE is able to recover $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ without any artefacts, and estimate $P(k)$ within $5 \%$ accuracy over a large $k$-range. We also present preliminary results for a single PC, combining 9 nights of observation $(17 \, {\rm min}$ total). We find that $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ exhibits streaks at a fixed interval of $k_{\parallel}=0.29 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which matches $\Delta \nu_{\rm per}=1.28 \, {\rm MHz}$ that is the period of the flagged channels. The streaks are not as pronounced at larger $k_{\parallel}$, and in some cases they do not appear to extend across the entire $k_{\perp}$ range. The rectangular region $0.05 \leq k_{\perp} \leq 0.16 \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $0.9 \leq k_{\parallel} \leq 4.6 \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ is found to be relatively free of foreground contamination and artefacts, and we have used this to place the $2\sigma$ upper limit $\Delta^2(k) < (1.85 \times 10^4)^2\, {\rm mK^2}$ on the EoR 21-cm mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations at $k=1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Intense flaring events in the near-infrared and X-ray wavebands of our Galactic Center have been the subject of research for decades. In recent years, the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope captured the motion and polarimetric signature of such a flare in close proximity to the supermassive black hole. This study aims to investigate a broad parameter space for hot spot motion in the vicinity of Sgr$A*$ and reproduce the observed flaring behavior. To this end, we have developed a General Relativistic Radiative Transfer code and conducted a parameter study including both planar and ejected hot spot configurations around supermassive black holes. Super-Keplerian orbital frequencies are favored by circular equatorial, cylindrical and parabolic models, whereas conical hot spot trajectories provide a better fit for orbital frequencies below the Keplerian value. Additionally, a distant observer cannot effectively differentiate between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, as well as face-on orbits at different observation angles.

 Context. The blazar AO 0235+164, located at redshift $z=0.94$, has displayed interesting and repeating flaring activity in the past, the latest episodes occurring in 2008 and 2015. In 2020, the source brightened again, starting a new flaring episode that peaked in 2021. Aims. We study the origin and properties of the 2021 flare in relation to previous studies and the historical behavior of the source, in particular to the 2008 and 2015 flaring episodes. Methods. We analyze the multi-wavelength photo-polarimetric evolution of the source. From Very Long Baseline Array images, we derive the kinematic parameters of new components associated with the 2021 flare. We use this information to constrain a model for the spectral energy distribution of the emission during the flaring period. We propose an analytical geometric model to test whether the observed wobbling of the jet is consistent with precession. Results. We report the appearance of two new components that are ejected in a different direction than previously, confirming the wobbling of the jet. We find that the direction of ejection is consistent with that of a precessing jet.The derived period independently agrees with the values commonly found in the literature. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution further confirm that the differences between flares can be attributed to geometrical effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar convection plays an important role in atmospheric dynamics, wind formation and the mass-loss processes in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. However, a direct characterization of convective surface structures in terms of size, contrast, and life-span is quite challenging. Spatially resolving these features requires the highest angular resolution. In this work, we aim at characterizing the size of convective structures on the surface of the O-rich AGB star R Car to test different theoretical predictions, based on mixing-length theory from solar models. We used infrared low-spectral resolution (R~35) interferometric data in the H-band (~1.76 $\mu$m) with the instrument PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) to image the star's surface at two epochs separated by ~6 years. Using a power spectrum analysis, we estimate the horizontal size of the structures on the surface of R Car. The sizes of the stellar disk, at different phases of a pulsation cycle, were obtained using parametric model-fitting in the Fourier domain. Our analysis supports that the sizes of the structures in R Car are correlated with variations of the pressure scale height in the atmosphere of the target, as predicted by theoretical models based on solar convective processes. We observe that these structures grow in size when the star expands within a pulsation cycle. While the information is still scarce, this observational finding highlights the role of convection in the dynamics of those objects. New interferometric imaging campaigns with the renewed capabilities of the VLTI are envisioned to expand our analysis to a larger sample of objects.

 We present and test a method to infer a probability density function (PDF) for the missing vlos of a star with 5D information within $2.5$ kpc. We use stars from the Gaia DR3 RVS catalogue to describe the local orbital structure in action space. This technique also allows us to infer the probability that a 5D star is associated with the Milky Way's stellar Disc or the stellar Halo, which can be further decomposed into known stellar substructures. The method is tested on a 6D Gaia DR3 RVS sample and a 6D Gaia sample crossmatched to groundbased spectroscopic surveys, stripped of their true vlos. The stars predicted vlos, membership probabilities, and inferred structure properties are then compared to the true 6D equivalents, allowing the method's accuracy and limitations to be studied in detail. Our predicted vlos PDFs are statistically consistent with the true vlos, with accurate uncertainties. We find that the vlos of Disc stars can be well constrained, with a median uncertainty of 26 kms. Halo stars are typically less well constrained with a median uncertainty of 72 kms, but those found likely to belong to Halo substructures can be better constrained. The dynamical properties of the total sample and subgroups, such as distributions of integrals of motion and velocities, are also accurately recovered. The group membership probabilities are statistically consistent with our initial labelling, allowing high quality sets to be selected from 5D samples by choosing a trade off between higher expected purity and decreasing expected completeness.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations have shown for decades that the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phenomenon is ubiquitous among stars with different initial masses. Although much effort to understand the winds from massive WR stars has been presented in the literature, not much has been done for such type of stars in the low-mass range. Here we present an attempt to understand the winds from [WR]-type stars using results from spectral analyses with the full non-LTE stellar atmosphere code PoWR. These results are put into context with the properties of massive WR stars. We found that WC+[WC] stars and WO+[WO] stars create independent sequences in the mass-loss rate ($\dot{M}$) and modified wind momentum ($D_\mathrm{mom}$) versus luminosity ($L$) diagrams. Our analysis indicates that even when the winds of WR and [WR] stars become optically thin, there is no breakdown of the general mass-loss trend, contrary to the observed ``weak wind phenomenon'' in OB stars. We report that all WR-type stars studied here broadly define single sequences in the wind efficiency ($\eta$) versus transformed mass-loss rate ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{t}$), the $\dot{M}_\mathrm{t}$-$T_\mathrm{eff}$ diagram, and the $(L, T_\mathrm{eff}, \dot{M})$ space, which suggest these to be fundamental properties of the WR phenomenon (regardless of the mass range), at least for WR-type stars of the O and C sequences. Our analytical estimations could drive computations of future stellar evolution models for WR-type stars.

 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies are a powerful probe of the early universe, and have largely contributed to establishing the current standard cosmological model. To extract the information encoded in those tiny variations, one must first compress the raw, time-domain data collected by a telescope into maps of the sky at the observed frequencies, in a procedure known as map-making. I provide a general introduction to this problem, and highlight a few specificities of the MAPPRAISER implementation.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and extract cosmological parameter constraints based on the cosmic shear peak count statistics. Peaks are identified in aperture mass maps in which the filter is maximally sensitive to angular scales in the range 2-4arcmin, probing deep into the non-linear regime of structure formation. We interpret our results with a simulation-based inference pipeline, sampling over a broad $w$CDM prior volume and marginalising over uncertainties on shape calibration, photometric redshift distribution, intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. Our measurements constrain the structure growth parameter and the amplitude of the non-linear intrinsic alignment model to $\Sigma_8 \equiv \sigma_8\left[\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right]^{0.60}=0.765^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$ and $A_{\rm IA}= 0.71^{+0.42}_{-0.42}$, respectively, in agreement with previous KiDS-1000 results based on two-point shear statistics. These results are robust against modelling of the non-linear physics, different scale cuts and selections of tomographic bins. The posterior is also consistent with that from the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 peak count analysis presented in Harnois-Déraps et al (2021), and hence we jointly analyse both surveys. We obtain $\Sigma_8^{\rm joint} \equiv \sigma_8\left[\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right]^{0.57}=0.759^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$, in agreement with the Planck $w$CDM results. The shear-CMB tension on this parameter increases to $3.1\sigma$ when forcing $w=-1.0$, and to $4.1\sigma$ if comparing instead with $S_{8,\Lambda{\rm CDM}}^{\rm joint} = 0.736^{+0.016}_{-0.018}$, one of the tightest constraints to date on this quantity.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the effectiveness of a non-parametric bias model in generating mock halo catalogues for modified gravity (MG) cosmologies, relying on the distribution of dark matter from either MG or $\Lambda$CDM. We aim to generate halo catalogues that effectively capture the distinct impact of MG, ensuring high accuracy in both two- and three-point statistics for comprehensive analysis of large-scale structures. As part of this study we aim at investigating the inclusion of MG into non-local bias to directly map the tracers onto $\Lambda$CDM fields, which would save many computational costs. We employ the bias assignment method (BAM) to model halo distribution statistics by leveraging seven high-resolution COLA simulations of MG cosmologies. Taking into account cosmic-web dependencies when learning the bias relations, we design two experiments to map the MG effects: one utilising the consistent MG density fields and the other employing the benchmark $\Lambda$CDM density field. BAM generates MG halo catalogues from both calibrations experiments excelling in summary statistics, achieving a $\sim 1\%$ accuracy in the power spectrum across a wide range of $k$-modes, with only minimal differences well below 10\% at modes subject to cosmic variance, particularly below $k<0.07$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$. The reduced bispectrum remains consistent with the reference catalogues within 10\% for the studied configuration. Our results demonstrate that a non-linear and non-local bias description can model the effects of MG starting from a $\Lambda$CDM dark matter field.
