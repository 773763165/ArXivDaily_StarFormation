 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves have been instrumental in providing deep insights into the nature of gravity. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are predicted to have a higher detection rate given the increased sensitivity and lower cut-off frequency. However, this increased sensitivity raises challenges concerning parameter estimation due to the foreseeable overlap of signals from multiple sources. Overlapping signals (OSs), if not properly identified, may introduce biases in estimating post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients in parameterized tests of general relativity (GR). We investigate how OSs affect $-1$PN to 2PN terms in parameterized GR tests, examining their potential to falsely suggest GR deviations. We estimate the prevalence of such misleading signals in next-generation detectors, and their collective influence on GR tests. We compare the effects of OSs on coefficients at different PN orders, concluding that overall the 1PN coefficient suffers the most. Our findings also reveal that while a non-negligible portion of OSs exhibit biases in PN coefficients that might individually prefer to conclude deviations from GR, collectively, the direction to deviate is random and a statistical combination will still be in favor of GR.

 - **Abstract**
 Monte-Carlo techniques are standard numerical tools for exploring non-Gaussian and multivariate likelihoods. Many variants of the original Metropolis-Hastings algorithm have been proposed to increase the sampling efficiency. Motivated by Ensemble Monte Carlo we allow the number of Markov chains to vary by exchanging particles with a reservoir, controlled by a parameter analogous to a chemical potential $\mu$, which effectively establishes a random process that samples microstates from a macrocanonical instead of a canonical ensemble. In this paper, we develop the theory of macrocanonical sampling for statistical inference on the basis of Bayesian macrocanonical partition functions, thereby bringing to light the relations between information-theoretical quantities and thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for macrocanonical sampling, $\texttt{Avalanche Sampling}$, and apply it to various toy problems as well as the likelihood on the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $w$ on the basis of data from the supernova distance redshift relation.
#### Properties of the Magellanic Corona Model for the formation of the  Magellanic Stream

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16221
 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the Magellanic Corona model of the formation of the Magellanic Stream, which we introduced in Lucchini et al. (2020, 2021). Using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the properties of the primordial Magellanic Clouds, including the Magellanic Corona -- the gaseous halo around the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With an LMC mass of $1.75\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, a Magellanic Corona of $>5\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $3\times10^5$ K, a total Small Magellanic Cloud mass $<10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, and a Milky Way corona of $2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we can reproduce the observed total mass of the neutral and ionized components of the Trailing Stream, ionization fractions along the Stream, morphology of the neutral gas, and on-sky extent of the ionized gas. The inclusion of advanced physical routines in the simulations allow the first direct comparison of a hydrodynamical model with UV absorption-line spectroscopic data. Our model reproduces O I, O VI, and C IV observations from HST/COS and FUSE. The stripped material is also nearby ($<50$ kpc from the Sun), as found in our prior models including a Magellanic Corona.
#### A Systematic Review of 24 Previously Measured Black Hole Spins in X-ray  Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our recent work on black hole spin in X-ray binary systems to include an analysis of 189 archival NuSTAR observations from 24 sources. Using self-consistent data reduction pipelines, spectral models, and statistical techniques, we report an unprecedented and uniform sample of 36 stellar-mass black hole spin measurements based on relativistic reflection. This treatment suggests that prior reports of low spins in a small number of sources were generally erroneous; our comprehensive treatment finds that those sources also tend to harbor black holes with high spin values. Overall, within $1\sigma$ uncertainty, $\sim86\%$ of the sample is consistent with $a \geq 0.95$, $\sim94\%$ of the sample is consistent with $a\geq 0.9$, and $100\%$ is consistent with $a\geq 0.7$ (the theoretical maximum for neutron stars; $a = cJ/GM^{2}$). We also find that the high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs; those with A, B, or O-type companions) are consistent with $a\geq 0.9$ within $1\sigma$ errors; this is in agreement with the low-mass X-ray binary population and may be especially important for comparisons to black holes discovered in gravitational wave events. In some cases, different spectra from the same source yield similar spin measurements but conflicting values for the inclination of the inner disk; we suggest that this is due to variable disk winds obscuring the blue wing of the relativistic Fe K emission line. We discuss the implications of our measurements, the unique view of systematic uncertainties enabled by our treatment, and future efforts to characterize black hole spins with new missions.
#### Dark Matter Scattering Constraints from Observations of Stars  Surrounding Sgr A*

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution infrared data has revealed several young stars in close proximity to Sgr A*. These stars may encounter extremely high dark matter densities. We examine scenarios where dark matter scatters on stellar gas, accumulates in stellar cores, and then annihilates. We study the stars S2, S62, S4711 and S4714 and find three observable effects. First, dark matter interactions can inhibit in situ star-formation close to Sgr A*, favoring scenarios where these stars migrate into the Galactic Center. Second, dark matter interactions can delay main sequence evolution, making stars older than they appear. Third, very high dark matter densities can inject enough energy to disrupt main sequence stars, allowing S-star observations to constrain the dark matter density near Sgr A*.
#### Ultraviolet Quasi-periodic Eruptions from Star-Disk Collisions in  Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 ``Quasi-periodic eruptions'' (QPE) are recurrent nuclear transients with periods of several hours to almost a day, which thus far have been detected exclusively in the X-ray band. We have shown that many of the key properties of QPE flares (period, luminosity, duration, emission temperature, alternating long-short recurrence time behavior, source rates) are naturally reproduced by a scenario involving twice-per-orbit collisions between a solar-type star on a mildly eccentric orbit, likely brought into the nucleus as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), and the gaseous accretion disk of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The flare is generated by the hot shocked debris expanding outwards from either side of the disk midplane, akin to dual miniature supernovae. Here, we consider the conditions necessary for disk-star collisions to generate lower-temperature flares which peak in the ultraviolet (UV) instead of the X-ray band. We identify a region of parameter space at low SMBH mass $M_{\bullet} \sim 10^{5.5}M_{\odot}$ and QPE periods $P \gtrsim 10$ hr for which the predicted flares are sufficiently luminous $L_{\rm UV} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to outshine the quiescent disk emission at these wavelengths. The prospects to discover such ``UV QPEs'' with future satellite missions such as ULTRASAT and UVEX depends on the prevalence of very low-mass SMBH and the occurrence rate of stellar EMRIs onto them. For gaseous disks produced by the tidal disruption of stars, we predict that X-ray QPEs will eventually shut off, only to later reappear as UV-QPEs as the accretion rate continues to drop.
#### C I Traces the Disk Atmosphere in the IM Lup Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 The central star and its energetic radiation fields play a vital role in setting the vertical and radial chemical structure of planet-forming disks. We present observations that, for the first time, clearly reveal the UV-irradiated surface of a protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we spatially resolve the atomic-to-molecular (C I-to-CO) transition in the IM Lup disk with ALMA archival observations of [C I] $^3$P$_1$-$^3$P$_0$. We derive a C I emitting height of z/r $\gtrsim$ 0.5 with emission detected out to a radius of ${\approx}$600 au. Compared to other systems with C I heights inferred from unresolved observations or models, the C I layer in the IM Lup disk is at scale heights almost double that of other disks, confirming its highly flared nature. C I arises from a narrow, optically-thin layer that is substantially more elevated than that of $^{12}$CO (z/r $\approx$ 0.3-0.4), which allows us to directly constrain the physical gas conditions across the C I-to-CO transition zone. We also compute a radially-resolved C I column density profile and find a disk-averaged C I column density of 2$\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is ${\approx}$3-20$\times$ lower than that of other disks with spatially-resolved C I detections. We do not find evidence for vertical substructures or spatially-localized deviations in C I due, e.g., to either an embedded giant planet or a photoevaporative wind that have been proposed in the IM Lup disk, but emphasize that deeper observations are required for robust constraints.
#### TOI-1670 c, a 40-day Orbital Period Warm Jupiter in a Compact System, is  Well-aligned

 - **Abstract**
 We report the measurement of the sky-projected obliquity angle $\lambda$ of the Warm Jovian exoplanet TOI-1670 c via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect as part of the Stellar Obliquities in Long-period Exoplanet Systems (SOLES) project. We observed the transit window during UT 20 April 2023 for 7 continuous hours with NEID on the 3.5 m WIYN Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. TOI-1670 hosts a sub-Neptune (P ~11 days; planet b) interior to the Warm Jovian (P ~40 days; planet c), which presents an opportunity to investigate the dynamics of a Warm Jupiter with an inner companion. Additionally, TOI-1670 c is now among the longest-period planets to date to have its sky-projected obliquity angle measured. We find planet c is well-aligned to the host star, with $\lambda$ = -0.3 +/- 2.2 degrees. TOI-1670 c joins a growing census of aligned Warm Jupiters around single stars and aligned planets in multi-planet systems.
#### Learning Reionization History from Quasars with Simulation-Based  Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the entire history of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is at the frontier of astrophysics and cosmology. A promising method to achieve this is by extracting the damping wing signal from the neutral IGM. As hundreds of redshift $z>6$ quasars are observed, we anticipate determining the detailed time evolution of the ionization fraction with unprecedented fidelity. However, traditional approaches to parameter inference are not sufficiently accurate. We assess the performance of a simulation-based inference (SBI) method to infer the neutral fraction of the universe from quasar spectra. The SBI method adeptly exploits the shape information of the damping wing, enabling precise estimations of the neutral fraction $\left<x_{\rm HI}\right>_{\rm v}$ and the wing position $w_p$. Importantly, the SBI framework successfully breaks the degeneracy between these two parameters, offering unbiased estimates of both. This makes the SBI superior to the traditional method using a pseudo-likelihood function. We anticipate that SBI will be essential to determine robustly the ionization history of the Universe through joint inference from the hundreds of high-$z$ spectra we will observe.
#### On the nature of the ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg II X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg II X-1 using broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectra taken with the XMM-Newton satellite over a period of 19 years benefiting from a recent campaign. We tested several models for the broadband spectra among which a double thermal component provided a reasonable description for the continuum between 0.3-10 keV and enabled us to constrain the properties of the accretion disc. The Luminosity-Temperature trends of the inner and outer disc components broadly agree with the expectations for a thin disc, although the exact values of the slopes are slightly sensitive to the adopted model. However, all tested models show L-T trends which deviate from a power law above a bolometric luminosity of about 5 $\times \ 10^{39} $erg/s, particularly for the hot thermal component associated to the inner accretion flow. Assuming that such deviations are due to the accretion rate exceeding its Eddington limit or, most likely, the super-critical rate, a compact object with a mass 16-36 Msun, i.e. a stellar-mass black hole, is inferred. The time-averaged (2021) high resolution spectra present narrow emission lines at 1 keV primarily from Ne IX-X and a very strong at 0.5 keV from N VII, which indicate Ne-N-rich gas with non-Solar abundances. This favours a nitrogen-rich donor star, such as a blue/red supergiant, which has escaped from its native stellar cluster characterised by a low-metallicity environment.
#### TIC 184743498: The First Tri-Axial Stellar Pulsator

 - **Abstract**
 We have discovered a $\delta$ Scuti pulsator in a tight binary (P = 1.053 d) with nine pulsation modes whose frequencies are between 38 and 56 d$^{-1}$. Each of these modes exhibits amplitude modulations and $\pi$-rad phase shifts twice per orbital cycle. Five of these modes exhibit amplitude and phase shifts that are readily explained by dipole pulsations along an axis that is aligned with the binary's tidal axis. The novelty of the system lies in the remaining four pulsation modes, which we show are dipole pulsations along an axis that is perpendicular to both the tidal axis and the binary's orbital angular momentum axis. There are additionally two pulsation modes whose amplitudes and phases do not change significantly with orbital phase; they are explained as dipole modes along an axis aligned with the orbital/rotation axis. Hence, we propose that TIC 184743498 is a tri-axial pulsator, the first of its kind.
#### Initial Characterization of the First Speedster-EXD550 Event-Driven  X-Ray Hybrid CMOS Detectors

 - **Abstract**
 Future x-ray observatories will require imaging detectors with fast readout speeds that simultaneously achieve or exceed the other high performance parameters of x-ray charge-coupled devices (CCDs) used in many missions over the past three decades. Fast readout will reduce the impact of pile-up in missions with large collecting areas while also improving performance in other respects like timing resolution. Event-driven readout, in which only pixels with charge from x-ray events are read out, can be used to achieve these faster operating speeds. Speedster-EXD550 detectors are hybrid CMOS detectors (HCDs) capable of event-driven readout, developed by Teledyne Imaging Sensors and Penn State University. We present initial results from measurements of the first of these detectors, demonstrating their capabilities and performance in both full-frame and event-driven readout modes. These include dark current, read noise, gain variation, and energy resolution measurements from the first two engineering-grade devices.
#### Cosmology and fundamental physics with the ELT-ANDES spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art 19th century spectroscopy led to the discovery of quantum mechanics, and 20th century spectroscopy led to the confirmation of quantum electrodynamics. State-of-the-art 21st century astrophysical spectrographs, especially ANDES at ESO's ELT, have another opportunity to play a key role in the search for, and characterization of, the new physics which is known to be out there, waiting to be discovered. We rely on detailed simulations and forecast techniques to discuss four important examples of this point: big bang nucleosynthesis, the evolution of the cosmic microwave background temperature, tests of the universality of physical laws, and a real-time model-independent mapping of the expansion history of the universe (also known as the redshift drift). The last two are among the flagship science drivers for the ELT. We also highlight what is required for the ESO community to be able to play a meaningful role in 2030s fundamental cosmology and show that, even if ANDES only provides null results, such `minimum guaranteed science' will be in the form of constraints on key cosmological paradigms: these are independent from, and can be competitive with, those obtained from traditional cosmological probes.
#### An Algorithm to Mitigate Charge Migration Effects in Data from the Near  Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16301
 - **Abstract**
 We present an algorithm that mitigates the effects of charge migration due to the "brighter-fatter effect'' (BFE) that occurs for highly illuminated stars in the Teledyne HAWAII-2RG detectors used in the NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec science instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The impact of this effect is most significant for photometry and spectrophotometry of bright stars in data for which the point spread function (PSF) is undersampled, which is the case for several observing modes of the NIRISS instrument. The main impact of the BFE to NIRISS data is incorrect count rate determinations for pixels in the central regions of PSFs of bright stars due to jump detections that are caused by charge migration from peak pixels to surrounding pixels. The effect is especially significant for bright compact sources in resampled, distortion-free images produced by the drizzle algorithm: quantitatively, apparent flux losses of $>$ 50% can occur in such images due to the BFE. We describe the algorithm of the "charge_migration'' mitigation step that has been implemented in version 10.0 of the operational JWST calibration pipeline as of Dec 5, 2023. We illustrate the impact of this step in terms of the resulting improvements of the precision of imaging photometry of point sources. The algorithm renders the effects of the BFE on photometry and surface brightness measurements to stay within 1%.
#### The search for the lost attractor

 - **Abstract**
 N-body systems characterized by inverse square attractive forces may display a self similar collapse known as the gravo-thermal catastrophe. In star clusters, collapse is halted by binary stars, and a large fraction of Milky Way clusters may have already reached this phase. It has been speculated -- with guidance from simulations -- that macroscopic variables such as central density and velocity dispersion are governed post-collapse by an effective, low-dimensional system of ODEs. It is still hard to distinguish chaotic, low dimensional motion, from high dimensional stochastic noise. Here we apply three machine learning tools to state-of-the-art dynamical simulations to constrain the post collapse dynamics: topological data analysis (TDA) on a lag embedding of the relevant time series, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDY), and Tests of Accuracy with Random Points (TARP).

 The ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph (ANDES) is the optical and near-infrared high-resolution echelle spectrograph envisioned for the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). We present a selection of science cases, supported by new calculations and simulations, where ANDES could enable major advances in the fields of stars and stellar populations. We focus on three key areas, including the physics of stellar atmospheres, structure, and evolution; stars of the Milky Way, Local Group, and beyond; and the star-planet connection. The key features of ANDES are its wide wavelength coverage at high spectral resolution and its access to the large collecting area of the ELT. These features position ANDES to address the most compelling and potentially transformative science questions in stellar astrophysics of the decades ahead, including questions which cannot be anticipated today.
#### Helioseismic Investigation of Quasi-biennial Oscillation Source Regions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16331
 - **Abstract**
 We studied the temporal evolution of quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) using acoustic mode oscillation frequencies from the Global Oscillation Network Group. The data used here span over more than 25 yr, covering solar cycles 23 and 24 and the ascending phase of cycle 25. The analysis reveals that the QBO-like signals are present in both the cycles, but with different periods. The dominant QBO period in cycle 23 is found to be about 2 yr while it is about 3 yr in cycle 24. Furthermore, the quasi-biennial oscillatory signals are present only during the ascending and high-activity phases of cycle 23 and quickly weaken around 2005 during the declining phase. In comparison, the QBO signals are present throughout the cycle 24, starting from 2009 to 2017. We also explored the depth dependence in QBO signals and obtained a close agreement at all depths, except in the near-surface shear layer. A detailed analysis of the near-surface shear layer suggests that the source region of QBOs is probably within a few thousand kilometers just below the surface.
#### Reexamining aspects of spacetime-symmetry breaking with CMB polarization

 - **Abstract**
 The linear polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is highly sensitive to parity-violating physics at the surface of last scattering, which might cause mixing of E and B modes, an effect known as {\it cosmic birefringence}. This has until recently been problematic to detect due to its degeneracy with the instrument polarization miscalibration angle. Recently, a possible detection of a non-zero cosmic-birefringence angle was reported at $\beta={0.35^\circ}\pm 0.14^\circ$, where the miscalibration angle was simultaneously determined and subtracted from the analysis. Starting from this claim, we exploit a simple map of $\beta$ to the coupling constant of a parity-violating term in a generic effective-field theory for Lorentz and CPT violation. We show that the reported constraint on $\beta$ is consistent with current one-sided upper bounds from CMB studies of spacetime-symmetry breaking, and we discuss the implications and interpretation of this detection.
#### $5 σ$ tension between Planck cosmic microwave background and eBOSS  Lyman-alpha forest and constraints on physics beyond $Λ$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 We find that combined Planck cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data analyzed under $\Lambda$CDM are in 4.9$\sigma$ tension with eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ forest in inference of the linear matter power spectrum at wavenumber $\sim 1 h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshift = 3. Model extensions can alleviate this tension: running in the tilt of the primordial power spectrum ($\alpha_\mathrm{s} \sim -0.01$); a fraction $\sim (1 - 5)\%$ of ultra-light axion dark matter (DM) with particle mass $\sim 10^{-25}$ eV or warm DM with mass $\sim 90$ eV. The new DESI survey, coupled with high-accuracy modeling, will help distinguish the source of this discrepancy.

 The neighborhood of the Galactic black hole boasts a plethora of extended interstellar gas and dust features as well as populations of compact (unresolved, or marginally resolved) features such as the G objects. Most are well manifested in the infrared. To disentangle and characterize the infrared structure of extended features and identify compact sources, we used 3.8~$\mu$m (L' filter) data from the NIRC2 imager at the Keck Observatory and 8.6~$\mu$m (PAH1 filter) data from the VISIR imager at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to produce the highest-resolution mid-IR color-temperature map of the inner half-parsec of the Galactic Center to date. From this map, we compile a catalog of features that stand out from their background. In particular, we identify 33 compact sources that stand out against the local background temperature, 11 of which are newly identified and are candidates for being members of the G objects population. Additionally, we resolve and newly characterize the morphology of several known extended features. These results prepare the way for ongoing and future JWST studies that have access to a greater range of mid-infrared wavelengths, and thus will allow for refined estimation of the trends of dust temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical bandpass-filter observations can be simply processed to determine similar horizontal ammonia distributions above the Jovian cloud tops as mid-infrared and microwave observations. Current understanding of this distribution and its relationship to aerosol opacity, cloud-top pressure, and circulation is provided by atmospheric retrieval models using observations from major ground-based facilities and spacecraft. These techniques recover high fidelity information on the ammonia distribution but are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Part of this coverage gap - upper tropospheric abundance - can be bridged by using continuum-divided ammonia and methane absorption images as suggested by Combes and Encrenaz [1979]. In 2020-21, Jupiter was imaged in the 645 nm ammonia absorption band and adjacent continuum bands, demonstrating that the spatially-resolved optical depth in that band could be determined with a 0.28-m Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT). In 2022, a 620 nm filter was added to include methane absorption images in the same wavelength range. Methane abundance provides a constant reference against which to determine the ammonia abundance, specifically the column-averaged mole fraction above the clouds. VLT/MUSE results are compared to these SCT results and those from the TEXES mid-infrared spectrometer used on the IRTF and the Gemini telescopes. Meridional and longitudinal features are examined, including the Equatorial Zone (EZ) ammonia enhancement, the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) depletion, depletion above the Great Red Spot (GRS), and suggested enhancements over bright plumes in the northern EZ. This work demonstrates meaningful ammonia monitoring that can provide synoptic coverage and continuity between spacecraft or major ground-based facility campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a new catalog of the blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5 dataset, which contains 5355+81 BHB stars at high Galactic latitude (($|Glat|>20^{\circ}$). We combine the spectral line indices with a set of Balmer line profile selection criteria to identify the BHB stars. During the selection process, we use the line index of \ion{Ca}{2}\,K to exclude the metal-rich A-type dwarfs. We obtain their atmospheric parameters by cross-matching our BHB stars with the catalog provided by \citet{Xiang2022}. The results show that our sample is consistent with the theoretical $T_{\rm eff}$-log\,$g$ evolutionary tracks of the BHB stars, indicating that our method is robust for identifying BHB stars from the LAMOST spectra. Their spatial distribution indicates that most of our BHB stars are located in the inner halo or the disk of the Milky Way. Combined with other BHB samples from the literature, the BHB stars can cover a large Galactic volume, which makes it a better probe for studying the kinematics, dynamics, and structural characteristics of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Decayless kink oscillations, which are nearly omnipresent in the solar corona, are believed to be driven by continuously operating energy supply. In this letter, we investigate an external continuous excitation of an apparent decayless oscillation during an X1.1 flare on June 20, 2023 (SOL2023-06-20T16:42).The decayless kink oscillation was identified in the coronal loop at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths and the associated flare quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) were simultaneously observed in passbands of hard X-ray (HXR), microwave, and ultraviolet (UV) emissions. The kink oscillation is detected as a transverse oscillation of the coronal loop, which reveals five apparent cycles with an average period of about 130-10 s. The oscillation amplitude does not show any significantly decay, suggesting a decayless oscillation. At the same time, the solar flare occurs in the vicinity of the oscillating loop and exhibits five main pulses in HXR, microwave, and UV emissions, which could be regarded as flare QPPs. They have similar periods of about 100-130 s, which may indicate successive and repetitive energy releases during the flare impulsive phase. The peak of each loop oscillation cycle appears to follow the pulse of the QPPs, suggesting that the transverse oscillation is closely associated with flare QPPs. Our observations support the scenario where the repetitive energy released following flare QPPs could be invoked as external, continuously operating drivers of the apparent decayless kink oscillation.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlinear gravitational evolution induces strong nonlinearities in the observed cosmological density fields, leading to positive off-diagonal correlations in the power spectrum covariance. This has caused the information saturation in the power spectrum, e.g., the neutrino mass constraints from the nonlinear power spectra are lower than their linear counterparts by a factor of $\sim2$ at $z=0$. In this paper, we explore how nonlinear reconstruction methods improve the cosmological information from nonlinear cosmic fields. By applying nonlinear reconstruction to cold dark matter fields from the Quijote simulations, we find that nonlinear reconstruction can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters significantly, nearly reaching the linear theory limit. For neutrino mass, the result is only $12\%$ lower than the linear power spectrum, i.e., the theoretical best result. This makes nonlinear reconstruction an efficient and useful method to extract neutrino information from current and upcoming galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based framework has been developed for foreground mitigation from data collected by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR), to measure the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn. However, it has been noted that through this method there can be a significant amount of signal loss if the EoR signal covariance is misestimated. To obtain better covariance models, we propose to use a kernel trained on the {\tt GRIZZLY} simulations using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) based algorithm. In this work, we explore the abilities of this Machine Learning based kernel (VAE kernel) used with GPR, by testing it on mock signals from a variety of simulations, exploring noise levels corresponding to $\approx$10 nights ($\approx$141 hours) and $\approx$100 nights ($\approx$1410 hours) of observations with LOFAR. Our work suggests the possibility of successful extraction of the 21-cm signal within 2$\sigma$ uncertainty in most cases using the VAE kernel, with better recovery of both shape and power than with previously used covariance models. We also explore the role of the excess noise component identified in past applications of GPR and additionally analyse the possibility of redshift dependence on the performance of the VAE kernel. The latter allows us to prepare for future LOFAR observations at a range of redshifts, as well as compare with results from other telescopes.

 The EBLM project aims to characterise very low-mass stars that are companions to solar-type stars in eclipsing binaries. We describe the history and motivation for this project, the methodology we use to obtain precise mass, radius and effective temperature estimates for very low-mass M-dwarfs, and review results of the EBLM study and those from related projects. We show that radius inflation in fully-convective stars is a more subtle effect than was previously thought based on less precise measurements, i.e. the mass-radius-effective temperature relations we observe for fully-convective stars in single-line eclipsing binaries show reasonable agreement with theoretical models, particularly if we account for the M-dwarf metallicity, as inferred from the analysis of the primary star spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Ongoing improvements of sub-mm- and mm-range interferometers and single-dish radiotelescopes are progressively allowing the detailed study of planetary nebulae (PNe) in molecular species other than 12CO and 13CO. We are implementing a new set of tables for extending the capabilities of the morpho-kinematical modelling tool SHAPE+shapemol, so radiative transfer in molecular species beyond 12CO and 13CO, namely C17O, C18O, HCN, HNC, CS, SiO, HCO+, and N2H+, are enabled under the Large Velocity Gradient approximation with the ease of use of SHAPE. We present preliminary results on the simultaneous analysis of a plethora of IRAM-30m and HERSCHEL/HIFI spectra, and NOEMA maps of different species in the pre-PN nebula M~1-92, which show interesting features such as a previously undetected pair of polar, turbulent, high-temperature blobs, or a 17O/18O isotopic ratio of 1.7, which indicates the AGB should have turned C-rich, as opposed to the apparent nature of its O-rich nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 With JWST slated to gain high fidelity time dependent data on brown dwarf atmospheres, it is highly anticipated to do the same for directly imaged, sub-Jupiter exoplanets. With this new capability, the need for a full 3D understanding to explain spectral features and their time dependence is becoming an vital aspect for consideration. To examine the atmospheric properties of directly imaged sub-Jupiter exoplanets, we use the three dimensional Exo-FMS general circulation model (GCM) to simulate a metal enhanced generic young sub-Jupiter object. We couple Exo-FMS to a kinetic chemistry scheme, a tracer based cloud formation scheme and a spectral radiative-transfer model to take into account the chemical and cloud feedback on the atmospheric thermochemical and dynamical properties. Our results show a highly complex feedback between clouds and chemistry onto the 3D temperature structure of the atmosphere, bringing about latitudinal differences and inducing time-dependent stormy features at photospheric pressures. This suggests a strong connection and feedback between the spatial cloud coverage and chemical composition of the atmosphere, with the temperature changes and dynamical motions induced by cloud opacity feedback driving chemical species behaviour. In addition, we also produce latitude dependent and time dependent spectra of our model to investigate atmospheric variability and periodicity in commonly used photometric bands. Overall, our efforts put the included physics in 3D simulations of exoplanets on par with contemporary 1D radiative-convective equilibrium modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a noteworthy transient event in the optical light curves of ztf18aanlzzf (SDSS J161259.83+421940.3), identified as a Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) exhibiting merging patterns in the optical image. The 16-year long-term archived light curve revealed that this target stays in a steady state, while three flares occurred within the past 5 years with time separations ranging from 1 year to 3.5 years. The flare patterns of rapid brightening and slow decline following the peak, coupled with distinctive spectral features with strong He {\sc ii} and rare appearance of Bowen fluorescence line emissions, indicate at least two Tidal Eruption Event (TDE) flares in ztf18aanlzzf with a time separation of 3.5 years. We also apply TiDE light curve modeling and yield a Black Hole (BH) mass of $\sim 10^{6}\ M_{\odot}$, which is consistent with the BH mass measured from single-epoch spectra. Besides, the observed time lags $3.90_{-2.00}^{+2.06}$ days between the g and r bands strongly disagree with the prediction of the standard accretion disk model, highlighting the intricate interaction in the inner region related to the TDE. The reoccurrence gap of these TDEs, surpassing the previously reported repeated TDEs, can be attributed to binary star tidal disruption by a binary SMBH. Notably, the frequent TDE flares observed in this ULIRG-like target align with findings in a previous report for another ULIRG, suggesting a potentially elevated TDE rate in ULIRGs. Systematic variability studies of ULIRGs may help verify whether ULIRGs indeed have higher TDE rates.

 - **Abstract**
 The Red Rectangle is a nebula surrounding the post-AGB star HD 44179. It is the prototype of a particular class of nebulae associated with post-AGB binaries characterised by the presence of stable circumbinary disks in (quasi-)Keplerian rotation. Here we present the results of new high-resolution (20-50 mas) ALMA observations of continuum and line emissions at 0.9 mm. The continuum maps are analysed through a simple model of dust emission, which can reproduce the observational data. We find that most dust emission in the Red Rectangle is concentrated in the central regions of the rotating disk and that the settlement of dust grains onto the equatorial plane is very significant, particularly in comparison with the much larger scale height displayed by the gas distribution. The diameter of the dust-emitting region is about 250 au, with a total width of about 50 au. This region coincides with the warm PDR where certain molecules (like HCN), CI, and CII are presumably formed, as well as probably PAHs. From the spectral index, we confirm the presence in the disk of large grains, with a typical radius of about 0.150 mm, which supports the long-lived hypothesis for this structure. We also confirm the existence of a compact ionised wind at the centre of the nebula, probably emerging from the accretion disk around the companion, for which we derive an extent of about 10 au and a total flux of 8 mJy. We also briefly present the results on molecular lines of 12CO, 13CO, and other less abundant species.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution absorption spectroscopy toward bright background sources has had a paramount role in understanding early galaxy formation, the evolution of the intergalactic medium and the reionisation of the Universe. However, these studies are now approaching the boundaries of what can be achieved at ground-based 8-10m class telescopes. The identification of primeval systems at the highest redshifts, within the reionisation epoch and even into the dark ages, and of the products of the first generation of stars and the chemical enrichment of the early Universe, requires observing very faint targets with a signal-to-noise ratio high enough to detect very faint spectral signatures. In this paper, we describe the giant leap forward that will be enabled by ANDES, the high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT, in these key science fields, together with a brief, non-exhaustive overview of other extragalactic research topics that will be pursued by this instrument, and its synergistic use with other facilities that will become available in the early 2030s.
#### The Role of Type Ia Supernovae in Constraining the Hubble Constant

 - **Abstract**
 In the conventional / most studied local distance ladder measurements, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are used in two of the three rungs. In the second rung, their luminosities are calibrated by standard candles like Cepheids or Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). In the third rung, the high luminosities and standardizability allow SNe to be used to calibrate the `Hubble' relation between distances and redshifts. Locally, the majority of distance ladder analyses find a high value of the Hubble Constant $H_0$ of $>70$ km/s/Mpc. Given the discrepancy with the inferred value using CMB observations, great scrutiny must be given to the role supernovae play in measuring $H_0$. Here, we review the main methodology, the many crosschecks for the supernova component of the distance ladder, and the various systematics studied. We review the important role supernovae play to explain the small disagreements seen from various local analyses. We also discuss analyses that employ an inverse distance ladder, which use similar sets of supernovae, but in the reverse direction, and yield a low value of $H_0$. We conclude given all available evidence, it is difficult to find a way that a systematic in supernovae measurements, or a non-$\Lambda$CDM component of the universe which could be measured with supernovae, can help explain the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present a unified model for the cosmological dark sector. The theory is based on a simple minimally coupled scalar field whose action only contains a canonical kinetic term and is invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff). The model has the same number of free parameters as $\Lambda$CDM. We confront the predictions of the model at the background level with data from Planck 2018 CMB distance priors, Pantheon+ and SH0ES SNIa distance moduli, BAO data points from 6dFGS, BOSS, eBOSS and DES and measurements of the Hubble parameter from cosmic chronometers. The model provides excellent results in the joint fit analysis, showing very strong evidence compared to $\Lambda$CDM in the deviance information criterion (DIC). We also show that the Hubble tension between Planck 2018 and SH0ES measurements can be alleviated in the unified TDiff model although further analysis is still needed.

 - **Abstract**
 The current expansion rate of the Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$, is an important cosmological quantity. However, two different ways to measure its value do not agree -- building a low-redshift distance ladder leads to a higher value of $H_0$ than inferring it from high-redshift observations in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Most approaches to solve this tension either act at very low redshift by modifying the local distance ladder, or at high redshift by introducing new physics that changes the normalization of the inverse distance ladder. Here we discuss a way to address the Hubble tension at intermediate redshifts instead. By keeping the low- and high-redshift normalizations unchanged, we find a violation of the distance duality in the redshift range where luminosity and angular diameter distances overlap. We 'solve' this problem by introducing a redshift-dependent systematic effect that brings the luminosity distance into agreement with the angular diameter distance. The resulting expansion history is no longer compatible with $\Lambda$CDM, but this can be fixed with a dynamical dark energy component. In this way, we are able to solve the Hubble tension at intermediate redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy is a proven technique to study a transiting exoplanet's atmosphere. However, stellar surface inhomogeneities, spots and faculae, alter the observed transmission spectra: the stellar contamination effect. The variable nature of the stellar activity also makes it difficult to stitch together multi-epoch observations and evaluate any potential variability in the exoplanet's atmosphere. This paper introduces SAGE, a tool to correct for the time-dependent impact of stellar activity on transmission spectra. It uses a pixelation approach to model the stellar surface with spots and faculae, while fully accounting for limb-darkening and rotational line-broadening. The current version is designed for low to medium-resolution spectra. We used SAGE to evaluate stellar contamination for F to M-type hosts, testing various spot sizes and locations, and quantify the impact of limb-darkening. We find that limb-darkening enhances the importance of the spot location on the stellar disk, with spots close to the disk center impacting the transmission spectra more strongly than spots near the limb. Moreover, due to the chromaticity of limb darkening, the shape of the contamination spectrum is also altered. Additionally, SAGE can be used to retrieve the properties and distribution of active regions on the stellar surface from photometric monitoring. We demonstrate this for WASP-69 using TESS data, finding that two spots at mid-latitudes and a combined coverage fraction of $\sim$1% are favoured. SAGE allows us to connect the photometric variability to the stellar contamination of transmission spectra, enhancing our ability to jointly interpret transmission spectra obtained at different epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 Using deep, narrowband imaging of the nearby spiral galaxy M101, we present stellar age information across the full extent of the disk of M101. Our narrowband filters measure age-sensitive absorption features such as the Balmer lines and the slope of the continuum between the Balmer break and 4000 \r{A} break. We interpret these features in the context of inside-out galaxy formation theories and dynamical models of spiral structure. We confirm the galaxy's radial age gradient, with the mean stellar age decreasing with radius. In the relatively undisturbed main disk, we find that stellar ages get progressively older with distance across a spiral arm, consistent with the large-scale shock scenario in a quasi-steady spiral wave pattern. Unexpectedly, we find the same pattern across spiral arms in the outer disk as well, beyond the corotation radius of the main spiral pattern. We suggest that M101 has a dynamic, or transient, spiral pattern with multiple pattern speeds joined together via mode coupling to form coherent spiral structure. This scenario connects together the radial age gradient inherent to inside-out galaxy formation with the across-arm age gradients predicted by dynamic spiral arm theories across the full radial extent of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-metal-rich (SMR) stars, currently in the solar neighbourhood, are expected to originate only in the inner Galaxy and have definitely migrated. We aim at studying a large sample of SMR stars to provide constraints on the epoch of the bar formation and its impact on the MW disc stellar populations. We investigate a sample of 169,701 MSTO and SGB stars with 6D phase space information and high-quality stellar parameters coming from the hybrid-CNN analysis of the Gaia-DR3 RVS stars. We compute distances and ages using the StarHorse code with a mean precision of 1% and 11%, respectively. From these, 11,848 stars have metallicity ([Fe/H]) above 0.15 dex. We report a metallicity dependence of spatial distribution of stellar orbits shown by the bimodal distribution in the guiding radius at 6.9 and 7.9 kpc, first appearing at [Fe/H]~0.1 dex, becoming very pronounced at larger [Fe/H]. In addition, we've observed a trend where the most metal-rich stars, with [Fe/H]~0.4 dex, are predominantly old (9-12 Gyrs) but show a gradual decline in [Fe/H] with age, reaching around 0.25 dex at about 4 Gyrs ago, followed by a sharp drop around 3 Gyrs ago. Furthermore, our full dataset reveals a clear peak in the age-metallicity relationship during the same period, indicating a SF burst around 3-4 Gyrs ago with slightly sub-solar [Fe/H] and enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe]. We show the SMR stars are good tracers of the bar activity. We interpret the steep decrease in number of SMR stars at around 3 Gyr as the end of the bar formation epoch. In this scenario, the peak of bar activity also coincides with a peak in the SF activity in the disc. Although the SF burst around 3 Gyr ago has been reported previously, its origin was unclear. Here, we suggest the SF burst to have been triggered by the high bar activity, 3-4 Gyr ago. According to these results and interpretation, the MW bar could be young.

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) aims to understand the evolution of the chemistry of inner protoplanetary disks using the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With a growing sample of >30 disks, the survey implements a custom method to calibrate the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) to contrasts of better than 1:300 across its 4.9-28 micron spectral range. This is achieved using observations of Themis-family asteroids as precise empirical reference sources. High spectral contrast enables precise retrievals of physical parameters, searches for rare molecular species and isotopologues, and constraints on the inventories of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species. JDISCS also offers significant improvements to the MRS wavelength and resolving power calibration. We describe the JDISCS calibrated data and demonstrate its quality using observations of the disk around the solar-mass young star FZ Tau. The FZ Tau MIRI spectrum is dominated by strong emission from warm water vapor. We show that the water and CO line emission originates from the disk surface and traces a range of gas temperatures of ~500-1500 K. We retrieve parameters for the observed CO and H2O lines, and show that they are consistent with a radial distribution represented by two temperature components. A high water abundance of n(H2O)~10^-4 fills the disk surface at least out to the 350 K isotherm at 1.5 au. We search the FZ Tau environs for extended emission detecting a large (radius of ~300 au) ring of emission from H2 gas surrounding FZ Tau, and discuss its origin.
