 - **Abstract**
 We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS $H$ and $K$-band (R $\sim$ 70) high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of directly-imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is well reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\rm eff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio. Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the companion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${46.6}_{-5.7}^{+2.9}$$^{o}$) and dynamical mass (${51.7}_{-2.5}^{+2.6}$$M_{\rm J}$) than derived from imaging data and \textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a prime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding detailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model to estimate the average primary masses, companion mass ranges, the inclination limit for recognizing a rotational variable, and the primary mass spreads for populations of binary stars. The model fits a population's binary mass function distribution and allows for a probability that some mass functions are incorrectly estimated. Using tests with synthetic data, we assess the model's sensitivity to each parameter, finding that we are most sensitive to the average primary mass and the minimum companion mass, with less sensitivity to the inclination limit and little to no sensitivity to the primary mass spread. We apply the model to five populations of binary spotted rotational variables identified in ASAS-SN, computing their binary mass functions using RV data from APOGEE. Their average primary mass estimates are consistent with our expectations based on their CMD locations ($\sim0.75 M_{\odot}$ for lower main sequence primaries and $\sim 0.9$--$1.2 M_{\odot}$ for RS CVn and sub-subgiants). Their companion mass range estimates allow companion masses down to $M_2/M_1\simeq0.1$, although the main sequence population may have a higher minimum mass fraction ($\sim0.4$). We see weak evidence of an inclination limit $\gtrsim50^{\circ}$ for the main sequence and sub-subgiant groups and no evidence of an inclination limit in the other groups. No groups show strong evidence for a preferred primary mass spread. We conclude by demonstrating that the approach will provide significantly better estimates of the primary mass and the minimum mass ratio and reasonable sensitivity to the inclination limit with 10 times as many systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present {\sc Venice}, an operator splitting algorithm to integrate a numerical model on a hierarchy of timescales. {\sc Venice} allows a wide variety of different physical processes operating a different scales to be coupled on individual and adaptive time-steps. It therewith mediates the development of complex multi-scale and multi-physics simulation environments with a wide variety of independent components. The coupling between various physical models and scales is dynamic, and realized through (Strang) operators splitting using adaptive time steps. We demonstrate the functionality and performance of this algorithm using astrophysical models of a stellar cluster, first coupling gravitational dynamics and stellar evolution, then coupling internal gravitational dynamics with dynamics within a galactic background potential, and finally combining these models while also introducing dwarf galaxy-like perturbers. These tests show numerical convergence for decreasing coupling timescales, demonstrate how {\sc Venice} can improve the performance of a simulation by shortening coupling timescales when appropriate, and provide a case study of how {\sc Venice} can be used to gradually build up and tune a complex multi-physics model. Although the examples couple complete numerical models, {\sc Venice} can also be used to efficiently solve systems of stiff differential equations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we model the high-energy tail of observed solar energetic proton energy distributions with a kappa distribution function. We employ a technique for deriving the thermodynamic parameters of solar energetic proton populations measured by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) EPI-Hi high energy telescope (HET), over energies from 10 - 60 MeV. With this technique we explore, for the first time, the characteristic thermodynamic properties of the solar energetic protons associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and its driven shock. We find that (1) the spectral index, or equivalently, the thermodynamic parameter kappa of solar energetic protons ($\kappa_{\rm EP}$) gradually increases starting from the pre-ICME region (upstream of the CME-driven shock), reaching a maximum in the CME ejecta ($\kappa_{\rm EP} \approx 3.5$), followed by a gradual decrease throughout the trailing portion of the CME; (2) solar energetic proton temperature and density ($T_{\rm EP}$ and $n_{\rm EP}$) appear anti-correlated, a behavior consistent to sub-isothermal polytropic processes; and (3) values of $T_{\rm EP}$ and $\kappa_{\rm EP}$ appear are positively correlated, indicating an increasing entropy with time. Therefore, these proton populations are characterized by a complex and evolving thermodynamic behavior, consisting of multiple sub-isothermal polytropic processes, and a large-scale trend of increasing temperature, kappa, and entropy. This study and its companion study by Livadiotis et al. (2024) open a new set of procedures for investigating the thermodynamic behavior of energetic particles and their shared thermal properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hartmann test is a method used to measure the wavefront error in a focal optical system, wherein a mask with a pattern of small holes is placed at the system's aperture stop. By taking an image at a defocused plane, the differences between the ideal and real positions of the reimaged holes (called the transverse ray aberrations) can be measured, which can then be used to estimate the wavefront error. However, the Hartmann test is usually used with an on-axis field. In this paper, we present a wavefront sensing method which generalizes the classical Hartmann test for off-axis field angles and arbitrary reference wavefronts. Our method involves taking images at two defocused planes, and then using the real reimaged hole positions on both planes to estimate the trajectories of rays from the system's exit pupil, at which the reference wavefront is situated. We then propagate the rays forward from the reference wavefront to one of the two defocused planes, in order to find the ideal reimaged hole positions, from which we can compute transverse ray aberrations. We derive and solve a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations relating transverse ray aberrations to wavefront error, using Zernike decomposition and nonlinear least squares. Our method has been verified on simulated data from the 7-lens f/2.25 red camera system of the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF), a high resolution optical echelle spectrograph which will be a first light instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT).

          Evidence for Rapid Variability at High Energies in GRBs

 - **Abstract**
 Intrinsic variability was searched for in arrival times of six gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at high energies -- between 30 MeV and 2 GeV -- detected by the Fermi satellite's Large Area Telescope (LAT). The GRBs were selected from the Fermi LAT catalog with preference for events with numerous photons, a strong initial pulse, and measured redshifts. Three long GRBs and three short GRBs were selected and tested. Two different variability-detection algorithms were deployed, one counting photons in pairs, and the other multiplying time gaps between photons. In both tests, a real GRB was compared to 1000 Monte-Carlo versions of itself smoothed over a wide range of different timescales. The minimum detected variability timescales for long bursts (GRB 080916C, GRB 090926A, GRB 131108A) was found to be (0.005, 10.0, 10.0) seconds for the photon pair test and (2.0, 20.0, 10.0) seconds for the time-gap multiplication test. Additionally, the minimum detected variability timescales for the short bursts (GRB 090510, GRB 140619B, GRB 160709A) was found to be (0.05, 0.01, 20.0) seconds for the photon pair test and (0.05, 0.01, 20.0) seconds for the gap multiplication test. Statistical uncertainties in these times are about a factor of 2. The durations of these variability timescales may be used to constrain the geometry, dynamics, speed, cosmological dispersion, Lorentz-invariance violations, weak equivalence principle violations, and GRB models.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded eccentric planet is an important, long-standing problem, which has been not yet been conclusively explored. Here we study the torque and associated orbital evolution of an eccentric planet in a two-dimensional disc via the semi-analytical, fully global linear approach. Our methodology has the advantage that the spatial structure of the density waves launched by the planet is solved for fully. This allows us to account for the possibility of torque excitation over an extended radial interval for each Fourier harmonic of the perturbation, as opposed to earlier approximate treatments localized around Lindblad and corotation resonances. We systematically explore the torque behaviour across the space of disc properties (assuming power law profiles for the disc surface density and temperature), including the aspect ratio. Crucially, we examine the torque variation as the orbital eccentricity becomes supersonic relative to the gas motion (when planetary eccentricity is of order the disc aspect ratio), finding that the torque robustly reverses its sign near this transition. We also find that for shallow surface density gradients planetary migration may become outwards beyond this transition, although the rapid eccentricity damping (which is typically $\sim 10^2$ times faster than the orbital migration rate) would quickly restore inwards migration as the planet circularizes. Our self-consistently computed torques are in qualitative agreement with past numerical studies of eccentric planet-disc coupling. We provide our torque data for different disc parameters to the community for future testing and implementation in population synthesis studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions, characterized by dense environments, experience frequent encounters that significantly influence binary systems, leading to their hardening, softening, or ionization. We extend the Hut \& Bahcall formalism to derive an analytical expression for the ionization cross-section in extreme mass ratio binary systems, allowing us to investigate the orbital evolution and population dynamics of binary planets and binary brown dwarfs in star clusters, while considering ongoing binary system formation. Our findings reveal that for low-mass soft binaries, the semi-major axis distribution asymptotes to a universal power law between $\propto a^{-8/3}$ and $\propto a^{-5/3}$ over the derived ionization timescale. We also discuss the implications of our results for the candidate Jupiter-mass binary objects putatively reported in the Trapezium cluster. We demonstrate that if their existence is verified, they likely form continuously with a spectrum proportional to $a^{1}$, aligning better with the ejection mechanism than with the in-situ formation mechanism, which predicts a distribution roughly proportional to $a^{-1}$. However, this implies an impractically high ejection formation rate. Alternatively, if these objects are binary brown dwarfs, continuous in-situ formation ($\propto a^{-1}$) with an initial minimal semi-major axis around 20 AU and a formation rate of 100 Myr$^{-1}$ plausibly matches the observed number of single objects, binary number, binary fraction, and semi-major axis distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new window to study highly reddened explosive transients. We present results from late-time (1421 days post-explosion) JWST follow-up spectroscopic observations with NIRSpec and MIRI LRS of the intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) AT 2019abn located in the nearby Messier 51 galaxy (8.6 Mpc). ILRTs represent a mysterious class of transients which exhibit peak luminosities between those of classical novae and supernovae and which are known to be highly dust obscured. Similar to the prototypical examples of this class of objects, NGC 300 2008-OT and SN 2008S, AT 2019abn has an extremely red and dusty progenitor detected only in pre-explosion Spitzer/IRAC imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 micron and not in deep optical or near-infrared HST images. We find that late time observations of AT 2019abn from NEOWISE and JWST are consistent with the late time evolution of SN 2008S. In part because they are so obscured by dust, it is unknown what produces an ILRT with hypotheses ranging from high mass stellar merger events, non-terminal stellar outbursts, or terminal supernovae explosions through electron-capture in super-AGB stars. Our JWST observations show strong mid-IR Class C PAH features at 6.3 and 8.25 micron typical of carbon-rich post-AGB sources. These features suggest the dust around AT 2019abn, either pre-existing or newly formed in the ejecta, is composed of carbonaceous grains which are not typically observed around red supergiants. However, depending on the strength and temperature of hot bottom burning, SAGBs may be expected to exhibit a carbon-rich chemistry. Thus our JWST observations are consistent with AT 2019abn having an SAGB progenitor.

          Stage IV baryonic feedback correction for non-Gaussianity inference

 - **Abstract**
 Non-Gaussian statistics of the projected weak lensing field are powerful estimators that can outperform the constraining power of the two-point functions in inferring cosmological parameters. This is because these estimators extract the non-Gaussian information contained in the small scales. However, fully leveraging the statistical precision of such estimators is hampered by theoretical uncertainties, such as those arising from baryonic physics. Moreover, as non-Gaussian estimators mix different scales, there exists no natural cut-off scale below which baryonic feedback can be completely removed. We therefore present a Bayesian solution for accounting for baryonic feedback uncertainty in weak lensing non-Gaussianity inference. Our solution implements Bayesian model averaging (BMA), a statistical framework that accounts for model uncertainty and combines the strengths of different models to produce more robust and reliable parameter inferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a Stage IV convergence peak counts analysis, including three baryonic feedback models. We find that the resulting BMA posterior distribution safeguards parameter inference against biases due to baryonic feedback, and therefore provides a robust framework for obtaining accurate cosmological constraints at Stage IV precision under model uncertainty scenarios.

          Neutrino Oscillation Effects on the Luminosity of Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Flows Around Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar-mass black hole surrounded by the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is proposed to be the central engine of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we investigate the neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity from the NDAF and pair-annihilation model, taking into account the neutrino oscillation above the accretion disk. The disk hydrodynamical properties are modelled using the empirical solution previously derived with boundary conditions including the effect of electron degeneracy and neutrino trapping. Our key parameters are the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin given in the range of $\dot{M} = 0.1$ - $10$ $M_\odot$ s$^{-1}$ and $ 0 \le a < 1$, respectively. Without neutrino oscillation, the obtained neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity is $\sim 10^{51}$ - $10^{53}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, while the neutrino annihilation luminosity is found to be $\sim 10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. In the presence of neutrino oscillation in the vacuum limit, the electron neutrino annihilation luminosity decreases by $\lesssim 22\%$ through the flavor transformation, while the muon- and tau-neutrino luminosity can increase up to $\sim 45\%$ and $ 60\%$, respectively. As a result, the total annihilation luminosity can be reduced up to $\sim 19\%$ due to the oscillation process above the disk. Finally, we also investigate the case whereby the CP-violating phase is changed from $\delta \textrm{CP} =$ $0^{\circ}$ to $245^{\circ}$. However, our results reveal that the CP-violating phase has minimal impact on neutrino annihilation luminosity.

 We report the spectroscopic confirmation and fundamental properties of TOI-757 b, a mini-Neptune on a 17.5-day orbit transiting a bright star ($V = 9.7$ mag) discovered by the TESS mission. We acquired high-precision radial velocity measurements with the HARPS, ESPRESSO, and PFS spectrographs to confirm the planet detection and determine its mass. We also acquired space-borne transit photometry with the CHEOPS space telescope to place stronger constraints on the planet radius, supported with ground-based LCOGT photometry. WASP and KELT photometry were used to help constrain the stellar rotation period. We also determined the fundamental parameters of the host star. We find that TOI-757 b has a radius of $R_{\mathrm{p}} = 2.5 \pm 0.1 R_{\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_{\mathrm{p}} = 10.5^{+2.2}_{-2.1} M_{\oplus}$, implying a bulk density of $\rho_{\text{p}} = 3.6 \pm 0.8$ g cm$^{-3}$. Our internal composition modeling was unable to constrain the composition of TOI-757 b, highlighting the importance of atmospheric observations for the system. We also find the planet to be highly eccentric with $e$ = 0.39$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, making it one of the very few highly eccentric planets among precisely characterized mini-Neptunes. Based on comparisons to other similar eccentric systems, we find a likely scenario for TOI-757 b's formation to be high eccentricity migration due to a distant outer companion. We additionally propose the possibility of a more intrinsic explanation for the high eccentricity due to star-star interactions during the earlier epoch of the Galactic disk formation, given the low metallicity and older age of TOI-757.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard model of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), all neutrinos are assumed to be in pure flavor eigenstates in CCSN cores, but the assumption becomes invalid if neutrino distributions are unstable to flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a study of the occurrences of two representative neutrino-flavor instabilities, fast- and collisional flavor instabilities, in the cooling phase of proto-neutron star (PNS) from 1- to 50 seconds. We follow the long-term evolution of a PNS under spherically symmetric and quasi-static approximations, in which the matter profile is determined by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with neutrino feedback under the treatment of multi-group flux limited diffusion. For the stability analysis of neutrino flavor conversions, we recompute neutrino distributions using Monte Carlo transport in order to obtain the full angular distribution needed to compute the dispersion relations. We find no signs of flavor conversions in our models; the physical reason is thoroughly investigated. We also argue that the negative conclusion in flavor conversions could be changed qualitatively if multi-dimensional effects are included, as similar to cases in the earlier phase of CCSN.

 We present the detection and characterization of fluctuations in linearly polarized emission from the atmosphere above the South Pole. These measurements make use of Austral winter survey data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We use the cross-correlation between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q, and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by Kolmogorov turbulence. The signal is most significant at large angular scales, high observing frequency, and low elevation angle. Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 years of winter observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified experiment and observation strategy. For the SPT-3G data, downweighting the small fraction of significantly contaminated observations is an effective mitigation strategy. In addition, we present a strategy for further improving sensitivity on large angular scales where maps made in the 220 GHz band are used to measure and subtract the polarized atmosphere signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In observations with the SPT-3G instrument at the South Pole, the polarized atmospheric signal is a well-understood and sub-dominant contribution to the measured noise after implementing the mitigation strategies described here.

 - **Abstract**
 As a byproduct of our search for Galactic stellar systems with gamma-ray emission, we have identified an unrelated cool and evolved star (IRC-10412) that attracted our attention due to its strong radio emission level with a spectral index matching, almost perfectly, the canonical +0.6 value expected from an ionized stellar wind. A follow-up observational analysis was undertaken given that these two properties are hard to reconcile as originating in the same stellar object. As a result, IRC-10412 has been classified as a new semiregular variable of SRb type in the asymptotic giant branch, and different but consistent estimates of its mass-loss parameter are reported. We propose that its unusually high radio emission arises from a ~ 1E-5 Msun/yr stellar wind exposed to an external source of ionizing photons, possibly coming from nearby OB associations.

 - **Abstract**
 Additive manufacture (AM) involves creating a part layer by layer and is a rapidly evolving manufacturing process. It has multiple strengths that apply to space-based optics, such as the ability to consolidate multiple parts into one, reducing the number of interfaces. The process also allows for greater mass reduction, making parts more cost-effective to launch, achieved by optimising the shape for intended use or creating intricate geometries like lattices. However, previous studies have highlighted issues associated with the AM process. For example, when trying to achieve high-precision optical surfaces on AM parts, the latticing on the underside of mirrors can provide insufficient support during machining, resulting in the quilting effect. This paper builds on previous work and explores such challenges further. This will be implemented by investigating ways to apply AM to a deployable mirror from a CubeSat project called A-DOT. The reflective surface has a spherical radius of curvature of 682 mm and approximate external dimensions of 106 mm x 83 mm. The aim is to produce two mirrors that will take full advantage of AM design benefits and account for the challenges in printing and machining a near-net shape. The designs will have reduced mass by using selected internal lattice designs and topology-optimised connection points, resulting in two mirrors with mass reduction targets of 50% and 70%. Once printed in aluminium using laser powder bed fusion, the reflective surface will be created using single point diamond turning. Finally, an evaluation of the dimensional accuracy will be conducted, using interferometry, to quantify the performance of the reflective surface.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barbá 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barbá. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.

          Exocomet orbital distribution around $\beta$ Pictoris

 - **Abstract**
 The 23 Myr young star $\beta$ Pictoris is a laboratory for planet formation studies given its observed debris disk, its two directly imaged super-Jovian planets, and the evidence of transiting extrasolar comets. The most recent evidence of exocometary transits around $\beta$ Pic came from the TESS space mission. Previous analyses of these transits constrained the orbital distribution of the underlying exocomet population to range between about 0.03 and 1.3 AU assuming a fixed transit impact parameter. Here we examine the distribution of the observed transit durations (${\Delta}t$) to infer the orbital surface density distribution ($\delta$) of the underlying exocomet sample. We show that a narrow belt of exocomets around $\beta$ Pic, in which the transit impact parameters are randomized but the orbital semimajor axes are equal, results in a pile-up of long transit durations. This is contrary to observations, which reveal a pile-up of short transit durations (${\Delta}t \approx 0.1$ d) and a tail of only a few transits with ${\Delta}t > 0.4$ d. A flat density distribution of exocomets between about 0.03 and 2.5 AU results in a better match between the resulting ${\Delta}t$ distribution and the observations but the slope of the predicted ${\Delta}t$ histogram is not sufficiently steep. An even better match to the observations can be produced with a $\delta \propto a^{\beta}$ power law. Our modeling reveals a best fit between the observed and predicted ${\Delta}t$ distribution for $\beta = -0.15_{-0.10}^{+0.05}$. A more reasonable scenario in which the exocometary trajectories are modeled as hyperbolic orbits can also reproduce the observed ${\Delta}t$ distribution to some extent. Our results imply that cometary material exists on highly eccentric orbits with a more extended range of semimajor axes than suggested by previous spectroscopic observations.

          Precise Transit Photometry Using TESS II: Revisiting 28 Additional Transiting Systems With Updated Physical Properties

 - **Abstract**
 Precise physical properties of the known transiting exoplanets are essential for their precise atmospheric characterization using modern and upcoming instruments. Leveraging the large volume of high SNR photometric follow-up data from TESS, highly precise physical properties can be estimated for these systems, especially for those discovered using ground-based instruments prior to the TESS mission. In this work, I have used the publicly available TESS follow-up data for 28 transiting systems with 10 $<$ V$_{mag}$ $<$ 10.5, with an aim to update their known physical properties. The observed lightcurves have been analysed by implementing a state-of-the-art critical noise treatment algorithm to effectively reduce both time-correlated and un-correlated noise components, using sophisticated techniques like wavelet denoising and Gaussian-process regression. Compared with the previous studies, the estimated transit parameters are found to be more precise for most of the targets, including a few cases where a larger space-based instrument like Spitzer, Kepler or CHEOPS has been used in the previous study. The large volume of transit observations used for each target has also resulted in a more accurate estimation of the physical properties, as this overcomes any error in parameter estimations from bias present in a smaller volume of data. Thus, comparing with the literature values, statistically significant improvements in the known physical properties of several targeted systems have been reported from this work. The large volume of transit timing information from the analyses was also used to search for Transit Timing Variation trends in these targets, which has resulted in no significant detection.

 - **Abstract**
 In our Solar system, spin-orbit coupling is a common phenomenon in binary asteroid systems, where the mutual orbits are no longer invariant due to exchange of angular momentum between translation and rotation. In this work, dynamical structures in phase space are explored for the problem of spin-orbit coupling by taking advantage of analytical and numerical methods. In particular, the technique of Poincaré sections is adopted to reveal numerical structures, which are dependent on the total angular momentum, the Hamiltonian, mass ratio and asphericity parameter. Analytical study based on perturbative treatments shows that high-order and/or secondary spin-orbit resonances are responsible for numerical structures arising in Poincaré sections. Analytical solutions are applied to (65803) Didymos, (80218) ${\rm VO}_{123}$ and (4383) Suruga to reveal their phase-space structures, showing that there is a high possibility for them to locate inside secondary 1:1 spin-orbit resonance.

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of deuterated acetylene (C$_2$HD) at 19.3 $\mu$m (519 cm$^{-1}$) with the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in July 2017. Six individual lines from the Q-branch of the $\nu_4$ band were clearly detected with a S/N ratio up to 10. Spectral intervals around 8.0 $\mu$m (745 cm$^{-1}$) and 13.4 $\mu$m (1247 cm$^{-1}$) containing acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) lines respectively, were observed during the same run to constrain the disk-averaged C$_2$H$_2$ abundance profile and temperature profile. Cassini observations with the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) were used to improve the flux calibration and help to constrain the atmospheric model. The measured D/H ratio in acetylene, derived from the C$_2$HD/C$_2$H$_2$ abundance ratio, is (1.22$^{+0.27}_{-0.21})$ $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, consistent with that in methane obtained in previous studies. Possible sources of fractionation at different steps of the acetylene photochemistry are investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded disks observations of the Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3. Our observations included 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of 0.''05 (7.8 au) and several molecular species including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_{2}$CO and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$. The dust continuum analysis unveiled a disk-shaped structure with a major axis size of $\sim$200 au. We observed an asymmetry in the minor axis of the continuum emission suggesting that the emission is optically thick and the disk is flared. On the other hand, we identified two prominent bumps along the major axis located at distances of 26 and 50 au from the central protostar. The origin of the bumps remains uncertain and might be due to an embedded substructure within the disk or the result of the temperature distribution instead of surface density due to optically thick continuum emission. The $^{12}$CO emission reveals a molecular outflow consisting of three distinct components: a collimated one, an intermediate velocity component exhibiting an hourglass shape, and a wider angle low-velocity component. We associate these components with the coexistence of a jet and a disk-wind. The C$^{18}$O emission traces both a Keplerian rotating circumstellar disk and the infall of the rotating envelope. We measured a stellar dynamical mass of 0.35$\pm$0.09 M$_{\odot}$.

          Detailed abundances of the planet-hosting TOI-1173 A/B system: Possible evidence of planet engulfment in a very wide binary

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last decade, studies of large samples of binary systems identified chemical anomalies, and showed that they might be attributed to planet formation or planet engulfment. However, both scenarios have primarily been tested in pairs without known exoplanets. In this work, we explore these scenarios in the newly detected planet-hosting wide binary TOI-1173 A/B (projected separation $\sim 11,400$ AU) using high-resolution MAROON-X and ARCES spectra. We determined photospheric stellar parameters both by fitting stellar models and via the spectroscopic equilibrium approach. Both analyses agree and suggest that they are cool main sequence stars located in the thin disc. A line-by-line differential analysis between the components (B$-$A) displays an abundance pattern in the condensation temperature plane where the planet-hosting star TOI-1173 A is enhanced in refractory elements such as iron by more than 0.05 dex. This suggests the engulfment of $\sim$18 M$_{\oplus}$ of rocky material in star A. Our hypothesis is supported by the dynamics of the system detailed in our companion paper Yana Galarza et al. 2024, which suggest that the Super-Neptune TOI-1173 A $b$ might have been delivered to its current short period ($\sim7$ days) through circulatization and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanisms, thereby triggering the engulfment of inner rocky exoplanets.

          Neutron star kicks plus rockets as a mechanism for forming wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our current update on the gas-phase chemical reactions and spectral lines of TiO in the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. For this purpose, we have added 229 Ti-related reactions in the chemical network. In addition, we consider 230 fine-structure energy levels, the corresponding 223 radiative transitions, and 444 collisional transitions with ortho and para H$_2$ and predict 66 TiO lines. We perform spectroscopic simulations of TiO emission from the circumstellar region of the oxygen-rich red supergiant VY Canis Majoris to validate our update. Our model reproduces the observed TiO column density. This update is helpful in modeling dust-free astrophysical environments where Ti is in the gas phase and TiO can form.

 - **Abstract**
 Using data from the first flight of SPIDER and from Planck HFI, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the SPIDER observing region. Component separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses spanning the full SPIDER region demonstrate that i) the spectral energy distribution of diffuse Galactic dust emission is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.45\pm0.05$ $(1.47\pm0.06)$ for $E$ ($B$)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; ii) its angular power spectrum is broadly consistent with a power law; and iii) there is no significant detection of line-of-sight decorrelation of the astrophysical polarization. The size of the SPIDER region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature $T_\mathrm{d}=19.6$ K, an analysis of two independent sub-regions of that field results in inferred values of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.52\pm0.06$ and $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.09\pm0.09$, which are inconsistent at the $3.9\,\sigma$ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within a subset of the SPIDER region is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than $3\,\sigma$, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. These modeling uncertainties have a small--but non-negligible--impact on limits on the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio derived from the \spider dataset. The fidelity of the component separation approaches of future CMB polarization experiments may thus have a significant impact on their constraining power.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a formalism to extract the angular power spectrum of fields sampled at a finite number of points with arbitrary positions -- a common situation for several catalog-based astrophysical probes -- through a simple extension of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ algorithm. A key complication in this case is the need to handle the shot noise component of the associated discrete angular mask which, for sparse catalogs, can lead to strong coupling between very different angular scales. We show that this problem can be solved easily by estimating this contribution analytically and subtracting it. The resulting estimator is immune to small-scale pixelization effects and aliasing, and, more interestingly, unbiased against the contribution from measurement noise uncorrelated between different sources. We demonstrate the validity of the method in the context of cosmic shear datasets, and showcase its usage in the case of other spin-0 and spin-1 astrophysical fields of interest. We incorporate the method in the public $\texttt{NaMaster}$ code (this https URL).
