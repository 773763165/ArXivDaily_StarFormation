 - **Abstract**
 Close binary systems present challenges to planet formation. As binary separations decrease, so too do the occurrence rates of protoplanetary disks in young systems and planets in mature systems. For systems that do retain disks, their disk masses and sizes are altered by the presence of the binary companion. Through the study of protoplanetary disks in binary systems with known orbital parameters, we seek to determine the properties that promote disk retention and, therefore, planet formation. In this work, we characterize the young binary-disk system, FO Tau. We determine the first full orbital solution for the system, finding masses of $0.35^{+0.06}_{-0.05}\ M_\odot$ and $0.34\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ for the stellar components, a semi-major axis of $22(^{+2}_{-1})$ AU, and an eccentricity of $0.21(^{+0.04}_{-0.03})$. With long-baseline ALMA interferometry, we detect 1.3mm continuum and $^{12}{\mathrm{CO}} \ (J=2-1)$ line emission toward each of the binary components; no circumbinary emission is detected. The protoplanetary disks are compact, consistent with being truncated by the binary orbit. The dust disks are unresolved in the image plane and the more extended gas disks are only marginally resolved. Fitting the continuum and CO visibilities, we determine the inclination of each disk, finding evidence for alignment of the disk and binary orbital planes. This study is the first of its kind linking the properties of circumstellar protoplanetary disks to a precisely known binary orbit. In the case of FO Tau, we find a dynamically placid environment (coplanar, low eccentricity), which may foster its potential for planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here, we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high angular resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work for eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which being previously unknown and five of substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at a angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. In combination with the system's distance this translates to a physical separation of (1.054 $\pm$ 0.002) AU. The GRAVITY data are then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enables us to further characterise them in terms of their age, effective temperature and radius by the application of evolutionary models. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular resolution direct imaging hold great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly-imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of the Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordially formed extended dark objects would accrete baryonic matter and impact the ionisation history of the Universe. Insisting on consistency with the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, we derive constraints on the dark matter fraction for various classes of objects, of different sizes. We introduce a novel scaling technique to speed up numerical calculations and release our calculation framework in the form of a Mathematica notebook. Conservatively, we focus on spherical accretion and collisional ionisation. We find strong constraints limiting the dark matter fraction to subpercent level for objects of up to $10^4$ AU in size.

 - **Abstract**
 A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, dark matter haloes are expected to deviate from spherical symmetry. Constraining the halo shapes at large galactocentric distances is challenging due to the low density of luminous tracers. The well-studied early-type galaxy NGC 5128 (Centaurus A - CenA), has a large number of radial velocities for globular clusters (GCs) and planetary nebulae (PNe) of its extended stellar halo. In this work, we aim to determine the deviation from spherical symmetry of the dark matter halo of CenA at 5 $R_{\rm e}$ using its GCs as kinematic tracers. We used the largest photometric catalogue of GC candidates to accurately characterise the spatial distribution of the relaxed population and investigated the presence of non-relaxed structures in the kinematic catalogue of GCs using the relaxed point-symmetric velocity field as determined by the host's PNe population. We used anisotropic Jeans modelling under axisymmetric assumptions together with the Gaussian likelihood and GCs as discrete tracers. The gravitational potential is generated by flattened stellar and dark matter distributions. We leveraged different orbital properties of the blue and red GCs to model them separately. We find that discrete kinematics of the GCs are consistent with being drawn from an underlying relaxed velocity field determined from PNe. The best-fit parameters of the gravitational potential recovered from the blue and red GCs separately agree well and the joint results are: $M_{200} = 1.86^{1.61}_{-0.69}\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, $M_\star/L_{\rm B} = 2.98^{+0.96}_{-0.78}$ and the flattening $q_{\rm DM} = 1.45^{+0.78}_{-0.53}$. Both GC populations show mild rotation, with red having a slightly stronger rotational signature and radially biased orbits, and blue GCs preferring negative velocity anisotropy. An oblate or a spherical dark matter halo of CenA is strongly disfavoured by our modelling.
#### Neutral Fraction of Hydrogen in the Intergalactic Medium Surrounding  High-Redshift Gamma-Ray Burst 210905A

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a key period of cosmological history in which the intergalactic medium (IGM) underwent a major phase change from being neutral to almost completely ionized. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are luminous and unique probes of their environments that can be used to study the timeline for the progression of the EoR. Here we present a detailed analysis of the ESO Very Large Telescope X-shooter spectrum of GRB 210905A, which resides at a redshift of z ~ 6.3. We focus on estimating the fraction of neutral hydrogen, xHI, on the line of sight to the host galaxy of GRB 210905A by fitting the shape of the Lyman-alpha damping wing of the afterglow spectrum. The X-shooter spectrum has a high signal to noise ratio, but the complex velocity structure of the host galaxy limits the precision of our conclusions. The statistically preferred model suggests a low neutral fraction with an 3-sigma upper limit of xHI < 0.15, indicating that the IGM around the GRB host galaxy is mostly ionized. We discuss complications in current analyses and potential avenues for future studies of the progression of the EoR and its evolution with redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained from an X-ray timing study of the new black hole candidate (BHC) Swift J1727.8-1613. The work is based on Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) observations carried out during the 2023 outburst. Prominent type-C low-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (LFQPOs) are detected throughout the observations. With the substantial effective area of the Insight-HXMT at high energies, we examine the energy dependence of various parameters, including the centroid frequency, fractional rms, and phase lags of the type-C QPOs. Our findings align closely with those observed in high-inclination systems. During the initial stage of the outburst, a peaked noise component is also detected, the frequency of which is highly correlated with the LFQPO frequency, aligning with the Psaltis-Belloni-van der Klis (PBK) relation. By assuming that the peaked noise originates from the precession of the accretion disc, the spin of this source can be constrained. Our results suggest that this source may possess a high spin.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of pulsar timing arrays have recently reported preliminary evidence for the existence of a nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave background. These analyses rely on detailed noise analyses, which are inherently complex due to the many astrophysical and instrumental factors that contribute to the pulsar noise budget. We investigate whether realistic systematic errors, stemming from misspecified noise models that fail to capture salient features of the pulsar timing noise, could bias the evidence for gravitational waves. We consider two plausible forms of misspecification: small unmodeled jumps and unmodeled chromatic noise. Using simulated data, we calculate the distribution of the commonly used optimal statistic with no signal present and using plausibly misspecified noise models. By comparing the optimal statistic distribution with the distribution created using ``quasi-resampling'' techniques (such as sky scrambles and phase shifts), we endeavor to determine the extent to which plausible misspecification might lead to a false positive. The results are reassuring: we find that quasi-resampling techniques tend to underestimate the significance of pure-noise datasets. We conclude that recent reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave background is likely robust to the most obvious sources of systematic errors; if anything, the significance of the signal is potentially underestimated.

 - **Abstract**
 As a stellar group forms within its parent molecular cloud, new members first appear in the deep interior. These overcrowded stars continually diffuse outward to the cloud boundary, and even beyond. Observations have so far documented only the interior drift. Those stars that actually leave the cloud form an expanding envelope that I call the "stellar mantle." Simple fluid models for the cloud and mantle illustrate their basic structure. The mantle's expansion speed is subsonic with respect to the cloud's dynamical temperature. I describe, in qualitative terms, how the expanding mantle and Galactic tidal radius might together shape the evolution of specific types of stellar groups. The massive stars in OB associations form in clouds that contract before extruding a substantial mantle. In contrast, the more slowly evolving clouds forming open clusters and T associations have extended mantles that encounter a shrinking tidal radius. These clouds are dispersed by internal stellar outflows. If the remaining group of stars is gravitationally bound, it appears as a long-lived open cluster, truncated by the tidal radius. If the group is unbound, it is a late-stage T association that will soon be torn apart by the tidal force. The "distributed" populations of pre-main~sequence stars observed in the outskirts of several star-forming regions are too distant to be stellar mantles. Rather, they could be the remnants of especially low-mass T associations.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar chemical compositions can be altered by ingestion of planetary material and/or planet formation which removes refractory material from the proto-stellar disc. These "planet signatures" appear as correlations between elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature. Detecting these planet signatures, however, is challenging due to unknown occurrence rates, small amplitudes, and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in stellar ages, and therefore stars born together (i.e., co-natal) with identical compositions can facilitate such detections. While previous spectroscopic studies were limited to small number of binary stars, the Gaia satellite provides new opportunities for detecting stellar chemical signatures of planets among co-moving pairs of stars confirmed to be co-natal. Here we report high-precision chemical abundances for a homogeneous sample of 91 co-natal pairs of stars with a well-defined selection function and identify at least seven new instances of planetary ingestion, corresponding to an occurrence rate of 8%. An independent Bayesian indicator is deployed, which can effectively disentangle the planet signatures from other factors, such as random abundance variation and atomic diffusion. Our study provides new evidence of planet signatures and facilitates a deeper understanding of the star-planet-chemistry connection by providing new observational constraints on the mechanisms of planet engulfment, formation and evolution.
#### LHS 1140 b is a potentially habitable water world

 - **Abstract**
 LHS 1140 b is a small planet orbiting in the habitable zone of its M4.5V dwarf host. Recent mass and radius constraints have indicated that it has either a thick H$_2$-rich atmosphere or substantial water by mass. Here we present a transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b between 1.7 and 5.2 $\mu$m, obtained using the NIRSpec instrument on JWST. By combining spectral retrievals and self-consistent atmospheric models, we show that the transmission spectrum is inconsistent with H$_2$-rich atmospheres with varied size and metallicity, leaving a water world as the remaining scenario to explain the planet's low density. Specifically, a H$_2$-rich atmosphere would result in prominent spectral features of CH$_4$ or CO$_2$ on this planet, but they are not seen in the transmission spectrum. Instead, the data favors a high-mean-molecular-weight atmosphere (possibly N$_2$-dominated with H$_2$O and CO$_2$) with a modest confidence. Forming the planet by accreting C- and N-bearing ices could naturally give rise to a CO$_2$- or N$_2$-dominated atmosphere, and if the planet evolves to or has the climate-stabilizing mechanism to maintain a moderate-size CO$_2$/N$_2$-dominated atmosphere, the planet could have liquid-water oceans. Our models suggest CO$_2$ absorption features with an expected signal of 20 ppm at 4.2 $\mu$m. As the existence of an atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 planets is uncertain, LHS 1140 b may well present the best current opportunity to detect and characterize a habitable world.

 The coalescence of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) might explain some of the gravitation waves (GWs) events detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. On the other hand, observational hints for supermassive PBHs (SMPBHs) have been accumulated. Thus it can be expected that stellar-mass PBHs might be gravitationally bounded to SMPBHs ($\sim10^{6}-10^9M_\odot$) in the early Universe, and both constituted primordial extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this work, we initiate the study of the merger rate for primordial EMRIs. The corresponding intrinsic EMRI rate at low redshift may be comparable to that of astrophysical model, $10-10^4$yr$^{-1}$, which the space-based detector LISA has the capability to detect, but significantly raises with redshift. Though equal mass binaries also inevitably form, we find that under certain conditions the primordial EMRIs can be the most prevalent GW sources, and thus potentially a new probe to PBH.
#### Radiative-convective models of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune:  heating sources and seasonal effects

 - **Abstract**
 The observations made during the Voyager 2 flyby have shown that the stratosphere of Uranus and Neptune are warmer than expected by previous models. In addition, no seasonal variability of the thermal structure has been observed on Uranus since Voyager 2 era and significant subseasonal variations have been revealed on Neptune. In this paper, we evaluate different realistic heat sources that can induce sufficient heating to warm the atmosphere of these planets and we estimate the seasonal effects on the thermal structure. The seasonal radiative-convective model developed by the Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique is used to reproduce the thermal structure of these planets. Three hypotheses for the heating sources are explored separately: aerosol layers, a higher methane mole fraction, and thermospheric conduction. Our modelling indicates that aerosols with plausible scattering properties can produce the requisite heating for Uranus, but not for Neptune. Alternatively, greater stratospheric methane abundances can provide the missing heating on both planets, but the large values needed are inconsistent with current observational constraints. In contrast, adding thermospheric conduction cannot warm alone the stratosphere of both planets. The combination of these heat sources is also investigated. In the upper troposphere of both planets, the meridional thermal structures produced by our model are found inconsistent with those retrieved from Voyager 2/IRIS data. Furthermore, our models predict seasonal variations should exist within the stratospheres of both planets while observations showed that Uranus seems to be invariant to meridional contrasts and only subseasonal temperature trends are visible on Neptune. However, a warm south pole is seen in our simulations of Neptune as observed since 2003.
#### Gas inflows from cloud to core scales in G332.83-0.55: Hierarchical  hub-filament structures and tide-regulated gravitational collapse

 - **Abstract**
 The massive star-forming region G332.83-0.55 contains at least two levels of hub-filament structures. The hub-filament structures may form through the "gravitational focusing" process. High-resolution LAsMA and ALMA observations can directly trace the gas inflows from cloud to core scales. We investigated the effects of shear and tides from the protocluster on the surrounding local dense gas structures. Our results seem to deny the importance of shear and tides from the protocluster. However, for a gas structure, it bears the tidal interactions from all external material, not only the protocluster. To fully consider the tidal interactions, we derived the tide field according to the surface density distribution. Then, we used the average strength of the external tidal field of a structure to measure the total tidal interactions that are exerted on it. For comparison, we also adopted an original pixel-by-pixel computation to estimate the average tidal strength for each structure. Both methods give comparable results. After considering the total tidal interactions, the slope of the $\sigma-N*R$ relation changes from 0.20 to 0.52, close to 0.5 of the pure free-fall gravitational collapse, and the correlation also becomes stronger. Thus, the deformation due to the external tides can effectively slow down the pure free-fall gravitational collapse of gas structures. The external tide tries to tear up the structure, but the external pressure on the structure prevents this process. The counterbalance between the external tide and external pressure hinders the free-fall gravitational collapse of the structure, which can also cause the pure free-fall gravitational collapse to be slowed down. These mechanisms can be called "tide-regulated gravitational collapse."

 - **Abstract**
 The S-band Polarisation All Sky Survey (SPASS/ATCA) rotation measure (RM) catalogue is the largest broadband RM catalogue to date, increasing the RM density in the sparse southern sky. Through analysis of this catalogue, we report a latitude dependency of the Faraday complexity of polarised sources in this catalogue within 10$^\circ$ of the Galactic plane towards the inner Galaxy. In this study, we aim to investigate this trend with follow-up observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We observe 95 polarised sources from the SPASS/ATCA RM catalogue at 1.1 - 3.1 GHz with ATCA's 6 km configuration. We present Stokes QU fitting results and a comparative analysis with the SPASS/ATCA catalogue. We find an overall decrease in complexity in these sources with the higher angular resolution observations, with a complexity fraction of 42\%, establishing that the majority of the complexity in the SPASS/ATCA sample is due to the mixing-in of diffuse Galactic emission at scales $\theta > 2.8'$. Furthermore, we find a correlation between our observed small-scale complexity $\theta < 2.8'$ and the Galactic spiral arms, which we interpret to be due to Galactic turbulence or small-scale polarised emission. These results emphasise the importance of considering the maximum angular scale to which the observations are sensitive in the classification of Faraday complexity; the effect of which can be more carefully investigated with SKA-precursor and pathfinder arrays (e.g. MeerKAT and ASKAP).
#### Application of hydrostatic LTE atmosphere models to interpretation of  supersoft X-ray sources spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Super-soft X-ray sources (SSSs) are accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with stable or recurrent thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. High resolution X-ray spectra of such objects are rather complex, can consist of several components, and are difficult to interpret accurately. The main emission source is the hot surface of the WD, and the emergent radiation can potentially be described by hot WD model atmospheres. We present a new set of such model atmosphere spectra computed in the effective temperature range from $100\rm\,kK$ to $1000\rm\,kK$, for eight values of surface gravity, and three different chemical compositions. These compositions correspond to the solar one and to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with decreased heavy element abundances, at one-half and one-tenth of the solar value. The presented model grid covers a broad range of physical parameters, and thus can be applied to a wide range of objects. It is also publicly available in XSPEC format. As an illustration, we applied it here for the interpretation of Chandra and XMM grating spectra of two classical SSSs, namely, CAL$\,83$ (RX$\,$J0543.5$-$6823) and RX$\,$J0513.9$-$6951. The obtained effective temperatures and surface gravities of $T_{\rm eff} \approx 560\,$kK, $\log g \approx 8.6-8.7$, and $T_{\rm eff} \approx 630 {\rm kK}, \log g \approx 8.5-8.6$, respectively, are in a good agreement with previous estimations for both sources. Derived WD~mass estimations are within $1.1-1.4\,M_\odot$ for CAL 83 and $1.15-1.4\, M_\odot$ for RX$\,$J0513.9$-$6951. The mass of the WD in CAL$\,83$ is consistent with the mass predicted from the respective model of recurrent thermonuclear burning.

 - **Abstract**
 The power spectrum, as a statistic in Fourier space, is commonly numerically calculated using the fast Fourier transform method to efficiently reduce the computational costs. To alleviate the systematic bias known as aliasing due to the insufficient sampling, the interlacing technique was proposed. We derive the analytical form of the shot noise under the interlacing technique, which enables the exact separation of the Poisson shot noise from the signal in this case. Thanks to the accurate shot noise subtraction, we demonstrate an enhancement in the accuracy of power spectrum estimation, and compare with the other widely used estimators in community. The good performance of our estimation allows an abatement in the computational cost by using low resolution and low order mass assignment scheme in the analysis for huge surveys and mocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the case of axion-like particles (ALPs) during inflation. When coupled to a non-Abelian gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term, ALPs support an intriguing, testable, phenomenology with very distinctive features including chiral primordial gravitational waves. For sufficiently small values of the gauge vev and coupling, scalar perturbations in the gauge sector exhibit a known instability. We harness the power of such instability for primordial black hole (PBH) generation. In the case of an axion-inflaton, one is dynamically driven into a strong-backreaction regime that crosses the instability band thereby sourcing a peaked scalar spectrum leading to PBH production and the related scalar-induced gravitational waves. Remarkably, this dynamics is largely insensitive to the initial conditions and the shape of the potential, highlighting the universal nature of the sourcing mechanism. In the case of spectator ALPs one can identify the parameter space that sets off the strong backreaction regime and the ensuing features. We show that spectator ALP models may also access the scalar instability region without triggering strong backreaction.

 - **Abstract**
 The MRS mode of the JWST-MIRI instrument has been shown to be a powerful tool to characterise the molecular gas emission of the inner region of planet-forming disks. Here, we analyse the spectrum of the compact T-Tauri disk DR Tau, which is complemented by high spectral resolution (R~60000-90000) CO ro-vibrational observations. Various molecular species, including CO, CO$_2$, HCN, and C$_2$H$_2$ are detected in the JWST-MIRI spectrum, for which excitation temperatures of T~325-900 K are retrieved using LTE slab models. The high-resolution CO observations allow for a full treatment of the line profiles, which show evidence for two components of the main isotopologue, $^{12}$CO: a broad component tracing the Keplerian disk and a narrow component tracing a slow disk wind. Rotational diagrams yield excitation temperatures of T>725 K for CO, with consistently lower temperatures found for the narrow components, suggesting that the disk wind is launched from a larger distance. The inferred excitation temperatures for all molecules suggest that CO originates from the highest atmospheric layers close to the host star, followed by HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, which emit, together with $^{13}$CO, from slightly deeper layers, whereas the CO$_2$ originates from even deeper inside or further out in the disk. Additional analysis of the $^{12}$CO line wings hint at a misalignment between the inner (i~20 degrees) and outer disk (i~5 degrees). Finally, we emphasise the need for complementary high-resolution CO observations, as in combination with the JWST-MIRI observations they can be used to characterise the CO kinematics and the physical and chemical conditions of the other observed molecules with respect to CO.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of stars, particularly the high-mass star formation, poses several still open questions. Nowadays, thanks to the most modern telescopes and instruments, we are able to observe and analyse many physical and chemical processes involved in the birth of massive stars. This work introduces to the interstellar medium, cradle of the stars, and makes focus on the interstellar structures distributed in the different spatial scales related to the collapse of the gas that gives rise to the star formation processes. Through some current works done by the investigation group of Interstellar Medium, Star Formation and Astrochemistry belonging to Instituto de Astronom\'ia y F\'isica del Espacio (https://interestelariafe.wixsite.com/mediointerestelar), it is shown that the observational study of the star formation is a research that must be carried out in a multispectral way, pointing to the spatial multiscale.

 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next generation of observatories employing the imaging air Cherenkov technique for the study of very high energy gamma rays. The deployment of deep learning methods for the reconstruction of physical attributes of incident particles has evinced promising outcomes when conducted on simulations. However, the transition of this approach to observational data is accompanied by challenges, as deep learning-based models are susceptible to domain shifts. In this paper, we integrate domain adaptation in the physics-based context of the CTAO and shed light on the gain in performance that these techniques bring using LST-1 real acquisitions.
#### Sculpting the Morphology of Supernova Remnant Pa 30 via Efficient Ejecta  Cooling

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept numerical hydrodynamics calculation that the narrow radial filamentary structures seen in Pa 30 could be generated through highly efficient cooling (e.g. via line emission) in the ejecta. Efficient cooling in the ejecta causes a drop of pressure support in Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, leading them to be compressed, and suppressing the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Following this result, we make three predictions that could determine whether this is the mechanism responsible for shaping Pa 30: First, we predict very strong emission lines, strong enough to cool a significant fraction of the shock energy in an expansion time. Secondly, we predict that the forward shock should be highly corrugated on small scales, with the shock front closely following the structure of the filaments. Third, we predict that these filaments should be nearly ballistic, with velocities around 90% of the free-expansion velocity ($v \approx 0.9 ~r/t$). These predictions should be falsifiable in follow-up observations of this remnant.
#### Examining a hadronic $γ$-ray scenario for the radiative shell &  molecular clouds of the old GeV supernova remnant G298.6$-$0.0

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the 13.7~yr Fermi-LAT data, Yeung et al. (2023) claimed detection of two $\gamma$-ray sources (Src-NE and Src-NW) associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) G298.6$-$0.0, and interpreted it as an old GeV SNR interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). In this follow-up study, we refine the flux measurements below 2~GeV with Fermi-LAT event types of better angular reconstruction. Then, we report our cosmic-ray phenomenology in a hadronic scenario, considering both the shell and MC regions of SNR G298.6$-$0.0. We confirm that both the $\gamma$-ray spectra of Src-NE and Src-NW exhibit spectral breaks at $1.50_{-0.50}^{+0.60}$~GeV and $0.68_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$~GeV, respectively. Src-NW has a harder broadband photon index than Src-NE, suggesting an appreciable difference between the physical separations of their respective emission sites from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. The cosmic-ray spectrum responsible for Src-NE starts with a minimum energy $E_\mathrm{CR,min}=1.38_{-0.16}^{+0.47}$~GeV, and has a proton index $\Gamma_\mathrm{CR}=2.57_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ below the exponential cutoff energy $E_\mathrm{CR,max}=240_{-150}^{+240}$~GeV. Accordingly, we argue that Src-NE is dominated by the SNR shell, while only a minor portion of lower-energy emission is contributed by the MCs interacting with the SNR. The cosmic-ray population for Src-NW starts at a higher energy such that the $E_\mathrm{CR,min}$ ratio of Src-NW to Src-NE is $\gtrsim$2. The high $E_\mathrm{CR,min}$, as well as the high cosmic-ray energy density required ($\sim$26~eV~cm$^{-3}$), supports the interpretation that Src-NW is predominantly the $\gamma$-ray emission from the farther MCs being bombarded by protons that had earlier escaped from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. By comparing the high-energy features of G298.6$-$0.0 with those of analogical SNRs, especially SNR W28 and SNR W44, we further constrain the age of SNR G298.6$-$0.0 to be 10--30~kyr.

 We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $>$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 An important application of next-generation wide-field radio interferometers is making high dynamic range maps of radio emission. Traditional deconvolution methods like CLEAN can give poor recovery of diffuse structure, prompting the development of wide-field alternatives like Direct Optimal Mapping and $m$-mode analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative Bayesian method to infer the coefficients of a full-sky spherical harmonic basis for a drift-scan telescope with potentially thousands of baselines. The can precisely encode the uncertainties and correlations between the parameters used to build the recovered image. We use Gaussian Constrained Realisations (GCR) to efficiently draw samples of the spherical harmonic coefficients, despite the very large parameter space and extensive sky-regions of missing data. Each GCR solution provides a complete, statistically-consistent gap-free realisation of a full-sky map conditioned on the available data, even when the interferometer's field of view is small. Many realisations can be generated and used for further analysis and robust propagation of statistical uncertainties. In this paper, we present the mathematical formalism of the spherical harmonic GCR-method for radio interferometers. We focus on the recovery of diffuse emission as a use case, along with validation of the method against simulations with a known diffuse emission component.
#### Sensitivity of Bayesian 21 cm power spectrum estimation to foreground  model errors

 - **Abstract**
 Power spectrum estimators are an important tool in efforts to detect the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations from neutral hydrogen at early times. An initial detection will likely be statistical in nature, meaning that it will not be possible to make a coherent map of the brightness temperature fluctuations; instead, only their variance will be measured against a background of noise and residual systematic effects. Optimal Quadratic Estimator (OQE)-based methods often apply an inverse covariance weighting to the data. However, inaccurate covariance modelling can lead to reduced sensitivity and, in some cases, severe signal loss. We recently proposed a Bayesian method to jointly estimate the 21 cm fluctuations, their power spectrum, and foreground emission. Instead of requiring a fixed a priori estimate of the covariance, we estimate the covariance as part of the inference. Choices of parametrization, particularly of the foregrounds, are subject to model errors and could lead to biases and other ill effects if not properly controlled. In this paper, we investigate the effects of inaccurate foreground models on 21 cm power spectrum recovery. Using simulated visibilities, we find that, even in the most extreme scenarios tested, our approach is capable of recovering 21 cm delay power spectrum estimates consistent with a known input signal for delays $\gtrsim300$ ns ($\sim$88\% of the available Fourier modes). This is true even when using foreground models derived from modified foreground catalogs containing spatial and spectral perturbations at the quoted level of uncertainty on our foreground catalogs.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a radio synchrotron background (RSB) is implied by a number of measurements, including excess emission seen by the ARCADE2 and LWA experiments. Highly sensitive wideband radio arrays, of the kind used to measure the cosmic 21-cm signal, provide a promising way to further constrain the RSB through its anisotropy, providing additional insight into its origin. We present a framework for evaluating the potential of 21-cm arrays to disentangle different components of the diffuse radio sky based on the combination of their frequency spectrum and angular power spectrum (APS). The formalism is designed to calculate uncertainties due to the intrinsic cosmic variance alone or together with instrumental noise. In particular, we predict the potential for measuring the anisotropy of a broad generalised class of excess radio background models using the low-frequency HERA array as an example. We find that a HERA-like array can distinguish an RSB from other sky components based on its angular clustering and spectral dependence, even if these are quite similar to one or more of the other components -- but only in the case that the RSB is relatively bright.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modelling of the primary beam is an important but difficult task in radio astronomy. For high dynamic range problems such as 21cm intensity mapping, small modelling errors in the sidelobes and spectral structure of the beams can translate into significant systematic errors. Realistic beams exhibit complex spatial and spectral structure, presenting a major challenge for beam measurement and calibration methods. In this paper series, we present a Bayesian framework to infer per-element beam patterns from the interferometric visibilities for large arrays with complex beam structure, assuming a particular (but potentially uncertain) sky model and calibration solution. In this first paper, we develop a compact basis for the beam so that the Bayesian computation is tractable with high-dimensional sampling methods. We use the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) as an example, verifying that the basis is capable of describing its single-element E-field beam (i.e. without considering array effects like mutual coupling) with a relatively small number of coefficients. We find that 32 coefficients per feed, incident polarization, and frequency, are sufficient to give percent-level and $\sim$10\% errors in the mainlobe and sidelobes respectively for the current HERA Vivaldi feeds, improving to $\sim 0.1\%$ and $\sim 1\%$ for 128 coefficients.
#### Cosmic shear with small scales: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC-DR1

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological analysis of the combination of the DES-Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC-DR1 weak lensing samples under a joint harmonic-space pipeline making use of angular scales down to $\ell_{\rm max}=4500$, corresponding to significantly smaller scales ($\delta\theta\sim2.4'$) than those commonly used in cosmological weak lensing studies. We are able to do so by accurately modelling non-linearities and the impact of baryonic effects using Baccoemu. We find $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.795^{+0.015}_{-0.017}$, in relatively good agreement with CMB constraints from Planck (less than $\sim1.8\sigma$ tension), although we obtain a low value of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.212^{+0.017}_{-0.032}$, in tension with Planck at the $\sim3\sigma$ level. We show that this can be recast as an $H_0$ tension if one parametrises the amplitude of fluctuations and matter abundance in terms of variables without hidden dependence on $H_0$. Furthermore, we find that this tension reduces significantly after including a prior on the distance-redshift relationship from BAO data, without worsening the fit. In terms of baryonic effects, we show that failing to model and marginalise over them on scales $\ell\lesssim2000$ does not significantly affect the posterior constraints for DES-Y3 and KiDS-1000, but has a mild effect on deeper samples, such as HSC-DR1. This is in agreement with our ability to only mildly constrain the parameters of the Baryon Correction Model with these data
#### The VELOCE Modulation Zoo I. Spectroscopic detection of non-radial modes  in the first-overtone Cepheids BG Crucis, QZ Normae, V0391 Normae, and V0411  Lacertae

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric observations from the recent decade revolutionized our view on classical pulsators. Low-amplitude signals have been detected photometrically in addition to the dominant high-amplitude radial mode pulsations in many RR Lyrae stars and classical Cepheids. First overtone (1O) pulsators with an additional low-amplitude signal at a period ratio of around 0.61 with the main mode, the so-called 0.61 stars, form the most populous group among these stars. The nature of this signal has been attributed to non-radial pulsations. Another mysterious group are stars, where the additional signal forms a period ratio of around 0.68 - the 0.68 stars. The origin of the signal remains unknown. Here, we search for similar phenomena in spectroscopic observations of 1O classical Cepheids collected as part of the VELOCE project. We performed frequency analysis of several parameters derived from cross-correlation functions (CCFs), including radial velocity, FWHM, bisector inverse span, and CCF depth. Using standard prewhitening, we searched for additional low-amplitude signals. We identify the location of these stars in various sequences of the Petersen diagram. We detect additional signals in four 1O classical Cepheids: BG Cru, QZ Nor, V391 Nor, and V411 Lac. We classified BG Cru, QZ Nor, and V391 Nor as 0.61 stars based on period ratios. V411 Lac, however, exhibits a ratio of 0.68 between the two modes, and the additional signal has a longer period. This kind of multiperiodicity remains unexplained. VELOCE CCFs yield the first spectroscopic detections of non-radial pulsation modes in classical Cepheids. This opens an asteroseismic window for pursuing a more detailed understanding of these important stars. While the 0.61 signal of BG Cru, QZ Nor, V391 Nor is understood to originate due to non-radial modes of moderate degrees, the 0.68 signal of V411 Lac still lacks a physical explanation.
