#### MAPS: Constraining Serendipitous Time Variability in Protoplanetary Disk  Molecular Ion Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models and observations suggest that the abundances of molecular ions in protoplanetary disks should be highly sensitive to the variable ionization conditions set by the young central star. We present a search for temporal flux variability of HCO+ J=1-0, which was observed as a part of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program. We split out and imaged the line and continuum data for each individual day the five sources were observed (HD 163296, AS 209, GM Aur, MWC 480, and IM Lup, with between 3 to 6 unique visits per source). Significant enhancement (>3\sigma) was not observed, but we find variations in the spectral profiles in all five disks. Variations in AS 209, GM Aur, and HD 163296 are tentatively attributed to variations in HCO+ flux, while variations in IM Lup and MWC 480 are most likely introduced by differences in the \textit{uv} coverage, which impact the amount of recovered flux during imaging. The tentative detections and low degree of variability are consistent with expectations of X-ray flare driven HCO+ variability, which requires relatively large flares to enhance the HCO+ rotational emission at significant (>20%) levels. These findings also demonstrate the need for dedicated monitoring campaigns with high signal to noise ratios to fully characterize X-ray flare driven chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of emission lines associated with accretion processes is a direct method for studying how and where gas giant planets form, how young planets interact with their natal protoplanetary disk and how volatile delivery to their atmosphere takes place. H$\alpha$ ($\lambda=0.656\,\mu$m) is expected to be the strongest accretion line observable from the ground with adaptive optics systems, and is therefore the target of specific high-contrast imaging campaigns. We present MagAO-X and HST data obtained to search for H$\alpha$ emission from the previously detected protoplanet candidate orbiting AS209, identified through ALMA observations. No signal was detected at the location of the candidate, and we provide limits on its accretion. Our data would have detected an H$\alpha$ emission with $F_\mathrm{H\alpha}>2.5\pm0.3 \times10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, a factor 6.5 lower than the HST flux measured for PDS70b (Zhou et al., 2021). The flux limit indicates that if the protoplanet is currently accreting it is likely that local extinction from circumstellar and circumplanetary material strongly attenuates its emission at optical wavelengths. In addition, the data reveal the first image of the jet north of the star as expected from previous detections of forbidden lines. Finally, this work demonstrates that current ground-based observations with extreme adaptive optics systems can be more sensitive than space-based observations, paving the way to the hunt for small planets in reflected light with extremely large telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) utilizing nine distinct sources, the largest sample to date. Our data set includes 175 sub-bursts and 31 multi-component bursts from 11 data sets, with centre frequencies ranging from 149-7144 MHz and durations spanning from 73 \mu s-13 ms. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model (TRDM) of FRB emission. We affirm the predicted quadratic relationship between sub-burst slope and frequency, as well as a linear dependence of bandwidth on frequency that is consistent with mildly-relativistic Doppler broadening of narrow-band emission. Most importantly, we confirm the sub-burst slope law, a predicted inverse relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, to hold consistently across different sources. Remarkably, we also discover that the drift rates of multi-component bursts follow the same law as the sub-burst slopes, an unexplained result that warrants further investigation. These findings not only support the TRDM as a viable framework for explaining several aspects of FRB emission, but also provide new insights into the complex spectro-temporal properties of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the close similarity of coronal mass ejection (CME) properties in ground level enhancement (GLE) in solar energetic particle (SEP) events and sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun as indicated by low frequency type III radio bursts observed in the interplanetary medium. The complex type III bursts have an average 1 MHz duration of 36 and 34 min in the SGRE and GLE events, respectively. Similarly, the CMEs underlying SGRE and GLE have average space speeds of 1866 and 2084 km/s, respectively. These are larger than the corresponding values (32 min, 1407 km/s) for a control sample of type III bursts associated with frontside halo CMEs with sky plane speed exceeding 800 km/s. These results are consistent with the idea that energetic CME driven shocks accelerate particles to very high energies that are responsible for GLE and SGRE events.

 - **Abstract**
 The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft arrived at its target, near-Earth asteroid 101955 Bennu, in December 2018. After one year of operating in proximity, the team selected a primary site for sample collection. In October 2020, the spacecraft descended to the surface of Bennu and collected a sample. The spacecraft departed Bennu in May 2021 and will return the sample to Earth in September 2023. The analysis of the returned sample will produce key data to determine the history of this B-type asteroid and that of its components and precursor objects. The main goal of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Analysis Plan is to provide a framework for the Sample Analysis Team to meet the Level 1 mission requirement to analyze the returned sample to determine presolar history, formation age, nebular and parent-body alteration history, relation to known meteorites, organic history, space weathering, resurfacing history, and energy balance in the regolith of Bennu. To achieve this goal, this plan establishes a hypothesis-driven framework for coordinated sample analyses, defines the analytical instrumentation and techniques to be applied to the returned sample, provides guidance on the analysis strategy for baseline, overguide, and threshold amounts of returned sample, including a rare or unique lithology, describes the data storage, management, retrieval, and archiving system, establishes a protocol for the implementation of a micro-geographical information system to facilitate co-registration and coordinated analysis of sample science data, outlines the plans for Sample Analysis Readiness Testing, and provides guidance for the transfer of samples from curation to the Sample Analysis Team.

 - **Abstract**
 WR 137 (HD 192641) is a binary system consisting of a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star and an Oe companion star in a 13-year orbit. Near periastron, the winds of the two stars collide and form carbonaceous dust. We obtained three mid-infrared grism spectra of the system with SOFIA and FORCAST during the last year of SOFIA's operations in July 2021, February 2021, and May 2022 (Cycle 9). Within these spectra, we have identified several wind lines from He I, He II, C III, and C IV that are emitted from the Wolf-Rayet wind as well as a weak emission feature around 6.3-6.4 $\mu$m that may have shifted its peak flux from 6.29 to 6.41$\mu$m through this time period. The weak feature grew as the continuum dust emission grew while the WR emission appeared to decline due to lower contrast with the continuum. Furthermore, we observe that the peak of the feature shifts to redder wavelengths during the observations. We compare this feature to the UIR feature and other emission lines identified in dusty WC binaries. For WR 137, we speculate that mixing of the winds in the system with the Oe star's disk is important for starting the dust formation and that it is less important as dust formation continues. Previous infrared photometry shows "mini-eruptions" of dust production which could then be explained with variations of the Oe star disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The detection of Earth-like planets with the radial-velocity (RV) method is extremely challenging today due to the presence of non-Doppler signatures such as stellar activity and instrumental signals that mimic and hide the signals of exoplanets. In a previous paper, we presented the YARARA pipeline, which implements corrections for telluric absorption, stellar activity and instrumental systematics at the spectral level, then extracts line-by-line (LBL) RVs with significantly better precision than standard pipelines. Aims. In this paper, we demonstrate that further gains in RVs precision can be achieved by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition on the LBL RVs. Methods. The mean-insensitive nature of PCA means that it is unaffected by true Doppler shifts, and thus can be used to isolate and correct nuisance signals other than planets. Results. We analysed the data of 20 intensively observed HARPS targets by applying our PCA approach on the LBL RVs obtained by YARARA. The first principal components show similarities across most of the stars and correspond to newly identified instrumental systematics, which we can now correct for. For several targets, this results in an unprecedented RV root-mean-square of around 90 cm/s over the full lifetime of HARPS. We use the corrected RVs to confirm a previously published 120-day signal around 61Vir, and to detect a Super-Earth candidate (K = 60 +/- 6 cm/s, m sin i = 6.6 +/- 0.7 Earth mass) around the G6V star HD20794, which spends part of its 600-day orbit within the habitable zone of the host star. Conclusions. This study highlights the potential of LBL PCA to identify and correct hitherto unknown, long-term instrumental effects and thereby extend the sensitivity of existing and future instruments towards the Earth analogue regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We examined the grain size in the dust ring encircling the 0.19~$M_\sun$ T Tauri star CIDA 1 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at multiple centimeter wavelengths, with a spatial resolution of 0$\farcs$2--0$\farcs$9. We detected distinct partial-ring structures at these wavelengths around CIDA~1. Based on spatial distributions and spectral indexes, we determined that these centimeter emissions originated from dust, rather than free-free or synchrotron emissions. To estimate the maximum grain size ($a_{\rm max}$) within the ring, we compared the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) with SEDs calculated for different $a_{\rm max}$ values using radiative transfer calculations. Our findings indicate an $a_{\rm max}$ value of approximately 2.5~cm in the ring, assuming the dust opacity can be approximated by the DSHARP models. These results suggest that grain growth took place within the CIDA~1 ring, potentially facilitating more efficient planet formation through pebble accretion scenarios involving centimeter-sized pebbles.
#### Exploring the Impact of Imaging Cadence on Inferring CME Kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are essential for understanding their initiation mechanisms and predicting their planetary impact. Most acceleration and deceleration occur below 4 R$\odot$, which is crucial for initiation understanding. Furthermore, the kinematics of CMEs in the inner corona ($<$ 3 R$_\odot$) are closely related to their propagation in the outer corona and their eventual impact on Earth. Since the CME kinematics are mainly probed using coronagraph data, it is crucial to investigate how imaging cadence affects the precision of data analysis and conclusions drawn and also for determining the flexibility of designing observational campaigns with upcoming coronagraphs. We study ten CMEs observed by the K-Coronagraph of the MLSO. We manually track the CMEs using high cadence (15 s) white-light observations of K-Cor and vary the cadence as 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min to study the impact of cadence on the kinematics. We also employed the bootstrapping method to estimate the fitting parameters. Our results indicate that the average velocity of the CMEs does not have a high dependence on the imaging cadence, while the average acceleration shows significant dependence on the same, with the confidence interval showing significant shifts for the average acceleration for different cadences. The decrease in cadence also influences the determination of acceleration onset time. We further find that it is difficult to find an optimum cadence to study all CMEs, as it is also influenced by the pixel resolution of the instrument and the speed of the CME. However, except for very slow CMEs (speeds less than 300 Kms$^{-1}$), our results indicate a cadence of 1 min to be reasonable for the study of their kinematics. The results of this work will be important in the planning of observational campaigns for the existing and upcoming missions that will observe the inner corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes (FAST) is one of several proposed designs for a next-generation cosmic-ray detector. Such detectors will require enormous collecting areas whilst also needing to remain cost-efficient. To meet these demands, the FAST collaboration has designed a simplified, low-cost fluorescence telescope consisting of only four photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Since standard air shower reconstruction techniques cannot be used with so few PMTs, FAST utilises an alternative two-step approach. In the first step, a neural network is used to provide a first estimate of the true shower parameters. This estimate is then used as the initial guess in a minimisation procedure where the measured PMT traces are compared to simulated ones, and the best-fit shower parameters are found. A detailed explanation of these steps is given, with the expected performance of FAST prototypes at the Telescope Array experiment acting as a demonstration of the technique.

 - **Abstract**
 The MACE (Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment) telescope has started its regular gamma-ray observations at Hanle in India. Located at an altitude of $\sim$ 4.3 km above sea level and equipped with a 21 m diameter large quasi-parabolic reflector, it has the capability to explore the gamma-ray sky in the energy range above 20 GeV with very high sensitivity. In this work, we present the results from the feasibility studies for searching high-energy gamma-ray signals from dark matter interaction in potential astrophysical environments. We study the impact of MACE response function and other instrumental characteristics to probe the velocity average interaction cross-section ($<\sigma v>$) of the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), expected from the thermal dark matter freeze-out during the decoupling era. We consider the presence of dark matter in the form of pure WIMPs in the mass range 200 GeV - 10 TeV to produce distinctive gamma-ray spectra through its self-annihilation into standard model particles using the Pythia simulation package. The convolution of gamma-ray spectra corresponding to different standard model channels with the MACE response function is used to estimate the upper limit on $<\sigma v>$ for 100 hours of expected MACE observation of Segue1 (a dwarf spheroidal galaxy) which is a potential site of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while the two other sources were initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Ultradeep, low-resolution 1-5 $\mu$m spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to near-infrared spectral standards infers spectral classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8-T9. The spectrum of the warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and a fit to atmosphere models indicates Teff = 1300 K and [M/H] ~ -1.0, making this one of the few examples of a spectroscopically-confirmed T subdwarf. The spectrum of the coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, places it near the T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and we identify features of CH$_4$, CO, H$_2$O, and likely PH$_3$ in the 3.5-5.0 $\mu$m band. Our analysis suggests that PH3 is favored over CO$_2$ in this source, a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9-4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, and population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk or halo. Our simulations also indicate that there may be up to 7 T dwarfs and 5-6 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly half of which are halo members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.
#### Dense Forests of Microshots in Bursts from FRB 20220912A

 - **Abstract**
 We report on exceptionally bright bursts (>400 Jy ms) detected from the repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20220912A using the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT), as part of the ECLAT (Extragalactic Coherent Light from Astrophysical Transients) monitoring campaign. These bursts exhibit extremely luminous, broadband, short-duration structures (~ 16 microseconds), which we term 'microshots' and which can be especially well studied in the NRT data given the excellent signal-to-noise and dynamic range (32-bit samples). The estimated peak flux density of the brightest microshot is 450 Jy. We show that the microshots are clustered into dense 'forests', by modelling them as Weibull distributions and obtaining Weibull shape parameters of approximately 0.5. Our polarimetric analysis reveals that the bursts are nearly 100% linearly polarised; have < 10% circular polarisation fractions; a near-zero average rotation measure of 0.10(6) rad/m^2; and varying polarisation position angles over the burst duration. For one of the bursts, we analyse raw voltage data from simultaneous observations with the Westerbork RT-1 single 25-m dish. These data allow us to measure the scintillation bandwidth, 0.30(3) MHz, and to probe the bursts on (sub-)microsecond timescales. Some important nuances related to dedispersion are also discussed. We propose that the emission mechanism for the broadband microshots is potentially different from the emission mechanism of the broader burst components which still show a residual drift of a few hundred MHz/ms after correcting for dispersion using the microshots. We discuss how the observed emission is phenomenologically analogous to different types of radio bursts from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE, $>10$ PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole that aims to detect radio emissions from neutrino-induced particle cascades. ARA has five independent stations which together have collected nearly 24 station-years of data. Each of these stations search for UHE neutrinos by burying in-ice clusters of antennas $\sim 200$ m deep in a roughly cubical lattice with side length $\sim 15$ m. Additionally, the fifth ARA station (A5) has a beamforming trigger, referred to as the Phased Array (PA), consisting of a trigger array of 7 tightly packed vertically-polarized antennas. In this proceeding, we will present a neutrino search with the data of this "hybrid" station, emphasizing its capabilities for improved analysis efficiencies, background rejection, and neutrino vertex reconstruction. This is enabled by combining the closely packed trigger antennas with the long-baselines of the outrigger antennas. We will also place the A5 analysis into the context of the broader five station analysis program, including efforts to characterize and calibrate the detector, model and constrain backgrounds, and reject noise across the entire array. We anticipate this full neutrino search to set world-leading limits above 100 PeV, and inform the next generation of neutrino detection experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, thousands of planets have been discovered, but there are regions of the orbital parameter space that are still bare. An example is the short period and intermediate mass/radius space known as the Neptunian desert, where planets should be easy to find but discoveries remain few. This suggests unusual formation and evolution processes are responsible for the planets residing here. We present the discovery of TOI-332 b, a planet with an ultra-short period of $0.78$ d that sits firmly within the desert. It orbits a K0 dwarf with an effective temperature of $5251 \pm 71$ K. TOI-332 b has a radius of $3.20^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ R$_{\oplus}$, smaller than that of Neptune, but an unusually large mass of $57.2 \pm 1.6$ M$_{\oplus}$. It has one of the highest densities of any Neptune-sized planet discovered thus far at $9.6^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ gcm$^{-3}$. A 4-layer internal structure model indicates it likely has a negligible hydrogen-helium envelope, something only found for a small handful of planets this massive, and so TOI-332 b presents an interesting challenge to planetary formation theories. We find that photoevaporation cannot account for the mass loss required to strip this planet of the Jupiter-like envelope it would have been expected to accrete. We need to look towards other scenarios, such as high-eccentricity migration, giant impacts, or gap opening in the protoplanetary disc, to try and explain this unusual discovery.
#### $γ$-ray detection from occasional flares in T Tauri stars of NGC  2071. I. Observational connection

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 2071 is a star-forming region that overlaps with three $\gamma$-ray sources detected by the Fermi Space Telescope. We propose that strong flare activity in T Tauri stars could produce $\gamma$-ray emission in a way that makes them a counterpart to some unidentified sources detected by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi satellite. We have performed a spectral and temporal analysis for two Fermi data sets: the first 2 yr and the entire 14 yr of observations. We have found that the $\gamma$-ray source is detectable at 3.2$\sigma$ above the background at energies above 100 GeV during the first 2 yr of observation. The analysis of the expected frequency of the highest energy flares occurring in T Tauri stars is consistent with our estimate. In addition, we have determined the minimum energy of the flare that would produce $\gamma$-ray emission, which is $\sim 5 \times 10^{37}$ erg. This agreement becomes a hard observational constraint supporting previous hypotheses about rare flares as the origin of unidentified $\gamma$-ray sources in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 A planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk produces a gap by disk-planet interaction. It also generates velocity perturbation of gas, which can also be observed as deviations from the Keplerian rotation in the channel map of molecular line emission, called kinematic planetary features. These observed signatures provide clues to determine the mass of the planet. We investigated the features induced by the planet with an inclined orbit through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We found that a smaller planet, with the inclination being $\sim 10^{\circ}$ -- $20^{\circ}$, can produce kinematic features as prominent as those induced by the massive coplanar planet. Despite the kinematic features being similar, the gap is shallower and narrower as compared with the case in which the kinematic features are formed by the coplanar planet. We also found that the kinematic features induced by the inclined planet were fainter for rarer CO isotopologues because the velocity perturbation is weaker at the position closer to the midplane, which was different in the case with a coplanar massive planet. This dependence on the isotopologues is distinguished if the planet has the inclined orbit. We discussed two observed kinematic features in the disk of HD 163296. We concluded that the kink observed at 220 au can be induced by the inclined planet, while the kink at 67 au is consistent to that induced by the coplanar planet.

 Context. A characteristic feature of young stellar objects is their variability, which is caused by a variety of different physical processes. High-resolution interferometric observations in the near- and mid-infrared wavelength ranges spanning multiple epochs allow the detailed study of these processes. Aims. We aim at investigating the expected variations of the interferometric observables connected to changes in the measured photometric fluxes of a typical variable accreting central young stellar object with a circumstellar disk. Methods. We calculated visibilities and closure phases as well as the photometric flux of brightness distributions obtained using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations for a model of a circumstellar disk with an accreting central star. Results. Changes in the accretion luminosity of the central object, that is, an accreting pre-main-sequence star, can lead to significant variations in the visibility and closure phase of the star-disk system measured with instruments at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) that can be related to changes in the photometric flux. Taking into account additional effects due to baseline variation, interferometric observations can provide valuable contributions to the understanding of the underlying processes. Additionally, we provide the web application VLTI B-VAR that allows the impact of the hour angle on the visibility and closure phase for customized intensity maps to be estimated.

 - **Abstract**
 Two dark matter searches performed with charge-coupled devices (CCDs) in the DAMIC cryostat at SNOLAB reported with high statistical significance the presence of an unidentified source of low-energy events in bulk silicon. The observed spectrum is consistent with nuclear recoils from the elastic scattering of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with masses between 2 and 3 GeV. In the standard scenario of spin-independent WIMP-nucleus scattering, the derived cross section is conclusively excluded by results in argon by the DarkSide-50 experiment. We identify isospin-violating and spin-dependent scenarios where interactions with $^{40}$Ar are strongly suppressed and the interpretation of the DAMIC excess as WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering remains viable.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be/X-ray binary system LS V +44 17 (RX J0440.9+4431) is a potential member of the rare class of gamma-ray binaries. The system is comprised of a Be star and a neutron star companion with an orbital period of 150 days. In December of 2022, MAXI detected an X-ray outburst from the source, which peaked in early January before declining and then re-brightening. During the second peak, the flux exceeded 1 Crab in the 15-50 keV range, and exhibited a pulsed emission component with a pulse period of 208 seconds. VERITAS observations were conducted close to the peak of the second outburst, from January 24 to January 27, 2023. We report here on the search for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission in these data.

 - **Abstract**
 Our knowledge of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is mostly based on quasar absorption-line measurements. These have uncovered a multiphase medium that is likely highly turbulent, but constraints of this turbulence are limited to measurements of the non-thermal width of absorption-line components ($b_{turb}$) and the line-of-sight velocity dispersion between components ($\sigma_{LOS}$). Here we analyze a suite of CGM simulations to determine how well these indirect measures are related to the underlying CGM. Our simulations track the non-equilibrium evolution of all commonly observed ions, and consist of two main types: small-scale simulations of regions of homogeneous CGM turbulence and global simulations of inhomogeneous turbulence throughout a galactic halo. From each simulation, we generate mock spectra of Si II, Si IV, C IV, and O VI, which allow us to directly compare $b_{turb}$ and $\sigma_{LOS}$ to the true line-of-sight turbulence ($\sigma_{1D}$). In the small-scale simulations, $b_{turb}$ is only weakly correlated with $\sigma_{1D}$, likely because it measures random motions within individual warm CGM clouds, which do not sample the overall random motions. Meanwhile, $\sigma_{LOS}$ and $\sigma_{1D}$ are strongly correlated, with $\sigma_{1D}\approx\sigma_{LOS}+10$ km s$^{-1}$ in the densest regions we simulated, though, the strength of this correlation depended weakly on the gas phase being probed. Our large-scale simulations also indicate that $b_{turb}$ and $\sigma_{1D}$ are largely uncorrelated, and that $\sigma_{1D}\approx\sigma_{LOS}+10$ kms$^{-1}$ on average, although it varies along individual sightlines. Moreover, the $\sigma_\mathrm{LOS}$ distributions from our global simulations are similar to recent observations, suggesting that this quantity may provide useful constraints on circumgalactic turbulence regardless of the axis probed.
