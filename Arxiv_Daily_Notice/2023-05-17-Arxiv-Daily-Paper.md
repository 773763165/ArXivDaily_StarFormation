#### Astrophysical parameters of M dwarfs with exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Universe and are hosts of a rich diversity of planetary companions. In many cases, planets orbiting M dwarfs can be described in remarkable detail. What makes the difference is how deeply we can characterise the host star. This includes to properly model their atmospheres, their abundance of metals, and their activity processes. If they are well described individually, these numerous stars have the potential for providing statistically robust conclusions when combined into larger samples. Carmencita is the input catalogue of nearby M dwarfs for the CARMENES project, which aims to search for potentially habitable Earth-sized planets orbiting them. It contains more than two thousand M dwarfs that are scrutinized by the consortium members from multiple angles. This thesis contributes to the description of each one of these M dwarfs, including astrometry, photometry, activity, kinematics, and multiplicity, but also to the study of the sample as a whole. The empirical observations presented in this study provide an important benchmark for testing and improving theoretical predictions. By taking a careful, individualized approach to the study of M dwarfs, we not only contribute to the study of the Universe's physical processes, but we also pave the way for future discoveries of the potential for life beyond our own planet. Overall, the findings of this study underscore the importance of continued research into the most numerous stars and their planetary systems. We expect that the wealth of data gathered in this thesis will serve as a valuable resource for astronomers and researchers in related fields, and that it will inspire further investigations and new insights into the processes that shape the Universe.
#### Neutron star kicks and implications for their rotation at birth
 - **Authors:** Giacomo Fragione, Abraham Loeb

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars are born out of core-collapse supernovae, and they are imparted natal kicks at birth as a consequence of asymmetric ejection of matter and possibly neutrinos. Unless the force resulting from the kicks is exerted exactly at their center, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. In this paper, we discuss the possibility that neutron stars may receive off-center natal kicks at birth, which imprint a natal rotation. In this scenario, the observed pulsar spin and transverse velocity in the Galaxy are expected to correlate. We develop a model of the natal rotation imparted to neutron stars and constrain it by the observed population of pulsars in our Galaxy. At $90\%$ confidence, we find that the location of the off-center kick is $R_{\rm kick}=1.12^{+4.79}_{-0.97}$\,km. Our result is robust when considering pulsars with different observed periods, transverse velocities, and ages. Our constraint can be used as a guide for core-collapse simulations of massive stars.
#### On a discontinuity at the base of the transition layer located between  the Keplerian accretion disk and the compact object
 - **Authors:** Lev Titarchuk, Ilia Kalashnikov
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08930
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08930
 - **Abstract**
 We study the geometry of the transition layer (TL) between the classical Keplerian accretion disk (the TL outer boundary) and the compact object at the TL inner boundary. Our goal is to demonstrate using the hydrodynamical formalism that the TL is created along with a shock due to a discontinuity and to an adjustment of the Keplerian disk motion to a central object. We apply hydrodynamical equations to describe a plasma motion near a central object in the TL. We point out that before matter accretes to a central object the TL cloud is formed between an adjustment radius and the TL inner boundary which is probably a site where the emergent Compton spectrum comes from. Using a generalization of the Randkine-Hugoniot relation and a solution of the azimutal force balance equation we have reproduced the geometric characteristics of TL.
#### Modelling supernova nebular lines in 3D with $\texttt{ExTraSS}$

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08933
 - **Abstract**
 We present $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator), a newly developed code aimed at generating 3D spectra for supernovae in the nebular phase by using modern multi-dimensional explosion models as input. It is well established that supernovae are asymmetric by nature, and that the morphology is encoded in the line profiles during the nebular phase, months after the explosion. In this work, we use $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ to study one such simulation of a $3.3\,M_\odot$ He-core explosion ($M_\text{ejecta}=1.3\,M_\odot$, $E_\text{kin}=1.05\times10^{51}\,$erg) modelled with the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code and evolved to the homologous phase. Our code calculates the energy deposition from the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe and uses this to determine the Non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium temperature, excitation and ionization structure across the nebula. From the physical condition solutions we generate the emissivities to construct spectra depending on viewing angles. Our results show large variations in the line profiles with viewing angles, as diagnosed by the first three moments of the line profiles; shifts, widths, and skewness. We compare line profiles from different elements, and study the morphology of line-of-sight slices that determine the flux at each part of a line profile. We find that excitation conditions can sometimes make the momentum vector of the ejecta emitting in the excited states significantly different from that of the bulk of the ejecta of the respective element, thus giving blueshifted lines for bulk receding material, and vice versa. We compare the 3.3 $M_\odot$ He-core model to observations of the Type Ib supernova SN 2007Y.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new period-luminosity and period-luminosity-metallicity relations for Galactic RR Lyrae stars based on a sample of 28 pulsators located at distances up to $1.5$ kpc from the Sun. Near-infrared photometry was obtained at the Cerro Armazones Observatory and parallaxes were taken from the Gaia Early Data Release 3. Relations were determined for the 2MASS $JHK_s$ bands and the $W_{JK}$ Wesenheit index. We compare our results with other calibrations available in the literature and obtain very good agreement with the photometry of RR Lyraes from the Large Magellanic Cloud anchored using the distance to the Cloud, which based on detached eclipsing binaries. We find that the dependence of absolute magnitudes on metallicity of $0.070\pm 0.042$ mag/dex ($J-$ band) to $0.087 \pm 0.031$ mag/dex ($W_{JK}$ index) for the population of fundamental pulsators (RRab) that is in agreement with previously published phenomenological works. We perform a refined determination of distance to the LMC based on our new calibration and photometry from Szewczyk et al. (2008). We study the dependence of the fitted parameters of fiducial relations and the LMC distance on the systematic parallax offset.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the gamma-ray emission from M87 is currently a matter of debate. This work aims to localize the VHE (100 GeV-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission from M87 and probe a potential extended hadronic emission component in the inner Virgo Cluster. The search for a steady and extended gamma-ray signal around M87 can constrain the cosmic-ray energy density and the pressure exerted by the cosmic rays onto the intra-cluster medium, and allow us to investigate the role of the cosmic rays in the active galactic nucleus feedback as a heating mechanism in the Virgo Cluster. H.E.S.S. telescopes are sensitive to VHE gamma rays and have been utilized to observe M87 since 2004. We utilized a Bayesian block analysis to identify M87 emission states with H.E.S.S. observations from 2004 until 2021, dividing them into low, intermediate, and high states. Because of the causality argument, an extended ($\gtrsim$kpc) signal is allowed only in steady emission states. Hence, we fitted the morphology of the 120h low state data and found no significant gamma-ray extension. Therefore, we derived for the low state an upper limit of 58"(corresponding to $\approx$4.6kpc) in the extension of a single-component morphological model described by a rotationally symmetric 2D Gaussian model at 99.7% confidence level. Our results exclude the radio lobes ($\approx$30 kpc) as the principal component of the VHE gamma-ray emission from the low state of M87. The gamma-ray emission is compatible with a single emission region at the radio core of M87. These results, with the help of two multiple-component models, constrain the maximum cosmic-ray to thermal pressure ratio $X_{{CR,max.}}$$\lesssim$$0.32$ and the total energy in cosmic-ray protons (CRp) to $U_{CR}$$\lesssim$5$\times10^{58}$ erg in the inner 20kpc of the Virgo Cluster for an assumed CRp power-law distribution in momentum with spectral index $\alpha_{p}$=2.1.
#### On the feasibility of structure inversions for gravity-mode pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity-mode asteroseismology has significantly improved our understanding of mixing in intermediate mass stars. However, theoretical pulsation periods of stellar models remain in tension with observations, and it is often unclear how the models of these stars should be further improved. Inversions provide a path forward by directly probing the internal structure of these stars from their pulsation periods, quantifying which parts of the model are in need of improvement. This method has been used for solar-like pulsators, but has not yet been applied to main-sequence gravity-mode pulsators. Our aim is to determine whether structure inversions for gravity-mode pulsators are feasible. We focus on the case of slowly rotating SPB stars. We computed and analyzed dipole mode kernels for three variables pairs: $(\rho,c), (N^2,c)$, and $(N^2,\rho)$. We assessed the potential of these kernels by predicting the oscillation frequencies of a model after perturbing its structure. We then tested two inversion methods, RLS and SOLA, using a model grid computed with MESA and GYRE. We find that changing the stellar structure affects the oscillation frequencies in a nonlinear way. The oscillation modes for which this nonlinear dependency is the strongest are in resonance with the near-core peak in the buoyancy frequency. The near core region of the star can be probed with SOLA, while RLS requires fine tuning to obtain accurate results. Both RLS and SOLA are strongly affected by the nonlinear dependencies on the structure differences, as these methods are based on a first-order approximation. These inversion methods need to be modified for meaningful applications of inversions to SPB stars. Our results show that inversions of gravity-mode pulsators are possible in principle, but that the typical inversion methods developed for solar-like oscillators are not applicable. [abridged]
