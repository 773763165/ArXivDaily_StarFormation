 - **Abstract**
 To keep current global warming below 1.5{\deg}C compared with the pre-industrial era, measures must be taken as quickly as possible in all spheres of society. Astronomy must also make its contribution. In this proceeding, and during the workshop to which it refers, different levers of actions are discussed through various examples: individual efforts, laboratory-level actions, impact evaluation and mitigation in major projects, institutional level, and involvement through collectives.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we analyse the density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M_\mathrm{sh} \geq 1.4 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation, with the aim of including baryonic effects. We evaluate the performance of frequently used models, such as the standard NFW, the Einasto, and a smoothly truncated version of the NFW profile. We find that these models do not perform well for the majority of subhaloes, with the NFW profile giving the worst fit in most cases. This is primarily due to mismatches in the inner and outer logarithmic slopes, which are significantly steeper for a large number of subhaloes in the presence of baryons. To address this issue, we propose new three-parameter models and show that they significantly improve the goodness of fit independently of the subhalo's specific properties. Our best-performing model is a modified version of the NFW profile with an inner log-slope of -2 and a variable truncation that is sharper and steeper than the slope transition in the standard NFW profile. Additionally, we investigate how both the parameter values of the best density profile model and the average density profiles vary with subhalo mass, $V_\mathrm{max}$, distance from the host halo centre, baryon content and infall time, and we also present explicit scaling relations for the mean parameters of the individual profiles. The newly proposed fit and the scaling relations are useful to predict the properties of realistic subhaloes in the mass range $10^8$ M$_\odot$ $\leq M_\mathrm{sh} \leq$ $10^{13}$ M$_\odot$ that can be influenced by the presence of baryons.

 - **Abstract**
 The shell of the classical nova V5668 Sgr was resolved by ALMA at the frequency of 230 GHz 927 days after eruption, showing that most of the continuum bremsstrahlung emission originates in clumps with diameter smaller than $10^{15}$ cm. Using VLA radio observations, obtained between days 2 and 1744 after eruption, at frequencies between 1 and 35 GHz, we modeled the nova spectra, assuming first that the shell is formed by a fixed number of identical clumps, and afterwards with the clumps having a power law distribution of sizes, and were able to obtain the clump's physical parameters (radius, density and temperature). We found that the density of the clumps decreases linearly with the increase of the shell's volume, which is compatible with the existence of a second media, hotter and thinner, in pressure equilibrium with the clumps. We show that this thinner media could be responsible for the emission of the hard X-rays observed at the early times of the nova eruption, and that the clump's temperature evolution follows that of the super-soft X-ray luminosity. We propose that the clumps were formed in the radiative shock produced by the collision of the fast wind of the white dwarf after eruption, with the slower velocity of the thermonuclear ejecta. From the total mass of the clumps, the observed expansion velocity and thermonuclear explosion models, we obtained an approximate value of 1.25 M$_{\odot}$ for the mass of the white dwarf, a central temperature of $10^7$ K and an accretion rate from the secondary star of $10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ y$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of the ground state transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO C$^{18}$O, HCN, and HCO$^+$ at 88-115 GHz in the inner region of the nearby galaxy IC 342. These data were obtained with the 16-pixel spectroscopic focal plane array Argus on the 100-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 6-9$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. In the nuclear bar region, the intensity distributions of $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) emission trace moderate densities, and differ from the dense gas distributions sampled in C$^{18}$O(1-0), HCN(1-0), and HCO$^+$(1-0). We observe a constant HCN(1-0)-to-HCO$^+$(1-0) ratio of 1.2$\pm$0.1 across the whole $\sim$1 kpc bar. This indicates that HCN(1-0) and HCO$^+$(1-0) lines have intermediate optical depth, and that the corresponding $n_{\textrm{H}_2}$ of the gas producing the emission is of 10$^{4.5-6}$ cm$^{-3}$. We show that HCO$^+$(1-0) is thermalized and HCN(1-0) is close to thermalization. The very tight correlation between HCN(1-0) and HCO$^+$(1-0) intensities across the 1~kpc bar suggests that this ratio is more sensitive to the relative abundance of the two species than to the gas density. We confirm the angular offset ($\sim$10$^{\prime\prime}$) between the spatial distribution of molecular gas and the star formation sites. Finally, we find a breakdown of the $L_\textrm{IR}$-$L_\textrm{HCN}$ correlation at high spatial resolution due to the effect of incomplete sampling of star-forming regions by HCN emission in IC 342. The scatter of the $L_\textrm{IR}$-$L_\textrm{HCN}$ relation decreases as the spatial scale increases from 10$^{\prime\prime}$~to 30$^{\prime\prime}$ (170-510~pc), and is comparable to the scatter of the global relation at the scale of 340 pc.
#### The 85-electrode AO system of the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the chosen concepts, detailed design, implementation and calibration of the 85-electrode adaptive optics (AO) system of the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST). The AO system includes a 52 mm diameter monomorph deformable mirror with 34 mm pupil diameter, and an Intel PC workstation that performs the heavy image processing associated with cross correlations and real-time control at 2 kHz update rate with very low latency. The AO system is unusual by using a combination of a monomorph mirror with a Shack-Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensor (WFS), and uses a second high-resolution SH microlens array to aid the DM characterization, calibration, and modal control. The computer and software continue the successful implementation since 1995 of earlier generations of correlation tracker and AO systems at SST and its predecessor SVST by relying entirely on work station technology and an extremely efficient algorithm for implementing cross correlations with the large field-of-view of the WFS. We describe critical aspects of the design, calibrations, software and functioning of the AO system. The exceptionally high performance is testified through the highest Strehl ratio (as inferred from the measured granulation contrast) of existing meter-class solar telescopes, and in particular the unparalleled image quality achieved at wavelengths below 400 nm. We expect that some aspects of this AO system may be of interest also outside the solar community.
#### Uncommon SN 2020jfo: Ordinary explosion of 8 Msun red supergiant with  dense wind

 - **Abstract**
 We present the hydrodynamic model of Type IIP SN 2020jfo with the unusually short (nearly 60 days) light curve plateau. The model suggests the explosion of about 8 Msun red supergiant that ejected nearly 6 Msun with the energy of about 0.8x10^51 erg. The presupernova wind density turns out highest among known SNe IIP. Yet the presupernova was not embedded into a very dense confined circumstellar shell that is a feature of some Type IIP supernovae, so the circumstellar interaction in close environment does not contribute noticeably to the initial (about 10 days) bolometric luminosity. Despite uncommon appearance SN 2020jfo turns out similar to SN 1970G in the V-band light curve, photospheric velocities, and, possibly, luminosity as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Interactions of cosmic ray protons and nuclei in their sources and in the interstellar medium produce "hadronic" gamma-ray emission. Gamma-rays can also be of "leptonic" origin, i.e. originating from high-energy electrons accelerated together with protons. It is difficult to distinguish between hadronic and leptonic emission mechanisms based on gamma-ray data alone. This can be done via detection of neutrinos, because only hadronic processes lead to neutrino production. We use publicly available ten-year IceCube neutrino telescope dataset to demonstrate the hadronic nature of high-energy emission from the direction of Cygnus region of the Milky Way. We find a 3-sigma excess of neutrino events from an extended Cygnus Cocoon, with the flux comparable to the flux of gamma-rays in the multi-TeV energy range seen by HAWC and LHAASO telescopes.
#### A dusty streamer infalling onto the disk of a class I protostar. ALMA  dual-band constraints on grain properties and mass infall rate

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of interstellar material infalling onto star- and planet-forming systems have become increasingly common thanks to recent advancements in radio interferometry. These structures replenish disks with fresh material, have the potential to significantly alter their dynamics, trigger the formation of substructures, induce shocks, and modify their physical and chemical properties. In this study, we combine new ALMA band 3 and archival band 6 observations to characterize the dust content and mass infall rate of a 4,000 au arc-like structure infalling onto M512, a class I young stellar object located in the Lynds 1641 region of the Orion A molecular cloud. We measure for the first time spectral index maps and derive a dust opacity index profile along a streamer, constraining grain properties and its dust mass. We measure a spectral index $\alpha \sim$ 3.2 across the entire structure, and a dust opacity index $\beta \sim$ 1.6. Given grain properties consistent with the measured $\beta$, the structure can host up to 245 M$_{\oplus}$ of dust, being comparable or even exceeding the mass of the inner, unresolved 600 au, which contains the protoplanetary disk of M512. Such a massive streamer can strongly affect the evolution of the star- and planet-forming inner system. Assuming typical ISM dust-to-gas ratio of 1%, free-fall timescales (50 kyr) imply total mass infall rates up to 1.5 $\cdot$ 10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr. M512 has been classified as an outbursting source with multi-epoch photometry, thus representing an interesting case study to explore the possible connection between infalling streamers and accretion outbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we analytically calculate the spectra of primordial perturbations at the end of Type III hilltop inflation models under the slow-roll approximation. We examine the one-loop corrections of the spectra and find that those from the inflaton self-interaction are negligible. On the contrary, the loop effects from the interaction between the inflaton field and the waterfall field can be significant when the vacuum expectation value of the waterfall field is small. The implications are discussed.
#### JWST's PEARLS: Improved Flux Calibration for NIRCam

 - **Abstract**
 The Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS), a JWST GTO program, obtained a set of unique NIRCam observations that have enabled us to significantly improve the default photometric calibration across both NIRCam modules. The observations consisted of three epochs of 4-band (F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W) NIRCam imaging in the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field (IDF). The three epochs were six months apart and spanned the full duration of Cycle 1. As the IDF is in the JWST continuous viewing zone, we were able to design the observations such that the two modules of NIRCam, modules A and B, were flipped by 180 degrees and completely overlapped each other's footprints in alternate epochs. We were therefore able to directly compare the photometry of the same objects observed with different modules and detectors, and we found significant photometric residuals up to ~ 0.05 mag in some detectors and filters, for the default version of the calibration files that we used (jwst_1039.pmap). Moreover, there are multiplicative gradients present in the data obtained in the two long-wavelength bands. The problem is less severe in the data reduced using the latest pmap (jwst_1130.pmap as of September 2023), but it is still present, and is non-negligible. We provide a recipe to correct for this systematic effect to bring the two modules onto a more consistent calibration, to a photometric precision better than ~ 0.02 mag.
#### The CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor of Galactic Giant Molecular Clouds  using CO isotopologues: High-resolution $X_{\rm CO}$ maps

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the correlation between intensities of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ($J=1$-0) lines toward the Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs) W51A, W33, N35-N36 complex, W49A, M17SW, G12.02-00.03, W43, and M16 using the FUGIN (FOREST Unbiased Galactic plane Imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope) CO line data. All the GMCs show intensity saturation in the $^{12}$CO line when the brightness temperature of $^{13}$CO is higher than a threshold temperature of about $\sim 5$ K. We obtained high-resolution ($\sim 20"$) distribution maps of the $X_{\rm CO}$ factor ($X_{\rm CO, iso}$) in individual GMCs using correlation diagrams of the CO isotopologues. It is shown that $X_{\rm CO, iso}$ is variable in each GMC within the range of $X_{\rm CO, iso} \sim (0.9 {\rm -} 5) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$. Despite the variability in the GMCs, the average value among the GMCs is found to be nearly constant at $X_{\rm CO, iso} = (2.17 \pm 0.27) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, which is consistent with that from previous studies in the Milky Way.
#### Model Independent Dark Matter Properties from Cosmic Growth

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter dominates the matter budget of the universe but its nature is unknown. Deviations from the standard model, where dark matter clusters with the same gravitational strength as baryons, and has the same pressureless equation of state as baryons, can be tested by cosmic growth measurements. We take a model independent approach, allowing deviations in bins of redshift, and compute the constraints enabled by ongoing cosmic structure surveys through redshift space distortions and peculiar velocities. These can produce constraints at the $3-14\%$ level in four independent redshift bins over $z=[0,4]$.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars play a central role in tracing phase-space structures within the Milky Way because they are easy to identify, are relatively luminous, and are found in large numbers in the Galactic bulge, disk, and halo. In this work, we present a new set of spectroscopic metallicity calibrations that use the equivalent widths of the Ca II K and Balmer H-gamma and H-delta lines to calculate metallicity values from low-resolution spectra. This builds on an earlier calibration from Layden by extending the range of equivalent widths which map between Ca II K and the Balmer lines. We have developed the software rrlfe to apply this calibration to spectra in a consistent, reproducible, and extensible manner. This software is open-source and available to the community. The calibration can be updated with additional datasets in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We study zero and finite temperature static Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the combined Rastall-Rainbow (RR) theory of gravity by considering different BEC equation of states (EoSs). We obtain the global properties of BEC stars by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with values of Rastall parameter $\kappa$ and Rainbow function $\Sigma$ chosen accordingly to get the results in theories of Rastall, Rainbow and RR. We observe that the parameter $\kappa$ has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stars considered, whereas $\Sigma$ alters it significantly, and increasing the value of $\kappa$ beyond a certain limit results in unstable solutions for any value of $\Sigma$. We report that the inclusion of temperature in our analysis expands the parameter space by including more values of $\kappa$. However, temperature has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stellar profiles in all the three theories. We find that the maximum masses and radii of the stars within RR theory can have good agreement with the observational data on pulsars for all the EoSs considered and in particular, the Colpi-Wasserman-Shapiro EoS, which was ruled out in General Relativity (GR). We also find that, in contrast to the results of GR, BEC stars consistent with observations can be realised in the RR theory with smaller bosonic self-interaction strength.
#### CMB bispectrum constraints on DHOST inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first direct constraints on a Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) inflation model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) results on non-Gaussianities. We identify that the bispectrum consists of a fixed contribution following from the power spectrum and a linear combination of terms depending on five free parameters defining the cubic perturbations to the DHOST model. The former peaks in the squeezed limit, while the latter is maximised in the equilateral limit. We directly confront the model predictions to the CMB bispectrum statistics via the public code CMB-BEST and marginalize over the free parameters. We explicitly show that there are viable DHOST inflationary models satisfying both power spectrum and bispectrum constraints from Planck. However, rather surprisingly, the constraints exclude certain models at the $6\sigma$-level even though they pass the conventional fudge factor tests. In this case and despite having a handful of free parameters, the model's large squeezed bispectrum cannot be cancelled out without introducing a large bispectrum in other limits which are strongly constrained by Planck's non-detection of primordial non-Gaussianity. We emphasize that first-order approximations such as fudge factors, albeit commonly used in the literature, may be misleading and provide weaker constraints. A proper analysis of the constraints from Planck requires a more robust approach, such as the one provided by the CMB-BEST code.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the role of optical absorbers is critical for linking the properties of the day-side and terminator atmospheres of hot Jupiters. This study aims to identify the signatures of optical absorbers in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b. We conducted five transit observations of this planet to obtain its optical transmission spectra using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We performed atmospheric retrievals assuming free abundances of 12 chemical species. Our Bayesian model comparisons revealed strong evidence for TiO absorption ($\Delta\ln \mathcal{Z}=21.02$), modest evidence for CrH ($\Delta\ln \mathcal{Z}=3.73$), and weak evidence for MgH ($\Delta\ln \mathcal{Z}=2.32$). When we combined the GTC transmission spectrum with previously published Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data, the retrieval results and model inferences remained consistent. In conclusion, HAT-P-41b has a metal-rich atmosphere with no high-altitude clouds or hazes. Further observations of its day-side atmosphere should be made to confirm the hints of a thermal inversion in the upper atmosphere suggested by our results.
#### Fast neutrino-flavor swap in high-energy astrophysical environments

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13842
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13842
 - **Abstract**
 We assert that non-linear features of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) can be qualitatively different between core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). This argument arises from recent global FFC simulations in BNSM, in which fast flavor swap (FFS) emerges in very narrow spatial regions, whereas neutrinos in CCSN tend to evolve towards flavor equipartition. In this {\it Letter}, we provide the physical mechanism of FFS based on a colliding neutrino beam model. Neutrinos/antineutrinos can undergo FFS when they propagate in ambient neutrino gas that propagates in the opposite direction and also has the opposite sign of ELN-XLN, where ELN and XLN denote electron- and heavy-leptonic neutrino number, respectively. Such environments can be naturally realized in BNSMs, whereas they are unlikely in CCSNe unless the neutrino sphere is strongly deformed aspherically. Our study exhibits the diversity of non-linear dynamics of FFC.
#### Multiwavelength observations of KS 1947+300

 - **Abstract**
 KS 1947+300 is a Be/X-ray binary. Despite its nearly circular orbit, it displays both giant and regular less intense X-ray outbursts. According to the viscous decretion disk model, such low eccentric binaries should not show periodic outbursts. We have studied the long-term optical variability of KS 1947+300 and its relationship with X-ray activity. Our objective is to investigate the origin of this variability. KS 1947+300 exhibits changes in brightness and H$\alpha$ emission on time scales from months to years. The optical and IR variability shows small amplitude changes during the active X-ray state, and a long, smooth decrease during the quiescent state. The fact that the amplitude of variability increased with wavelength suggests that the long-term decrease of the optical emission is due to the weakening of the circumstellar disk. Structural changes in the disk may also be the origin of the periodic signals with periods $\sim200$ days detected in the ZTF-{\it g} and {\it r} band light curves. We speculate that these changes are related to the mechanism that ejects matter from the photosphere of the Be star into the disk. We have also studied the X-ray variability that manifested as a series of type I outbursts after the two giant outburst in 2000 and 2013 and found that the intensity and peak orbital phase differ from outburst to outburst. The type I outbursts in KS 1947+300 are not strictly periodic. This irregularity could result from precession of the interacting points between the neutron star and the disk, namely the disk apastron and the two nodes of the disk. The long-term changes in optical continuum and line emission and the X-ray variability patterns are attributed to an evolving and distorted decretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the time resolved spectroscopy result from two observations of Cen X-3, over one binary orbit with ASTROSAT and two binary orbit with NuSTAR. NuSTAR covered two intensity states where the light curve showed transition in count rate from first to second binary orbit by a factor of $\sim$ 3. A phenomenological model comprising of partially absorbed powerlaw with smoothed high energy cutoff, cyclotron absorption $\sim$ 24 keV and 6.4 keV iron emission gave good fit for ASTROSAT observation. NuSTAR spectra required two additional emission components, a broad one $\sim$ 5.7 keV and a narrow one $\sim$ 6.9 keV. A weak secondary absorption feature at $\sim$ 11.6 keV and $\sim$ 14.5 keV was seen in the residuals of the spectral fit for ASTROSAT and NuSTAR data respectively. The secondary absorption energy showed no correlation with the cutoff energy. Its strength varied within 0.1 to 0.6 keV with its width $\sim$ 1.6 keV. Its energy and optical depth showed linear positive correlation with the fundamental cyclotron line energy and depth respectively. The cyclotron line energy showed anti-correlation to flux described by a powerlaw with negative index and the secondary absorption also showed similar trend to flux. Depth of secondary absorption was $\sim$ 45 \% and centroid energy was $\sim$ 54 \% of fundamental. Depth and energy ratio of secondary to fundamental lied within 2$\sigma$ deviation from 0.5. We suggest this secondary absorption to be a redshifted dipolar cyclotron resonance feature exhibiting sub-harmonic behaviour.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the detection of twelve doublets with quantum numbers of N=12-11 to N=17-16 of the v11 vibrationally excited state of C6H towards TMC-1. This marks the first time that an excited vibrational state of a molecule has been detected in a cold starless core. The data are part of the QUIJOTE line survey gathered with the Yebes 40m radio telescope. The line intensities have been aptly reproduced with a rotational temperature of 6.2 +/- 0.4K and a column density of (1.2+/-0.2)e11 cm-2. We also analysed the ground state transitions of C6H, detecting fourteen lines with quantum numbers of J = 23/2-21/2 to J = 35/2 for each of the two 2Pi_3/2 and 2Pi_1/2 ladders. It is not possible to model the intensities of all the transitions of the ground state simultaneously using a single column density. We considered the two ladders as two different species and found that the rotational temperature is the same for both ladders, Trot(2Pi_3/2)=Trot(2Pi_1/2)=6.2+/-0.2, achieving a result that is comparable to that of the v11 state. The derived column densities are N(2Pi_3/2)(6.2+/-0.3)e12cm-2 and N(2Pi_1/2)=(8.0+/-0.4)e10cm-2. The fraction of C6H molecules in its 2Pi_3/2, 2Pi_1/2, and v11 states is 96.8 %, 1.3 %, and 1.9 %, respectively. Finally, we report that this vibrational mode has also been detected towards the cold cores Lupus-1A and L1495B, as well as the low-mass star forming cores L1527 and L483, with fractions of C6H molecules in this mode of 3.8%, 4.1%, 14.8%, and 6%, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud cover plays a pivotal role in assessing observational conditions for astronomical site-testing. Except for the fraction of observing time, its fragmentation also wields a significant influence on the quality of nighttime sky clarity. In this article, we introduce the function Gamma, designed to comprehensively capture both the fraction of available observing time and its continuity. Leveraging in situ measurement data gathered at the Muztagh-ata site between 2017 and 2021, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach. The statistical result illustrates that the Muztagh-ata site affords approximately 122 nights of absolute clear and 205 very good nights annually, corresponding to Gamma greater than or equal 0.9 and Gamma greater than or equal 0.36 respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately measuring the Hubble parameter is vital for understanding the expansion history and properties of the universe. In this paper, we propose a new method that supplements the covariance between redshift pairs to improve the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter using the OHD dataset. Our approach utilizes a cosmological model-independent radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to describe the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift effectively. Our experiments show that this method results in a reconstructed Hubble parameter of $H_0 = 67.1\pm9.7~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ , which is more noise-resistant and fits better with the $\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts. Providing the covariance between redshift pairs in subsequent observations will significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of Hubble parametric data reconstruction. Future applications of this method could help overcome the limitations of previous methods and lead to new advances in our understanding of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a spherical self-similar model for the formation of a galaxy through gas collapsing in an isolated self-gravitating dark matter halo. We improve upon the existing literature on self-similar collapse in two ways. First, we include the effects of radiative cooling and the formation of a pseudo-disk at the center of collapse, in a parametrised manner. More importantly, for the first time we solve for the evolution of gas and dark matter simultaneously and self-consistently using a novel iterative approach. As a result, our model produces shell trajectories of both gas and dark matter that qualitatively agree with the results of full hydrodynamical simulations. We discuss the impact of various ingredients such as the accretion rate, gas equation of state, disk radius and cooling rate amplitude on the evolution of the gas shells. The self-consistent evolution of gas and dark matter allows us to study the response of the dark matter trajectories to the presence of collapsing gas, an effect that has gained increasing importance recently in the context of precision estimates of small-scale statistics like the matter power spectrum. Our default configuration produces a relaxation relation in qualitative agreement with that seen in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and further allows us to easily study the impact of the model ingredients mentioned above. As an initial application, we vary one ingredient at a time and find that the accretion rate and gas equation of state have the largest impact on the relaxation relation, while the cooling amplitude plays only a minor role. Our model thus provides a convenient framework to rapidly explore the coupled nonlinear impact of multiple astrophysical processes on the mass and velocity profiles of dark matter in galactic halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We made statistical analysis of the Fermi GBM and Swift BAT observational material, accumulated over 15 years. We studied how GRB parameters (T$_{90}$ duration, fluence, peak flux) that were observed by only one satellite differ from those observed by both. In the latter case, it was possible to directly compare the values of the parameters that both satellites measured. The GRBs measured by both satellites were identified using the knn() k-nearest neighbour algorithm in the FNN library of the R statistical package. In the parameter space we determined the direction in which the jointly detected GRBs differ most from those detected by only one of the instruments using the lda() in MASS library of R. To get the strength of the relationship between the parameters obtained from the GBM and BAT, a canonical correlation was performed using the cc() procedure in the CCA library in R. The GBM and BAT T$_{90}$ distributions were fitted with a linear combination of lognormal functions. The optimal number of such functions required for fit is two for GBM and three for BAT. Contrary to the widely accepted view, we found that the number of lognormal functions required for fitting the observed distribution of GRB durations does not allow us to deduce the number of central engine types responsible for GRBs.

 The James Webb Space Telescope was not even launched yet when the Astro2020 Decadal Survey American report recommended the development of what is now called the Habitable World Observatory, also mentioned by the Voyage 2050 European report. This future space telescope, at 11 billions dollars and at least 6 m diameter, should allow, around 2040, the characterization of at least 25 exoplanets similar to Earth and orbiting around main sequence stars, with the hope of discovering one where life could have developed. This objective represents a technological challenge since it requires the design of spectro-imagers able to access very high contrasts (10^-8-10^-10) at low angular separations (smaller than 100 mas). This proceeding and the talk it is associated to address various obstacles that remain to be overcome in order to one day allow HabWorld to reach its ultimate performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Communications to and from a spacecraft undertaking launch-landing interstellar travel at near light speed faces significant challenges. Photon-based communication is significantly impacted by large photon propagation delay and relativistic time dilation. The timing of communications by photon transfer, as measured specifically by local clocks at origin and destination and aboard spacecraft, is analyzed and illustrated for concrete mission scenarios. These include a spacecraft experiencing indefinite constant self-acceleration, and a launch-landing mission, in which a spacecraft experiences constant acceleration for the first half of its cruise phase and a like deceleration for the second half. The origin and destination are assumed to be at rest within a common inertial frame with a wide range of fixed distances separating them. Several typical communication modes are considered, including one-way messaging, two-way message query with an expected response, and the one-way streaming of long program material such as a podcast or video. The local-clock relative timing experienced by the communicating entities including clock images (relation of transmit and receive clocks in one-way communication), the query-response latency (the elapsed time between a query message and reception of a message in response), and the time warping of a streaming program (nonlinear stretching or shrinking of the time axis) are included. In particular, large query-response latency, except for a short interval following launch or before landing, is a severe limit on remote control and social interaction. When photons must travel in the same direction as the spacecraft, communication blackouts strongly limit the periods of time during which communication is possible, and restrict the opportunities for both one-way and two-way communication.
#### An upper limit on the spins of merging binary black holes formed through  binary evolution

 - **Abstract**
 As gravitational wave detectors improve, observations of black hole (BH) mergers will provide the joint distribution of their masses and spins. This will be a critical benchmark to validate formation scenarios. Merging binary BHs formed through isolated binary evolution require both components to be stripped of their hydrogen envelopes before core-collapse. The rotation rates of such stripped stars are constrained by their surface critical rotation, restricting their angular momentum content at core-collapse. We use stripped star models at low metallicities ($Z_\odot/10$, $Z_\odot/50$ and $Z_\odot/250$) to determine the spins of BHs produced by critically rotating stellar progenitors. To study how such progenitors can arise, we consider their formation through chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). We use a semianalytical model to study the final spins of CHE binaries, and compare our results against available detailed population synthesis models. We find that above BH masses of $\simeq 25M_\odot$, the dimensionless spin of critically rotating stripped stars ($a = Jc/(GM^2$)) is below unity. This results in an exclusion region at high chirp masses and effective spins that cannot be populated by binary evolution. CHE can produce binaries where both BHs hit this limit, producing a pile-up at the boundary of the excluded region. Highly spinning BHs arise from very low-metallicity CHE systems with short delay times, which merge at higher redshifts. On the other hand, the contribution of CHE to merging binary BHs in the third observing run of the LVK collaboration is expected to be dominated by systems with low spins ($\chi_\mathrm{eff}<0.5$) which merge near redshift zero. Owing to its higher projected sensitivity and runtime, the fourth observing run of the LVK collaboration can potentially place constraints on the high spin population and the existence of a limit set by critical rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of planetary material polluting the atmospheres of white dwarfs are an important probe of the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. Medium- and high-resolution optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy of seven white dwarfs with known circumstellar dust and gas emission are presented. Detections or meaningful upper limits for photospheric absorption lines are measured for: C, O, Na, S, P, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni. For 16 white dwarfs with known observable gaseous emission discs (and measured photospheric abundances), there is no evidence that their accretion rates differ, on average, from those without detectable gaseous emission. This suggests that, typically, accretion is not enhanced by gas drag. At the effective temperature range of the white dwarfs in this sample (16,000-25,000K) the abundance ratios of elements are more consistent than absolute abundances when comparing abundances derived from spectroscopic white dwarf parameters versus photometric white dwarf parameters. Crucially, this highlights that the uncertainties on white dwarf parameters do not prevent white dwarfs from being utilised to study planetary composition. The abundances of oxygen and silicon for the three hydrogen-dominated white dwarfs in the sample with both optical and ultraviolet spectra differ by 0.62 dex depending on if they are derived from the optical or ultraviolet spectra. This optical/ultraviolet discrepancy may be related to differences in the atmospheric depth of line formation; further investigations into the white dwarf atmospheric modelling are needed to understand this discrepancy.

 - **Abstract**
 PRAIA - Package for the Reduction of Astronomical Images Automatically - is a suite of photometric and astrometric tasks designed to cope with huge amounts of heterogeneous observations with fast processing, no human intervention, minimum parametrization and yet maximum possible accuracy and precision. It is the main tool used to analyse astronomical observations by an international collaboration involving Brazilian, French and Spanish researchers under the Lucky Star umbrella for Solar System studies. Here, we focus on the concepts of differential aperture photometry and digital coronagraphy underneath PRAIA, used in the reduction of stellar occultations, rotational light curves, mutual phenomena and natural satellite observations. We highlight novelties developed by us and never before reported in the literature, which significantly enhance the precision and automation of photometry and digital coronagraphy, such as: a) PRAIA's pixelized aperture photometry (PCAP); b) fully automatic object detection and aperture determination (BOIA); c) better astrometry improving the aperture and coronagraphy centre, including the new Photogravity Center Method besides circular and elliptical Gaussian and Lorentzian generalized profiles; d) coronagraphy of faint objects close to bright ones and vice-versa; e) use of elliptical rings for the coronagraphy of elongated profiles; f) refined quartile ring statistics; g) multiprocessing image capabilities for faster computation speed. We give examples showing the photometry performance, discuss the advantages of PRAIA over other popular packages, and point out the uniqueness of its digital coronagraphy in comparison with other coronagraphy tools. Besides Solar System works, PRAIA can also be used in the differential photometry and digital coronagraphy of any astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays seek and study gravitational waves (GWs) through the angular two-point correlation function of timing residuals they induce in pulsars. The two-point correlation function induced by the standard transverse-traceless GWs is the famous Hellings-Downs curve, a function only of the angle between the two pulsars. Additional polarization modes (vector/scalar) that may arise in alternative-gravity theories have different angular correlation functions. Furthermore, anisotropy, linear, or circular polarization in the stochastic GW background gives rise to additional structure in the two-point correlation function that cannot be written simply in terms of the angular separation of the two pulsars. In this paper, we provide a simple formula for the most general two-point correlation function -- or overlap reduction function (ORF) -- for a gravitational-wave background with an arbitrary polarization state, possibly containing anisotropies in its intensity and polarization (linear/circular). We provide specific expressions for the ORFs sourced by the general-relativistic transverse-traceless GW modes as well as vector (or spin-1) modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories.

 The launch of JWST has ushered in a new era of high precision infrared astronomy, allowing us to probe nearby white dwarfs for cold dust, exoplanets, and tidally heated exomoons. While previous searches for these exoplanets have successfully ruled out companions as small as 7-10 Jupiter masses, no instrument prior to JWST has been sensitive to the likely more common sub-Jovian mass planets around white dwarfs. In this paper, we present the first multi-band photometry (F560W, F770W, F1500W, F2100W) taken of WD 2149+021 with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST. After a careful search for both resolved and unresolved planets, we do not identify any compelling candidates around WD 2149+021. Our analysis indicates that we are sensitive to companions as small as ~0.34 MJup outwards of 1."263 (28.3 au) and ~0.64 MJup at the innermost working angle (0."654, 14.7 au) with 5 sigma confidence, placing significant constraints on any undetected companions around this white dwarf. The results of these observations emphasize the exciting future of sub-Jovian planet detection limits by JWST, which can begin to constrain how often these planets survive their host stars evolution.
#### The BOAT GRB 221009A: a Poynting-Flux-Dominated Narrow Jet Surrounded by  a Matter-Dominated Structured Jet Wing

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the broad-band observations of the brightest-of-all-time (BOAT) GRB 221009A reveal a physical picture involving two jet components: a narrow ($\sim 0.6$ degree half opening angle) pencil-beam jet that has a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition, and a broader matter-dominated jet with an angular structure. We discuss various observational evidence that supports such a picture. To treat the problem, we develop an analytical structured jet model for both forward and reverse shock emission from the matter dominated structured jet wing during the deceleration phase. We discuss the physical implications of such a two-component jet configuration for this particular burst and for GRBs in general. We argue that some bright X-ray flares could be similar narrow jets viewed slightly outside the narrow jet cone and that narrow jets may exist in many more GRBs without being detected.

 A planet's Lyman-{\alpha} (Ly{\alpha}) emission is sensitive to its thermospheric structure. Here, we report joint Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Cassini cross-calibration observations of the Saturn Ly{\alpha} emission made two weeks before the Cassini grand finale. To investigate the long-term Saturn Ly{\alpha} airglow observed by different ultraviolet instruments, we cross-correlate their calibration, finding that while the official Cassini/UVIS sensitivity should be lowered by ~75%, the Voyager 1/UVS sensitivities should be enhanced by ~20% at the Ly{\alpha} channels. This comparison also allowed us to discover a permanent feature of the Saturn disk Ly{\alpha} brightness that appears at all longitudes as a brightness excess (Ly{\alpha} bulge) of ~30% (~12{\sigma}) extending over the latitude range ~5-35N compared to the regions at equator and ~60N. This feature is confirmed by three distinct instruments between 1980 & 2017 in the Saturn north hemisphere. To analyze the Ly{\alpha} observations, we use a radiation transfer (RT) model of resonant scattering of solar and interplanetary Ly{\alpha} photons, and a latitude-dependent photochemistry model of the upper atmosphere constrained by occultation and remote-sensing observations. For each latitude, we show that the Ly{\alpha} observations are sensitive to the temperature profile in the upper stratosphere and lower thermosphere, thus providing useful information in a region of the atmosphere that is difficult to probe by other means. In the Saturn Ly{\alpha} bulge region, at latitudes between ~5 to ~35{\deg}, the observed brightening and line broadening support seasonal effects, variation of the temperature vertical profile, and potential superthermal atoms that require confirmation.

 - **Abstract**
 Alternative cosmological models have been proposed to alleviate the tensions reported in the concordance cosmological model, or to explain the current accelerated phase of the universe. One way to distinguish between General Relativity and modified gravity models is using current astronomical data to measure the growth index $\gamma$, a parameter related to the growth of matter perturbations, which behaves differently in different metric theories. We propose a model independent methodology for determining $\gamma$, where our analyses combine diverse cosmological data sets, namely $\{ f(z_i) \}$, $\{ [f\sigma_8](z_i) \}$, and $\{ H(z_i) \}$, and use Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric approach suitable to reconstruct functions. This methodology is a new consistency test for $\gamma$ constant. Our results show that, for the redshift interval $0 < z < 1$, $\gamma$ is consistent with the constant value $\gamma = 0.55$, expected in General Relativity theory, within $2 \sigma$ confidence level (CL). Moreover, we find $\gamma(z=0)$ = $0.311 \pm 0.229$ and $\gamma(z=0) = 0.336 \pm 0.107$ for the reconstructions using the $\{ f(z_i) \}$ and $\{ [f\sigma_8](z_i) \}$ data sets, respectively, values that also agree at a 2$\sigma$ CL with $\gamma = 0.55$. Our main results are a third way in light of the current discussion in literature that point out to some possible evidence for the growth index evolution.

 Abundance determinations in planetary nebulae (PNe) are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the chemical evolution of the host galaxy. We discuss the complications involved when the presence of a metal-rich phase is suspected in the nebula. We demonstrate that the presence of a cold region emitting mainly metal recombination lines necessitates a detailed treatment to obtain an accurate assessment of the enrichment of this cold gas phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal streams and stellar shells are naturally formed in galaxy interactions and mergers. The Giant Stellar Stream (GSS), the North-East (NE), and Western (W) stellar shelves observed in Andromeda galaxy (M31) are examples of these structures and were formed through the merger of M31 and a satellite galaxy. Recent observational papers have provided strong evidence that the shells and GSS originate from a single progenitor. In this paper, we investigate the formation of these two stellar shelves and the detailed nature of their relationship to the GSS. We present numerical simulations of tidal disruption of a satellite galaxy assuming that it is a progenitor of the GSS and the shell system. We represent the progenitor as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the stellar mass of $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and evolve its merger with M31 for 3 Gyrs to reproduce the chemodynamical properties of the NE and W shelves. We find that an initial metallicity of the progenitor with a negative radial gradient of $\Delta$ FeH = -0.3 $\pm$ 0.2, successfully reproduces observed metallicities of the NE, W shelves, and the GSS, showing that all these structures can originate from the same merger event.

 - **Abstract**
 We present sensitive, high angular resolution Jansky Very Large Array observations made in 2014 at 1.50 GHz toward the field of Tycho's supernova remnant. We detect a total of 36 compact sources in a field with radius of 13 arcmin. This number is consistent with the expected number of background sources. We use older observations made with the classic Very Large Array to compare with the 2014 observations and search for sources showing large proper motions that could be related to the donor companion of the exploding white dwarf that produced the supernova in 1572. The comparison of the positions for the two sets of observations does not show sources with large proper motions and supports the conclusion that all sources detected are extragalactic and unrelated to the supernova field.

 Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection and mitigation is critical for enabling and maximising the scientific output of radio telescopes. The emergence of machine learning methods capable of handling large datasets has led to their application in radio astronomy, particularly in RFI detection. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological systems, are well-suited for processing spatio-temporal data. This study introduces the first application of SNNs to an astronomical data-processing task, specifically RFI detection. We adapt the nearest-latent-neighbours (NLN) algorithm and auto-encoder architecture proposed by previous authors to SNN execution by direct ANN2SNN conversion, enabling simplified downstream RFI detection by sampling the naturally varying latent space from the internal spiking neurons. We evaluate performance with the simulated HERA telescope and hand-labelled LOFAR dataset that the original authors provided. We additionally evaluate performance with a new MeerKAT-inspired simulation dataset. This dataset focuses on satellite-based RFI, an increasingly important class of RFI and is, therefore, an additional contribution. Our SNN approach remains competitive with the original NLN algorithm and AOFlagger in AUROC, AUPRC and F1 scores for the HERA dataset but exhibits difficulty in the LOFAR and MeerKAT datasets. However, our method maintains this performance while completely removing the compute and memory-intense latent sampling step found in NLN. This work demonstrates the viability of SNNs as a promising avenue for machine-learning-based RFI detection in radio telescopes by establishing a minimal performance baseline on traditional and nascent satellite-based RFI sources and is the first work to our knowledge to apply SNNs in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 How massive stars end their lives depends on the core mass, core angular momentum, and hydrogen envelopes at death. However, these key physical facets of stellar evolution can be severely affected by binary interactions. In turn, the effectiveness of binary interactions itself varies greatly depending on the initial conditions of the binaries, making the situation much more complex. We investigate systematically how binary interactions influence core-collapse progenitors and their fates. Binary evolution simulations are performed to survey the parameter space of supernova progenitors in solar metallicity binary systems and to delineate major evolutionary paths. We first study fixed binary mass ratios ($q=M_2/M_1$ = 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) to elucidate the impacts of initial mass and initial separation on the outcomes, treating separately Type Ibc supernova, Type II supernova, accretion induced collapse (AIC), rapidly rotating supernova (RSN), black hole formation, and gamma ray burst (GRB). We then conduct Binary Population Synthesis calculations for 12 models, varying the initial parameter distributions and binary evolution parameters, to estimate various supernova fractions. We obtain a Milky Way supernova rate $R_{\rm SN} = (1.14$--$1.57) \times10^{-2} \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$ which is consistent with observations. We find the rates of AIC, RSN, and GRB to be $\sim 1/100$ the rate of regular supernovae. Our estimated GRB rates are higher than the observed long GRB rate, but very close to the low luminosity GRB rate. Furthering binary modeling and improving the inputs one by one will enable more detailed studies of these and other transients associated with massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries containing compact objects, if viewed close to edge on, can produce periodic brightening events under certain conditions on the masses, radii, and binary separation. Such flares are caused by one object gravitational lensing the other, in what is known as self-lensing flares. We present a simulation tool that efficiently reproduces the main features of self-lensing flares and facilitates a detection sensitivity analysis for various sky surveys. We estimate the detection prospects for a handful of representative surveys when searching for systems of either two white dwarfs, or a white dwarf with other compact objects, i.e., neutron stars and black holes. We find only a marginal ability to detect such systems in existing surveys. However, we estimate many such systems could be detectable by surveys in the near future, including the Vera Rubin observatory. We provide a quantitative analysis of the detectability of double-compact object self-lensing flares across the landscape of system parameters, and a qualitative discussion of survey and followup approaches to distinguish such flares from confounding events, such as stellar flares, satellite glints, and cosmic rays. We estimate 0.3, 3 and 247 double white dwarf systems could be detected by TESS, ZTF, and LSST, respectively. A similar number of systems with a neutron star or black hole companion could be detected, but we caution that the number densities of such binaries is model dependent and so our detection estimates. Such binaries can be used to constrain models of the end states of binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock breakout emission is light that arises when a shockwave, generated by core-collapse explosion of a massive star, passes through its outer envelope. Hitherto, the earliest detection of such a signal was at several hours after the explosion, though a few others had been reported. The temporal evolution of early light curves should reveal insights into the shock propagation, including explosion asymmetry and environment in the vicinity, but this has been hampered by the lack of multiwavelength observations. Here we report the instant multiband observations of a type II supernova (SN 2023ixf) in the galaxy M101 (at a distance of 6.85+/-0.15 Mpc), beginning at about 1.4 hours after the explosion. The exploding star was a red supergiant with a radius of 450 solar radii. The light curves evolved rapidly, on timescales of 1-2 hours, and appeared unusually fainter and redder than predicted by models within the first few hours, which we attribute to an optically thick dust shell before it was disrupted by the shockwave. We infer that the breakout and perhaps the distribution of the surrounding dust were not spherically symmetric.

 - **Abstract**
 Current cosmological tensions show that it is crucial to test the predictions from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at different cosmic times. One very appealing test of structure formation in the universe is the growth rate of structure in our universe $f$, usually parameterized via the growth index $\gamma$, with $f\equiv \Omega_m(a)^\gamma$ and $\gamma \simeq 0.55$ in the standard $\Lambda$CDM case. Recent studies have claimed a suppression of the growth of structure from a variety of cosmological observations, characterized by $\gamma>0.55$. By employing different self-consistent growth parameterizations schemes, we show here that $\gamma<0.55$, obtaining instead \emph{an enhanced growth of structure today}. This preference reaches the $3\sigma$ significance using Cosmic Microwave Background observations, Supernova Ia and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. The addition of Cosmic Microwave Background lensing data relaxes such a preference to the $2\,\sigma$ level, since a larger lensing effect can always be compensated with a smaller structure growth, or, equivalently, with $\gamma>0.55$. We have also included the lensing amplitude $A_{\rm L}$ as a free parameter in our data analysis, showing that the preference for $A_{\rm L}>1$ still remains, except for some particular parameterizations when lensing observations are included. We also not find any significant preference for a multipole dependence of $A_{\rm L}$. To further reassess the effects of a non-standard growth, we have computed by means of N-body simulations the dark matter density fields, the dark matter halo mass functions and the halo density profiles for different values of $\gamma$. Future observations from the Square Kilometer Array, reducing by a factor of three the current errors on the $\gamma$ parameter, could finally settle the issue.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Orbiter's four in-situ instruments have recorded numerous energetic electron events at heliocentric distances between 0.5 and 1au. We analyse energetic electron fluxes, spectra, pitch angle distributions, associated Langmuir waves, and type III solar radio bursts for 3 events to understand what causes modifications in the electron flux and identify the origin and characteristics of features observed in the electron spectrum. We investigate what electron beam properties and solar wind conditions are associated with Langmuir wave growth and spectral breaks in the electron peak flux as a function of energy. We observe velocity dispersion and quasilinear relaxation in the electron flux caused by the resonant wave-particle interactions in the deca-keV range, at the energies at which we observe breaks in the electron spectrum, co-temporal with the local generation of Langmuir waves. We show, via the evolution of the electron flux at the time of the event, that these interactions are responsible for the spectral signatures observed around 10 and 50keV, confirming the results of simulations by Kontar & Reid (2009). These signatures are independent of pitch angle scattering. Our findings highlight the importance of using overlapping FOVs when working with data from different sensors. In this work, we exploit observations from all in-situ instruments to address, for the first time, how the energetic electron flux is modified by the beam-plasma interactions, and results into specific features to appear in the local spectrum. Our results, corroborated with numerical simulations, can be extended to a wider range of heliocentric distances.

 - **Abstract**
 The geographic South Pole provides unique opportunities to study cosmic particles in the Southern Hemisphere. It represents an optimal location to deploy large-scale neutrino telescopes in the deep Antarctic ice, such as AMANDA or IceCube. In both cases, the presence of an array, constructed to observe extensive air showers, enables hybrid measurements of cosmic rays. While additional neutron monitors can provide information on solar cosmic rays, large detector arrays, like SPASE or IceTop, allow for precise measurements of cosmic rays with energies above several $100\,\rm{TeV}$. In coincidence with the signals recorded in the deep ice, which are mostly due to the high-energy muons produced in air showers, this hybrid detector setup provides important information about the nature of cosmic rays. In this review, we will discuss the historical motivation and developments towards measurements of cosmic rays at the geographic South Pole and highlight recent results reported by the IceCube Collaboration. We will emphasize the important contributions by Thomas K. Gaisser and his colleagues that ultimately led to the rich Antarctic research program which today provides crucial insights into cosmic-ray physics.
#### Induced gravitational waves: the effect of first order tensor  perturbations

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar induced gravitational waves contribute to the cosmological gravitational wave background. They can be related to the primordial density power spectrum produced towards the end of inflation and therefore are a convenient new tool to constrain models of inflation. These waves are sourced by terms quadratic in perturbations and hence appear at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While the focus of research so far was on purely scalar source terms we also study the effect of including first order tensor perturbations as an additional source. This gives rise to two additional source terms: a term quadratic in the tensor perturbations and a cross term involving mixed scalar and tensor perturbations. We present full analytical expressions for the spectral density of these new source terms and discuss their general behaviour. To illustrate the generation mechanism we study two toy models containing a peak on small scales. For these models we show that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes non-negligible compared to the scalar-scalar contribution on smaller scales. We also consider implications for future gravitational wave surveys.
#### FlexKnot as a Generalised Model of the Sky-averaged 21-cm Signal at z ~  6-30 in the Presence of Systematics

 - **Abstract**
 Global 21-cm experiments are built to study the evolution of the Universe between the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. FlexKnot is a function parameterised by freely moving knots stringed together by splines. Adopting the FlexKnot function as the signal model has the potential to separate the global 21-cm signal from the foregrounds and systematics while being capable of recovering the crucial features given by theoretical predictions. In this paper, we implement the FlexKnot method by integrating twice over a function of freely moving knots interpolated linearly. The function is also constrained at the lower frequencies corresponding to the dark ages by theoretical values. The FlexKnot model is tested in the framework of the realistic data analysis pipeline of the REACH global signal experiment using simulated antenna temperature data. We demonstrate that the FlexKnot model performs better than existing signal models, e.g. the Gaussian signal model, at reconstructing the shape of the true signals present in the simulated REACH data, especially for injected signals with complex structures. The capabilities of the FlexKnot signal model is also tested by introducing various systematics and simulated global signals of different types. These tests show that four to five knots are sufficient to recover the general shape of most realistic injected signals, with or without sinusoidal systematics. We show that true signals whose absorption trough of amplitude between 120 to 450 mK can be well recovered with systematics up to about 50 mK.

 - **Abstract**
 Close binary central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) must have formed through a common envelope evolution during the giant phase experienced by one of the stars. Transfer of the angular momentum from the binary system to the envelope leads to the shortening of the binary separations from the radius of red giant to the radius of the order of few tenths of AU. Thus, close binary central stars of planetary nebulae are laboratories to study the common envelope phase of evolution. The close binary fraction in the Galaxy has been measured in various sky surveys, but the close binary fraction is not yet well constrained for the Magellanic Clouds, and our results may help the study of common envelope evolution in low-metallicity environments. This paper presents a continuation of our study of variability in the Magellanic Cloud planetary nebulae on the basis of data from the OGLE survey. Previously, we had analysed the OGLE data in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Here, the study is extended to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In this paper we search for close binary central stars with the aim to constrain the binary fraction and period distribution in the LMC. We identified 290 counterparts of PNe in the LMC in the I-band images from the OGLE-III and OGLE-IV surveys. However, the light curves of ten objects were not accessible in the OGLE database, and thus we analysed the time series photometry of 280 PNe. In total, 32 variables were found, but 5 of them turned out to be foreground objects. Another 18 objects show irregular or regular variability that is not attributable to the binarity of their central stars. Their status and the nature of their variability will be verified in the follow-up paper. Nine binary central stars of PNe with periods between 0.24 and 23.6 days were discovered. The obtained fraction for the LMC PNe is 3.3^(+2.6)_(-1.6)% without correcting for incompleteness.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility that the N-rich young proto-galaxy GN-z11 recently observed at z=10.6 by the James Webb Space Telescope is the result of the formation of second generation stars from pristine gas and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) ejecta in a massive globular cluster or nuclear star cluster. We show that a second generation forming out of gas polluted by the ejecta of massive AGB stars and mixed with gas having a standard composition accounts for the unusually large N/O in the GN-z11 spectrum. The timing of the evolution of massive (4-7.5M$_{\odot}$) AGBs also provides a favourable environment for the growth of a central stellar mass black hole to the Active Galactic Nucleus stage observed in GN-z11. According to our model the progenitor system was born at an age of the Universe of $\simeq 260 - 380$Myr, well within the pre-reionization epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) has excelled in imaging debris disks in the near-infrared. The GPI Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) imaged twenty-four debris disks in polarized $H$-band light, while other programs observed half of these disks in polarized $J$- and/or $K1$-bands. Using these data, we present a uniform analysis of the morphology of each disk to find asymmetries suggestive of perturbations, particularly those due to planet-disk interactions. The multi-wavelength surface brightness, the disk color and geometry permit identification of any asymmetries such as warps or disk offsets from the central star. We find that nineteen of the disks in this sample exhibit asymmetries in surface brightness, disk color, disk geometry, or a combination of the three, suggesting that for this sample, perturbations, as seen in scattered light, are common. The relationship between these perturbations and potential planets in the system are discussed. We also explore correlations among stellar temperatures, ages, disk properties, and observed perturbations. We find significant trends between the vertical aspect ratio and the stellar temperature, disk radial extent, and the dust grain size distribution power-law, $q$. We also confirm a trend between the disk color and stellar effective temperature, where the disk becomes increasingly red/neutral with increasing temperature. Such results have important implications on the evolution of debris disk systems around stars of various spectral types.

 - **Abstract**
 Very recent work has identified a new satellite galaxy, Ursa Major III/UNIONS I, which is the faintest such system ever observed. Dynamical considerations indicate that if the system is in equilibrium, it is likely to be highly dark matter dominated. This, in combination with its proximity, predicts that it may be the preeminent dwarf spheroidal galaxy target for dark matter indirect detection searches. We utilize 15 years of Fermi-LAT data to search for $\gamma$-ray emission from Ursa Major III. Finding no excess, we set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation. Intriguingly, if the high J-factor of Ursa Major III is confirmed, standard thermal dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states would be ruled out for dark matter masses up to 4 TeV. The discovery of Ursa Major III, combined with recent tentative measurements of other high J-factor systems, suggests the exciting possibility that near-future data could produce transformative constraints on thermal dark matter.
