 - **Abstract**
 Using images at multiple mid-infrared wavelengths, acquired in May 2018 using the VISIR instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), we study Jupiter's pole-to-pole thermal, chemical and aerosol structure in the troposphere and stratosphere. We confirm that the pattern of cool and cloudy anticyclonic zones and warm cloud-free cyclonic belts persists throughout the mid-latitudes, up to the polar boundaries, and evidence a strong correlation with the vertical maximum windshear and the locations of Jupiter's zonal jets. At high latitudes, VISIR images reveal a large region of mid-infrared cooling poleward $\sim$64$^{\circ}$N and $\sim$67$^{\circ}$S extending from the upper troposphere to the stratosphere, co-located with the reflective aerosols observed by JunoCam, and suggesting that aerosols play a key role in the radiative cooling at the poles. Comparison of zonal-mean thermal properties and high-resolution visible imaging from Juno allows us to study the variability of atmospheric properties as a function of altitude and jet boundaries, particularly in the cold southern polar vortex. However, the southern stratospheric polar vortex is partly masked by a warm mid-infrared signature of the aurora. Co-located with the southern main auroral oval, this warming results from the auroral precipitation and/or joule heating which heat the atmosphere and thus cause a significant stratospheric emission. This high emission results from a large enhancement of both ethane and acetylene in the polar region, reinforcing the evidence of enhanced ion-related chemistry in Jupiter's auroral regions.
#### Atmospheric properties of AF Lep b with forward modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to expand the atmospheric exploration of AF Lep b by modeling all available observations obtained with SPHERE at VLT (between 0.95-1.65, at 2.105, and 2.253 $\mu$m, and NIRC2 at Keck (at 3.8 $\mu$m) with self-consistent atmospheric models. Methods. To understand the physical properties of this exoplanet, we used ForMoSA. This forward-modeling code compares observations with grids of pre-computed synthetic atmospheric spectra using Bayesian inference methods. We used Exo-REM, an atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium model, including the effects of non-equilibrium processes and clouds. Results. From the atmospheric modeling we derive solutions at a low effective temperature of ~750 K. Our analysis also favors a metal-rich atmosphere (>0.4) and solar to super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (~0.6). We tested the robustness of the estimated values for each parameter by cross-validating our models using the leave-one-out strategy, where all points are used iteratively as validation points. Our results indicate that the photometry point at 3.8 $\mu$m strongly drives the metal-rich and super-solar carbon-to-oxygen solutions. Conclusions. Our atmospheric forward-modeling analysis strongly supports the planetary nature of AF Lep b. Its spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of a young, cold, early-T super-Jovian planet. We recover physically consistent solutions for the surface gravity and radius, which allows us to reconcile atmospheric forward modeling with evolutionary models, in agreement with the previously published complementary analysis done by retrievals. Finally, we identified that future data at longer wavelengths are mandatory before concluding about the metal-rich nature of AF Lep b.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter may be detected in X-ray decay, including from the decay of the dark matter particles that make up the Milky Way (MW) halo. We use a range of density profiles to compute X-ray line intensity profiles, with a focus on the resonantly produced sterile neutrino dark matter candidate. Compared to the Navarro--Frenk--White density profile, we show that using an adiabatically contracted halo profile suppresses the line intensity in the halo outskirts and enhances it in the Galactic Centre (GC), although this enhancement is eliminated by the likely presence of a core within 3~kpc. Comparing our results to MW halo observations, other X-ray observations, and structure formation constraints implies a sterile neutrino mixing angle parameter $s_{11}\equiv\sin^{2}(2\theta)\times10^{11}\sim[3,4]$ (particle lifetime $\tau_{28}\equiv\tau/(10^{28}\mathrm{sec})\sim[1.0,1.3]$), which is nevertheless is strong tension with some reported non-detections. We make predictions for the likely decay flux that the XRISM satellite would measure in the GC, plus the Virgo and Perseus clusters, and outline further steps to determine whether the dark matter is indeed resonantly produced sterile neutrinos as detected in X-ray decay.

 - **Abstract**
 We have identified 189 candidate $z > 1.3$ protoclusters and clusters in the LSST Deep Drilling Fields. This sample will enable the measurement of the metal enrichment and star formation history of clusters during their early assembly period through the direct measurement of the rate of supernovae identified through the LSST. The protocluster sample was selected from galaxy overdensities in a $Spitzer$/IRAC colour-selected sample using criteria that were optimised for protocluster purity using a realistic lightcone. Our tests reveal that $60-80\%$ of the identified candidates are likely to be genuine protoclusters or clusters, which is corroborated by a $\sim4\sigma$ stacked X-ray signal from these structures. We provide photometric redshift estimates for 47 candidates which exhibit strong peaks in the photo-$z$ distribution of their candidate members. However, the lack of a photo-$z$ peak does not mean a candidate is not genuine, since we find a stacked X-ray signal of similar significance from both the candidates that exhibit photo-$z$ peaks and those that do not. Tests on the lightcone reveal that our pursuit of a pure sample of protoclusters results in that sample being highly incomplete ($\sim4\%$) and heavily biased towards larger, richer, more massive, and more centrally concentrated protoclusters than the total protocluster population. Most ($\sim75\%$) of the selected protoclusters are likely to have a maximum collapsed halo mass of between $10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, with only $\sim25\%$ likely to be collapsed clusters above $10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the aforementioned bias ensures our sample is $\sim50\%$ complete for structures that have already collapsed into clusters more massive than $10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling of the stars in the red clump (RC) is challenging, due to the uncertainties associated with the physical processes happening in their core and during the helium flash. By probing the internal stellar structure, asteroseismology allows us to constrain the core properties of RC stars and eventually improve our understanding of this evolutionary phase. In this work, we aim to quantify the impact on the seismic properties of the RC stars of the two main core modeling uncertainties: core boundary mixing, and helium burning nuclear reaction rates. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we compute models with different core boundary mixing as well as different $3\alpha$ and carbon alpha (C-alpha) nuclear reaction rates. We investigate the impact of those parameters on the period spacing $\Delta \Pi$, which is a probe of the region around the core. We find that different core boundary mixing schemes yield significantly different period spacings, with differences of 30s between the maximal $\Delta \Pi$ value computed with semiconvection and maximal overshoot. We show that increasing the rate of the C-alpha reaction lengthens the core helium burning phase, which extends the range of $\Delta \Pi$ covered by the models during their evolution. This results in a difference of 10s between the models computed with a nominal rate and a rate multiplied by 2, which is larger than the observational uncertainties. The effect of changing the 3$\alpha$ reaction rate is comparatively small. In conclusion, the core boundary mixing is the main source of uncertainty regarding the seismic modeling of RC stars. Moreover, the effect of the C-alpha reaction rate is non-negligible, even if difficult to disentangle from the effect of the mixing. Such degeneracy could be raised in the future, thanks to new seismic data from the PLATO mission and theoretical constraints from numerical simulations.
#### Modelling stellar variability in archival HARPS data: I -- Rotation and  activity properties with multi-dimensional Gaussian Processes

 - **Abstract**
 Although instruments for measuring the radial velocities (RVs) of stars now routinely reach sub-meter per second accuracy, the detection of low-mass planets is still very challenging. The rotational modulation and evolution of spots and/or faculae can induce variations in the RVs at the level of a few m/s in Sun-like stars. To overcome this, a multi-dimensional Gaussian Process framework has been developed to model the stellar activity signal using spectroscopic activity indicators together with the RVs. A recently published computationally efficient implementation of this framework, S+LEAF 2, enables the rapid analysis of large samples of targets with sizeable data sets. In this work, we apply this framework to HARPS observations of 268 well-observed targets with precisely determined stellar parameters. Our long-term goal is to quantify the effectiveness of this framework to model and mitigate activity signals for stars of different spectral types and activity levels. In this first paper in the series, we initially focus on the activity indicators (S-index and Bisector Inverse Slope), and use them to a) measure rotation periods for 49 slow rotators in our sample, b) explore the impact of these results on the spin-down of middle-aged late F, G & K stars, and c) explore indirectly how the spot to facular ratio varies across our sample. Our results should provide valuable clues for planning future RV planet surveys such as the Terra Hunting Experiment or the PLATO ground-based follow-up observations program, and help fine-tune current stellar structure and evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the recent surge in interest concerning white dwarf (WD) planets, this work presents the first numerical exploration of WD-driven atmospheric escape, whereby the high-energy radiation from a hot/young WD can trigger the outflow of the hydrogen-helium envelope for close-in planets. As a pilot investigation, we focus on two specific cases: a gas giant and a sub-Neptune-sized planet, both orbiting a rapidly cooling WD with mass $M_\ast$ = 0.6 \msun\ and separation $a$ = 0.02 AU. In both cases, the ensuing mass outflow rates exceed $10^{14}$ g sec$^{-1}$ for WD temperatures greater than $T_{\rm WD} \simeq$ 50,000 K. At $T_{\rm WD} \simeq$ 18,000 K [/22,000 K], the sub-Neptune [/gas giant] mass outflow rate approaches $10^{12}$ g sec$^{-1}$, i.e., comparable to the strongest outflows expected from close-in planets around late main-sequence stars. Whereas the gas giant remains virtually unaffected from an evolutionary standpoint, atmospheric escape may have sizable effects for the sub-Neptune, depending on its dynamical history, e.g., assuming that the hydrogen-helium envelope makes up 1 [/4] per cent of the planet mass, the entire envelope would be evaporated away so long as the planet reaches 0.02 AU within the first 230 [/130] Myr of the WD formation. We discuss how these results can be generalized to eccentric orbits with effective semi-major axis $a'=a/(1-e^2)^{1/4}$, which receive the same orbit-averaged irradiation. Extended to a much broader parameter space, this approach can be exploited to model the expected demographics of WD planets as a function of their initial mass, composition and migration history, as well as their potential for habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of RELXILL (modified to read the table of REFLIONX, which is the non-relativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that RELXILL with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk's ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the values of the coronal height and of the disk's ionization parameter increase.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme temperatures and densities of many astrophysical environments tends to destabilize nuclear isomers by inducing transitions to higher energy states. Those states may then cascade to ground. However, not all environments destabilize all isomers. Nuclear isomers which retain their metastable character in pertinent astrophysical environments are known as astrophysically metastable nuclear isomers, or ``astromers''. Astromers can influence nucleosynthesis, altering abundances or even creating new pathways that would otherwise be inaccessible. Astromers may also release energy faster or slower relative to their associated ground state, acting as heating accelerants or batteries, respectively. In stable isotopes, they may even simply remain populated after a cataclysmic event and emit observable x- or $\gamma$-rays. The variety of behaviors of these nuclear species and the effects they can have merit careful consideration in nearly every possible astrophysical environment. Here we provide a brief overview of astromers past and present, and we outline future work that will help to illuminate their role in the cosmos.
#### Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter with LAMOST and  Gaia. I. Methodology and Local Halo Results

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel, deep-learning based method -- dubbed Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter, or GS$^{3}$ Hunter for short, to search for substructures and streams in stellar kinematics data. GS$^{3}$ Hunter relies on a combined application of Siamese Neural Networks to transform the phase space information and the K-means algorithm for the clustering. As a validation test, we apply GS$^{3}$ Hunter to a subset of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) cosmological simulations. The stellar streams and substructures thus identified are in good agreement with corresponding results reported earlier by the FIRE team. In the same vein, we apply our method to a subset of local halo stars from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 and GALAH DR3 datasets, and recover several, previously known dynamical groups, such as Thamnos 1+2, Hot Thick Disk, ED-1, L-RL3, Helmi 1+2, and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, VRM, Cronus, Nereus. Finally, we apply our method without fine-tuning to a subset of K-giant stars located in the inner halo region, obtained from the LAMOST Data Release 5 (DR5) dataset. We recover three, previously known structures (Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila Cloud, and the Virgo Overdensity), but we also discover a number of new substructures. We anticipate that GS$^{3}$ Hunter will become a useful tool for the community dedicated to the search of stellar streams and structures in the Milky Way (MW) and the Local group, thus helping advance our understanding of the stellar inner and outer halos, and of the assembly and tidal stripping history in and around the MW.
#### New candidate hypervelocity red clump stars in the inner Galactic bulge

 - **Abstract**
 We search for high-velocity stars in the inner region of the Galactic bulge using a selected sample of red clump stars. Some of those stars might be considered hypervelocity stars (HVSs). Even though the HVSs ejection relies on an interaction with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the centre of the Galaxy, there are no confirmed detections of HVSs in the inner region of our Galaxy. With the detection of HVSs, ejection mechanism models can be constrained by exploring the stellar dynamics in the Galactic centre through a recent stellar interaction with the SMBH. Based on a previously developed methodology by our group, we searched with a sample of preliminary data from version 2 of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) Infrared Astrometric Catalogue (VIRAC2) and Gaia DR3 data, including accurate optical and NIR proper motions. This search resulted in a sample of 46 stars with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity within the Galactic bulge, of which 4 are prime candidate HVSs with high-proper motions consistent with being ejections from the Galactic centre. Adding to that, we studied a sample of reddened stars without a Gaia DR3 counterpart and found 481 stars with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity, from which 65 stars have proper motions pointing out of the Galactic centre and are candidate HVSs. In total, we found 69 candidate HVSs pointing away from the Galactic centre with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity.
#### Shock-driven synchrotron radio emission from the 2021 outburst of RS  Ophiuchi

 - **Abstract**
 We present low-frequency radio observations of the Galactic symbiotic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi during its 2021 outburst. The observations were carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) spanning a frequency range of 0.15$-$1.4 GHz during 23$-$287 days post the outburst. The average value of the optically thin spectral index is $\alpha \sim$ $-$0.4 ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu^\alpha$), indicating a non-thermal origin of the radio emission at the observed frequencies. The radio light curves are best represented by shock-driven synchrotron emission, initially absorbed by a clumpy ionized circumbinary medium. We estimate the mass-loss rate of the red giant companion star to be $\dot{M} \sim$ 7.5 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for an assumed stellar wind velocity of 20 km/s. The 0.15--1.4 GHz radio light curves of the 2021 outburst are systematically brighter than those of the 2006 outburst. Considering similar shock properties between the two outbursts, this is indicative of a relatively higher particle number density in the synchrotron emitting plasma in the current outburst.
#### A correlation between accretion rate and free-free emission in  protoplanetary disks -- A multi-wavelength analysis of central mm/cm emission  in transition disks

 - **Abstract**
 The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are the locations where most of planets are thought to form and where processes that influence the global evolution of the disk, such as MHD-winds and photoevaporation, originate. Transition disks (TDs) with large inner dust cavities are the ideal targets to study the inner tens of au of disks, as the central emission can be fully disentangled from the outer disk emission. We present a homogeneous multi-wavelength analysis of the continuum emission in a sample of 11 TDs. We investigate the nature of the central emission close to the star, distinguishing between thermal dust and free-free emission. Spatially resolved measurements of continuum emission from archival ALMA data are combined with literature cm-wave observations to study the spectral indices of the inner and outer disks separately. While the emission from the outer disks is consistent with thermal dust emission, 10/11 of the spectral indices estimated for the central emission close to the star suggest that this emission is free-free emission, likely associated with an ionized jet or a disk wind. No correlation between the free-free luminosity and the accretion luminosity or the X-ray luminosity is found, arguing against the photoevaporative wind origin. A sub-linear correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate onto the star is observed, suggesting an origin in an ionized jet. The relative lack of mm-dust grains in the majority of inner disks in transition disks suggests that either such dust grains have drifted quickly towards the central star, grain growth is less efficient in the inner disk, or grains grow rapidly to planetesimal sizes in the inner disk. The observed correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate suggests the outflow is strictly connected with the stellar accretion and that accretion in these disks is driven by a jet.
#### NIR spectral classification of the companion in the gamma-ray binary  HESS J1832-093 as an O6 V star

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1832-093 is a member of the rare class of gamma-ray binaries, as recently confirmed by the detection of orbitally modulated X-ray and gamma-ray emission with a period of ~86 d. The spectral type of the massive companion star has been difficult to retrieve as there is no optical counterpart, but the system is coincident with a near-infrared source. Previous results have shown that the infrared counterpart is consistent with an O or B type star, but a clear classification is still lacking. We observed the counterpart twice, in 2019 and 2021, with the X-Shooter spectrograph operating on the VLT. The obtained spectra classify the counterpart as an O6 V type star. We estimate a distance to the source of $6.7 \pm 0.5$ kpc, although this estimate can be severely affected by the high extinction towards the source. This new O6 V classification for the companion star in HESS J1832-093 provides further support to an apparent grouping around a given spectral type for all discovered gamma-ray binaries that contain an O-type star. This may be due to the interplay between the initial mass function and the wind-momentum-luminosity relation.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of significant neutrino flux from the inner Galactic plane by the IceCube detector has provided us valuable insights on the spectrum of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\sim 10$ below compared to $\pi^0$ and KRA$_\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV. Instead, for Case-II the model can explain up to $\sim 90 \%$ of the neutrino flux at that energy. Moreover, for this scenario IceCube detector could be able to detect neutrino events from the Galactic centre regions. We then calculated the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from individual GMCs and noticed that several current and future Cherenkov telescopes and neutrino observatories have the right sensitivities to study these objects. In particular, very neutrino-bright region such as Aquila Rift is favourable for detection by the IceCube-Gen2 observatory.
#### Distinguishing oceans of water from magma on mini-Neptune K2-18b

 - **Abstract**
 Mildly irradiated mini-Neptunes have densities potentially consistent with them hosting substantial liquid water oceans (`Hycean' planets). The presence of CO2 and simultaneous absence of ammonia (NH3) in their atmospheres has been proposed as a fingerprint of such worlds. JWST observations of K2-18b, the archetypal Hycean, have found the presence of CO2 and the depletion of NH3 to <100 ppm; hence, it has been inferred that this planet may host liquid water oceans. In contrast, climate modelling suggests that many of these mini-Neptunes, including K2-18b, may likely be too hot to host liquid water. We propose a solution to this discrepancy between observation and climate modelling by investigating the effect of a magma ocean on the atmospheric chemistry of mini-Neptunes. We demonstrate that atmospheric NH3 depletion is a natural consequence of the high solubility of nitrogen species in magma at reducing conditions; precisely the conditions prevailing where a thick hydrogen envelope is in communication with a molten planetary surface. The magma ocean model reproduces the present JWST spectrum of K2-18b to < 3 sigma, suggesting this is as credible an explanation for current observations as the planet hosting a liquid water ocean. Spectral areas that could be used to rule out the magma ocean model include the >4um region, where CO2 and CO features dominate: Magma ocean models suggest a systematically lower CO2/CO ratio than estimated from free chemistry retrieval, indicating that deeper observations of this spectral region may be able to distinguish between oceans of liquid water and magma on mini-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 206 unpublished optical spectra of 104 type II supernovae obtained by the Xinglong 2.16m telescope and Lijiang 2.4m telescope during the period from 2011 to 2018, spanning the phases from about 1 to 200 days after the SN explosion. The spectral line identifications, evolution of line velocities and pseudo equivalent widths, as well as correlations between some important spectral parameters are presented. Our sample displays a large range in expansion velocities. For instance, the Fe~{\sc ii} $5169$ velocities measured from spectra at $t\sim 50$ days after the explosion vary from ${\rm 2000\ km\ s^{-1}}$ to ${\rm 5500\ km\ s^{-1}}$, with an average value of ${\rm 3872 \pm 949\ km\ s^{-1}}$. Power-law functions can be used to fit the velocity evolution, with the power-law exponent quantifying the velocity decline rate. We found an anticorrelation existing between H$\beta$ velocity at mid-plateau phase and its velocity decay exponent, SNe II with higher velocities tending to have smaller velocity decay rate. Moreover, we noticed that the velocity decay rate inferred from the Balmer lines (i.e., H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) have moderate correlations with the ratio of absorption to emission for H$\alpha$ (a/e). In our sample, two objects show possibly flash-ionized features at early phases. Besides, we noticed that multiple high-velocity components may exist on the blue side of hydrogen lines of SN 2013ab, possibly suggesting that these features arise from complex line forming region. All our spectra can be found in WISeREP and Zenodo.

 - **Abstract**
 Deriving atmospheric parameters of a large sample of stars is of vital importance to understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Photometric surveys, especially those with near-ultraviolet filters, can offer accurate measurements of stellar parameters, with the precision comparable to that from low/medium resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we explore the capability of measuring stellar atmospheric parameters from CSST broad-band photometry (particularly the near-ultraviolet bands), based on synthetic colors derived from model spectra. We find that colors from the optical and near-ultraviolet filter systems adopted by CSST show significant sensitivities to the stellar atmospheric parameters, especially the metallicity. According to our mock data tests, the precision of the photometric metallicity is quite high, with typical values of 0.17 dex and 0.20 dex for dwarf and giant stars, respectively. The precision of the effective temperature estimated from broad-band colors are within 50 K.

 - **Abstract**
 The minimum variation timescale (MVT) and spectral lag of hundreds of X-ray bursts (XRBs) from soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) J1935+2154 were analyzed in detail for the first time in our recent work, which are important probes for studying the physical mechanism and radiation region. In this work, we investigate their differential and cumulative distributions carefully and find that they follow power-law models. Besides, the distributions of fluctuations in both parameters follow the Tsallis $q$-Gaussian distributions and the $q$ values are consistent for different scale intervals. Therefore, these results indicate that both parameters are scale-invariant, which provides new parameters for the study of self-organized criticality systems. Interestingly, we find that the $q$ values for MVT and spectral lag are similar with duration and fluence, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) is motivated by the premise that spacetime fluctuations near the Planck scale impose a lower bound on the achievable resolution of distances, leading to a minimum length. Inspired by a semiclassical method that integrates the GUP into the partition function by deforming its phase space, we induce a modification on the thermodynamic quantities of the MIT bag model that we propose serves as an effective semiclassical description of deconfined quark matter in a space with minimal length. We investigate the consequences of this deformation on the zero-temperature limit, revealing a saturation limit for the energy density, pressure and baryon number density and an overall decrease of the thermodynamic quantities which suggests an enhanced stability against gravitational collapse. These findings extend existing research on GUP-deformed Fermi gases. Ultimately, our description introduces effects of quantum gravity in the equations of state for compact stars in a mathematically simple manner, suggesting potential for extension to more complex systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply methods of particle track reconstruction in High Energy Physics (HEP) to the search for distinct stellar populations in the Milky Way, using the Gaia EDR3 dataset. This was motivated by analogies between the 3D space points in HEP detectors and the positions of stars (which are also points in a coordinate space) and the way collections of space points correspond to particle trajectories in the HEP, while collections of stars from distinct populations (such as stellar streams) can resemble tracks. Track reconstruction consists of multiple steps, the first one being seeding. In this note we describe our implementation and results of the seeding step to the search for distinct stellar populations, and we indicate how the next step will proceed. Our seeding method uses machine learning tools from the FAISS library, such as the kNN nearest neighbor search.

 - **Abstract**
 To probe the star formation process, we present an observational investigation of the Pillar IV and an ionized knot HH 216 in the Eagle Nebula (M16). Pillar IV is known to host a Class I protostar that drives a bipolar outflow. The outflow has produced the bow shock, HH 216, which is associated with the red-shifted outflow lobe. The James Webb Space Telescope's near- and mid-infrared images (resolution $\sim$0.07 arcsec - 0.7 arcsec) reveal the protostar as a single, isolated object (below 1000 AU). The outer boundary of Pillar IV is depicted with the 3.3 $\mu$m Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. HH 216 is traced with the 4.05 $\mu$m Br$\alpha$ and the radio continuum emission, however it is undetected with 4.693 $\mu$m H$_{2}$ emission. HH 216 seems to be associated with both thermal and non-thermal radio emissions. High-resolution images reveal entangled ionized structures (below 3000 AU) of HH 216, which appear to be located toward termination shocks. New knots in 4.693 $\mu$m H$_{2}$ emission are detected, and are mainly found on Pillar IV's northern side. This particular result supports the previously proposed episodic accretion in the powering source of HH 216. One part of the ionized jet (extent $\sim$0.16 pc) is discovered on the southern side of the driving source. Using the $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0), $^{12}$CO($J$ = 3-2), and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 1-0) emission, observational signposts of Cloud-Cloud Collision (or interacting clouds) toward Pillar IV are investigated. Overall, our results suggest that the interaction of molecular cloud components around 23 and 26 km s$^{-1}$ might have influenced star formation activity in Pillar IV.
#### Photometric redshifts and intrinsic alignments: degeneracies and biases  in 3$\times$2pt analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of cosmological parameter bias in weak lensing and large-scale structure analyses for upcoming imaging surveys induced by the interplay of intrinsic alignments (IA) and photometric redshift (photo-z) model mis-specification error. We first examine the degeneracies between the parameters of the Tidal Alignment - Tidal Torquing (TATT) model for IA and of a photo-z model including a mean shift ($\Delta \bar{z}$) and variance ($\sigma_{z}$) for each tomographic bin of lenses and sources, under a variety of underlying true IA behaviors. We identify strong degeneracies between: (1) the redshift scaling of the tidal alignment amplitude and the mean shift and variances of source bins, (2) the redshift scaling of the tidal torquing amplitude and the variance of the lowest-$z$ source bin, and (3) the IA source density weighting and the mean shift and variance of several source bins. We then use this information to guide our exploration of the level of cosmological parameter bias which can be induced given incorrect modelling of IA, photo-z, or both. We find that marginalizing over all the parameters of TATT is generally sufficient to preclude cosmological parameter bias in the scenarios we consider. However, this does not necessarily mean that IA and photo-z parameters are themselves unbiased, nor does it mean that the best-fit model is a good fit to the data. We also find scenarios where the inferred parameters produce $\chi^2_{\rm DOF}$ values indicative of a good fit but cosmological parameter bias is significant, particularly when the IA source density weighting parameter is not marginalized over.
#### Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Light Curves in the Open  Supernova Catalog

 - **Abstract**
 The ever-growing sample of observed supernovae enhances our capacity for comprehensive supernova population studies, providing a richer dataset for understanding the diverse characteristics of Type Ia supernovae and possibly that of their progenitors. Here, we present a data-driven analysis of observed Type Ia supernova photometric light curves collected in the Open Supernova Catalog. Where available, we add the environmental information from the host galaxy. We focus on identifying sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae without imposing the pre-defined sub-classes found in the literature to date. To do so, we employ an implicit-rank minimizing autoencoder neural network for developing low-dimensional data representations, providing a compact representation of the supernova light curve diversity. When we analyze light curves alone, we find that one of our resulting latent variables is strongly correlated with redshift, allowing us to approximately ``de-redshift'' the other latent variables describing each event. After doing so, we find that three of our latent variables account for $\sim$95\% of the variance in our sample, and provide a natural separation between 91T and 91bg thermonuclear supernovae. Of note, the 02cx subclass is not unambiguously delineated from the 91bg sample in our results, nor do either the over-luminous 91T or the under-luminous 91bg/02cx samples form a clearly distinct population from the broader sample of ``other'' SN Ia events. We identify the physical characteristics of supernova light curves which best distinguish SNe 91T from SNe 91bg \& 02cx, and discuss prospects for future refinements and applications to other classes of supernovae as well as other transients.
