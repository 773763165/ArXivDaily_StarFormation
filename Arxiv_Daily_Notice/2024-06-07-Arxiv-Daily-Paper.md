 - **Abstract**
 GWnext 2024 was a meeting held in the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in March $4^\text{th} - 8^\text{th}$, 2024. In the meeting researchers at different career stages -- with a particular focus on early career scientists -- working on the different aspects of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy gathered to discuss the current status as well as prospects of the field. The meeting was divided into three core sessions: Astrophysics, GW Theory, and Detection. Each session consisted of introductory talks and extended discussion sessions. Moreover, there was a poster session where students could present their results. In this paper, we summarize the results presented during the meeting and present the most important outcomes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) for JWST is supplied with a suite of imaging bandpass filters optimized for full spectral coverage in eight intermediate-width bands from 5 to 26 microns and a narrower one at 11.3 microns. This contrasts with previous infrared space telescopes, which generally have provided only two broad bands, one near 10 microns and the other near 20 microns. The expanded MIRI spectral capability provides new possibilities for detailed interpretation of survey results. This is an important feature of the instrument, on top of its great increase in sensitivity and angular resolution over any previous mission. The Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) was designed to take full advantage of this capability. This paper briefly describes the history of infrared surveys that paved the way for MIRI on JWST and for our approach to designng SMILES. It illustrates the use of the observations for a broad range of science programs, and concludes with a brief summary of the need for additional surveys with JWST/MIRI.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheric response for MeV $\gamma$ rays ($\sim$ 0.1 $-$ 10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth's atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work we simulate the full response for $\gamma$-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant towards lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of $\sim2-4$, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The Forschungszentrum Juelich has been hosting the German part of the LOFAR archive since 2013. It is Germany's most extensive radio astronomy archive, currently storing nearly 22 petabytes (PB) of data. Future radio telescopes are expected to require a dramatic increase in long-term data storage. Here, we take stock of the current data management of the Juelich LOFAR Data Archive, describe the ingestion, the storage system, the export to the long-term archive, and the request chain. We analysed the data availability over the last 10 years and searched for the underlying data access pattern and the energy consumption of the process. We determine hardware-related limiting factors, such as network bandwidth and cache pool availability and performance, and software aspects, e.g. workflow adjustment and parameter tuning, as the main data storage bottlenecks. By contrast, the challenge in providing the data from the archive for the users lies in retrieving the data from the tape archive and staging them. Building on this analysis, we suggest how to avoid/mitigate these problems in the future and define the requirements for future even more extensive long-term data archives.

          The signatures of density fluctuations and mixing gas in circumgalactic absorption systems

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the prospects for detecting and constraining density and temperature inhomogeneities in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using absorption measurements of metal ions. Distributions in the gas thermal properties could arise from turbulence, gas cooling from the hot phase, and mixing between the cool and hot phases. Focusing on these physically motivated models, we parameterize each with a single parameter for simplicity and provide empirical and theoretical estimates for reasonable parameter values. We then construct the probability distribution functions for each of these scenarios, calculate the effective ion fractions, and fit our models to the COS-Halos absorption measurements to infer the gas densities and metallicities. We find that the models we consider (i) produce similarly good fits to the observations with or without distributions in the gas thermal properties, and (ii) result in detectable changes in the column densities only at the boundaries of reasonable parameter values. We show that He II self-shielding can have a larger effect on the ion fractions than density and temperature fluctuations. As a result, uncertainties in cloud geometry and their spatial distribution, affecting the details of radiation transfer, may obscure the effect of inhomogeneities.

          Superbubbles as Galactic PeVatrons: The Potential Role of Rapid Second-Order Fermi Acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Galactic cosmic rays is still a mystery, in particular the sources and acceleration mechanism for cosmic rays with energies up to or beyond a PeV. Recently LHAASO has and H.E.S.S have shown that two gamma-ray sources associated with superbubbles created by young massive stellar clusters are likely PeVatrons. This has renewed the interest in the cosmic-ray acceleration processes in superbubbles. To study the possibility and conditions under which second-order Fermi acceleration can accelerate particles beyond PeV energies in superbubbles. An analytical equation is derived for the maximum energy a cosmic-ray particle can obtain as a function of acceleration duration. The maximum energy depends critically on the diffusion coefficient D and the Alfvén velocity, $V_A$. The analytical solutions for the acceleration time scale shows that second-order Fermi acceleration can be just as efficient as diffusive shock acceleration, when comparable relevant velocities are used-i.e. the Alfvén velocity or shock velocity. The probable values for the diffusion coefficient and Alvén speed are studied for two likely PeVatron regions, HESS J1646-458 associated with Westerlund 1, and the Cygnus Cocoon, associated Cyg OB2. It is shown that within a typical stellar cluster time scale of 1-5 Myr cosmic-rays can be accelerated to $> 10^{15}$ eV, provided that $V_{\rm A} > 300$ km/s, and the diffusion coefficient is $D \sim 10^{26}$ cm$^2$/s at 100 TeV. This suggests that second-order Fermi acceleration in superbubbles should be considered as a possible source of Galactic cosmic rays up to, or beyond a PeV.

          Confirming the Explosive Dispersal Outflow in DR21 with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm continuum and CO(2-1) line emission observations toward the high-mass star formation region DR21. Five new continuum sources are found. We identify eighteen outflow streamers detected in CO emission radially arising from a common origin. The velocity spread of the outflow streamers range between $-$100 to $+$70 km s$^{-1}$. The radial velocities of each outflow roughly follow linear gradients (Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions). Using the CO emission of the whole ensemble of streamers we estimate a total outflow mass of 120-210M$_{\odot}$. Additionally, we derived the dynamical age (8600 yr), momentum ($\sim10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), and kinetic energy ($\sim10^{48}$ erg) of the outflow. The morphology and kinematics presented by the CO outflow streamers confirm the presence of an explosive dispersal outflow at the heart of DR21. Five dispersal explosive outflows associated with massive star-forming regions have been confirmed in our Galaxy (Orion BN/KL, G5.89-0.39, S106-IR, IRAS16076-5134 and IRAS 12326-6245). However, their frequency of occurrence in the Galaxy and the originating nature are still uncertain.

          Molecular Cloud Matching in $\mathrm{CO}$ and Dust in M33 I. High-Resolution Hydrogen Column Density Maps from {\sl \textbf{Herschel}}

 - **Abstract**
 This study is aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular hydrogen distribution in the galaxy M33 by introducing novel methods for generating high angular resolution (18.2$''$, equivalent to 75 pc) column density maps of molecular hydrogen ($N_{\rm H_2}$). M33 is a local group galaxy that has been observed with Herschel in the far-infrared wavelength range from 70 to 500 $\mum$. Previous studies have presented total hydrogen column density maps ($N_{\rm H}$), using these FIR data (partly combined with mid-IR maps), employing various methods. We first performed a spectral energy distribution fit to the 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mum$ continuum data obtain $N_{\rm H}$, using a technique similar to one previously reported in the literature. We also use a second method which involves translating only the 250 $\mum$ map into a $N_{\rm H}$ map at the same angular resolution. An $N_{\rm H_2}$ map via each method is then obtained by subtracting the HI component. Distinguishing our study from previous ones, we adopt a more versatile approach by considering a variable emissivity index, $\beta$ and dust absorption coefficient, $\kappa_0$. This choice enables us to construct a $\kappa_0$ map, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of our investigation of the hydrogen column density. We address the inherent biases and challenges within both methods (which give similar results) and compare them with existing maps available in the literature. Moreover, we calculate a map of the carbon monoxide CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (\Xco\ factor), which shows a strong dispersion around an average value of $1.8\times10^{20}\,\cmKkms$ throughout the disk. We obtain column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) from the $N_{\rm H}$, $N_{\rm H_2}$, and $N_{HI}$ maps and discuss their shape, consisting of several log-normal and power-law tail components.

          Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield. The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future orbital measurements of Mercury and near-Sun asteroids can refine these constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback driven massive outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and influencing the dynamics of surrounding media. Extracting outflow properties from spectral lines is a notoriously difficult process for a number of reasons, including the possibility that a substantial fraction of the outflow is carried by dense gas in a very narrow range in velocity. This gas can hide in spectra with insufficient resolution. Empirically motivated analysis based on the Apparent Optical Depth method, commonly used in the literature, neglects the contribution of this gas, and may therefore underestimate the true gas column density. More complex semi-analytical line transfer (e.g., SALT) models, on the other hand, allow for the presence of this gas by modeling the radial density and velocity of the outflows as power laws. Here we compare the two approaches to quantify the uncertainties in the inferences of outflow properties based on 1-D "down-the-barrel" using the UV spectra of the CLASSY galaxy sample. We find that empirical modeling may significantly underestimate the column densities relative to SALT analysis, particularly in the optically thick regime. We use simulations to show that the main reason for this discrepancy is the presence of large amount of dense material at low velocities, which can be hidden by the finite spectral resolution of the data. The SALT models in turn could over-estimate the column densities if the assumed power laws of the density profiles strong are not a property of actual outflows.

          Impact of nuclear matter properties on the nucleosynthesis and the kilonova from binary neutron star merger ejecta

 - **Abstract**
 Material expelled from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can harbor r-process nucleosynthesis and power a Kilonova (KN), both intimately related to the astrophysical conditions of the ejection. In turn such conditions indirectly depend on the equation of state (EOS) describing matter inside the neutron star. Therefore, in principle the above observables can hold valuable information on nuclear matter, as the merger gravitational wave signal already does. In this work, we consider the outcome of a set of BNS merger simulations employing different finite-temperature nuclear EOSs. The latter are obtained from a Skyrme-type interaction model where nuclear properties, such as the incompressibility and the nucleon effective mass at saturation density, are systematically varied. We post-process the ejecta using a reaction network coupled with a semi-analytic KN model, to asses the sensitivity on the input EOS of the final yields and the KN light curves. Both of them are found to be non-trivially influenced by the EOS, with the overall outcome being dominated by the heterogeneous outflows from the remnant disk, hosting a variable degree of neutron-rich material. The dynamical ejecta can be more directly related to the EOS parameters considered, however, we find its role in the yields production and the KN emission too entangled with the other ejecta components, in order to infer solid correlations. This result highlights the strong degeneracy that intervenes between the merger outcome and the behaviour of the intrinsic nuclear matter, and places itself as a limit to the employment of EOS-constraining approaches of such kind.

          A $\gamma$-Ray Emitting Blazar at Redshift 3.64: Fermi-LAT and OVRO Observations of PKS 0201+113

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z >3$) $\gamma$-ray blazars are rare, but they are crucial for our understanding of jet evolution, $\gamma$-ray production and propagation, and the growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe. A new analysis of Fermi-LAT data reveals a significant (5$\sigma$), spectrally soft ($\Gamma \simeq$ 3.0) $\gamma$-ray source in a specific 4-month epoch, cospatial with PKS 0201+113 ($z$ = 3.64). Monitoring of PKS 0201+113 at 15 GHz by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m Telescope from 2008 to 2023 shows a prominent flare that dominates the radio light curve. The maximum of the radio flare coincides with the $\gamma$-ray flare, strongly suggesting an association ($\textrm{p-value}=0.023$) between the $\gamma$-ray and the radio sources. PKS 0201+113 is only the third $\gamma$-ray blazar to be identified with $z> 3.5$, and it is the first such object to be identified by the detection of quasi-simultaneous $\gamma$-ray and radio flares. The jet properties of this peculiar blazar have been investigated. A detailed study of a two-zone leptonic model is presented that fits the broadband spectral energy distribution. An alternative scenario is also briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration flashes with unknown origins. Its formation rate is crucial for unveiling physical origins. However, the luminosity and formation rate are degenerated when directly fitting the redshift distribution of FRBs. In contrast to previous forward-fitting methods, we use the Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to derive luminosity function and formation rate of FRBs without any assumptions. Using the non-repeating FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we find a relatively strong luminosity evolution, and luminosity function can be fitted by a broken power-law model with a break at $1.33\times10^{41}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The formation rate declines rapidly as $(1+z)^{-4.9\pm0.3}$ with a local rate $1.13\times10^4\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This monotonic decrease is similar to the rate of short gamma-ray bursts. After comparing it with star formation rate and stellar mass density, we conclude that the old populations including neutron stars and black holes, are closely related to the origins of FRBs. Monte Carlo simulations are used to test our results. The distributions of mock sample are consistent with the observational data.

          Shockingly Bright Warm Carbon Monoxide Molecular Features in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A Revealed by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec- IFU spectroscopy of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the reformation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3 - 5.5 microns) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar VI] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si IX], [Ca IV], [Ca V] and [Mg IV]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudo-continuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. The CO also shows high J lines at different vibrational transitions. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of 1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae, and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The pion-bump structure in the gamma-ray spectrum is a direct proof for the hadronic origin of the gamma rays, and thus the decisive evidence for the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays in astrophysical objects. However, the identification of such a spectral feature is limited by the resolution and energy coverage of current gamma-ray instruments. Furthermore, there are unavoidable bremsstrahlung emissions from secondary and primary electrons, which may dominate the gamma-ray emission below the pion-bump. Thus, the study of this gamma-ray emission component can provide unique information on the acceleration and confinement of high-energy particles. In this paper, we studied the predicted gamma-ray spectrum assuming both hadronic or leptonic origin in mid-aged supernova remnants W44, we discuss the detection potential of future MeV missions on these emissions and possible implications.

          Increasing the detectability of long-period and nulling pulsars in next-generation pulsar surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of multiple long-period pulsars (periods ${\sim}10\,$s or larger) are starting to challenge the conventional notion that coherent radio emission cannot be produced by objects that are below the many theorised death lines. Many of the past pulsar surveys and software have been prone to selection effects that restricted their sensitivities towards long-period and sporadically-emitting objects. Pulsar surveys using new-generation low-frequency facilities are starting to employ longer dwell times, which makes them significantly more sensitive in detecting long-period or nulling pulsars. There have also been software advancements to aid more sensitive searches towards long-period objects. Furthermore, recent discoveries suggest that nulling may be a key aspect of the long-period pulsar population. We simulate both long-period and nulling pulsar signals, using the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter (SMART) survey data as reference, and explore the detection efficacy of popular search methods such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), fast-folding algorithm (FFA) and single pulse search (SPS). For FFT-based search and SPS, we make use of the PRESTO implementation, and for FFA we use RIPTIDE. We find RIPTIDE's FFA to be more sensitive; however, it is also the slowest algorithm. PRESTO's FFT, although faster than others, also shows some unexpected inaccuracies in detection properties. SPS is highly sensitive to long-period and nulling signals, but only for pulses with high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratios. We use these findings to inform current and future pulsar surveys that aim to uncover a large population of long-period or nulling objects and comment on how to make optimal use of these methods in unison.

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of significant progress in the research of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in recent decade, their origin is still under extensive debate. Investigation on the population of FRBs can provide new insight into this interesting problem. In this paper, based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we construct a Bayesian framework to analyze the FRB population, with the selection effect of the CHIME telescope being properly taken into account. The energy function is modeled as the power-law with an exponential cutoff. Four redshift distribution models are considered, i.e., the star formation history (SFH) model, and three time-delayed models (Gaussian delay, log-normal delay, and power-law delay). The free parameters are simultaneously constrained using Bayesian inference method, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model comparison. According to BIC, the log-normal delay model fits the data best. The power-law delay model and Gaussian delay model can also give reasonable fits, although they are not as good as the log-normal delay model. However, the SFH model is strongly disfavored compared with the three time-delayed models. The energy function is tightly constrained and is almost independent of the redshift models, with the best-fitting power-law index $\alpha\approx 1.8$, and cut-off energy $\log(E_c/{\rm erg})\approx 42$. The FRB population shows on average $3\sim 5$ billion years time delay with respect to the SFH. Therefore, the hypothesis that the FRB population traces the SFH is conclusively ruled out.

          Triton and Pluto: same origin but separated at birth

 - **Abstract**
 Assessing the origin of Pluto and Triton has profound implications for the bigger picture of Solar System formation and evolution. In such a context, this chapter reviews our current knowledge of the formation conditions of Pluto and Triton's constitutive building blocks in the protosolar nebula, which can be derived from their known or estimated volatile contents. Assuming that the ultravolatiles carbon monoxide and dinitrogen detected in Pluto and Triton are primordial, the presence of these molecules suggest that the two bodies accreted material originating from the vicinity of the carbon monoxide and dinitrogen icelines. Dinitrogen--rich and water--poor comets such as comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) obviously present a compositional link with Pluto and Triton, indicating that their building blocks formed in nearby regions of the protosolar nebula, despite of the variation of the water abundance among those bodies. Also, the assumption of Triton's growth in Neptune's circumplanetary disk requires that its building blocks formed at earlier epochs in the protosolar nebula, to remain consistent with its estimated composition.

 - **Abstract**
 We report data analysis results about the outburst evolution and spectral properties during the hard state of the recently discovered X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-163 as observed by \emph{Insight}-HXMT and NuSTAR. We find that the broadband X-ray spectrum of Swift J1727.8-163 is more complex than the most typical spectral patterns of black hole X-ray binary systems, with not only a comparatively weaker reflection component but also an additional spectral continuum component, manifesting itself as a hard X-ray tail beyond the thermal Comptonization description detectable below 100 keV. This additional component can be phenomenologically well fitted by adding an extra power-law model with high energy exponential cutoff in the 2-120 keV energy band. We made an attempt to explain the broadband X-ray spectral continuum with a thermal/non-thermal hybrid plasma corona scenario , and find an ultra high compactness parameter ($l_{\rm s}\sim2000$) and a steep non-thermal electron distribution ($\Gamma_{\rm inj}>4$), suggesting the source was accreting with high Eddington rates and that the electron acceleration mechanism is not very efficient. We also present a detailed multi-epoch analysis of spectral properties using \emph{Insight}-HXMT data to investigate the evolution of the key physical properties regarding the disk and corona during the hard states. No significant variation is found with the inner disk radius and the coronal temperature during this time period, and the weak reflection and hard X-ray tail features are persistent. We discuss the physical implications of our spectral analysis results in the context of disk-corona relation, particle acceleration, and jet contribution, during the rise of a black hole X-ray binary in outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Progenitor stars of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be surrounded by a significant and complex nebula structure lying at a parsec scale distance. After the initial release of energy from the GRB jet, the jet will interact with this nebula environment. We show here that for a large, plausible parameter space region, the interaction between the jet blastwave and the wind termination (reverse) shock is expected to be weak, and may be associated with a precursor emission. As the jet blast wave encounters the contact discontinuity separating the shocked wind and the shocked interstellar medium, we find that a bright flash of synchrotron emission from the newly-formed reverse shock is produced. This flash is expected to be observed at around ~100 s after the initial explosion and precursor. Such a delayed emission thus constitutes a circumburst medium (CBM) phase in a GRB, having a physically distinct origin from the preceding prompt phase and the succeeding afterglow phase. The CBM phase emission may thus provide a natural explanation to bursts observed to have a precursor followed by an intense, synchrotron-dominated main episode that is found in a substantial minority, ~10% of GRBs. A correct identification of the emission phase is thus required to infer the properties of the flow and of the immediate environment around GRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an investigation of spectral properties of 10 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered by the uGMRT, observed from 2017-2023 using band 3 (300-500 MHz) and 4 (550-750 MHz) of uGMRT. For these MSPs, we have reported a range of spectral indices from ~0 to -4.8, while averaging the full observing band and all the observing epochs. For every MSP, we calculated the mean flux densities across 7-8 sub-bands each with approximately 25 MHz bandwidth spanning band 3 and band 4. We computed their modulation indices as well as average and maximum-to-median flux densities within each subband. Using a temporal variation of flux density we calculated the refractive scintillation time scales and estimated structure function with time lag for 8 MSPs in the sample. We note a significant temporal evolution of the in-band spectra, classified into three categories based on the nature of the best-fit power-law spectra, having single positive spectral indices, multiple broken power law, and single negative spectral indices. Additionally, indications of low-frequency turnover and a temporal variation of the turnover frequency (to the extent that turnover was observed for some of the epochs while not seen for the rest) were noted for all the MSPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation probing temporal changes in the MSP spectra as well as in turnover frequency. Future exploration with dense monitoring combined with modeling of spectra can provide vital insight into the intrinsic emission properties of the MSPs and ISM properties.

 Schaefer (2024) has recently published observations of binary period derivatives $\dot P$ for 52 cataclysmic variables, and concluded that these strongly conflict with all proposed evolutionary pictures for these systems. We point out once again that using measurements of $\dot P$ is likely in practice to produce misleading evolutionary constraints in almost every case. The one identified exception to this is probably the recently-born X-ray binary SN 2022jli, because of its extremely high mass transfer rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian evidence is a standard method used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days. Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models. In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.

 - **Abstract**
 PyExoCross is a Python adaptation of the ExoCross Fortran application, PyExoCross is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP databases. PyExoCross generates absorption and emission stick spectra, cross-sections, and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes, and oscillator strengths) based on molecular line lists. PyExoCross calculates cross-sections with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profiles in both sampling and binned methods; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles which we test for speed and accuracy. PyExoCross supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats. PyExoCross also provides conversion between the ExoMol and HITRAN data formats. In addition, PyExoCross has extra code for users to automate the batch download of line list files from the ExoMol database.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the numerical simulations of axisymmetric, relativistic, optically thin jets under the influence of the radiation field of an accretion disk. We show that starting from a very low injection velocity at the base, jets can be accelerated to relativistic terminal speeds when traveling through the radiation field. The jet gains momentum through the interaction with the radiation field. We use a relativistic equation of state for multi-species plasma, which self-consistently calculates the adiabatic index for the jet material. All the jet solutions obtained are transonic in nature. In addition to the acceleration of the jet to relativistic speeds, our results show that the radiation field also acts as a collimating agent. The jets remain well collimated under the effect of radiation pressure. We also show that if the jet starts with a rotational velocity, the radiation field will reduce the angular momentum of the jet beam.

 Excess of gamma rays with a spherical morphology around the Galactic center (GC) observed in the Fermi large area telescope (LAT) data is one of the most intriguing features in the gamma-ray sky. The excess has been interpreted by annihilating dark matter as well as emission from a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We use a multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources with machine learning to study the distribution of MSP-like sources among unassociated Fermi-LAT sources near the GC. We find that the source count distribution of MSP-like sources is comparable with the MSP explanation of the GC excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Since 2019, GRAVITY has provided direct observations of giant planets and brown dwarfs at separations of down to 95 mas from the host star. Some of these observations have provided the first direct confirmation of companions previously detected by indirect techniques (astrometry and radial velocities). We want to improve the observing strategy and data reduction in order to lower the inner working angle of GRAVITY in dual-field on-axis mode. We also want to determine the current limitations of the instrument when observing faint companions with separations in the 30-150 mas range. To improve the inner working angle, we propose a fiber off-pointing strategy during the observations to maximize the ratio of companion-light-to-star-light coupling in the science fiber. We also tested a lower-order model for speckles to decouple the companion light from the star light. We then evaluated the detection limits of GRAVITY using planet injection and retrieval in representative archival data. We compare our results to theoretical expectations. We validate our observing and data-reduction strategy with on-sky observations; first in the context of brown dwarf follow-up on the auxiliary telescopes with HD 984 B, and second with the first confirmation of a substellar candidate around the star Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464. With synthetic companion injection, we demonstrate that the instrument can detect companions down to a contrast of $8\times 10^{-4}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 7.7$ mag) at a separation of 35 mas, and a contrast of $3\times 10^{-5}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 11$ mag) at 100 mas from a bright primary (K<6.5), for 30 min exposure time. With its inner working angle and astrometric precision, GRAVITY has a unique reach in direct observation parameter space. This study demonstrates the promising synergies between GRAVITY and Gaia for the confirmation and characterization of substellar companions.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modelling of the one-to-two halo transition has long been difficult to achieve. We demonstrate that physically motivated halo definitions that respect the bimodal phase-space distribution of dark matter particles near halos resolves this difficulty. Specifically, the two phase-space components are overlapping and correspond to: 1) particles \it orbiting \rm the halo; and 2) particles \it infalling \rm into the halo for the first time. Motivated by this decomposition, García [R. García et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] advocated for defining haloes as the collection of particles orbiting their self-generated potential. This definition identifies the traditional one-halo term of the halo--mass correlation function with the distribution of orbiting particles around a halo, while the two-halo term governs the distribution of infalling particles. We use dark matter simulations to demonstrate that the distribution of orbiting particles is finite and can be characterised by a single physical scale $r_{\rm h}$, which we refer to as the \it halo radius. \rm The two-halo term is described using a simple yet accurate empirical model based on the Zel'dovich correlation function. We further demonstrate that the halo radius imprints itself on the distribution of infalling particles at small scales. Our final model for the halo--mass correlation function is accurate at the $\approx 2\%$ level for $r \in [0.1,50]\ h^{-1}\ Mpc$. The Fourier transform of our best fit model describes the halo--mass power spectrum with comparable accuracy for $k\in [0.06, 6.0]\ h\ Mpc^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory restricted to single stars predicts a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of around eight solar masses; this minimum mass corresponds to a maximum age of around 45 million years for the progenitor and the coeval population of stars. Binary evolution complicates this prediction. For example, an older stellar population around 100 million years could contain stellar mergers that reach the minimum mass for core collapse. Despite this clear prediction by binary evolution, there are few, if any CCSNe associated with a distinctly older stellar population...until now. The stellar population within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar is inconsistent with single-star evolution only; instead, the most likely solution is that the stellar population is $\ge$80 Myr old, and the brightest stars are mass gainers and/or mergers, the result of binary evolution. The evidence is as follows. Even though the main sequence is clearly dominated by a $\ge$80-Myr-old population, a large fraction of the corresponding red giants is missing. The best-fitting single-star model expects 51.5 red giants, yet there are only 22; the Poisson probability of this is $1.7 \times 10^{-6}$. In addition, there is an overabundance of bright, young-looking stars (25-30 Myrs old), yet there is not a corresponding young main sequence (MS). Upon closer inspection, the vast majority of the young-looking stars show either past or current signs of binary evolution. These new results are possible due to exquisite Gaia parallaxes and a new age-dating software called {\it Stellar Ages}.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have emerged as potential $\gamma$-ray sources, after the recent association of a dozen YMSCs with extended $\gamma$-ray emission. The large size of the detected halos, comparable to that of the wind-blown bubble expected around YMSCs, makes the $\gamma$-ray detection of individual YMSCs rather challenging. As a result, the emission from most of the Galactic YMSCs could be unresolved, thus contributing to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray radiation observed along the Galactic Plane. Aims: In this study, we estimate the possible contribution to the Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from a synthetic population of YMSCs, and we compare it with observations obtained with different experiments, from 1 GeV to hundreds of TeV, in two regions of the Galactic Plane. Methods: As the population of galactic YMSCs is only known locally, we evaluate the contribution of $\gamma$-ray emission relying on the simulation of synthetic populations of YMSCs based on the observed properties of local clusters. We compute the $\gamma$-ray emission from each cluster assuming that the radiation is purely hadronic in nature and produced by cosmic rays accelerated at the cluster's collective wind termination shock. Results: We find that the $\gamma$-ray emission from unresolved YMSCs can significantly contribute to the observed Galactic diffuse flux, especially in the inner part of the Galaxy. The result is independent of the assumed particle transport, but an important role is played by Wolf-Rayet stars. The predicted $\gamma$-ray flux should be considered as a lower limit, given that our calculation neglects the contribution of supernovae exploding in YMSCs.

 - **Abstract**
 KIC 4150611 is a high-order multiple composed of a triple system composed of the F1V primary (Aa), which is eclipsed on a 94.2d period by a tight 1.52d binary composed of two dim K/M dwarfs (Ab1, Ab2), which also eclipse each other; an 8.65d eccentric, eclipsing binary composed of two G stars (Ba, Bb); and another faint eclipsing binary composed of two stars of unknown spectral type (Ca and Cb). In addition to its many eclipses, the system is an SB3 spectroscopic multiple (Aa, Ba, and Bb) and the primary (Aa) is a hybrid pulsator. We employ a novel photometric analysis of the complicated eclipse geometry of Aa to obtain orbital and stellar properties of the triple. We acquired 51 TRES spectra at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory, calculating radial velocities and orbital elements of Aa (SB1) and the B binary (SB2). These spectra and radial velocities are used to perform spectral disentangling for Aa, Ba, and Bb. Spectral modelling is applied to the disentangled spectrum of Aa to obtain atmospheric properties. We obtain precise stellar properties of the triple, including the mass ratios (MAa/(MAb1 + MAb2) = 3.61 +/- 0.01, MAb1/MAb2 = 1.113 +/- 0.001), separation ratio (aAab/aAb1Ab2 = 21.81 +/- 0.01), orbital periods (PAab = 94.29486 +/- 0.00008d, PAb1Ab2 = 1.522248 +/- 0.000001d), and stellar radii (RAa = 1.64 +/- 0.06 Rsun, RAb1 = 0.42 +/- 0.01 Rsun, RAb2 = 0.38 +/- 0.01 Rsun). Radial velocity fitting and spectral disentangling arrive at orbital elements for Aa, Ba, and Bb in excellent agreement with each other and with previous results in the literature. Spectral modelling on the disentangled spectrum of Aa provides constraints on the effective temperature (Teff = 7280 +/- 70 K), surface gravity (log(g) = 4.14 +/- 0.18 dex), micro-turbulent velocity (vmicro = 3.61 +/- 0.19 km s-1), rotation velocity (v sin i = 127 +/- 4 km s-1), and metallicity ([M/H] = -0.23 +/- 0.06).

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between T Tauri stars and their circumstellar disks, and how this impacts the onset of planet formation has yet to be established. We studied a seemingly old T Tauri star, PDS 111, and its disk. We analyzed optical, infrared, and sub-millimeter observations obtained with VLT/X-shooter, Mercator/HERMES, TESS, VLT/SPHERE, and ALMA, providing a new view on PDS 111 and its protoplanetary disk. The multi-epoch spectroscopy yields photospheric lines to classify the star, and emission lines to study variability in the hot inner disk and to determine the mass-accretion rate. The SPHERE and ALMA observations are used to characterize the dust distribution of the small and large grains, respectively. PDS 111 is a weak-line T Tauri star with spectral type G2, exhibits strong H$\alpha$ variability and with a low mass-accretion rate of $1-5\times10^{-10}$\,M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We measured an age of the system of 15.9$^{+1.7}_{-3.7}$ Myr using pre-main sequence tracks. The SPHERE observations show a strongly flaring disk with an asymmetric substructure. The ALMA observations reveal a 30 au cavity in the dust continuum emission with a low contrast asymmetry in the South-West of the disk and a dust disk mass of 45.8\,$M_\oplus$. The $^{12}$CO radial extension is at least three times larger than that of the dust emission. Although the measured age is younger than suggested in literature, PDS 111 still seems relatively old; this provides insight into disk properties at an advanced stage of pre-main sequence evolution. The characteristics of this disk are very similar to its younger counterparts: strongly flaring, an average disk mass, a typical radial extent of the disk gas and dust, and the presence of common substructures. This suggests that disk evolution has not significantly changed the disk properties. These results show similarities with the "Peter Pan disks" around M-dwarfs.

 The presence of young massive stars in the Galactic Centre (GC) raises questions about star formation near the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Additionally, the initial mass function (IMF) in this region appears different from the standard Salpeter/Kroupa law. Extreme extinction and crowding limit our understanding of the stellar population, with spectroscopic data available only for selected bright sources. We aim to improve knowledge about the distribution and IMF of young, massive stars near Sgr A*. Using intermediate band (IB) photometry, we identify candidates for massive young stars through Bayesian inference, a neural network, and a gradient-boosted trees algorithm. We obtained spectral energy distributions for 6590 stars, 1181 of which have been previously classified spectroscopically. We identify 351 stars classified as early types by all three methods, including 155 newly identified candidates. The radial density profiles for late and early-type stars fit broken power laws, with a break radius of 9.2 +- 0.6'' for early-type stars. Late-type stars show a core-like distribution around Sgr A*, while early-type stars' density increases steeply towards the black hole. We infer a top-heavy IMF of young stars near Sgr A* (R < 9''), with a power-law of 1.6 +- 0.1. At greater distances, a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF fits the data. IB photometry also constrains the metallicities of late-type stars, estimating metallicities for over 600 stars. The IMF variation with radial distance suggests different star formation mechanisms, with a top-heavy IMF near Sgr A* consistent with disc star formation.

The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0>\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method to obtain rapid mass loss rates in binary systems, specifically at the onset of MT episodes. The method unifies atmospheric (underflow) and $L_1$ stream (overflow) mass rates in a single continuous procedure. The method uses averaged 3D properties of the binaries, such as effective binary potential and effective binary acceleration, to both evolve the donor and obtain properties of the matter at the $L_1$ plane. In the case of underflow, we obtain atmospheric stratification. Our method can be used for binaries with an extensive range of mass ratios, $0.01 \le q \le 100$, and can also be applied to hot donors. The considered examples show that the MT rates obtained with this revised formalism always differ from the optically thin and optically thick MT rates widely used during the computations of binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs represent the end stage for 97% of stars, making precise parameter measurement crucial for understanding stellar evolution. Traditional estimation methods involve fitting spectra or photometry, which require high-quality data. In recent years, machine learning has played a crucial role in processing spectral data due to its speed, automation, and accuracy. However, two common issues have been identified. First, most studies rely on data with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR > 10), leaving many poor-quality datasets underutilized. Second, existing machine learning models, primarily based on convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and their variants, cannot simultaneously capture both the spatial and sequential information of spectra. To address these challenges, we designed the Estimator Network (EstNet), an advanced algorithm integrating multiple techniques, including Residual Networks, Squeeze and Excitation Attention, Gated Recurrent Units, Adaptive Loss, and Monte-Carlo Dropout Layers. We conducted parameter estimation on 5,965 poor-quality white dwarf spectra (R~1800, SNR~1.17), achieving average percentage errors of 14.86% for effective temperature and 3.97% for surface gravity. These results are significantly superior to other mainstream algorithms and consistent with the outcomes of traditional theoretical spectrum fitting methods. In the future, our algorithms will be applied for large-scale parameter estimation on the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 While the secondary in a binary asteroid plays an important role in the precession of the mutual orbit, this role has not been thoroughly studied. Given the complex spin-orbit coupled dynamics in binary asteroids, we use a numerical approach to study the relationship between the secondary's shape and spin and the apsidal precession rate of the orbit. Using this approach in conjunction with observations of Didymos, we find it is likely that Dimorphos was significantly reshaped as a result of the DART impact, with its new shape more elongated than the pre-impact shape. Finally, we show that non-principal axis rotation of the secondary can lead to a chaotic evolution of the longitude of the periapsis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new analysis of the KELT-24 system, comprising a well-aligned hot Jupiter, KELT-24~b, and a bright ($V=8.3$), nearby ($d=96.9~\mathrm{pc}$) F-type host star. KELT-24~b was independently discovered by two groups in 2019, with each reporting best-fit stellar parameters that were notably inconsistent. Here, we present three independent analyses of the KELT-24 system, each incorporating a broad range of photometric and spectroscopic data, including eight sectors of TESS photometry and more than 200 new radial velocities (RVs) from MINERVA. Two of these analyses use KELT-24's observed spectral energy distribution (SED) through a direct comparison to stellar evolutionary models, while our third analysis assumes an unknown additional body contributing to the observed broadband photometry and excludes the SED. Ultimately, we find that the models that include the SED are a poor fit to the available data, so we adopt the system parameters derived without it. We also highlight a single transit-like event observed by TESS, deemed likely to be an eclipsing binary bound to KELT-24, that will require follow-up observations to confirm. We discuss the potential of these additional bodies in the KELT-24 system as a possible explanation for the discrepancies between the results of the different modeling approaches, and explore the system for longer-period planets that may be weakly evident in the RV observations. The comprehensive investigations that we present not only increase the fidelity of our understanding of the KELT-24 system, but also serve as a blueprint for future stellar modeling in global analyses of exoplanet systems.

          From Super-Earths to Sub-Neptunes: observational constraints and connections to theoretical models

 - **Abstract**
 We update the PlanetS catalog of transiting planets with precise and robust mass and radius measurements and use this comprehensive catalog to explore Mass-Radius (M-R) diagrams. On one hand, we propose new M-R relationships to separate exoplanets into three populations. On the other hand, we explore the transition in radius and density between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes around M-dwarfs and compare it with those orbiting K- and FG-dwarfs. Using Kernel Density Estimation method with a re-sampling technique, we estimate the normalized density and radius distributions, revealing connections between observations and theories on composition, internal structure, formation, and evolution of these exoplanets orbiting different spectral types. Firstly, the substantial 30% increase in the number of well-characterized exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs compared with previous studies shows us that there is no clear gap in either composition or radius between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes. The "water-worlds" around M-dwarfs cannot correspond to a distinct population, their bulk density and equilibrium temperature can be interpreted by several different internal structures and compositions. The continuity in the fraction of volatiles in these planets suggests a formation scenario involving planetesimal or hybrid pebble-planetesimal accretion. Moreover, we find that the transition between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes appears to happen at different mass (and radii) depending on the spectral type of the star. The maximum mass of Super-Earths seems to be close to 10 M$_\oplus$ for all spectral types, but the minimum mass of Sub-Neptunes increases with the star's mass. This effect also contributes to the fading of the radius valley for M-planets compared to FGK-planets. While Sub-Neptunes are less common around M-dwarfs, smaller ones exhibit lower density than their equivalents around FGK-dwarfs.
