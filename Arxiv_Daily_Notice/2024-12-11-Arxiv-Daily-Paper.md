 - **Abstract**
 The 2023-2032 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey Origins, Worlds, and Life recommended that "NASA develop scientific exploration strategies, as it has for Mars, in areas of broad scientific importance, e.g., Venus... that have an increasing number of U.S. missions and international collaboration opportunities" (OWL, p.22-10). In NASA's initial responses to that Decadal Survey, the agency asserted that "...specific scientific exploration strategies should be community generated by bodies such as the Analysis Groups," thus placing the onus on the planetary community to generate and support these exploration strategies. In late 2022, the Venus Exploration Analysis Group began a project to develop a new exploration strategy for Venus, reflecting the 2021 selections of the VERITAS, DAVINCI, and EnVision missions and the sweeping comparative planetology recommendations relevant to Venus in Origins, Worlds, and Life. This is that strategy. Taking a broad look at the scientific, technological, and programmatic advances required to address the key outstanding questions that Venus poses, and predicated on VERITAS, DAVINCI, and EnVision flying as planned in the early 2030s, this report outlines a set of actions available to NASA, VEXAG, and the planetary science community at large to establish a sustained program of Venus exploration in the years and decades ahead. Key to this approach is recognizing Venus as a unique setting where multiple, cross-disciplinary, Decadal-level planetary, Earth, heliophysics, and exoplanet science questions can be addressed, as well as being a worthy target of exploration in its own right. This report offers Assessments of the current state of Venus exploration, and Actions for the U.S. and international Venus community, as well as NASA, to consider. This strategy is a living document and should be updated as warranted.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.

          Prospects of a statistical detection of the 21-cm forest and its potential to constrain the thermal state of the neutral IGM during reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest signal is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization complementary to other 21-cm line observables and Ly$\alpha$ forest signal. Prospects of detecting it have significantly improved in the last decade thanks to the discovery of more than 30 radio-loud quasars at these redshifts, upgrades to telescope facilities, and the notion that neutral hydrogen islands persist down to $z\lesssim 5.5$. We forward-model the 21-cm forest signal using semi-numerical simulations and incorporate various instrumental features to explore the potential of detecting the 21-cm forest at $z=6$, both directly and statistically, with the currently available (uGMRT) and forthcoming (SKA1-low) observatories. We show that it is possible to detect the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest spectrum, especially at large scales of $k\lesssim8.5\,\rm MHz^{-1}$ with the $500\,\rm hr$ of the uGMRT time and $k\lesssim32.4\,\rm MHz^{-1}$ with the SKA1-low over $50\,\rm hr$ if the intergalactic medium (IGM) is $25\%$ neutral and these neutral hydrogen regions have a spin temperature of $\lesssim30\,\rm K$. On the other hand, we infer that a null-detection of the signal with such observations of 10 radio-loud sources at $z\approx6$ can be translated into constraints on the thermal and ionization state of the IGM which are tighter than the currently available measurements. Moreover, a null-detection of the 1D 21-cm forest power spectrum with only $50\,\rm hr$ of the uGMRT observations of 10 radio-loud sources can already be competitive with the Ly$\alpha$ forest and 21-cm tomographic observations in disfavouring models of significantly neutral and cold IGM at $z=6$.

          Dark Astronomy with Dark Matter Detectors

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel way of probing non-gravitational dark matter interactions: dark astronomy, which leverages the dark radiation emitted by dissipative dark sectors. If the mediator of the dark matter self interactions is a dark photon with a small mass that kinetically mixes with the visible photon, the dark radiation flux becomes accessible to underground experiments. We argue that the emission may be dominantly longitudinally polarized, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of direct detection experiments such as XENON and SENSEI to this signal. We introduce a new detection mechanism based on resonant dark-photon-to-photon conversion at the surface of conducting materials, which offers unique directional sensitivity to dark radiation. This mechanism facilitates the development of experiments that combine dark matter detection techniques with methods of traditional astronomy, opening the possibility to map dark radiation sources within our galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-year observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project have significantly increased the number of quasars with reliable reverberation-mapping lag measurements. We statistically analyze target properties, light-curve characteristics, and survey design choices to identify factors crucial for successful and efficient RM surveys. Analyzing 172 high-confidence ("gold") lag measurements from SDSS-RM for the H$\beta$, MgII, and CIV emission lines, we find that the Durbin-Watson statistic (a statistical test for residual correlation) is the most significant predictor of light curves suitable for lag detection. Variability signal-to-noise ratio and emission-line placement on the detector also correlate with successful lag measurements. We further investigate the impact of observing cadence on survey design by analyzing the effect of reducing observations in the first year of SDSS-RM. Our results demonstrate that a modest reduction in observing cadence to $\sim$1.5 weeks between observations can retain approximately 90% of the lag measurements compared to twice-weekly observations in the initial year. Provided similar and uniform sampling in subsequent years, this adjustment has a minimal effect on the overall recovery of lags across all emission lines. These results provide valuable inputs for optimizing future RM surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of supermassive black holes at high redshift challenge our understanding of the evolution of the first generation of black holes (BHs) in proto-galactic environments. One possibility is that they grow much more rapidly than current estimates of feedback and accretion efficiency permit. Following our previous analysis of super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes in mini-haloes under no-feedback conditions, we now investigate whether this can be sustained when thermal feedback is included. We use four sets of cosmological simulations at sub-pc resolution with initial black hole masses varying from $1 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$, exploring a range of feedback efficiencies. We also vary the feedback injection radius to probe the threshold of numerical overcooling. We find that super-Eddington growth sustained on the order of $\sim$$100 \, \rm kyr$ is possible with very weak thermal feedback efficiency in all environments and moderate efficiency for the $6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$ BH. Trans-Eddington growth is possible for a $3 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ BH at moderate feedback efficiencies. We discuss the effectiveness of thermal feedback in heating the gas, suppressing accretion, and driving outflows at these parameter configurations. Our results suggest that super-Eddington growth may be possible in the presence of thermal feedback for black holes formed from the first stars.

          The ACCEL2 Project: Precision Measurements of EFT Parameters and BAO Peak Shifts for the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 We present precision measurements of the bias parameters of the one-loop power spectrum model of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest, derived within the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT). We fit our model to the three-dimensional flux power spectrum measured from the ACCEL2 hydrodynamic simulations. The EFT model fits the data with an accuracy of below 2 percent up to a wavenumber of k = 2 h/Mpc. Further, we analytically derive how non-linearities in the three-dimensional clustering of the Lya forest introduce biases in measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scaling parameters in radial and transverse directions. From our EFT parameter measurements, we obtain a theoretical error budget of -0.2 (-0.3) percent for the radial (transverse) parameters at redshift two. This corresponds to a shift of -0.3 (0.1) percent for the isotropic (anisotropic) distance measurements. We provide an estimate for the shift of the BAO peak for Lya-quasar cross-correlation measurements assuming analytical and simulation-based scaling relations for the non-linear quasar bias parameters resulting in a shift of -0.2 (-0.1) percent for the radial (transverse) dilation parameters, respectively. This analysis emphasizes the robustness of Lya forest BAO measurements to the theory modeling. We provide informative priors and an error budget for measuring the BAO feature -- a key science driver of the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our work paves the way for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from DESI and upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph, WEAVE-QSO, and 4MOST.

          Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum III: Precessing Quadrupole

 - **Abstract**
 The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a slightly aligned precessing quadrupole potential is investigated analytically and solved for both rotating and librating Kozai-Lidov cycles (KLCs) with high eccentricities. We describe the finding of a striking similarity between librating and rotating KLCs for some range of precession rates. We show that the main effect occurs in both categories when the KLC frequency is equal to the precession rate of the perturbing potential. We solve the resonant dynamics analytically and show that it is equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing us to map the strikingly rich structures that arise for precession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few) and explain the similarity and when it vanishes. Additionally, we show that the regular KLCs at high eccentricities can also be described using a simple pendulum.

          The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (VIII): A 5 Mpc stretch of the z $\approx$ 4 cosmic web revealed in emission

 - **Abstract**
 We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from a ~5 Mpc-long (comoving) portion of the cosmic web hosting an overdensity ($\delta \approx 25$) of 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx 4$ within the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), reaching an average surface brightness (SB) of $5\times 10^{-20}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. This large-scale structure has an average SB similar to the filament across the two MUDF quasars at $z\approx 3.22$. However, deep multiwavelength data do not show a clear presence of active galactic nuclei, suggesting that the emission is mainly regulated by the underlying gas density. We find $\approx 0.2$ dex higher star formation compared to control samples and a remarkable predominance (5/7) of blue-peaked emission lines in the spectra of the embedded LAEs, indicative of favorable conditions for gas accretion. Lastly, we quantify the contribution of intragalactic gas to the Ly$\alpha$ SB profile at large distances from LAEs. By studying samples of filaments detected in emission within diverse environments, we are finally gaining new insight into the physics of gas accretion within the cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is a satellite orbiting the Milky Way that has experienced multiple stripping events due to tidal interactions with our Galaxy. Its accretion history has led to a distinct stellar overdensity, which is the remnant of the core of the progenitor. We present a complete chemical analysis of 111 giant stars in the core of Sgr dSph to investigate the chemical evolution and enrichment history of this satellite. Employing the metallicity-sensitive Ca H&K photometry from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we selected stars spanning a wide metallicity range and obtained high-resolution spectra with the ESO FLAMES/GIRAFFE multi-object spectrograph. For the stellar sample covering $-2.13 < \rm{[Fe/H] < -0.35}$, we derived abundances for up to 14 chemical elements with average uncertainties of $\sim 0.09$ dex and a set of stellar ages which allowed us to build an age-metallicity relation (AMR) for the entire sample. With the most comprehensive set of chemical species measured for the core of Sgr, we studied several [X/Fe] ratios. Most trends align closely with Galactic chemical trends, but notable differences emerge in the heavy $n$-capture elements, which offer independent insights into the star formation history of a stellar population. The deficiency in the $\alpha$-elements with respect the Milky Way suggests a slower, less efficient early star formation history, similar to other massive satellites. $S$-process element patterns indicate significant enrichment from AGB stars over time. The AMR and chemical ratios point to an extended star formation history, with a rapid early phase in the first Gyr, followed by declining activity and later star-forming episodes. These findings are consistent with Sgr hosting multiple stellar populations, from young ($\sim 4$ Gyr) to old, metal-poor stars ($\sim 10$ Gyr)

 - **Abstract**
 Diffraction-limited radial velocity instruments offer a pathway towards improved precision and stability, and the exploration of new parameter spaces at high spatial and spectral resolution. However, achieving the necessary performance requires careful instrument design and considerable on-sky testing. We describe the design and construction of ``Little iLocater'' (Lili), a compact spectrograph that has been used to validate the performance of the front-end fibre-injection system of the iLocater spectrograph. We present the design, assembly, and performance using on-sky data obtained at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), including extraction of spectra from standard stars, testing of the atmospheric dispersion corrector to elevations of 40 degrees, and spatially resolved spectra from close companion systems. These results show the front-end fibre-injection system is performing as expected and is indicative of iLocater's capabilities once installed at the LBT.

 - **Abstract**
 We present algorithms and software for constructing high-precision difference images to detect and measure transients, such as microlensing events, in crowded stellar fields using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Our method generates difference images by subtracting an over-sampled reference, with iterative masking to address outlier pixels. We also provide an analytic correction for small dither offset errors. Microlensing event detection is achieved through a three-dimensional matched-filtering technique, optimized with Gaussian kernels to capture varying event durations, and verified through synthetic tests with high recovery rates. Transient photometry is performed via PSF fitting on difference images, using Nelder-Mead optimization for sub-pixel accuracy. The software, Dazzle, is available as an open-source Python package built on widely used libraries, offering accessible tools for the detection and characterization of transient phenomena in crowded fields.

          ESPRESSO observations of the debris-accreting white dwarf WD\,0141--675

 - **Abstract**
 WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.

          Impact of the shape of the prestellar density fluctuations on the core mass function

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial dark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model yields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the original, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in the context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of density perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass function (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal, instead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass and low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density fluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation (prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual hypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable. We find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity increases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking difference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the ellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense structures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low mass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star formation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by the ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one predicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward lower masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs that use adaptive optics (AO) show promise to advance telescope observing capabilities beyond those of seeing-limited designs. We are building a spectrograph for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) named iLocater that uses AO to inject starlight directly into single mode fibers (SMF). iLocater's first acquisition camera system (the `SX' camera), which receives light from one of the 8.4m diameter primary mirrors of the LBT, was initially installed in summer 2019 and has since been used for several commissioning runs. We present results from first-light observations that include on-sky measurements as part of commissioning activities. Imaging measurements of the bright B3IV star 2 Cygni ($V=4.98$) resulted in the direct detection of a candidate companion star at an angular separation of only $\theta = 70$ mas. Follow-up AO measurements using Keck/NIRC2 recover the candidate companion in multiple filters. An $R\approx1500$ miniature spectrograph recently installed at the LBT named ``Lili'' provides spatially resolved spectra of each binary component, indicating similar spectral types and strengthening the case for companionship. Studying the multiplicity of young runaway star systems like 2 Cygni ($36.6 \pm 0.5$ Myr) can help to understand formation mechanisms for stars that exhibit anomalous velocities through the galaxy. This on-sky demonstration illustrates the spatial resolution of the iLocater SX acquisition camera working in tandem with the LBT AO system; it further derisks a number of technical hurdles involved in combining AO with Doppler spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words detection of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.

          Various Modifications to Debye-H\"uckel Interactions in Solar Equations of State

 - **Abstract**
 The first order effect of Coulomb forces between the charged particles of a plasma is the well-known Debye-Hückel-term. It is a negative contribution to the pressure and energy of the gas, that at high densities will overwhelm the ideal gas contributions and make the gas implode into a black hole. Nature obviously constrains this term, avoiding this fate, but how? We investigate three different mechanisms and their effects on the equation of state and on solar models, and the physical justifications for each of them. We conclude that higher order Coulomb terms in combination with quantum diffraction of electrons, provide the needed convergence.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency solar radio emission is sourced in the solar corona, with sub-100 MHz radio emission largely originating from the $\sim$10$^{5}$\,$\mathrm{K}$ plasma around 2 optical radii. However, the region of emission has yet to be constrained at 35--45\,MHz due to both instrumentation limitations and the rarity of astronomical events, such as total solar eclipses, which allow for direct observational approaches. In this work, we present the results from a student-led project to commission a low-frequency radio telescope array situated in the path of totality of the 2024 total solar eclipse in an effort to probe the middle corona. The Deployable Low-Band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (DLITE) is a low-frequency radio array comprised of four dipole antennas, optimized to observe at 35--45\,MHz, and capable of resolving the brightest radio sources in the sky. We constructed a DLITE station in Observatory Park, a dark sky park in Montville, Ohio. Results of observations during the total solar eclipse demonstrate that DLITE stations can be quickly deployed for observations and provide constraints on the radius of solar emission at our center observing frequency of 42\,MHz. In this work, we outline the construction of DLITE Ohio and the solar observation results from the total solar eclipse that transversed North America in April 2024.

 The directional state transition tensor (DSTT) reduces the complexity of state transition tensor (STT) by aligning the STT terms in sensitive directions only, which provides comparable accuracy in orbital uncertainty propagation. The DSTT assumes the sensitive directions to be constant during the integration and only works at a predefined epoch. This paper proposes a time-varying STT (TDSTT) to improve the DSTT. The proposed TDSTT computes the sensitive directions with time; thereby, it can perform uncertainty propagation analysis at any point instead of only a predefined epoch as the DSTT does. First, the derivatives of the sensitive directions are derived. Then, the differential equations for the high-order TDSTTs are derived and simplified using the orthogonality of sensitive directions. Next, complexity analysis is implemented to show the advantages of the proposed TDSTT over the STT. Finally, the TDSTT is applied to solve orbital uncertainty propagation problems in highly nonlinear three-body systems. Numerical results show that the proposed TDSTT can yield nearly the same level of accuracy as the STT and DSTT. It is approximately 94% faster than the STT and has hundreds of improvements in speed over the DSTT when one wants to investigate the evolutions of orbital uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) power spectrum is expected to provide state-of-the-art cosmological constraints, with an associated need for precise error modeling. In this paper we design, and evaluate the performance of, an analytic covariance matrix prescription for the DR6 power spectrum that sufficiently accounts for the complicated ACT map properties. We use recent advances in the literature to handle sharp features in the signal and noise power spectra, and account for the effect of map-level anisotropies on the covariance matrix. In including inhomogeneous survey depth information, the resulting covariance matrix prescription is structurally similar to that used in the $\textit{Planck}$ Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) analysis. We quantify the performance of our prescription using comparisons to Monte Carlo simulations, finding better than $3\%$ agreement. This represents an improvement from a simpler, pre-existing prescription, which differs from simulations by $\sim16\%$. We develop a new method to correct the analytic covariance matrix using simulations, after which both prescriptions achieve better than $1\%$ agreement. This correction method outperforms a commonly used alternative, where the analytic correlation matrix is assumed to be accurate when correcting the covariance. Beyond its use for ACT, this framework should be applicable for future high resolution CMB experiments including the Simons Observatory (SO).

 - **Abstract**
 Using nearly 230,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and Gaia, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stellar age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) for various disk populations, within 5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The AVRs of the whole RC sample stars are accurately described as $\sigma_{v}$ = $\sigma_{v,0}$ ($\tau$ + 0.1)$^{\beta_{v}}$, with $\beta_{R}$, $\beta_{\phi}$ and $\beta_{Z}$ displaying a global exponential decreasing trend with $R$, which may point to the difference in spatial distributions of various disk heating mechanisms. The measurements of $\beta$ $-$ $R$ for various disks suggest that the thin disk exhibits a radial dependence, with a global exponential decreasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$, while $\beta_{\phi}$ remains a nearly constant value (around 0.20$\sim$0.25) within 8.5 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 11.5 kpc. The thick disk displays a global increasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$, $\beta_{\phi}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$. These results indicate that the thin disk stars are likely heated by long-term heating from GMCs and spiral arms, while thick disk stars are likely heated by some violent heating process from merger and accretion, and/or formed by the inside-out and upside-down star formation scenarios, and/or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent ISM. Our results also suggest that the disk perturbation by a recent minor merger from Sagittarius may have occurred within 3.0 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry of pulsars, particularly their distances, serves as a critical input for various astrophysical experiments using pulsars. Pulsar timing is a primary approach for determining a pulsar's position, parallax, and distance. In this paper, we explore the influence of the solar wind on astrometric measurements obtained through pulsar timing, focusing on its potential to affect the accuracy of these parameters. Using both theoretical calculation and mock-data simulations, we demonstrate a significant correlation between the pulsar position, annual parallax and the solar-wind density parameters. This correlation strongly depends on the pulsar's ecliptic latitude. We show that fixing solar-wind density to an arbitrary value in the timing analysis can introduce significant bias in the estimated pulsar position and parallax, and its significance is highly dependent on the ecliptic latitude of the pulsar and the timing precision of the data. For pulsars with favourable ecliptic latitude and timing precision, the astrometric and solar-wind parameters can be measured jointly with other timing parameters using single-frequency data. The parameter correlation can be mitigated by using multi-frequency data, which also significantly improves the measurement precision of these parameters; this is particularly important for pulsars at a medium or high ecliptic latitude. Additionally, for a selection of pulsars we reprocess their EPTA Data Release 2 data to include modelling of solar-wind effect in the timing analysis. This delivers significant measurements of both parallax and solar-wind density, the latter of which are consistent with those obtained at low-frequency band. In the future, combining pulsar timing data at gigahertz and lower frequencies will probably deliver the most robust and precise measurements of astrometry and solar wind properties in pulsar timing.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted a GPU accelerated reprocessing of $\sim 87\%$ of the archival data from the High Time Resolution Universe South Low Latitude (HTRU-S LowLat) pulsar survey by implementing a pulsar search pipeline that was previously used to reprocess the Parkes Multibeam pulsar survey (PMPS). We coherently searched the full 72-min observations of the survey with an acceleration search range up to $|50|\, \rm m\,s^{-2}$, which is most sensitive to binary pulsars experiencing nearly constant acceleration during 72 minutes of their orbital period. Here we report the discovery of 71 pulsars, including 6 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) of which five are in binary systems, and seven pulsars with very high dispersion measures (DM $>800 \, \rm pc \, cm^{-3}$). These pulsar discoveries largely arose by folding candidates to a much lower spectral signal-to-noise ratio than previous surveys, and exploiting the coherence of folding over the incoherent summing of the Fourier components to discover new pulsars as well as candidate classification techniques. We show that these pulsars could be fainter and on average more distant as compared to both the previously reported 100 HTRU-S LowLat pulsars and background pulsar population in the survey region. We have assessed the effectiveness of our search method and the overall pulsar yield of the survey. We show that through this reprocessing we have achieved the expected survey goals including the predicted number of pulsars in the survey region and discuss the major causes as to why these pulsars were missed in previous processings of the survey.

 - **Abstract**
 While the environment around Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) has long been believed to be close to homogeneous, the latest analysis of Chandra data has identified a substantial deceleration of the forward shock which poses a major challenges to this picture. arXiv:2310.14841 showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in term of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the non-thermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind-MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present one-dimensional setup of the model which does not account for the clumpy and multi-dimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum which can be used to further probe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of type Ia supernova progenitor channels.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides us with much information about the Universe, including the dark matter distribution at small scales. The information about lensed gravitational waves is encapsulated by an amplification factor, which is calculated by an integration of an oscillatory function. The Born approximation, which has been studied in terms of wave optics in gravitational lensing, may provide a means of overcoming the difficulty in evaluating the oscillating function and better understanding the connection between the amplification factor and the lens mass distribution. In this paper, we revisit the Born approximation for a single lens plane. We find that the distortion of gravitational waves induced by wave optics gravitational lensing is in general connected with the mass distribution of the lens object through a convolution integral, where the scale of the kernel is determined by the Fresnel scale. We then study the validivity and accuracy of the Born approximation specifically for the case of a point mass lens for which the exact analytical expression of the amplicfication factor is available. Using the dimensionless parameter $y$, which represents the normalized impact parameter, and the dimensionless parameter $w$, which denotes the normalized frequency, we show that the $n$-th term of the Born approximation scales as $y^{-2}w^{n-1}$. This indicates that, for the case of a point mass lens, the Born approximation is valid when $w$ is less than 1, with its accuracy scaling as $wy^{-2}$ in this regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the physics of planetary magma oceans has been the subject of growing efforts, in light of the increasing abundance of Solar system samples and extrasolar surveys. A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to interact tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To date, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans have been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the dynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we provide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition, allowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We apply the model in two settings: The tidal history of the early Earth-Moon system in the aftermath of the giant impact; and the tidal interplay between short-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the fluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early Lunar recession to ${\sim} 25$ Earth radii within $10^4{-} 10^5$ years, in contrast with earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their molten surfaces significantly change their spin-orbit dynamics, allowing them to evade spin-orbit resonances and accelerating their track towards tidal synchronization from a Gyr to Myr timescale. Moreover, we re-evaluate the energy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface thermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven tidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change substantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 346 is a young cluster with numerous hot OB stars. It is part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and has an average metallicity that is one-seventh of the Milky Way's. A detailed study of its stellar content provides a unique opportunity to understand the stellar and wind properties of massive stars in low-metallicity environments, and enables us to improve our understanding of star formation and stellar evolution. The fundamental stellar parameters defining a star's spectral appearance are its effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Unfortunately, these parameters cannot be obtained independently from only H and He spectral features as they are partially degenerate. With this work we aim to overcome this degeneracy by applying a newly developed Bayesian statistic technique that can fit these three parameters simultaneously. Multi-epoch optical spectra are used in combination with a Bayesian statistic technique to fit stellar properties based on a publicly available grid of synthetic spectra of stellar atmospheres. The use of all of the multi-epoch observations simultaneously allows the identification of binaries. The stellar parameters for 34 OB stars within the core of NGC 346 are derived and presented here. By the use of both $\mathrm{He}\textsc{i}$ and $\mathrm{He}\textsc{ii}$ lines, the partial degeneracy between the stellar parameters of effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity is overcome. A lower limit to the binary fraction of the sample of stars is found to be at least 46%. Based on comparisons with analysis conducted on an overlapping sample of stars within NGC 346, the Bayesian statistic technique approach is shown to be a viable method to measure stellar parameters for hot massive stars in low-metallicity environments even when only low-resolution spectra are available.}

 - **Abstract**
 SHAPE (Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth) is an experiment onboard the Chandrayaan-3 Mission, designed to study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the habitable planet Earth in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1.0 - 1.7 $\mu$m). The spectro-polarimeter is the only scientific payload (experimental in nature) on the Propulsion Module (PM) of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The instrument is a compact and lightweight spectro-polarimeter with an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) at its core. The AOTF operates in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 135 MHz with a power of 0.5 - 2.0 Watts. The two output beams (e-beam and o-beam) from the AOTF are focused onto two InGaAs detectors (pixelated, 1D linear array) with the help of focusing optics. The primary (aperture) optics, with a diameter of $\sim$2 mm, collects the NIR light for input to the AOTF, defining the field of view (FOV) of 2.6$^\circ$. The payload has a mass of 4.8 kg and operates at a power of 25 Watts. This manuscript highlights some of the ground-based results, including the post-launch initial performance of the payload while orbiting around the Moon to observe Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will "kick" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to "freezing" dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as "thawing" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional "thawing" quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of the stellar cluster surrounding Sagittarius A* can be assessed indirectly through the motion of the S-stars. Specifically, the current accuracy to which the prograde precession of the S2 star is measured allows to place significant constraints on the extended mass enclosed by its orbit. We suggest that high velocity destructive collisions (DCs) offer a natural mechanism for depleting the mass inside the S2 orbit, thus allowing to reconcile the measured precession and the existence of a dense stellar cluster. Such a solution is especially necessary when considering that stars are supplied to the inner part of the cluster by both dynamical relaxation and by stars being captured in tight orbits during tidal disruption of binaries. We use analytic arguments and results from simulations to demonstrate that in order to obtain a precession that is consistent with observations, collisional depletion is necessary if the capture rate is greater than a few $10^{-6} yr^{-1}$. We also show that fluctuations arising from the finite number of stars cannot serve as an alternative to DCs for generating consistency with the observed S2 precession. We conclude that astrometric observations of the S-stars provide a meaningful indication that the inner part of our galactic center is shaped by collisional depletion, supporting the hypothesis that DCs occur in galactic nuclei at an astrophysically significant rate.

 We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and sub-mm-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bi-reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 $\mu$m in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of $\gtrsim1$ au at $100$ au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and mm observations with the latter being closer to an exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8-$\mu$m observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The redshift drift of objects following the cosmological expansion is a unique model-independent probe of background cosmology, detectable by astrophysical facilities presently under construction. Previous forecasts for such measurements assume flat universes. We explore the impact of relaxing this assumption on the constraining power of the redshift drift, focusing on the two most promising routes for its measurement: the SKA at low redshifts, and the Golden Sample for the ELT's ANDES spectrograph at higher redshifts. We also discuss the cosmological sensitivity of possible differential redshift drift measurements, both on their own and, for the specific case of the Golden Sample, in combination with the standard method. Overall, we find that the sensitivity of the redshift drift to curvature is comparable to that of matter (especially at low redshifts) and higher than the sensitivity to the dark energy equation of state. We also show that the sensitivity of redshift drift measurements to these cosmological parameters is asymmetric with respect to the curvature parameter, being different for open and closed universes with the same absolute value of the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$.

 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) of Sun and stars are challenging for stellar flare models. The white light stellar QPPs in the periodicity region of tens of second are unexplored yet. On the basis of observations with the 6-m telescope BTA in U-band of flaring dM-stars EV Lac, Wolf 359, Wolf 424, V577 Mon and UV Ceti we found 13 new QPPs. This composes 30% occurrence among 44 worked flares. These QPPs were found to have periods ranging from 6 to 107 seconds and were detected using both Fourier transform and empirical mode decomposition methods. The observed QPPs were categorized by the evolution of their oscillation envelope and fractional flux amplitudes. There are shown the statistically significant correlations of the QPP period with the duration, the equivalent duration and the amplitude of a flare, and the correlation between the QPP amplitude and flare amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particles (SEPs) can pose hazardous radiation risks to both humans in space and spacecraft electronics. Numerical modeling based on first principles offers valuable insights into SEPs, providing synthetic observables for SEPs at any time and location in space. In this work, we present a high-resolution scheme based on integral relations for Poisson brackets to solve the kinetic equation for particle acceleration and transport processes. We implement this scheme within the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), developed at the University of Michigan, to conduct a comprehensive study of solar energetic protons during the 2013 April 11 SEP event. In addition, a shock capturing tool is developed to study the coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock starting from the low solar corona. Multi-point spacecraft observations, including SOHO/ERNE, SDO/AIA, GOES and ACE at Earth, and STEREO-A/B, are used for model-data comparison and validation. New synthetic observables such as white-light images, shock geometry and properties, as well as SEP intensity-time profiles and spectra provide insights for SEP studies. The influences of the mean free path on SEP intensity-time profiles and spectra are also discussed. The results demonstrate: (1) the successful implementation of the Poisson bracket scheme with a self-consistent particle tracker within the SWMF, (2) the capability of capturing the time-evolving shock surface in the SWMF, and (3) the complexity of the mean free path impacts on SEPs. Overall, this study contributes to both scientific research and operational objectives by advancing our understanding of particle behaviors and showing the readiness for more accurate SEP predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Volume density is a key physical quantity controlling the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation, but it cannot be accessed directly by observations of molecular clouds. We aim at estimating the volume density distribution in nearby molecular clouds, to measure the relation between column and volume densities and to determine their roles as predictors of star formation. We develop an inverse modelling method to estimate the volume density distributions of molecular clouds. We apply this method to 24 nearby molecular clouds for which column densities have been derived using Herschel observations and for which star formation efficiencies (SFE) have been derived using observations with the Spitzer space telescope. We then compare the relationships of several column- and volume-density based descriptors of dense gas with the SFE of the clouds. We derive volume density distributions for 24 nearby molecular clouds, which represents the most complete sample of such distributions to date. The relationship between column densities and peak volume densities in these clouds is a piece-wise power-law relation that changes its slope at a column density of $5-10\times 10^{22}$ H$_2$cm$^{-2}$. We interpret this as a signature of hierarchical fragmentation in the dense ISM. We find that the volume-density based dense gas fraction is the best predictor of star formation in the clouds, and in particular, it is as anticipated a better predictor than the column-density based dense gas fraction. We also derive a volume density threshold density for star formation of $2\times 10^4$ H$_2$cm$^{-3}$.

 Small bodies are capable of delivering essential prerequisites for the development of life, such as volatiles and organics, to the terrestrial planets. For example, empirical evidence suggests that water was delivered to the Earth by hydrated planetesimals from distant regions of the Solar System. Recently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects (NEOs) were reported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven outgassing. However, these "dark comets" display no evidence of comae in archival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. Here we report detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects previously classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be explainable by asymmetric mass loss. A detailed search of archival survey and targeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in individual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of $\sim10$, $0.1$, and $0.1$ kg s$^{-1}$ for 1998 FR$_{11}$, 2001 ME$_{1}$, and 2003 RM with these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during the observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two distinct populations: larger, "outer" dark comets on eccentric orbits that are end members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, "inner" dark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a new population. These objects may trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected, but potentially numerous, volatile-rich population that may have provided essential material to the Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) searches using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are commonly assumed to be limited to a GW frequency of $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$Hz given by the Nyquist rate associated with the average observational cadence of $2$ weeks for a single pulsar. However, by taking advantage of asynchronous observations of multiple pulsars, a PTA can detect GW signals at higher frequencies. This allows a sufficiently large PTA to detect and characterize the ringdown signals emitted following the merger of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), leading to stringent tests of the no-hair theorem in the mass range of such systems. Such large-scale PTAs are imminent with the advent of the FAST telescope and the upcoming era of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). To scope out the data analysis challenges involved in such a search, we propose a likelihood-based method coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization and apply it to a simulated large-scale PTA comprised of $100$ pulsars, each having a timing residual noise standard deviation of $100$~nsec, with randomized observation times. Focusing on the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of the ringdown signal, we show that it is possible to achieve a $99\%$ detection probability with a false alarm probability below $0.2\%$ for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $>10$. This corresponds, for example, to an equal-mass non-spinning SMBBH with an observer frame chirp mass $M_c = 9.52\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at a luminosity distance of $D_L = 420$ Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this paper, by using 93 time delay GRBs covering the redshift range of $0.117 < z < 6.29$, we present a new idea of using cosmological model-independent (based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs) to test the LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{QG,1} \ge 1.40\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{QG,2} \ge 8.18\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.

 Context. We analyse multi-colour photometric and spectroscopic observations of a Young Stellar Object Gaia20bdk. Aims. We aim to investigate the exact nature of the eruptive phenomenon that the star has been experiencing since 2018. Methods. We use public-domain archival photometry to characterise the quiescent phase in order to establish major physical parameters of the progenitor. Then, we use our and public-domain optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy to study the outburst. Results. Gaia20bdk is a member of the Sharpless 2-301 star-forming region, at a distance of 3.3 kpc. The progenitor is a rather massive 2.7 solar mass, G7-type Class I young star having an effective temperature of 5300 K and bolometric luminosity of 11 solar luminosities. The optical and infrared photometric and spectroscopic data obtained during the outburst show a variety of signatures commonly found in classical FUors. Our disc modelling results in a bolometric luminosity of 100-200 solar luminosities and mass accretion rate of 1-2e-5 solar masses per year, also confirming the object's FUor classification. Further monitoring is necessary to track the light changes, accretion rate and spectral variations, as well as to understood the mechanisms behind the disc flickering.

 - **Abstract**
 In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.

          Runaway O and Be stars found using Gaia DR3, new stellar bow shocks and search for binaries

 - **Abstract**
 A relevant fraction of massive stars are runaways, moving with a significant peculiar velocity with respect to their environment. Kicks from supernova explosions or the dynamical ejection of stars from clusters can account for the runaway genesis. We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution of massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway stars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC and 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these catalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25% for O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher velocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the dynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion scenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We have used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the runaway stars. We have also conducted VLA radio observations of some of these bow shocks. Finally, our runaway stars include six X-ray binaries and one gamma-ray binary, implying that new such systems could be found by conducting detailed multi-wavelength studies. In this work we report on this ongoing project to find new runaway stars, study their interaction with the ISM and search for high-energy binary systems.
