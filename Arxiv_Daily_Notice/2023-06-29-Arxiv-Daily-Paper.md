 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream (MS) - an enormous ribbon of gas spanning $140^\circ$ of the southern sky trailing the Magellanic Clouds - has been exquisitely mapped in the five decades since its discovery. However, despite concerted efforts, no stellar counterpart to the MS has been conclusively identified. This stellar stream would reveal the distance and 6D kinematics of the MS, constraining its formation and the past orbital history of the Clouds. We have been conducting a spectroscopic survey of the most distant and luminous red giant stars in the Galactic outskirts. From this dataset, we have discovered a prominent population of 13 stars matching the extreme angular momentum of the Clouds, spanning up to $100^\circ$ along the MS at distances of $60-120$ kpc. Furthermore, these kinemetically-selected stars lie along a [$\alpha$/Fe]-deficient track in chemical space from $-2.5 < \mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -0.5$, consistent with their formation in the Clouds themselves. We identify these stars as high-confidence members of the Magellanic Stellar Stream. Half of these stars are metal-rich and closely follow the gaseous MS, whereas the other half are more scattered and metal-poor. We argue that the metal-rich stream is the recently-formed tidal counterpart to the MS, and speculate that the metal-poor population was thrown out of the SMC outskirts during an earlier interaction between the Clouds. The Magellanic Stellar Stream provides a strong set of constraints - distances, 6D kinematics, and birth locations - that will guide future simulations towards unveiling the detailed history of the Clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 When main-sequence stars expand into red giants, they are expected to engulf close-in planets. Until now, the absence of planets with short orbital periods around post-expansion, core-helium-burning red giants has been interpreted as evidence that short-period planets around Sun-like stars do not survive the giant expansion phase of their host stars. Here we present the discovery that the giant planet 8 Ursae Minoris b orbits a core-helium-burning red giant. At a distance of only 0.5 au from its host star, the planet would have been engulfed by its host star, which is predicted by standard single-star evolution to have previously expanded to a radius of 0.7 au. Given the brief lifetime of helium-burning giants, the nearly circular orbit of the planet is challenging to reconcile with scenarios in which the planet survives by having a distant orbit initially. Instead, the planet may have avoided engulfment through a stellar merger that either altered the evolution of the host star or produced 8 Ursae Minoris b as a second-generation planet. This system shows that core-helium-burning red giants can harbour close planets and provides evidence for the role of non-canonical stellar evolution in the extended survival of late-stage exoplanetary systems.
#### Cosmic-ray-driven enhancement of the C$^0$/CO abundance ratio in W51C

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15983
 - **Abstract**
 We examine spatial variations of the C$^0$/CO abundance ratio ($X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$) in the vicinity of the $\gamma$-ray supernova remnant W51C, based on [CI] ($^3P_1$-$^3P_0$), $^{12}$CO(1-0), and $^{13}$CO(1-0) observations with the ASTE and Nobeyama 45-m telescopes. We find that $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ varies in a range of 0.02-0.16 (0.05 in median) inside the molecular clouds of $A_V>$100 mag, where photodissociation of CO by the interstellar UV is negligible. Furthermore, $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ is locally enhanced up to by a factor of four near the W51C center, depending on the projected distance from the W51C center. In high-$A_V$ molecular clouds, $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ is determined by the ratio of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate to the H$_2$ density, and we find no clear spatial variation of the H$_2$ density against the projected distance. Hence, the high CR ionization rate may locally enhance $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ near the W51C center. We also find that the observed spatial extent of the enhanced $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ ($\sim$17 pc) is consistent with the diffusion distance of CRs with the energy of 100 MeV. The fact suggests that the low-energy CRs accelerated in W51C enhance $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$. The CR ionization rate at the $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$-enhanced cloud is estimated to be 3$\times$10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ on the basis of time-dependent PDR simulations of $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$, the value of which is 30 times higher than that in the standard Galactic environment. These results demonstrate that [CI] is a powerful probe to investigate the interaction between CRs and the interstellar medium for a wide area in the vicinity of supernova remnants.
#### Extreme data compression for Bayesian model comparison
 - **Authors:** Alan F. Heavens, Arrykrishna Mootoovaloo, Roberto Trotta, Elena Sellentin

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15998
 - **Abstract**
 We develop extreme data compression for use in Bayesian model comparison via the MOPED algorithm, as well as more general score compression. We find that Bayes factors from data compressed with the MOPED algorithm are identical to those from their uncompressed datasets when the models are linear and the errors Gaussian. In other nonlinear cases, whether nested or not, we find negligible differences in the Bayes factors, and show this explicitly for the Pantheon-SH0ES supernova dataset. We also investigate the sampling properties of the Bayesian Evidence as a frequentist statistic, and find that extreme data compression reduces the sampling variance of the Evidence, but has no impact on the sampling distribution of Bayes factors. Since model comparison can be a very computationally-intensive task, MOPED extreme data compression may present significant advantages in computational time.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are among the most powerful explosions in the universe, emitting thermal neutrinos that carry away the majority of the gravitational binding energy released. These neutrinos create a diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), one of the largest energy budgets among all radiation backgrounds. Detecting the DSNB is a crucial goal of modern high-energy astrophysics and particle physics, providing valuable insights in both core-collapse modeling, neutrino physics, and cosmic supernova rate history. In this review, we discuss the key ingredients of DSNB calculation and what we can learn from future detections, including black-hole formation and non-standard neutrino interactions. Additionally, we provide an overview of the latest updates in neutrino experiments, which could lead to the detection of the DSNB in the next decade. With the promise of this breakthrough discovery on the horizon, the study of DSNB holds enormous potential for advancing our understanding of the Universe.
#### Setting an upper limit for the total TeV neutrino flux from the disk of  our Galaxy
 - **Authors:** Vittoria Vecchiotti, Francesco L. Villante, Giulia Pagliaroli
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16305
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16305
 - **Abstract**
 We set an upper limit for the total TeV neutrino flux expected from the disk of our Galaxy in the region $|l|<30^{\circ}$ and $|b|<2^{\circ}$ probed by the ANTARES experiment. We include both the diffuse emission, due to the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, and the possible contribution produced by gamma-ray Galactic sources. The neutrino diffuse emission is calculated under different assumptions for the cosmic ray spatial and energy distribution in our Galaxy. In particular, we assume that the total gamma-ray flux produced by all the sources, resolved and unresolved by H.E.S.S., is produced via hadronic interaction and, hence, is coupled with neutrino emission. We compare our total neutrino flux with the recent ANTARES measurement of the neutrino from the Galactic Ridge. We show that the ANTARES best-fit flux requires the existence of a large source component, close to or even larger than the most optimistic predictions obtained with our approach.
#### Constraining MeV-scale axion-like particles with Fermi-LAT observations  of SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi-LAT observations of SN 2023ixf, a Type II supernova in the nearby Pinwheel Galaxy, Messier 101 (M101), presents us with an excellent opportunity to constrain MeV-scale Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). By examining the photon decay signature from heavy ALPs that could be produced in the explosion, we improve the existing constraints on the ALP-photon coupling by up to a factor of $ \sim 2 $ for masses $ m_a \lesssim 3 $ MeV, with the exact value depending mostly on plasma properties of the collapsing core. This study demonstrates the relevance of core-collapse supernovae, also beyond the Magellanic Clouds, as probes of fundamental physics.
