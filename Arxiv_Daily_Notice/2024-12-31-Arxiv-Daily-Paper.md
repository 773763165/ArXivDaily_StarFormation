          MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder

 - **Abstract**
 MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.

          Secular Perturbations from Exterior Giants Strongly Influence Gap Complexity in Peas-in-a-Pod Exoplanetary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 It has been demonstrated that systems of tightly packed inner planets with giant exterior companions tend to have less regular orbital spacings than those without such companions. We investigate whether this observed increase in the gap complexity of the inner systems can be explained solely as the result of secular dynamics caused by the disturbing potential of the exterior companions. Amplification of mutual orbital inclinations in the inner system due to such secular dynamics may lead to the inner system attaining non-mutually transiting geometries, thereby creating artificial observed gaps that result in a higher calculated gap complexity. Using second-order secular theory, we compute time-averaged observed gap complexities along a favorable line of sight for a set of hypothetical systems, both with and without an outer giant. We find that these secular interactions can significantly contribute to the observed gap complexity dichotomy in tightly packed multiple-planet systems.

          Exceptional X-ray activity in BL Lacertae

 - **Abstract**
 BL Lacertae is a unique blazar for which the X-ray band can cover either the synchrotron or the inverse Compton, or both parts of the broadband spectral energy distribution. In the latter case, when the spectral upturn is located in the X-ray range, it allows contemporaneous study of the low- and high-energy ends of the electron distribution function. In this work, we study spectral and temporal variability using X-ray and optical observations of the blazar performed with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2020 to 2023. The large set of observational data reveals intensive flaring activity, accompanied by spectral changes in both spectral branches. We conclude that the low-energy and high-energy ends of the particle distribution function are characterised by similar variability scales. Additionally, the hard X-ray observations of BL Lacertae performed with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) confirm a concave spectral curvature for some epochs of the blazar activity and reveal that it can be shifted up to energies of as high as 8 keV. The time-resolved spectral analysis allows us to disentangle X-ray spectral variability features of the synchrotron from inverse Compton components. Despite significant variability of both spectral components, we find only small changes in the position of the spectral upturn. The different slopes and shapes of the X-ray spectrum of BL Lacertae demonstrate that the classification of this source is not constant, and BL Lacertae can exhibit features of either high-, intermediate-, or low-energy peaked blazar in different epochs of observation. This also indicates that the spectral upturn for this blazar can be located not only in the X-ray range of 0.3-10 keV, but also at lower or higher energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ an efficient method for identifying gamma-ray sources across the entire sky, leveraging advanced algorithms from Fermi p y, and cleverly utilizing the Galactic diffuse background emission model to partition the entire sky into 72 regions,thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of discovering new sources throughout the sky through multi-threaded parallel computing. After confirming the reliability of the new method, we applied it for the first time to analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope encompassing approximately 15.41yr of all sky surveys. Through this analysis, we successfully identified 1379 new sources with levels exceeding 4sigma, of which 497 sources exhibited higher significance levels exceeding 5sigma. Subsequently, we performed a systematic analysis of the spatial extension, spectra, and light variation characteristics of these newly identified sources. We identified 21 extended sources and 23 sources exhibiting spectral curvature above 10GeV. Additionally, we identified 44 variable sources above 1GeV.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is a fundamental component of the Milky Way. Studying its chemical composition and the level of its chemical diversity gives us insight into the evolution of the Milky Way and the role of gas in the Galactic environment. In this paper, we use a novel simulation technique to model the distribution of total hydrogen between gas components, and therefore derive new constraints on the dust depletion and metallicity. We study individual gas components along the lines of sight towards eight bright O/B stars within 1.1 kpc of the Sun using high-resolution HST/STIS absorption spectra (R sim 114 000). We measure the level of dust depletion for these individual components and find components with higher levels of dust depletion compared to Milky Way sightlines in the literature. We find large ranges in the level of dust depletion among components along lines of sight, up to 1.19 dex. Although it is not possible to directly measure the metallicity of individual components due to the saturated and damped Ly-alpha line, we investigate possible metallicity ranges for individual gas components by exploring many different distributions of the total hydrogen gas between components. We select possible combinations of these gas fractions which produce the minimum metallicity difference between components, and for these cases we determine individual metallicities to accuracies that range between sim 0.1 to 0.4 dex. This work shows that full line-of-sight analyses wash out the level of diversity along lines of sight, and that component-by-component studies give a more in-depth understanding of the chemical intricacies of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are essential tools for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), but their analysis faces significant computational challenges. Traditional methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces where noise parameters often dominate, while existing deep learning approaches fail to model the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation or are validated only on synthetic datasets. We propose a flow-matching-based continuous normalizing flow (CNF) for efficient and accurate PTA parameter estimation. By focusing on the 10 most contributive pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, our method achieves posteriors consistent with MCMC, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence below \(10^{-2}\) nat, while reducing sampling time from 50 hours to 4 minutes. Powered by a versatile embedding network and a reweighting loss function, our approach prioritizes the SGWB parameters and scales effectively for future datasets. It enables precise reconstruction of SGWB and opens new avenues for exploring vast observational data and uncovering potential new physics, offering a transformative tool for advancing gravitational wave astronomy.

          Open cluster dissolution rate and the initial cluster mass function in the solar neighbourhood. Modelling the age and mass distributions of clusters observed by Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The dissolution rate of open clusters (OCs) and integration of their stars into the Milky Way's field population has been previously explored using their age distribution. With the advent of the Gaia mission, we have an exceptional opportunity to revisit and enhance these studies with ages and masses from high quality data. Aims. To build a comprehensive Gaia-based OC mass catalogue which, combined with the age distribution, allows a deeper investigation of the disruption experienced by OCs within the solar neighbourhood. Methods. Masses were determined by comparing luminosity distributions to theoretical luminosity functions. The limiting and core radii of the clusters were obtained by fitting the King function to their observed density profiles. We examined the disruption process through simulations of the build-up and mass evolution of a population of OCs which were compared to the observed mass and age distributions. Results. Our analysis yielded an OC mass distribution with a peak at $log(M)$ = 2.7 dex ($\sim 500 M_{\odot}$), as well as radii for 1724 OCs. Our simulations showed that using a power-law Initial Cluster Mass Function (ICMF) no parameters were able to reproduce the observed mass distribution. Moreover, we find that a skew log-normal ICMF provides a good match to the observations and that the disruption time of a $10^4 M{_\odot}$ OC is $t_4^{tot} = 2.9 \pm 0.4$ Gyr. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the OC disruption time $t_4^{tot}$ is about twice longer than previous estimates based solely on OC age distributions. We find that the shape of the ICMF for bound OCs differs from that of embedded clusters, which could imply a low typical star formation efficiency of $\leq 20\%$ in OCs. Our results also suggest a lower limit of $\sim 60 M{_\odot}$ for bound OCs in the solar neighbourhood.

          Primordial Power Spectrum of Five Dimensional Uniform Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 Five dimensional (5D) uniform inflation describes a de Sitter (or approximate) solution of 5D Einstein equations, with cosmological constant and a 5D Planck scale $M_* \sim 10^9$ GeV. During the inflationary period all dimensions (compact and non-compact) expand exponentially in terms of the 5D proper time. This set-up requires about 40 $e$-folds to expand the fifth dimension from the fundamental length to the micron size. At the end of 5D inflation (or at any given moment during the inflationary phase) one can interpret the solution in terms of 4D fields using 4D Planck units from the relation $M_p^2 = 2 \pi R M_*^3$, which amounts going to the 4D Einstein frame. This implies that if the compactification radius $R$ expands $N$ $e$-folds, then the 3D space would expand $3N/2$ $e$-folds as a result of a uniform 5D inflation. We reexamine the primordial power spectrum predicted by this model and show that it is consistent with Planck's measurements of the comic microwave background. The best-fit to Planck data corresponds to $R \sim 10~\mu$m. A departure of the angular power spectrum predicted by 4D cosmology is visible at multipole moment $\ell \sim 7$.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter is believed to account for a significant portion of the mass in the universe, exerting a critical influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This research delves into the processes of annihilation and decay of dark matter particles, which generate observable signals that deepen our comprehension of their characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, the study explores the potential role of primordial black holes, with a focus on the emissions of Hawking radiation that could offer valuable insights into their distribution and size range. A key aspect of this investigation revolves around the 21 cm signal, a vital tool for scrutinizing the effects of dark matter particles and primordial black hole phenomena on the intergalactic medium. The upcoming Hongmeng mission, featuring a lunar orbital interferometer array, is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe the 21 cm signal. By conducting measurements devoid of atmospheric disturbances, the mission will significantly boost sensitivity to subtle signals associated with dark matter particle annihilation, decay, and primordial black hole emissions. This study assesses the expected performance of the Hongmeng mission in detecting these telltale signs and aims to unveil fresh insights into the nature and interactions of dark matter particles and primordial black hole emissions through a meticulous analysis of the global 21 cm spectrum. The mission holds immense promise for reshaping our understanding of the universe's concealed components.

          Gravitational Waves from Post-Collision of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons

 - **Abstract**
 According to the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. The SP system can also determine the evolution of FDM solitons, such as head-on collision. In this paper, we first propose a new adimensional unit of length, time and mass. And then, we simulate the adimensional SP system with $\mathtt{PyUltraLight}$ to study the GWs from post-collision of FDM solitons when the linearized theory is valid and the GW back reaction on the evolution of FDM solitons is ignored. Finally, we find that the GWs from post-collisions have a frequency of (few ten-years)$^{-1}$ or (few years)$^{-1}$ when FDM mass is $m=10^{-18}\rm{eV}/c^2$ or $m=10^{-17}\rm{eV}/c^2$. Therefore, future detection of such GWs will constrain the property of FDM particle and solitons.

          Signatures of Core-Envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-Mode Asteroseismology of Kepler-56

 - **Abstract**
 Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto unexamined rotational configurations, under the ``shellular approximation'' of constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56 -- a red giant with a misaligned planetary system -- I find that its core and envelope rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets (consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed asteroseismic modelling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully elucidate the full spin-orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.

          The possible long-term periodic variability of the extremely luminous quasar WISE J090924.01+000211.1

 - **Abstract**
 The extremely luminous infrared galaxy (ELIRG), WISE J090924.01+000211.1 (hereafter; WISE J0909+0002, $z=1.87$) is an extraordinary object with a quasar aspect. This study performs monitoring observations of WISE J0909+0002 with the 105 cm Murikabushi telescope, Okayama and Akeno 50 cm telescopes/MITSuME ($g'$, $R_{\rm c}$, and $I_{\rm c}$ bands), and the SaCRA 55 cm telescope/MuSaSHI ($r$, $i$, and $z$ bands). We obtain the following results by combining the UV/optical light curves of the CRTS, Pan-STARRS, and ZTF archive data, and our observational data: (1) the light curves of WISE J0909+0002 present quasi-periodic (sinusoidal) oscillations with the rest-frame period of $\sim$ 660$-$689 day; (2) the structure functions of WISE J0909+0002 do not show a damped random walk (DRW) trend; (3) the mock DRW light curves present periodic-like trend on rare occasions in 10000 simulations; (4) the relativistic boost scenario is favored, since the relation between variability amplitude and power-law slope ratio is consistent with the theoretical prediction of this scenario, and a substantial parameter space exists between the inclination angles and the black hole mass; (5) the circumbinary disk model is difficult to explain the spectral energy distribution of our target; (6) the significant radio flux density of WISE J0909+0002 is not detected from the VLA FIRST Survey, thus the radio jet precession scenario is ruled out. From our results, the Doppler boost scenario is likely as a cause of the periodic variability, consequently the quasi-periodic oscillations in WISE J0909+0002 is possibly interpreted by a supermassive blackhole binary. Additional observations to investigate the continuity of the periodic trend would bring new insights into mechanisms of the quasi-periodic oscillations and/or ELIRGs.

          Solar Gamma-Ray Evidence for a Distinct Population of $>$ 1 MeV Flare-Accelerated Electrons

 - **Abstract**
 Significant improvements in our understanding of nuclear $\gamma$-ray line production and instrument performance allow us to better characterize the continuum emission from electrons at energies $\gtrsim$ 300 keV during solar flares. We represent this emission by the sum of a power-law extension of hard X-rays (PL) and a power law times an exponential function (PLexp). We fit the $\gamma$-ray spectra in 25 large flares observed by SMM, RHESSI, and Fermi with this summed continuum along with calculated spectra of all known nuclear components. The PL, PLexp, and nuclear components are separated spectroscopically. A distinct origin of the PLexp is suggested by significant differences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear components. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare, reveals that the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints while the PLexp component comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL component are strongly dependent on the flares' heliocentric angle, the PLexp parameters show no such dependency and are consistent with a component that is isotropic. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few MeV. Such a shape can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of soft X-rays by 10--20 MeV electrons and by thin-target bremsstrahlung from electrons with a spectrum that peaks between 3 -- 5 MeV, or by a combination of the two processes. These electrons can produce radiation detectable at other wavelengths.

          Primordial Black Hole Formation from the Upward Step Model: Avoiding Overproduction

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an upward step inflationary model, where nonlinearities between curvature perturbations and field fluctuations introduce a cutoff, deviating from the Gaussian case. This necessitates a reevaluation of PBH formation, as $\mathcal{R}$ is not the optimal variable for estimating abundance. Using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, we show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature perturbation profile $\mathcal{R}(r)$ and the integration path in probability space, significantly impacting PBH abundance. Our results reveal that the abundance initially increases with the parameter $h$, which characterizes the relaxation stage after the step. However, beyond a critical value ($h \simeq 5.9$), it sharply declines before rising again. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianity introduces uncertainties in indirect PBH observations via gravitational waves. Notably, we present an example where a positive $f_{\rm NL}$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional expectations. Finally, by accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve the overproduction of PBHs suggested by pulsar timing array (PTA) data, underscoring the critical importance of incorporating non-Gaussianity in future studies.
