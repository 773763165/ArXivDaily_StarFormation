 - **Abstract**
 The clarity of nights is the major factor that should be carefully considered for optical/infrared astronomical observatories in site-testing campaigns. Cloud coverage is directly related to the amount of time available for scientific observations at observatories. In this article, we report on the results of detailed night-time cloud statistics and continuous observing me derived from ground-based all-sky cameras at the Muztagh-ata site from 2017 to 2021. Results obtained from acquisition data show that the proportion of the annual observing me at the Muztagh-ata site is 65%, and the best period with the least cloud coverage and longer continuous observing time is from September to February. We made a comparison of the monthly mean observing nights obtained from our all-sky cameras and CLARA dataset, results show that the discrepancy between them may depend on the cloud top heights. On average, this site can provide 175 clear nights and 169 nights with at least 4 hours of continuous observing time per year.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of dynamically cold stellar streams reveals information about the gravitational potential where they reside and provides important constraints on dark matter properties. However, their intrinsic faintness makes detection beyond Local environments highly challenging. Here we report the detection of an extremely faint stellar stream (mu_g,max = 29.5 mag arcsec-2) with an extraordinarily coherent and thin morphology in the Coma Galaxy Cluster. This Giant Coma Stream spans 510 kpc in length and appears as a free-floating structure located at a projected distance of 0.8 Mpc from the center of Coma. We do not identify any potential galaxy remnant or core, and the stream structure appears featureless in our data. We interpret the Giant Coma Stream as being a recently accreted, tidally disrupting dwarf of M* ~ 10^8 Msun, and report a case with similar characteristics within the Illustris-TNG50 simulation. Our work shows the presence of free-floating, extremely faint and thin stellar streams in galaxy clusters, widening the environmental context for their promising future applications in the study of dark matter properties.

 - **Abstract**
 With its cored surface brightness profile, the elliptical galaxy NGC 5419 appears as a typical high-mass early-type galaxy (ETG). However, the galaxy hosts two distinct nuclei in its center. We use high-signal MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) spectral observations and novel triaxial dynamical orbit models to reveal a surprisingly isotropic central orbit distribution in NGC 5419. Recent collisionless simulations of merging massive ETGs suggest a two-phase core formation model, in which the low-density stellar core forms rapidly by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) sinking into the center due to dynamical friction. Only afterwards the SMBHs form a hard binary and the black hole scouring process slowly changes the central orbit distribution from isotropic to tangential. The observed cored density profile, the double nucleus and the isotropic center of NGC 5419 together thus point to an intermediate evolutionary state where the first phase of the core formation has taken place, yet the scouring process is only beginning. This implies that the double nucleus is a SMBH binary. Our triaxial dynamical models indicate a total mass of the two SMBHs in the center of NGC 5419 of MBH = (1.0 +/- 0.08) 10^10 Msol. Moreover, we find that NGC 5419's complex kinematically distinct core (KDC) can be explained by a coherent flip of the orbital rotation direction of stars on tube orbits at ~3kpc distance from the galaxy center together with projection effects. This is also in agreement with merger simulations hosting SMBHs in the same mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the statistical properties and the origin of the scatter within the spatially resolved surface brightness profiles of the CHEX-MATE sample, formed by 118 galaxy clusters selected via the SZ effect. These objects have been drawn from the Planck SZ catalogue and cover a wide range of masses, M$_{500}=[2-15] \times 10^{14} $M$_{\odot}$, and redshift, z=[0.05,0.6]. We derived the surface brightness and emission measure profiles and determined the statistical properties of the full sample. We found that there is a critical scale, R$\sim 0.4 R_{500}$, within which morphologically relaxed and disturbed object profiles diverge. The median of each sub-sample differs by a factor of $\sim 10$ at $0.05\,R_{500}$. There are no significant differences between mass- and redshift-selected sub-samples once proper scaling is applied. We compare CHEX-MATE with a sample of 115 clusters drawn from the The Three Hundred suite of cosmological simulations. We found that simulated emission measure profiles are systematically steeper than those of observations. For the first time, the simulations were used to break down the components causing the scatter between the profiles. We investigated the behaviour of the scatter due to object-by-object variation. We found that the high scatter, approximately 110%, at $R<0.4R_{500}$ is due to a genuine difference between the distribution of the gas in the core. The intermediate scale, $R_{500} =[0.4-0.8]$, is characterised by the minimum value of the scatter on the order of 0.56, indicating a region where cluster profiles are the closest to the self-similar regime. Larger scales are characterised by increasing scatter due to the complex spatial distribution of the gas. Also for the first time, we verify that the scatter due to projection effects is smaller than the scatter due to genuine object-by-object variation in all the considered scales. [abridged]
#### A Chandra X-ray Study of Supernova Remnant N63A in the Large Magellanic  Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We perform extensive spectroscopy of the supernova remnant N63A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using $\sim 43$ ks {\it Chandra} archival data. By analysing the spectra of the entire remnant, we determine the abundance distributions for O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe. We detect evidence of enhanced O and possibly Ne and Mg in some of the central regions which might indicate an asymmetric distribution of the ejecta. The average O/Ne, O/Mg, and Ne/Mg abundance ratios of the ejecta are in plausible agreement with the nucleosynthesis products from the explosion of a $\sim40$ $M_{\odot}$ progenitor. We estimate an upper limit on the Sedov age of $\sim 5,400\pm200$ yr and explosion energy of $\sim 8.9\pm 1.6\times 10^{51}$ erg for N63A. We discuss the implications of our results for the morphological structure of the remnant, its circumstellar medium and the nature of the progenitor star.
#### Complete replacement of magnetic flux in a flux rope during a coronal  mass ejection

 - **Abstract**
 Solar coronal mass ejections are the most energetic events in the Solar System. In their standard formation model, a magnetic flux rope builds up into a coronal mass ejection through magnetic reconnection that continually converts overlying, untwisted magnetic flux into twisted flux enveloping the pre-existing rope. However, only a minority of coronal mass ejections carry a coherent magnetic flux rope as their core structure, which casts doubt on the universality of this orderly wrapping process. Here we provide observational evidence of a different formation and eruption mechanism of a magnetic flux rope from an S-shaped thread, where its magnetic flux is fully replaced via flare reconnections. One of the footpoints of the sigmoidal feature slipped and expanded during the formation, and then moved to a completely new place, associated with the highly dynamical evolution of flare ribbons and a twofold increase in magnetic flux through the footpoint, during the eruption. Such a configuration is not predicted by standard formation models or numerical simulations and highlights the three-dimensional nature of magnetic reconnections between the flux rope and the surrounding magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of distances for 19544 K giants drawn from LAMOST DR8. Most of them are located in the halo of the Milky Way up to ~120~kpc. There are 15% K giants without SDSS photometry, for which we supplements with Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) photometry calibrated to SDSS photometric system. The possible contamination of the red clumps/horizontal branch are removed according to metallicities and colors before the distance determination. Combining the LAMOST spectroscopic metallicities with the SDSS/PS1 photometry, we estimate the absolute magnitudes in SDSS $r-$band, the distance moduli, and the corresponding uncertainties through an Bayesian approach devised by Xue et al. (2014) for the SEGUE halo K-giants. The typical distance precision is about 11%. The stars in the catalog lie in a region of 4-126 kpc from the Galactic center, of which with 6, 320 stars beyond 20 kpc and 273 stars beyond 50 kpc, forming the largest spectroscopic sample of distant tracers in the Milky Way halo so far.

 - **Abstract**
 Cometary dust particles are best preserved remnants of the matter present at the onset of the formation of the Solar System. Space missions, telescopic observations and laboratory analyses advanced the knowledge on the properties of cometary dust. Cometary samples were returned from comet 81P/Wild2 by the Stardust mission. The chondritic (porous) anhydrous interplanetary dust particles and chondritic porous micrometeorites, and the ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs) also show strong evidence for a cometary origin. The composition of cometary dust is generally chondritic, but with high C and N compared with CI. The cometary organic matter is mixed with minor amounts of crystalline and amorphous minerals. The most abundant crystalline minerals are ferromagnesian silicates, refractory minerals and low Ni Fe sulfides are also present. The presence of carbonates in cometary dust is still debated, but a phyllosilicate-like phase was observed in a UCAMM. GEMS phases are usually abundant. Some of the organic matter present in cometary dust particle resembles the insoluble organic matter present in primitive meteorites, but amorphous carbon and exotic (e.g. N-rich) organic phases are also present. The H isotopic composition of the organic matter traces a formation at very low temperatures, in the protosolar cloud or in the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk. The presolar dust concentration in cometary dust can reach about 1%, which is the most elevated value observed in extraterrestrial samples. The differential size distribution of cometary dust in comet trails is well represented by a power-law distribution with a mean power index N typically ranging from -3 to -4. Polarimetric and light scattering studies suggest mixtures of porous agglomerates of sub-micrometer minerals with organic matter. Cometary dust particles have low tensile strength, and low density.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the proper motion of the emission component in radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) could help to distinguish between the origins of the radio emission and to understand whether the jet production mechanism is the same in radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and RQQs. PG 1351+640 is one of the few RQQs suitable for proper motion studies: it has two compact components on milli-arcsecond scales, a flat-spectrum core and a steep-spectrum jet; both components are >2 mJy at 5 GHz and are well suited for Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations. We compare recent VLBA observations with that made seventeen years ago and find no significant change in the core-jet separation between 2005 and 2015 (a proper motion of 0.003 mas yr-1). However, the core-jet separation increased significantly between 2015 and 2022, inferring a jet proper motion velocity of 0.063 mas yr-1, which corresponds to an apparent transverse velocity of 0.37c. The result suggests that the jet of the RQQ PG 1351+640 is mildly relativistic and oriented at a relatively small viewing angle.
#### The first massive compact companion in a wide orbit around a hot  subdwarf star

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the first hot subdwarf B (sdB) star with a massive compact companion in a wide ($P=892.5\pm60.2\,{\rm d}$) binary system. It was discovered based on an astrometric binary solution provided by the Gaia mission Data Release 3. We performed detailed analyses of the spectral energy distribution (SED) as well as spectroscopic follow-up observations and confirm the nature of the visible component as a sdB star. The companion is invisible despite of its high mass of $M_{\rm comp}=1.50_{-0.45}^{+0.37}\,M_{\rm \odot}$. A main sequence star of this mass would significantly contribute to the SED and can be excluded. The companion must be a compact object, either a massive white dwarf or a neutron star. Stable Roche lobe overflow to the companion likely led to the stripping of a red giant and the formation of the sdB, the hot and exposed helium core of the giant. Based on very preliminary data, we estimate that $\sim9\%$ of the sdBs might be formed through this new channel. This binary might also be the prototype for a new progenitor class of supernovae type Ia, which has been predicted by theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars are the densest objects in the Universe. They have microscopically homogeneous core and heterogeneous crust. In particular, there may be a specific layer inside neutron stars, the mantle, which consists of substantially non-spherical nuclei immersed in a background of relativistic degenerate electrons and quasi-free neutrons. In this paper we reconsider transverse shear modulus for cylindrical phases of the mantle within the framework of compressible liquid drop model. We demonstrate that transverse shear affects the shape of nuclear clusters: their cross-section becomes elliptical. This effect reduces respective elastic constant. Using a simple model we perform all derivations analytically and obtain the expression for the transverse shear modulus, which can be useful for astrophysical applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Young protostellar discs are likely to be both self-gravitating, and to support grain growth to sizes where the particles decoupled from the gas. This combination could lead to short-wavelength fragmentation of the solid component in otherwise non-fragmenting gas discs, forming Earth-mass solid cores during the Class 0/I stages of Young Stellar Object evolution. We use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of two-fluid discs, in the regime where the Stokes number of the particles St>1, to study how the formation of solid clumps depends on the disc-to-star mass ratio, the strength of gravitational instability, and the Stokes number. Gravitational instability of the simulated discs is sustained by local cooling. We find that the ability of the spiral structures to concentrate solids increases with the cooling time, and decreases with the Stokes number, while the relative dynamical temperature between gas and dust of the particles decreases with the cooling time and the disc-to-star mass ratio, and increases with the Stokes number. Dust collapse occurs in a subset of high disc mass simulations, yielding clumps whose mass is close to linear theory estimates, namely 1-10 Earth masses. Our results suggest that if planet formation occurs via this mechanism, the best conditions correspond to near the end of the self-gravitating phase, when the cooling time is long and the Stokes number close to unity.
