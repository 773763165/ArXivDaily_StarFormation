#### Title:
          Modeling reflection spectra of super-Eddington X-ray sources

 - **Abstract**
 We present a relativistic disk reflection model based on the geometry calculated using analytical formulae for super-Eddington accretion flows. This model features a slim disk geometry where the inner disk thickness is proportional to radius, becoming thicker as the mass accretion rate increases. The slim disk profile reduces the brightness of the blue horn in the Fe K emission line for a fixed emissivity and significantly changes the intensity profile for a lamppost geometry. The model is constructed assuming a spherically symmetric spacetime. It can be used for any kind of sources showing fluorescent reflection features and predicted to have slim accretion disks, like slow rotating black holes in X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, and neutron star X-ray binaries. To show the capability of the model, we use the 2017 \textit{NICER} and \textit{NuSTAR} data of the ultraluminous X-ray transient Swift~J0243.6+6124.

          Comments concerning the paper "On the calibration of ultra-high energy EASs at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array" by A.V.Glushkov et. al

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent review of a paper by the Yakutsk Group, submitted to the Journal Physics of Atomic Nuclei and arXiv, the energy scales of the Yakutsk and Telescope Array (TA) experiments were examined. The authors developed a custom detector response simulator incorporating ionization, bremsstrahlung, pair production, and Compton scattering. Applying this simulator to both Yakutsk and TA surface detectors, they concluded that the TA energy scale might be incorrect due to a misdefined ``response unit.'' They referenced the TA's ``energy deposit formula'' from the literature, scaling it by two factors attributed to the thickness and density of the TA scintillator. Their simulations, using the QGSJET-II-04 hadronic interaction model, agreed with TA's calculations for vertical showers but not for inclined showers, suggesting an incorrect VEM unit of 2.05 MeV. However, this conclusion was found to be incorrect. The TA's energy deposit formula, derived from detailed Monte Carlo simulations using GEANT4, accurately represents the most probable energy deposit by a charged particle in the TA scintillator. The value of 2.05 MeV accounts for the scintillator's thickness and density and is validated by excellent agreement between TA's simulated and observed data. The Yakutsk Group's misinterpretation and incorrect application of the TA formula led to their erroneous conclusion.

          JWST reveals a rapid and strong day side variability of 55 Cancri e

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the close-in rocky planet 55 Cnc e is puzzling despite having been observed extensively. Its optical and infrared occultation depths show temporal variability, in addition to a phase curve variability observed in the optical. We wish to explore the possibility that the variability originates from the planet being in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, thus showing different sides during occultations. We proposed and were awarded Cycle 1 time at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to test this hypothesis. JWST/NIRCam observed five occultations (secondary eclipses), of which four were observed within a week, of the planet simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.5 {\mu}m. While the former gives band-integrated photometry, the latter provides a spectrum between 3.9-5.0 {\mu}m. We find that the occultation depths in both bandpasses are highly variable and change between a non-detection (-5 +/- 6 ppm and 7 +/- 9 ppm) to 96 +/- 8 ppm and 119 (+34) (-19) ppm at 2.1 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m, respectively. Interestingly, the variations in both bandpasses are not correlated and do not support the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance explanation. The measured brightness temperature at 4.5 {\mu}m varies between 873-2256 K and is lower than the expected dayside temperature of bare rock with no heat re-distribution (2500 K) which is indicative of an atmosphere. Our atmospheric retrieval analysis of occultation depth spectra at 4.5 {\mu}m finds that different visits statistically favour various atmospheric scenarios including a thin outgassed CO/CO2 atmosphere and a silicate rock vapour atmosphere. Some visits even support a flat line model. The observed variability could be explained by stochastic outgassing of CO/CO2, which is also hinted by retrievals. Alternatively, the variability, observed at both 2.1 and 4.5 {\mu}m, could be the result of a circumstellar patchy dust torus generated by volcanism on the planet.
#### Title:
          Helium features are inconsistent with the spectral evolution of the kilonova AT2017gfo

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral features observed in kilonovae (KNe) reveal the elemental composition and the velocity structures of matter ejected from neutron star mergers. In the spectra of the kilonova AT2017gfo, a P Cygni line at about 1$\mu$m has been linked to Sr II, providing the first direct evidence of freshly synthesised $r$-process material. An alternative explanation to Sr II was proposed - He I $\lambda 1083.3$nm under certain non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. A key way to robustly discriminate between these identifications, and indeed other proposed identifications, is to analyse the temporal emergence and evolution of the feature. In this analysis we trace the earliest appearance of the observed feature and detail its spectro-temporal evolution, which we compare with a collisional-radiative model of helium. We show that the 1$\mu$m P Cygni line is inconsistent with a He I interpretation both in emergence time and in subsequent spectral evolution. Self-consistent helium masses cannot reproduce the observed feature, due to the diminishing strength of radiative pathways leaving triplet helium.

          Detecting low-mass haloes with strong gravitational lensing II: constraints on the density profiles of two detected subhaloes

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing can detect the presence of low-mass haloes and subhaloes through their effect on the surface brightness of lensed arcs. We carry out an extended analysis of the density profiles and mass distributions of two detected subhaloes, intending to determine if their properties are consistent with the predictions of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. We analyse two gravitational lensing systems in which the presence of two low-mass subhaloes has been previously reported: SDSSJ0946+1006 and JVASB1938+66. We model these detections assuming four different models for their density profiles and compare our results with predictions from the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation. We find that the detected subhaloes are well-modelled by steep inner density slopes, close to or steeper than isothermal. The NFW profile thus needs extremely high concentrations to reproduce the observed properties, which are outliers of the CDM predictions. We also find a characteristic radius within which the best-fitting density profiles predict the same enclosed mass. We conclude that the lens modelling can constrain this quantity more robustly than the inner slope. We find that the diversity of subhalo profiles in TNG50, consistent with tidally stripping and baryonic effects, is able to match the observed steep inner slopes, somewhat alleviating the tension reported by previous works even if the detections are not well fit by the typical subhalo. However, while we find simulated analogues of the detection in B1938+666, the stellar content required by simulations to explain the central density of the detection in J0946+1006 is in tension with the upper limit in luminosity estimated from the observations. New detections will increase our statistical sample and help us reveal more about the density profiles of these objects and the dark matter content of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization spectrum, or wavelength dependence of the polarization fraction, of interstellar dust emission provides important insights into the grain alignment mechanism of interstellar dust grains. We investigate the far-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star forming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find that neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model that includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum seen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model with grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of producing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations of OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation between temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do find a positive correlation between column density and the slope of the polarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of wavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine a new Galactic plane survey of Hydrogen Radio Recombination Lines (RRLs) with far-infrared (FIR) surveys of ionized Nitrogen, N+, to determine Nitrogen abundance across Galactic radius. RRLs were observed with NASA DSS-43 70m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines-of-sight spanning -135 degrees < l < 60 degrees, at b=0 degrees. These positions were also observed in [N II] 122 um and 205 um lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining RRL and [N II] 122 um and 205 um observations in 41 of 108 samples with high signal-to-noise ratio, we studied ionized Nitrogen abundance distribution across Galactocentric distances of 0-8 kpc. Combined with existing Solar neighborhood and Outer galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this quantity's distribution within the Milky Way's inner 17 kpc for the first time. We found a Nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of 4-17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0-4 kpc, the N/H distribution remained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports inside-out galaxy growth with the additional steepening resulting from variable star formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the inner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar's onset, may be linked to radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and Herschel/PACS, we observed the [N III] 57 um line to trace doubly ionized gas contribution in a sub-sample of sightlines. We found negligible N++ contributions along these sightlines, suggesting mostly singly ionized Nitrogen originating from low ionization H II region outskirts.

          Single-Pulse Gamma-Ray Bursts have Prevalent Hard-to-Soft Spectral Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the spectral evolution of 62 bright Fermi gamma-ray bursts with large enough signal to noise to allow for time resolved spectral analysis. We develop a new algorithm to test for single-pulse morphology that is insensitive to the specific shape of pulses. Instead, it only checks whether or not there are multiple, isolated, statistical significant peaks in the light curve. In addition, we carry out a citizen science test to assess light curve morphology and spectral evolution. We find that, no matter the adopted assessment method, bursts characterized by single-peaked prompt emission light curves have a greater tendency to also have a consistently decaying peak energy, or hard-to-soft spectral evolution. This contrasts the behavior of multi-peaked bursts, for which the tendency is to have a peak frequency that is not monotonically decreasing. We discuss this finding in the theoretical framework of internal/external shocks, and find it to be consistent with at least some single pulse bursts being associated with particularly high-density environments.

          Catalog-level blinding on the bispectrum for DESI-like galaxy surveys

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the performance of the catalog-level blind analysis technique (\textit{blinding}) presented in Brieden et al. (2020) in the context of a power spectrum and bispectrum analysis. This blinding scheme, which is tailored for galaxy redshift surveys similar to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), has two components: the so-called "AP blinding" (Alcock-Paczyński, concerning the dilation parameters $\alpha_\parallel,\alpha_\bot$) and "RSD blinding" (redshift space distortions, affecting the growth rate parameter $f$). Through extensive testing, including checks for the RSD part in cubic boxes, the impact of AP blinding on mocks with realistic survey sky coverage, and the implementation of a full AP+RSD blinding pipeline, our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique in preserving the integrity of cosmological parameter estimation when the analysis includes the bispectrum statistic. We emphasize the critical role of sophisticated -- and difficult to accidentally unblind -- blinding methods in precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct time-evolving gravitational potential models for a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological-baryonic simulations using basis function expansions. These models capture the angular variation with spherical harmonics for the halo and azimuthal harmonics for the disk, and the radial or meridional plane variation with splines. We fit low-order expansions (4 angular/harmonic terms) to the galaxy's potential for each snapshot, spaced roughly 25 Myr apart, over the last 4 Gyr of its evolution, then extract the forces at discrete times and interpolate them between adjacent snapshots for forward orbit integration. Our method reconstructs the forces felt by simulation particles with high fidelity, with 95% of both stars and dark matter, outside of self-gravitating subhalos, exhibiting errors $\leq4\%$ in both the disk and the halo. Imposing symmetry on the model systematically increases these errors, particularly for disk particles, which show greater sensitivity to imposed symmetries. The majority of orbits recovered using the models exhibit positional errors $\leq10\%$ for 2-3 orbital periods, with higher errors for orbits that spend more time near the galactic center. Approximate integrals of motion are retrieved with high accuracy even with a larger potential sampling interval of 200 Myr. After 4 Gyr of integration, 43% and 70% of orbits have total energy and angular momentum errors within 10%, respectively. Consequently, there is higher reliability in orbital shape parameters such as pericenters and apocenters, with errors $\sim10\%$ even after multiple orbital periods. These techniques have diverse applications, including studying satellite disruption in cosmological contexts.

 - **Abstract**
 MagAO-X is the coronagraphic extreme adaptive optics system for the 6.5 m Magellan Clay Telescope. We report the results of commissioning the first phase of MagAO-X. Components now available for routine observations include: the >2 kHz high-order control loop consisting of a 97 actuator woofer deformable mirror (DM), a 2040 actuator tweeter DM, and a modulated pyramid wavefront sensor (WFS); classical Lyot coronagraphs with integrated low-order (LO) WFS and control using a third 97-actuator non-common path correcting (NCPC) DM; broad band imaging in g, r, i, and z filters with two EMCCDs; simultaneous differential imaging in H-alpha; and integral field spectroscopy with the VIS-X module. Early science results include the discovery of an H-alpha jet, images of accreting protoplanets at H-alpha, images of young extrasolar giant planets in the optical, discovery of new white dwarf companions, resolved images of evolved stars, and high-contrast images of circumstellar disks in scattered light in g-band (500 nm). We have commenced an upgrade program, called "Phase II", to enable high-contrast observations at the smallest inner working angles possible. These upgrades include a new 952 actuator NCPC DM to enable coronagraphic wavefront control; phase induced amplitude apodization coronagraphs; new fast cameras for LOWFS and Lyot-LOWFS; and real-time computer upgrades. We will report the status of these upgrades and results of first on-sky testing in March-May 2024.

          More data than you want, less data than you need: machine learning approaches to starlight subtraction with MagAO-X

 - **Abstract**
 High-contrast imaging data analysis depends on removing residual starlight from the host star to reveal planets and disks. Most observers do this with principal components analysis (i.e. KLIP) using modes computed from the science images themselves. These modes may not be orthogonal to planet and disk signals, leading to over-subtraction. The wavefront sensor data recorded during the observation provide an independent signal with which to predict the instrument point-spread function (PSF). MagAO-X is an extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) system for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope and a technology pathfinder for ExAO with GMagAO-X on the upcoming Giant Magellan Telescope. MagAO-X is designed to save all sensor information, including kHz-speed wavefront measurements. Our software and compressed data formats were designed to record the millions of training samples required for machine learning with high throughput. The large volume of image and sensor data lets us learn a PSF model incorporating all the information available. This will eventually allow us to probe smaller star-planet separations at greater sensitivities, which will be needed for rocky planet imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the preliminary design of GMagAO-X, the first-light high-contrast imager planned for the Giant Magellan Telescope. GMagAO-X will realize the revolutionary increase in spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the 25 m GMT. It will enable, for the first time, the spectroscopic characterization of nearby potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars. Additional science cases include: reflected light characterization of mature giant planets; measurement of young extrasolar giant planet variability; characterization of circumstellar disks at unprecedented spatial resolution; characterization of benchmark stellar atmospheres at high spectral resolution; and mapping of resolved objects such as giant stars and asteroids. These, and many more, science cases will be enabled by a 21,000 actuator extreme adaptive optics system, a coronagraphic wavefront control system, and a suite of imagers and spectrographs. We will review the science-driven performance requirements for GMagAO-X, which include achieving a Strehl ratio of 70% at 800 nm on 8th mag and brighter stars, and post-processed characterization at astrophysical flux-ratios of 1e-7 at 4 lambda/D (26 mas at 800 nm) separation. We will provide an overview of the resulting mechanical, optical, and software designs optimized to deliver this performance. We will also discuss the interfaces to the GMT itself, and the concept of operations. We will present an overview of our end-to-end performance modeling and simulations, including the control of segment phasing, as well as an overview of prototype lab demonstrations. Finally, we will review the results of Preliminary Design Review held in February, 2024.

 - **Abstract**
 MagAO-X is the extreme coronagraphic adaptive optics (AO) instrument for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope and is currently undergoing a comprehensive batch of upgrades. One innovation that the instrument features is a deformable mirror (DM) dedicated for non-common path aberration correction (NCPC) within the coronagraph arm. We recently upgraded the 97 actuator NCPC DM with a 1000 actuator Boston Micromachines Kilo-DM which serves to (1) correct non-common path aberrations which hamper performance at small inner-working angles, (2) facilitate focal-plane wavefront control algorithms (e.g., electric field conjugation) and (3) enable 10 kHz correction speeds (up from 2 kHz) to assist post-AO, real-time low-order wavefront control. We present details on the characterization and installation of this new DM on MagAO-X as part of our efforts to improve deep contrast performance for imaging circumstellar objects in reflected light. Pre-installation procedures included use of a Twyman-Green interferometer to build an interaction matrix for commanding the DM surface, in closed-loop, to a flat state for seamless integration into the instrument. With this new NCPC DM now installed, we report on-sky results from the MagAO-X observing run in March -- May 2024 for the Focus Diversity Phase Retrieval and implicit Electric Field Conjugation algorithms for quasistatic speckle removal and in-situ Strehl ratio optimization, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (GMagAO-X) instrument is a first-light high-contrast imaging instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). GMagAO-X's broad wavelength range and the large 25-meter aperture of the GMT creates new challenges: control of all 21.000 actuators; phasing GMT's segmented primary mirror to nm levels; active control of atmospheric dispersion to sub milli-arcsecond residuals; no chromatic pupil shear to minimize chromatic compensation errors; integrated focal plane wavefront sensing and control (WFSC). GMagAO-X will have simultaneous visible and infra-red WFS channels to control the 21.000 actuator DM. The infra-red arm will be flexible by incorporating switchable sensors such as the pyramid or Zernike WFS. One innovation that we developed for GMagAO-X is the Holographic Dispersed Fringe Sensor that measures differential piston. We have also developed several integrated coronagraphic wavefront sensors to control non-common path aberrations exactly where we need to sense them. We will discuss the key components of the WFSC strategies for GMagAO-X that address the challenges posed by the first high-contrast imaging system on the ELTs.

          On-sky, real-time optical gain calibration on MagAO-X using incoherent speckles

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of extreme adaptive optics (AO) must be calibrated exceptionally well to achieve the desired contrast for ground-based direct imaging exoplanet targets. Current wavefront sensing and control system responses deviate from lab calibration throughout the night due to non linearities in the wavefront sensor (WFS) and signal loss. One cause of these changes is the optical gain (OG) effect, which shows that the difference between actual and reconstructed wavefronts is sensitive to residual wavefront errors from partially corrected turbulence. This work details on-sky measurement of optical gain on MagAO-X, an extreme AO system on the Magellan Clay 6.5m. We ultimately plan on using a method of high-temporal frequency probes on our deformable mirror to track optical gain on the Pyramid WFS. The high-temporal frequency probes, used to create PSF copies at 10-22 lambda /D, are already routinely used by our system for coronagraph centering and post-observation calibration. This method is supported by the OG measurements from the modal response, measured simultaneously by sequenced pokes of each mode. When tracked with DIMM measurements, optical gain calibrations show a clear dependence on Strehl Ratio, and this relationship is discussed. This more accurate method of calibration is a crucial next step in enabling higher fidelity correction and post processing techniques for direct imaging ground based systems.

          Methane Formation Efficiency on Icy Gains: Role of Adsorption States

 - **Abstract**
 Methane (CH4) is one of the major components of the icy mantle of cosmic dust prevalent in cold, dense regions of interstellar media, playing an important role in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and prebiotic molecules. Solid CH4 is considered to be formed via the successive hydrogenation of C atoms accreting onto dust: C + 4H -> CH4. However, most astrochemical models assume this reaction on the ice mantles of dust to be barrierless and efficient, without considering the states of adsorption. Recently, we found that C atoms exist in either the physisorbed or chemisorbed state on compact amorphous solid water, which is analogous to an interstellar ice mantle. These distinct adsorption states considerably affect the hydrogenation reactivity of the C atom. Herein, we elucidate the reactivities of physisorbed and chemisorbed C atoms with H atoms via sequential deposition and co-deposition processes. The results indicate that only physisorbed C atoms can produce CH4 on ice. Combining this finding with a previous estimate for the fraction of physisorbed C atoms on ice, we determined the upper limit for the conversion of C atoms into CH4 to be 30%.

 - **Abstract**
 The China Space Station Telescope (CSST, also known as Xuntian) is a serviceable two-meter-aperture wide-field telescope operating in the same orbit as the China Space Station. The CSST plans to survey a sky area of 17,500 deg$^2$ of the medium-to-high Galactic latitude to a depth of 25-26 AB mag in at least 6 photometric bands over 255-1000 nm. Within such a large sky area, slitless spectra will also be taken over the same wavelength range as the imaging survey. Even though the CSST survey is not dedicated to time-domain studies, it would still detect a large number of transients, such as supernovae (SNe). In this paper, we simulate photometric SN observations based on a strawman survey plan using the Sncosmo package. During its 10-year survey, the CSST is expected to observe about 5 million SNe of various types. With quality cuts, we obtain a "gold" sample that comprises roughly 7,400 SNe Ia, 2,200 SNe Ibc, and 6,500 SNe II candidates with correctly classified percentages reaching 91%, 63%, and 93% (formally defined as classification precision), respectively. The same survey can also trigger alerts for the detection of about 15,500 SNe Ia (precision 61%) and 2,100 SNe II (precision 49%) candidates at least two days before the light maxima. Moreover, the near-ultraviolet observations of the CSST will be able to catch hundreds of shock-cooling events serendipitously every year. These results demonstrate that the CSST can make a potentially significant contribution to SN studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has obtained more than 23 million spectra, opening an unprecedented opportunity to study stellar physics, as well as the formation and evolution of our Milky Way. In order to obtain the accurate stellar parameters, we develop a LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectral Analysis Pipeline (LAMA), which estimates the stellar parameters from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, including the effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (logg), metallicity ([Fe/H]), radial velocity, and rotational velocity (vsini). LAMA estimates these parameters utilizing the template-matching method. The comparison between our results and those from the high-resolution ones, including APOGEE, GALAH, and PASTEL, shows no obvious bias, indicating the reliability of our results. The accuracy of Teff and [Fe/H] can reach 75 K and 0.12 dex, respectively, for the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS) spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10. For dwarfs, the uncertainty of logg is around 0.17 dex, while, for giants, it ranges from 0.18 to 0.30 dex, with the errors decreasing as logg increases. Using LAMA for the LAMOST-MRS spectra, we estimate the stellar parameters of 497,412 stars. This sample will be very helpful for investigating the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system (SS) analog, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our Solar System as viewed from a distance and based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth-Moon Barycenter, as influenced by the other SS bodies, with varying noise levels and observing durations. We then retrieve the system's dynamical parameters using an approximate N-body model for transit timing shifts while considering four possible plane-parallel configurations: two planets, three planets, four planets, and five planets. We demonstrate that -- with the retrieval applied to simulated transit times of Venus and EMB -- we can: 1) detect Jupiter at high significance (up to 90-s timing noise); 2) measure the masses and orbits of both transiting planets (mass-ratios are down to 4-8% uncertainty for the 3-planet model) ; 3) detect Mars with more than $5\sigma$ given very high level precision (10s of seconds). To accurately characterize Jupiter, we require timing precisions of better than 30 seconds and survey durations longer than 22 years. Accurate retrieval of Mars is possible when the survey baseline is longer than 25 years. Additionally, while Jupiter's mass is underestimated in most of our simulated cases, the addition of Mars improves the posterior mass, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems if they are nearly resonant to transiting planets. Ultimately, these simulations will help to guide future missions -- such as PLATO, Nautilus, LUVOIR, and Ariel -- in detecting and characterizing exoplanet systems analogous to our Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 High contrast imaging of extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks requires extreme wavefront stability. Such stability can be achieved with active wavefront control (WFC). The next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes will require a robust form of WFC in order to image planets at small inner working angles and extreme flux ratios with respect to the host star. WFC algorithms such as implicit Electric Field Conjugation (iEFC) reduce stellar leakage by minimizing the electric field within a given region of an image, creating a dark hole. iEFC utilizes an empirical approach to sense and remove speckles in the focal plane. While iEFC is empirically calibrated and can handle optical model errors, there are still model assumptions made during the calibration. The performance of iEFC will degrade if the system changes due to slow, optomechanical drifts. In this work, we assess the iEFC performance impacts of pupil misalignments on the deformable mirror and focal plane misalignments on the detector. We base our analysis on the MagAO-X instrument, an extreme AO system installed on the Magellan-Clay telescope, to develop iEFC misalignment tolerancing requirements for both ground- and space-based missions. We present end-to-end physical optics simulations of the MagAO-X instrument, demonstrating iEFC alignment tolerance.

          Probe the regolith characteristics of asteroids from 9-years infrared observations of WISE/NEOWISE: A case study of the Main-Belt Object (656) Beagle

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents data processing, fitting procedure, modelling and analyzing of 9-years infrared light curves provided by the WISE/NEOWISE telescope, by which the regolith characteristics of Main-Belt Object (656) Beagle is studied. We determine Beagle's effective diameter $D_{\rm eff}=57.3^{+4.5}_{-2.2}$ km, geometric albedo $p_{\rm v}=0.05^{+0.004}_{-0.007}$, mean roughness $\theta_{\rm RMS}=44\pm4^\circ$, mean grain size $b=100^{+350}_{-90}~\mu$m, mean specific heat capacity $c_{\rm p}=173\sim516\rm~JKg^{-1}K^{-1}$, mean thermal conductivity $\kappa=0.7\sim1.3\times10^{-3}\rm~Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ and mean thermal inertia $\Gamma=14\sim32\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$. The albedo of Beagle is a little anomalous that the albedos of Beagle's neighbouring asteroids are more close to Themis, rather than Beagle itself. The W1-band near-infrared light curves don't reveal significant heterogeneous NIR features on the surface of Beagle, being inconsistent with the expectation of a family parent that has members with diverse NIR spectral types. These results add new clues of Beagle probably being an interloper or a sister, rather than the parent of its neighbouring asteroids including the first main-belt comet (MBC) 133P, hence may lead to new scenarios about the origin of famous MBC 133P. Besides, we found that asteroidal shape models from inversion of optical light curves are imperfect for modeling infrared lightcurves, thus could mislead evaluations of both the heterogeneity of regolith reflectivity at near infrared and thermophysical characteristics at thermal infrared.

          Towards a complete picture of the Sco-Cen outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have shown strong evidence that the Sun is crossing an outflow originating from the Sco-Cen OB association. Understanding this outflow's origin and structure illuminates how massive star formation shapes the interstellar medium (ISM) and helps predict future Galactic conditions affecting our Solar System. We analysed H I emission and optical ISM absorption lines towards 47 early-type stars around the Upper Sco region to refine the map of the Sco-Cen outflow. Combined with data for nearby stars, we find that the outflow has at least two components: a faster, low-density component traced by Ca II, and a slower, possibly lower-density component traced by Mg II and Fe II in the UV that is passing through the Earth. A constant flow model successfully describes both components with $(l,b,|\vec{v}|) = (335.4^{\circ}, -6.8^{\circ}, 14.0 \,\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})$ and $(305.5^{\circ}, +17.6^{\circ}, 21.2\,\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})$, respectively. The origin of the faster component points towards the Sco-Cen 15 Myr population, which is consistent with the origin of the slower component within 2 $\sigma$. A simple model comparison indicates that a constant flow is favoured over a spherical flow geometry, implying an extended distribution of feedback sources within Sco-Cen. We also found that a poorly studied 25 pc long H I cloud at a distance of 107 pc belongs to the established Sco-Cen flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), are expected to detect gravitational wave signals, some of which are likely to overlap with each other. This overlap may lead to misidentification as a single GW event, potentially biasing the estimated parameters of mixture GWs. In this paper, we adapt the concept of speech separation to address this issue by applying it to signal separation of overlapping GWs. We show that deep learning models can effectively separate overlapping GW signals. The proposed method may aid in eliminating biases in parameter estimation for such signals.

 - **Abstract**
 A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest wide-field 115-166 MHz image at sub-arcsecond resolution spanning an area of 2.5 by 2.5 degrees centred at the ELAIS-N1 deep field. To achieve this, we improved the calibration for the International LOFAR Telescope. This enhancement enabled us to efficiently process 32 hrs of data from four different 8-hr observations using the high-band antennas (HBAs) of all 52 stations, covering baselines up to approximately 2,000 km across Europe. The DI calibration was improved by using an accurate sky model and refining the series of calibration steps on the in-field calibrator, while the DD calibration was improved by adopting a more automated approach for selecting the DD calibrators and inspecting the self-calibration on these sources. We also added an additional round of self-calibration for the Dutch core and remote stations in order to refine the solutions for shorter baselines. To complement our highest resolution at 0.3", we also made intermediate resolution wide-field images at 0.6" and 1.2". Our resulting wide-field images achieve a central noise level of 14 muJy/beam at 0.3", doubling the depth and uncovering four times more objects than the Lockman Hole deep field image at comparable resolution but with only 8 hrs of data. Compared to LOFAR imaging without the international stations, we note that due to the increased collecting area and the absence of confusion noise, we reached a point-source sensitivity comparable to a 500-hr ELAIS-N1 6" image with 16 times less observing time. Importantly, we have found that the computing costs for the same amount of data are almost halved (to about 139,000 CPU hrs per 8 hrs of data) compared to previous efforts, though they remain high. Our work underscores the value and feasibility of exploiting all Dutch and international LOFAR stations to make deep wide-field images at sub-arcsecond resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional pulsar surveys have primarily employed time-domain periodicity searches. However, these methods are susceptible to effects like scattering, eclipses and orbital motion. At lower radio frequencies (<= 300 MHz), factors such as dispersion measure and pulse broadening become more prominent, reducing the detection sensitivity. On the other hand, image domain searches for pulsars are not limited by these effects and can extend the parameter space to regions inaccessible to traditional search techniques. Therefore, we have developed a pipeline to form 1-second full Stokes images from offline correlated high time-resolution data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This led to the development of image-based methodologies to identify new pulsar candidates. In this paper, we applied these methodologies to perform a low-frequency image-based pulsar census of the Galactic Plane ( 12 MWA observations, covering ~6000 deg^2 sky ). This work focuses on the detection of the known pulsar population which were present in the observed region of the sky using both image-based and beamformed methods. This resulted in the detection of 83 known pulsars, with 16 pulsars found only in Stokes I images but not in periodicity searches applied in beamformed data. Notably, for 14 pulsars these are the first reported low-frequency detections. This underscores the importance of image-based searches for pulsars that may be undetectable in time-series data, due to scattering and/or dispersive smearing at low frequencies. This highlights the importance of low-frequency flux density measurements in refining pulsar spectral models and investigating the spectral turnover of pulsars at low frequencies.

 We introduce a novel software called TCSpy which is designed to efficiently control a multi-telescope array through network-based protocols. The primary objectives of TCSpy include centralized control of the array, support for diverse observation modes, and swift responses to the follow-up observations of astronomical transients. To achieve these objectives, TCSpy utilizes the ASCOM Alpaca protocol in conjunction with Alpyca, establishing robust communication among multiple telescope units. For the practical application of TCSpy, we implement TCSpy within the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT). 7DT is a telescope array consisting of 20, 0.5-m telescopes, equipped with 40 different medium-band filters. The main scientific goals of 7DT include detecting the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources, identifying kilonovae, and the spectral mapping of the southern sky. Through the integration of TCSpy, 7DT can achieve these scientific objectives with its unique observation modes and rapid follow-up capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The geodetic and astrometric VLBI community is in the process of upgrading its existing infrastructure with VGOS. The primary objective of VGOS is to substantially boost the number of scans per hour for enhanced parameter estimation. However, the current observing strategy results in fewer scans than anticipated. During 2022, six 24-hour VGOS R&D sessions were conducted to demonstrate a proof-of-concept aimed at addressing this shortcoming. The new observation strategy centers around a signal-to-noise (SNR)-based scheduling approach combined with eliminating existing overhead times in existing VGOS sessions. Two SNR-based scheduling approaches were tested during these sessions: one utilizing inter-/extrapolation of existing S/X source flux density models and another based on a newly derived source flux density catalog at VGOS frequencies. Both approaches proved effective, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the number of scheduled scans per station and a 2.6-fold increase in the number of observations per station, while maintaining a high observation success rate of approximately 90-95%. Consequently, both strategies succeeded in the main objective of these sessions by successfully increasing the number of scans per hour. The strategies described in this work can be easily applied to operational VGOS observations. Besides outlining and discussing the observation strategy, we further provide insight into the resulting signal-to-noise ratios, and discuss the impact on the precision of the estimated geodetic parameters. Monte Carlo simulations predicted a roughly 50% increase in geodetic precision compared to operational VGOS sessions. The analysis confirmed that the formal errors in estimated station coordinates were reduced by 40-50%. Additionally, Earth orientation parameters showed significant improvement, with a 40-50% reduction in formal errors.

          Circumbinary Disk Spectra Irradiated by Two Central Accretion Disks in a Binary Black Hole System

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effect of irradiation from two accretion disks (minidisks) around respective black holes of stellar to intermediate masses in a circular binary on the spectrum of a circumbinary disk (CBD) surrounding them. We assume the CBD to be a standard disk and adopt the orbit-averaged irradiation flux because the viscous timescale is much longer than the orbital period. We then solve the energy equation both analytically and numerically to compute the CBD temperature distribution and the corresponding disk spectrum. We find that the analytically calculated spectra are in good agreement with the numerical ones. The CBD spectrum is almost independent of the binary mass ratio. We also find that the combined spectra of two minidisks and the CBD have double peaks, one peak in the soft X-ray band and the other in the infrared (IR) band. The former peak comes from the two minidisks, while the latter peak from the CBD. The observed flux density increases with frequency as $\nu^{1/3}$ towards the soft X-ray peak, while it decreases with frequency away from the IR peak as $\nu^{-5/3}$. The latter feature is testable with near-IR observations with Subaru and JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, the dayside thermal structure of ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs) is generally considered to be inverted, but their nightside thermal structure has been less explored. Here we explore the impact of nightside thermal emission on high-resolution infrared transmission spectroscopy, which should not be neglected, especially for UHJs. We present a general equation for the high-resolution transmission spectrum that includes planetary nightside thermal emission. This provides a new way to infer the thermal structure of the planetary nightside with high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Using the cross-correlation technique, we find evidence for the presence of an H$_2$O emission signature on the UHJ WASP-33b during the transit, indicating an inverted temperature structure on its nightside. Such a result suggests a stronger heat transport through the circulation than currently expected. An alternative explanation is that the rotating visible hemisphere during transit leads to the potential contribution of the limb and dayside atmospheres to the detected emission signature. In the future, the combination of high-resolution full-phase curve spectroscopic observations and general circulation models will hopefully solve this puzzle and provide a complete picture of the three-dimensional nature of the chemistry, circulation, and thermal structure of UHJs.

 - **Abstract**
 A spectator axion-gauge sector, minimally coupled to the inflaton, with the axion experiencing a momentary stage of fast roll during cosmological inflation, can generate unique signatures in primordial density fluctuations and the gravitational wave background. We present the first lattice simulation of this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the fully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the gravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially, we test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then investigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our findings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the gauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also allows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including higher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed by strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the axion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for simulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational wave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.

 We study non-classical inflaton, which is minimally coupled to the semiclassical gravity in FRW universe in Coherent Squeezed Vacuum State (CSVS). We determined Oscillatory phase of inflaton, power-law expansion, scale factor, density fluctuations, quantum fluctuations and particle production for CSVS. We obtained an estimated leading solution of scale factor in CSVS proportional to $t^{2/3}$ follow similar diversification as demonstrated by Semiclassical Einstein Equation (SCEE) of gravity in matter dominated universe. We also studied the validity of SCEE in CSVS. By determining the quantum fluctuation for CSVS validity of uncertainty relation for FRW Universe also computed. The results shows that Quantum fluctuations doesn't depend on coherent parameter $\Upsilon$ as uncertainty relation doesn't effected by the displacement of $\Upsilon$ in phase space. We study the production of particles in CSVS for oscillating massive inflaton in flat FRW universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) is a far-infrared space mission concept with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Saltus consists of a 14-m inflatable primary, providing 16 times the sensitivity and 4 times the angular resolution of Herschel, and two cryogenic detectors spanning a wavelength range of 34-660 microns and spectral resolving power of 300 - 1e7. Spectroscopic observations in the far-infrared offer many unique windows into the processes of star and planet formation. These include observations of low energy water transitions, the H2 mass tracer HD, many CHONS constraining molecules such as NH3 and H2S, and emission lines from the phonon modes of molecular ices. Observing these species will allow us to build a statistical sample of protoplanetary disk masses, characterize the water snowline, identify Kuiper Belt like debris rings around other stars, and trace the evolution CHONS from prestellar cores, through to protoplanetary disks and debris disks. This paper details details several key star and planet formation science goals achievable with SALTUS.

 - **Abstract**
 RoboPol is a four-channel, one-shot linear optical polarimeter that has been successfully operating since 2013 on the 1.3 m telescope at Skinakas Observatory in Crete, Greece. Using its unique optical system, it measures the linear Stokes parameters $q$ and $u$ in a single exposure with high polarimetric accuracy of 0.1% - 0.15% and 1 degree in polarization angle in the R broadband filter. Its performance marginally degrades in other broadband filters. The source of the current instrumental performance limit has been identified as unaccounted and variable instrumental polarization, most likely originating from factors such as temperature and gravity-induced instrument flexure. To improve the performance of RoboPol in all broadband filters, including R, we have developed a rotating half-wave plate calibrator system. This calibrator system is placed at the beginning of the instrument and enables modulation of polarimetric measurements by beam swapping between all four channels of RoboPol. Using the new calibrator system, we observed multiple polarimetric standard stars over two annual observing seasons with RoboPol. This has enabled us to achieve a polarimetric accuracy of better than 0.05 % in both $q$ and $u$, and 0.5 degrees in polarization angle across all filters, enhancing the instrument's performance by a factor of two to three.

 - **Abstract**
 All planets and stars rotate. All gas planets in our solar system, the Sun, and many stars show a pattern of east- or westward mean flows. This phenomenon is known as differential rotation in the stellar and as zonal jets in the planetary context. Observations, laboratory experiments and simulations show that the zonal flow kinetic energy scales like $\ell^{-5}$, where $\ell$ is the spherical harmonic degree (which is effectively a latitudinal wave number). Here, we analyze observation of the Sun, as well as simulations of the dynamics in Saturn and in the outer atmosphere of an ultra-hot Jupiter. While these systems are very different, they all develop strong zonal winds that obey the $\ell^{-5}$ scaling. Our results strongly suggest that there is a simple common mechanism that shapes zonal mean flows in planets and stars independent of the flow driving.

 We present here 55 short period PCEBs containing a hot WD and a low-mass MS. Based on the photometric data from ZTF DR19, the light curves are analyzed for about 200 WDMS binaries with emission line(s) identified from SDSS or LAMOST spectra, in which 55 WDMS binaries are found to exhibit variability in their luminosities with a short period and are thus short-period binaries (i.e. PCEBs). In addition, it is found that the orbital periods of these PCEBs locate in a range from 2.2643 to 81.1526 hours. However, only 6 short-period PCEBs are newly discovered and the orbital periods of 19 PCEBs are improved in this work. Meanwhile, it is found that three objects are newly discovered eclipsing PCEBs, and a object (i.e. SDSS J1541) might be the short-period PCEB with a late M-type star or a brown dwarf companion based on the analysis of its spectral energy distribution. At last, the mechanism(s) being responsible for the emission features in the spectra of these PCEBs are discussed, the emission features arising in their optical spectra might be caused by the stellar activity or an irradiated component owing to a hot white dwarf companion because most of them contain a white dwarf with an effective temperature higher than $\sim$10,000 K.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1227$-$6208 is a 34.53-ms recycled pulsar with a massive companion. This system has long been suspected to belong to the emerging class of massive recycled pulsar-ONeMg white dwarf systems such as PSR J2222$-$0137, PSR J1528$-$3146 and J1439$-$5501. Here we present an updated emission and timing analysis with more than 11 years of combined Parkes and MeerKAT data, including 19 hours of high-frequency data from the newly installed MeerKAT S-band receivers. We measure a scattering timescale of 1.22 ms at 1 GHz with a flat scattering index 3.33<$\beta$<3.62, and a mean flux density of 0.53-0.62 mJy at 1 GHz with a steep spectral index 2.06<$\alpha$<2.35. Around 15% of the emission is linearly and circularly polarised, but the polarisation angle does not follow the rotating vector model. Thanks to the sensitivity of MeerKAT, we successfully measure a rate of periastron advance of 0.0171(11) deg/yr, and a Shapiro delay with an orthometric amplitude of 3.6$\pm$0.5 $\mu$s and an orthometric shape of 0.85$\pm$0.05. The main source of uncertainty in our timing analysis is chromatic correlated dispersion measure noise, which we model as a power law in the Fourier space thanks to the large frequency coverage provided by the Parkes UWL receiver. Assuming general relativity and accounting for the measurements across all the implemented timing noise models, the total mass, companion mass, pulsar mass and inclination angle are constrained at 2.3<Mt/$M_\odot$<3.2, 1.21<Mc/$M_\odot$<1.47, 1.16<Mp/$M_\odot$<1.69 and 77.5<i/deg<80.3. We also constrain the longitude of ascending node to either 266$\pm$78 deg or 86$\pm$78 deg. We argue against a neutron star nature of the companion based on the very low orbital eccentric of the system (e=1.15e-3), and instead classify the companion of PSR J1227-6208 as a rare, massive ONeMg white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new near-ultraviolet (NUV, $\lambda$ = 2479 $-$ 3306 $Å$) transmission spectroscopy of KELT-9b, the hottest known exoplanet, obtained with the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment ($CUTE$) CubeSat. Two transits were observed on September 28th and September 29th 2022, referred to as Visits 1 and 2 respectively. Using a combined transit and systematics model for each visit, the best-fit broadband NUV light curves are R$_{\text{p}}$/R$_{\star}$ $=$ 0.136$_{0.0146}^{0.0125}$ for Visit 1 and R$_{\text{p}}$/R$_{\star}$ $=$ 0.111$_{0.0190}^{0.0162}$ for Visit 2, appearing an average of 1.54$\times$ larger in the NUV than at optical wavelengths. While the systematics between the two visits vary considerably, the two broadband NUV light curves are consistent with each other. A transmission spectrum with 25 $Å$ bins suggests a general trend of excess absorption in the NUV, consistent with expectations for ultra-hot Jupiters. Although we see an extended atmosphere in the NUV, the reduced data lack the sensitivity to probe individual spectral lines.

          An Earth Encounter As the Cause of Chaotic Dynamics in Binary Asteroid (35107) 1991VH

 - **Abstract**
 Among binary asteroids, (35107) 1991VH stands out as unique given the likely chaotic rotation within its secondary component. The source of this excited dynamical state is unknown. In this work we demonstrate that a past close encounter with Earth could have provided the necessary perturbation to allow the natural internal dynamics, characterized by spin-orbit coupling, to evolve the system into its current dynamical state. In this hypothesis, the secondary of 1991VH was previously in a classical 1:1 spin-orbit resonance with an orbit period likely between 28-35 hours before being perturbed by an Earth encounter within $\sim80,000$ km. We find if the energy dissipation within the secondary is relatively inefficient, this excited dynamical state could persist to today and produce the observed ground-based measurements. Coupled with the orbital history of 1991VH, we can then place a constraint on the tidal dissipation parameters of the secondary.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and disk winds arise from materials with excess angular momentum ejected from the accretion disks in forming stars. How these structures are launched and how they impact the gas within the innermost regions of these objects remains poorly understood. MWC349A is a massive star that has a circumstellar disk which rotates in accord with Kepler's Law, with an ionized wind and a high-velocity jet launched from the disk surface. The strongly maser-amplified emission of hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs) observed toward this system provides a comprehensive picture of its ionized environment with exquisite detail. In this Letter, we present ALMA observations of the H26$\alpha$ RRL and continuum emission obtained with the highest angular resolution ever used toward this source (beam of $\sim$0.02"). The maser RRL emission is resolved for the first time and clearly delineates the ionized disk, wind and jet. We analyzed the RRL data cubes with the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer model MORELI, confirming that the jet is poorly collimated. We found that the jet orientation is closer to the rotation axis of the system than derived from spatially unresolved data. This study confirms that hydrogen RRL masers are powerful probes of the physical structure and kinematics of the innermost ionized material around massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the interface between $S$-wave and $P$-wave paired superfluids in neutron stars induces a neutron supercurrent, akin to the Josephson junction effect in electronic superconductors. The proton supercurrent entrainment by the neutron superfluid generates, in addition to the neutral supercurrent, a charged current across the interface. Beyond the stationary limit, the motions of the neutron vortex line and proton flux tube arrays, responding to secular changes in the neutron star's rotation rate, induce a time-dependent oscillating Josephson current across this interface. We show that such motion produces radiation from the interface, which is phenomenologically significant enough to heat the star and alter its cooling rate during the photon cooling era.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background C$_{\nu}$B with other observables, namely: cold dark matter density, effective weak lensing convergence, neutrino velocity and neutrino deflection angle. We provide, for the first time, this high-fidelity cross-correlation maps in order to illustrate how much can be learned from them once the cosmic neutrino background is measured. As cross-correlations will have more signal than auto-correlations of the C$_{\nu}$B itself, these might be the ones to be measured first by Ptolemy-like experiments. Our predictions thus provide the imprint of what massive neutrinos should look like from cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the pursuit of understanding the population of stellar remnants within the Milky Way, we analyze the sample of $\sim 950$ microlensing events observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope between 2014 and 2019. In this study we focus on a sub-sample of nine microlensing events, selected based on their long timescales, small microlensing parallaxes and joint observations by the Gaia mission, to increase the probability that the chosen lenses are massive and the mass is measurable. Among the selected events we identify lensing black holes and neutron star candidates, with potential confirmation through forthcoming release of the Gaia time-series astrometry in 2026. Utilizing Bayesian analysis and Galactic models, along with the Gaia Data Release 3 proper motion data, four good candidates for dark remnants were identified: OGLE-2016-BLG-0293, OGLE-2018-BLG-0483, OGLE-2018-BLG-0662, and OGLE-2015-BLG-0149, with lens masses of $2.98^{+1.75}_{-1.28}~M_{\odot}$, $4.65^{+3.12}_{-2.08}~M_{\odot}$, $3.15^{+0.66}_{-0.64}~M_{\odot}$ and $1.4^{+0.75}_{-0.55}~M_{\odot}$, respectively. Notably, the first two candidates are expected to exhibit astrometric microlensing signals detectable by Gaia, offering the prospect of validating the lens masses. The methodologies developed in this work will be applied to the full Spitzer microlensing sample, populating and analyzing the time-scale ($t_{\rm E}$) vs. parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) diagram to derive constraints on the population of lenses in general and massive remnants in particular.

 - **Abstract**
 The high contrast and spatial resolution requirements for directly imaging exoplanets requires effective coordination of wavefront control, coronagraphy, observation techniques, and post-processing algorithms. However, even with this suite of tools, identifying and retrieving exoplanet signals embedded in resolved scattered light regions can be extremely challenging due to the increased noise from scattered light off the circumstellar disk and the potential misinterpretation of the true nature of the detected signal. This issue pertains not only to imaging terrestrial planets in habitable zones within zodiacal and exozodiacal emission but also to young planets embedded in circumstellar, transitional, and debris disks. This is particularly true for H{\alpha} detection of exoplanets in transitional disks. This work delves into recent H{\alpha} observations of three transitional disks systems with MagAO-X, an extreme adaptive optics system for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope. We employed angular differential imaging (ADI) and simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) in combination with KLIP, a PCA algorithm in post-processing, for optimal starlight suppression and quasi-static noise removal. We discuss the challenges in protoplanet identification with MagAO-X in environments rich with scattered and reflected light from disk structures and explore a potential solution for removing noise contributions from real astronomical objects with current observation and post-processing techniques.
