#### Constraining the mass of fermionic dark matter from its feeble  interaction with hadronic matter via dark mediators in neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Considering ten well-known relativistic mean field models, we invoke feeble interaction between hadronic matter and fermionic dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via new physics scalar ($\phi$) and vector ($\xi$) mediators in neutron star core, thereby forming DM admixed neutron stars (DMANSs). The chosen masses of the DM fermion ($m_{\chi}$) and the mediators ($m_{\phi}$ and $m_{\xi}$) are consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster while their respective couplings ($y_{\phi}$ and $y_{\xi}$) are also constrained by the present day relic abundance. Assuming that both $\phi$ and $\xi$ contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of state of the DMANSs and consequently their structural properties. We found that for a particular (constant) DM density, the presence of lighter DM results in more massive DMANSs with larger radius. In the light of the various recent constraints like those from the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave (GW170817) data and the results of NICER experiments for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, we provide a bound on $m_{\chi}$ within the framework of the present work as $m_{\chi}\approx$ (0.1 $-$ 30) GeV for a wide range of fixed DM Fermi momenta $k_F^{\chi}$=(0.01 $-$ 0.06) GeV. In the case of the hadronic models that yield larger radii corresponding to the low mass neutron stars in the no-DM scenario, interaction with comparatively heavier DM fermion is necessary in order to ensure that the DMANSs obtained with such models satisfy the radius constraints from both GW170817 and NICER data for PSR J0030+0451.
#### Self-interacting dark matter solves the final parsec problem of  supermassive black hole mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, plausibly originating from the merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is accumulating with observations from pulsar timing arrays. An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the "final parsec" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $0.2-5\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel combination of the excursion-set approach with the peak theory formalism in Lagrangian space and provide accurate predictions for halo and void statistics over a wide range of scales. The set-up is based on an effective moving barrier. Besides deriving the corresponding numerical multiplicity function, we introduce a new analytical formula reaching the percent level agreement with the exact numerical solution obtained via Monte Carlo realizations down to small scales, $\sim 10^{12} h^{-1}\mathrm{M_\odot}$. In the void case, we derive the dependence of the effective moving barrier on the void formation threshold, $\delta_{\rm v}$, by comparison against the Lagrangian void size function measured in the Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos Universe simulations. We discuss the mapping from Lagrangian to Eulerian space for both halos and voids; adopting the spherical symmetry approximation, we obtain a strong agreement at intermediate and large scales. Finally, using the effective moving barrier, we derive Lagrangian void density profiles accurately matching measurements from cosmological simulations, a major achievement towards using void profiles for precision cosmology with the next generation of galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded "infant" phase with $\sim$0.1" ALMA, HST, and JWST observations targeting the central starburst ring in NGC 3351, a nearby Milky Way analog galaxy. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 11 have apparent counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (${\sim}10^5\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$), small radii (${\lesssim}\,5\;\mathrm{pc}$), large escape velocities ($6{-}10\;\mathrm{km/s}$), and short free-fall times ($0.5{-}1\;\mathrm{Myr}$). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline going from $1{-}2\;\mathrm{Myr}$ before cluster formation as starless clumps, to $4{-}6\;\mathrm{Myr}$ after as exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit an non-uniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The red hypergiant VY CMa is famous for its very visible record of high mass loss events. Recent CO observations with ALMA revealed three previously unknown large scale outflows (Paper I). In this paper we use the CO maps to investigate the motions of a cluster of four clumps close to the star, not visible in the optical or infrared images. We present their proper motions measured from two epochs of ALMA images and determine the line of sight velocities of the gas in emission at the clumps. We estimate their masses and ages, or time since ejection, and conclude that all four were ejected during VY CMa's active period in the early 20th century. Together with two additional knots observed with HST, VY CMa experienced at least six massive outflows during a 30 year period with a total mass lost greater than 0.07 Msun. The position-velocity map of the $^{12}$CO emission reveals previously unnoticed attributes of the older outer ejecta. In a very narrow range of Doppler velocities, $^{12}$CO absorption and emission causes some of this outer material to be quite opaque. At those frequencies the inner structure is hidden and we see only emission from an extended outer region. This fact produces a conspicuous but illusory dark spot if one attempts to subtract the continuum in a normal way.

 - **Abstract**
 During the pre-main-sequence evolution, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) assemble most of their mass during the episodic accretion process. The rarely seen FUOr-type events (FUOrs) are valuable laboratories to investigate the outbursting nature of YSOs. Here, we present multi-wavelength detection of a high-amplitude eruptive source in the young open cluster VdBH 221 with an ongoing outburst, including optical to mid-infrared time series and near-infrared spectra. The initial outburst has an exceptional amplitude of $>$6.3 mag in Gaia and 4.6 mag in $K_s$, with a peak luminosity up to 16 $L_{\odot}$ and a peak mass accretion rate of 1.4 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The optical to infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of this object is consistent with a low-mass star (0.2$M_\odot$) with a modest extinction ($A_V < 2$ mag). A 100-d delay between optical and infrared rising stages is detected, suggesting an outside-in origin of the instability. The spectroscopic features of this object reveal a self-luminous accretion disc, very similar to FU Orionis, with a low line-of-sight extinction. Most recently, there has been a gradual increase in brightness throughout the wavelength range, possibly suggesting an enhancement of the mass accretion rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed a comprehensive search of a VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) database of 9.5 yr light curves for variable sources with $\Delta K_s \ge 4$ mag, aiming to provide a large sample of high amplitude eruptive young stellar objects (YSOs) and detect unusual or new types of infrared variable source. We find 222 variable or transient sources in the Galactic bulge and disc, most of which are new discoveries. The sample mainly comprises novae, YSOs, microlensing events, Long Period Variable stars (LPVs) and a few rare or unclassified sources. Additionally, we report the discovery of a significant population of aperiodic late-type giant stars suffering deep extinction events, strongly clustered in the Nuclear Disc of the Milky Way. We suggest that these are metal-rich stars in which radiatively driven mass loss has been enhanced by super-solar metallicity. Among the YSOs, 32/40 appear to be undergoing episodic accretion. Long-lasting YSO eruptions have a typical rise time of $\sim$2 yr, somewhat slower than the 6-12 month timescale seen in the few historical events observed on the rise. The outburst durations are usually at least 5 yr, somewhat longer than many lower amplitude VVV events detected previously. The light curves are diverse in nature, suggesting that multiple types of disc instability may occur. Eight long-duration extinction events are seen wherein the YSO dims for a year or more, attributable to inner disc structure. One binary YSO in NGC 6530 displays periodic extinction events (P=59 days) similar to KH 15D.
#### On the incidence of episodic accretion in Class I YSOs from VVV

 - **Abstract**
 Episodic accretion is one of the competing models to explain the observed luminosity spread in young stellar clusters. These short-lived high accretion events could also have a strong impact on planet formation. Observations of high-amplitude variability in young stellar objects (YSOs) due to large changes in the accretion rate provide direct observational evidence for episodic accretion. However, there are still uncertainties in the frequency of these events and if episodic accretion is universal among YSOs. To determine the frequency of outbursts in Class I YSOs, we built a large and robust sample of objects at this evolutionary stage, and searched for high-amplitude near-infrared ($\Delta K_{\rm S}>2$~mag) variability in the VIRAC2 database of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey. By complementing with near-IR (2MASS and DENIS) and mid-IR (WISE/Neo-WISE) data, we find that from $\sim$ 7000 Class I YSOs, 97 objects can be classified as eruptive variable YSOs. The duration of the outbursts vary from a few months to longer than 9 years, and cover a similar range of amplitudes. Values of $\Delta K_{\rm S}>5$~mag, however, are only observed in outbursts with duration longer than 9 years. When considering different effects of completeness and contamination we estimate that the incidence of episodic accretion in Class I YSOs is between 2\% and 3\%. Finally, we determine a recurrence timescale of long-term outbursts (a.k.a FUors) of $\tau=1.75^{+1.12}_{-0.87}$~kyr. The latter value agrees with previous estimates and is in line with the expectations of higher frequency of FUor outbursts during younger stages of evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST spectral and photometric observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2022acko at ~50 days past explosion. These data are the first JWST spectral observations of a core-collapse SN. We identify ~30 different H I features, other features associated with products produced from the CNO cycle, and s-process elements such as Sc II and Ba II. By combining the JWST spectra with ground-based optical and NIR spectra, we construct a full Spectral Energy Distribution from 0.4 to 25 microns and find that the JWST spectra are fully consistent with the simultaneous JWST photometry. The data lack signatures of CO formation and we estimate a limit on the CO mass of < 10^{-8} solar mass. We demonstrate how the CO fundamental band limits can be used to probe underlying physics during stellar evolution, explosion, and the environment. The observations indicate little mixing between the H envelope and C/O core in the ejecta and show no evidence of dust. The data presented here set a critical baseline for future JWST observations, where possible molecular and dust formation may be seen.
#### Discourse on infrared colours and bolometric corrections of SiO masing  stars in the inner Milky Way

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14509
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14509
 - **Abstract**
 A sample of SiO-masing late-type stars located in the inner Galaxy is analyzed with the goal of better constraining their obscuration. This reference sample allows us to define mathematical relations between their dereddened infrared colours and the observed colours (e.g. \Ks-[8], \Ks-[24]). The derived equations define a property (a locus) of these late-type stars. Therefore, they enable us to derive the interstellar extinction. With estimated spectral types, it is possible to decompose the total extinction in the two components (interstellar and envelope extinction). These relations are very useful to classify extremely obscured late-type stars located in the inner Galaxy. Estimating the two extinction components is performable on an individual late-type star, independently of its surrounding, and also when a few mid-infrared measurements are available.
#### Diffuse Light in Milky-Way like Haloes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the diffuse light (DL) content of dark matter haloes in the mass range $11.5\leq \log M_{halo}\leq13$, a range that includes also the dark matter halo of the Milky-Way, taking advantage of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model run on the merger trees extracted from a set of high-resolution cosmological simulations. The fraction of DL in such relatively small haloes is found to progressively decrease from the high to the low mass end, in good agreement with analytic (\citealt{purcell2007}) and numerical results from simulations (\citealt{proctor2023,ahvazi2023}), in good agreement also with the fraction of the DL observed in the Milky-Way (\citealt{deason2019}) and M31 (\citealt{harmsen2017}). Haloes with different masses have a different efficiency in producing DL: $\log M_{halo} \simeq 13$ is found to be the characteristic halo mass where the production of DL is the most efficient, while the overall efficiency decreases at both larger (\citealt{contini2024}) and smaller scales (this work). The DL content in this range of halo mass is the result of stellar stripping due to tidal interaction between satellites and its host (95\%) and mergers between satellites and the central galaxy (5\%), with pre-processed material, sub-channel of mergers and stripping and so already included in the 100\%, that contributes no more than 8\% on average. The halo concentration is the main driver of the DL formation: more concentrated haloes have higher DL fractions that come from stripping of more massive satellites in the high halo mass end, while dwarfs contribute mostly in the low halo mass end.
#### On the Scarcity of Dense Cores ($n>10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) in High Latitude  Planck Galactic Cold Clumps

 - **Abstract**
 High-latitude ($|b|>30^{\circ}$) molecular clouds have virial parameters that exceed 1, but whether these clouds can form stars has not been studied systematically. Using JCMT SCUBA-2 archival data, we surveyed 70 fields that target high-latitude Planck galactic cold clumps (HLPCs) to find dense cores with density of $10^{5}$-$10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ and size of $<0.1$ pc. The sample benefits from both the representativeness of the parent sample and covering densest clumps at the high column density end ($>1\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$). At an average noise rms of 15 mJy/beam, we detected Galactic dense cores in only one field, G6.04+36.77 (L183), while also identifying 12 extragalactic objects and two young stellar objects. Compared to the low-latitude clumps, dense cores are scarce in HLPCs. With synthetic observations, the densities of cores are constrained to be $n_c\lesssim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, should they exist in HLPCs. Low-latitude clumps, Taurus clumps, and HLPCs form a sequence where a higher virial parameter corresponds to a lower dense core detection rate. If HLPCs were affected by the Local Bubble, the scarcity should favor turbulence-inhibited rather than supernova-driven star formation. Studies of the formation mechanism of the L183 molecular cloud are warranted.
#### Variable white dwarfs in TMTS: Asteroseismological analysis of a ZZ Ceti  star, TMTS J17184064+2524314

 - **Abstract**
 The Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS) has been constantly monitoring the northern sky since 2020 in search of rapidly variable stars. To find variable white dwarfs (WDs), the TMTS catalog is cross-matched with the WD catalog of Gaia EDR3, resulting in over 3000 light curves of WD candidates. The WD TMTS J17184064+2524314 (hereafter J1718) is the second ZZ~Ceti star discovered among these common sources. Based on the light curves from TMTS, follow-up photometric observations, and TESS, 10 periods and 3 combination periods are detected. A rotation period of $25.12\pm0.18$ hr is derived, according to the identified rotational splitting. Our spectroscopic observation indicates that this WD belongs to DA type with $T_{\rm eff}=11,670\pm604$ K, log $g=8.16\pm0.36$, $M = 0.70\pm0.23$ M$_{\odot}$, and age=$0.51\pm0.34$ Gyr. Based on core-parameterized asteroseismological model grids ($\geqslant$ 14 million), we derive a best-fit solution of $T_{\rm eff}=11,640\pm20$ K, log $g=8.267\pm0.008$, and $M = 0.750\pm0.005$ M$_{\odot}$ for J1718, consistent with the spectral fitting results. For this WD, the corresponding carbon and oxygen abundances in the core are 0.43 and 0.57, respectively. The distance derived from the intrinsic luminosity given by asteroseismology is $64\pm15$ pc, in accord with the distance of $70.1\pm0.2$ pc from Gaia DR3 within the uncertainties.
#### Bifurcation mechanism of quasihalo orbit from Lissajous orbit in the  restricted three-body problem

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a general analytical method to describe the center manifolds of collinear libration points in the Restricted Three-body Problem (RTBP). It is well-known that these center manifolds include Lissajous orbits, halo orbits, and quasihalo orbits. Previous studies have traditionally tackled these orbits separately by iteratively constructing high-order series solutions using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Instead of relying on resonance between their frequencies, this study identifies that halo and quasihalo orbits arise due to intricate coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane motions. To characterize this coupling effect, a novel concept, coupling coefficient $\eta$, is introduced in the RTBP, incorporating the coupling term $\eta \Delta x$ in the $z$-direction dynamics equation, where $\Delta$ represents a formal power series concerning the amplitudes. Subsequently, a uniform series solution for these orbits is constructed up to a specified order using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. For any given paired in-plane and out-of-plane amplitudes, the coupling coefficient $\eta$ is determined by the bifurcation equation $\Delta = 0$. When $\eta$ = 0, the proposed solution describes Lissajous orbits around libration points. As $\eta$ transitions from zero to non-zero values, the solution describes quasihalo orbits, which bifurcate from Lissajous orbits. Particularly, halo orbits bifurcate from planar Lyapunov orbits if the out-of-plane amplitude is zero. The proposed method provides a unified framework for understanding these intricate orbital behaviors in the RTBP.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are ubiquitous in our galaxy, and the rate at which they host stellar companions, and the properties of these companions, provides a window into the formation and evolution of the star(s), and of any planets that they may host. The Pervasive Overview of 'Kompanions' of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) speckle survey of nearby M dwarfs is volume-limited from M0V through M9V out to 15 pc, with additional targets at larger distances. In total, 1125 stars were observed, and 455 of these are within the volume-limited, 15-pc sample of M-dwarf primaries. When we combine the speckle observations with known companions from the literature, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of M dwarfs within 15 pc is 23.7% plus or minus 2.0%, and that the companion rate is 29.0% plus or minus 2.1%. We also find that the projected separation distribution for multiples that are known to host planets peaks at 198 au, while the distribution for multiples that are not yet known to host planets peaks at 5.57 au. This result suggests that the presence of close-in stellar companions inhibits the formation of M-dwarf planetary systems, similar to what has been found for FGK stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot rocky super-Earths are thought to be sufficiently irradiated by their host star to melt their surface and thus allow for long-lasting magma oceans. Some processes have been proposed for such planets to have retained primordial hydrogen captured during their formation while moving inward in the planetary system. The new generation of space telescopes such as the JWST may provide observations precise enough to characterize the atmospheres and perhaps the interiors of such exoplanets. We use a vaporization model that calculates the gas-liquid equilibrium between the atmosphere (including hydrogen) and the magma ocean, to compute the elemental composition of a variety of atmospheres for different quantities of hydrogen. The elemental composition is then used in a steady-state atmospheric model to compute the atmospheric structure and generate synthetic emission spectra. With this method, we confirm previous results showing that silicate atmospheres exhibit a thermal inversion, with notably an emission peak of SiO at 9~$\mu m$. We compare our method to the literature on the inclusion of hydrogen in the atmosphere, and show hydrogen reduces the thermal inversion, because of the formation of H2O which has a strong greenhouse potential. However planets that are significantly irradiated by their host star are sufficiently hot to dissociate H2O and thus also maintain a thermal inversion. The observational implications are twofold: 1) H2O is more likely to be detected in colder atmospheres; 2) Detecting a thermal inversion in hotter atmospheres does not a priori exclude the presence of H (in its atomic form). Due to the impact of H on the overall chemistry and atmospheric structure, and therefore observations, we emphasize the importance of including volatiles in the calculation of the gas-liquid equilibrium. Finally, we provide a criterion to determine potential targets for observation.

 Starting from the Hamiltonian representation of the dynamics in \cite{rosengren2015chaos,colombo2019long}, this work proposes an innovative procedure to design fully-analytical maneuvers for post-mission disposal of HEOs satellites, exploiting the third-body perturbations. The Hamiltonian representation has been selected to include the external perturbing effects and to obtain a phase space representation. Notably, the orbit evolution can be described through the variation of double-averaged orbital elements over the orbital periods of the spacecraft and the perturbing bodies around the central planet. this work conveys a two-dimensional Hamiltonian representation under the third-body perturbations and the central planet's oblateness. The effect of solar radiation pressure has been neglected in this analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 W50 is a radio nebula around hyper-accreting Galactic microquasar SS433. In this letter, we focus on one peculiar feature of W50 - a pair of so-called "extended X-ray jets" (EXJs). These "jets" have a size of $\sim20\, {\rm pc}$, a sharp inner boundary, and their spectra are well represented by a featureless X-ray continuum. We argue that EXJ could be an outcome of a powerful {\it anisotropic} wind produced by a super-critical accretion disk. The wind itself consists of two components. The first component is a nearly isotropic outflow that subtends most of the solid angle as seen from the compact source. The second component is a more collimated wind aligned with the binary system rotation axis (polar wind). The termination shock of the former component recollimates the latter, giving it an appearance of an extended X-ray structure. In this model, the EXJ continuum spectrum is due to synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in the recollimated polar wind. At variance with many other studies, in this model, the EXJ structures are not directly related to the highly collimated $0.26\;\!c$ baryonic jets. Instead, the EXJ and the W50's ears are produced by the part of the wind with an Eddington level kinetic luminosity confined to a half opening angle of $\sim 10$ degrees, which is not necessarily a recollimated version of the jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers are one of the most straightforward mechanisms to produce BHs inside and above the pair-instability mass gap. Here, we investigate the impact of globular cluster (GC) evolution on hierarchical mergers, and we account for the uncertainties related to BH mass pairing functions on the predicted primary BH mass, mass ratio and spin distribution. We find that the evolution of the host GC quenches the hierarchical BH assembly already at the third generation, mainly due to cluster expansion powered by a central BH sub-system. Hierarchical mergers match the primary BH mass distribution from GW events for $m_1 > 50 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, regardless of the assumed BH pairing function. At lower masses, however, different pairing functions lead to dramatically different predictions on the primary BH mass merger rate density. We find that the primary BH mass distribution evolves with redshift, with a larger contribution from mergers with $m_1 \geq 30 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ for $z\geq{}1$. Finally, we calculate the mixing fraction of BBHs from GCs and isolated binary systems. Our predictions are very sensitive to the spins, which favor a large fraction ($>0.6$) of BBHs born in GCs, in order to reproduce misaligned spin observations.
#### Why dust pressure matters in debris discs

 - **Abstract**
 There is a common assumption in the particulate disc community that the pressure in particulate discs is essentially zero and that the disc streamlines follow Keplerian orbits, in the absence of self-gravity or external perturbations. It is also often assumed that the fluid description of particulate discs is not valid in the presence of crossing orbits (e.g. from nonzero free eccentricities). These stem from the misconception that fluid pressure arises due to the (typically rare) collisions between particles and that the velocity of particles in fluids are single-valued in space. In reality, pressure is a statistical property of the particle distribution function which arises precisely because there is a distribution of velocities at a given position. In this letter we demonstrate, with simple examples, that pressure in particulate discs is non-zero and is related to the inclination and free eccentricity distributions of the constituent particles in the discs. This means many common models of debris discs implicitly assume a nonzero, and potentially quite significant, dust pressure. We shall also demonstrate that the bulk motion of the dust is not the same as the particle motion and that the presence of pressure gradients can lead to strong departures from Keplerian motion.

 - **Abstract**
 Some post-common-envelope binaries are binary stars with short periods that exhibit significant period variations over long observational time spans. These eclipse timing variations (ETVs) are most likely to be accounted for by the presence of an unseen massive companion, potentially of planetary or substellar nature, and the light-travel time (LTT) effect. In this study, our main objective is to describe the diversity of compatible nontransit companions around PCEBs and explore the robustness of the solutions by employing tools for uncertainty estimation. We select the controversial data of the QS Vir binary star, which previous studies have suggested hosts a planet. We employ a minimizing strategy, using genetic algorithms to explore the global parameter space followed by refinement of the solution using the simplex method. We evaluate errors through the classical MCMC approach and discuss the error range for parameters. Our results highlight the strong dependence of ETV models for close binaries on the dataset used, which leads to relatively loose constraints on the parameters of the unseen companion. We find that the shape of the $O-C$ curve is influenced by the dataset employed. We propose an alternative method to evaluate errors on the orbital fits based on a grid search surrounding the best-fit values, obtaining a wider range of plausible solutions that are compatible with goodness-of-fit statistics. We also analyze how the parameter solutions are affected by the choice of the dataset, and find that this system continuously changes the compatible solutions as new data are obtained from eclipses. The best-fit parameters for QS Vir correspond to a low-mass stellar companion (57.71 $M_{jup}$ ranging from 40 to 64 $M_{jup}$) on an eccentric orbit ($e=0.91^{+0.07}_{-0.17}$) with a variety of potential periods ($P = 16.69 ^{+0.47}_{-0.42}$ yr.)

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The modelling of chemical transport mechanisms is crucial for accurate stellar characterizations. Atomic diffusion is one of these processes and it is commonly included in stellar models. However, it is usually neglected for F-type or more massive stars because it produces surface abundance variations that are unrealistic. Additional mechanisms to counteract atomic diffusion must therefore be considered. It has been demonstrated that turbulent mixing can prevent the surface abundance over-variations, and can also be calibrated to mimic the effects of radiative accelerations on iron. Aims. We aim to evaluate the effect of a calibrated turbulent mixing on the characterisation of a sample of F-type stars, and how the estimates compare with those obtained when the chemical transport mechanisms are neglected. Methods. We selected stars from two samples - one from the Kepler LEGACY sample and the other from a sample of Kepler planet-hosting stars. We inferred their stellar properties using two grids. The first grid considers atomic diffusion only in models that do not show chemical over-variations at the stellar surface. The second grid includes atomic diffusion in all the stellar models and the calibrated turbulent mixing to avoid unrealistic surface abundances. Results. Comparing the derived results from the two grids, we found that the results for the more massive stars in our sample will have higher dispersion in the inferred values of mass, radius and age, due to the absence of atomic diffusion in one of the grids. This can lead to relative uncertainties for individual stars of up to 5% for masses, 2% for radii and 20% for ages. Conclusions. This work shows that a proper modelling of the microscopic transport processes is key for an accurate estimation of their fundamental properties not only for G-type stars, but also for F-type stars.
#### Modeling the wavelength dependence of photo-response non-uniformity of a  CCD sensor

 - **Abstract**
 Precision measurements of astrometry and photometry require stringent control of systematics such as those arising from imperfect correction of sensor effects. In this work, we develop a parametric method to model the wavelength dependence of photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) for a laser annealed backside-illuminated charge-coupled device. The model accurately reproduces the PRNU patterns of flat-field images taken at nine wavelengths from 290nm to 950nm, leaving the root mean square (RMS) residuals no more than 0.2% in most cases. By removing the large-scale non-uniformity in the flat fields, the RMS residuals are further reduced. This model fitting approach gives more accurate predictions of the PRNU than cubic-spline interpolation does with fewer free parameters. It can be applied to make PRNU corrections for individual objects according to their spectral energy distribution to reduce photometry errors.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still unclear, and the time-resolved spectral analysis of GRBs is a powerful tool for studying their underlying physical processes. We performed a detailed time-resolved spectral analysis of 78 bright long GRB samples detected by Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). A total of 1490 spectra were obtained and their properties were studied using a typical Band-shape model. Firstly, the parameter distribution of the time-resolved spectrum given as follows: the low-energy spectral index $\alpha \sim -0.72$, high-energy spectral index $\beta \sim -2.42$, the peak energy $E_{\rm p} \sim 221.69 \,\rm{keV}$, and the energy flux $F \sim 7.49\times 10^{-6} \rm{\, erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. More than 80\% of the bursts exhibit the hardest low-energy spectral index $\alpha_{\rm max}$ exceeding the synchrotron limit (-2/3). Secondly, the evolution patterns of $\alpha$ and $E_{\rm p}$ were statistically analyzed. The results show that for multi-pulse GRBs the intensity-tracking pattern is more common than the hard-to-soft pattern in the evolution of both $E_{\rm p}$ and $\alpha$. The hard-to-soft pattern is generally shown in single-pulse GRBs or in the initial pulse of multi-pulse GRBs. Finally, we found a significant positive correlation between $F$ and $E_{\rm p}$, with half of the samples exhibiting a positive correlation between $F$ and $\alpha$. We discussed the spectral evolution of different radiation models. The diversity of spectral evolution patterns indicates that there may be more than one radiation mechanism occurring in the gamma-ray burst radiation process, including photospheric radiation and synchrotron radiation. However, it may also involve only one radiation mechanism, but more complicated physical details need to be considered.

 The highly sensitive millimeter-wave telescope is an important tool for accurate measurement of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, and its core component is a detector array located in a cryogenic focal plane. The feasibility of utilizing thermal kinetic inductance detectors (TKIDs) for CMB observations has been demonstrated. We propose a pixel design of TKIDs for observing CMB through atmospheric windows for observations in the 90/150 GHz bands. Assuming lossless dielectric, the coupling efficiency of a single pixel is around 90%. This pixel design will be utilized for future large-scale TKIDs array designs for CMB observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence of late-time interaction between the ejecta of the hydrogen-poor Type Ib supernova (SN) 2019yvr and hydrogen-rich circumstellar material (CSM), similar to the Type Ib SN 2014C. A narrow H{\alpha} emission line appears simultaneously with a break in the light-curve decline rate at around 80-100 d after explosion. From the interaction delay and the ejecta velocity, under the assumption that the CSM is detached from the progenitor, we estimate the CSM inner radius to be located at ~6.5-9.1 {\times} 10^{15} cm. The H{\alpha} emission line persists throughout the nebular phase at least up to +420 d post-explosion, with a full width at half maximum of ~2000 km/s. Assuming a steady mass-loss, the estimated mass-loss rate from the luminosity of the H{\alpha} line is ~3-7 {\times} 10^{-5} M_\odot yr^{-1}. From hydrodynamical modelling and analysis of the nebular spectra, we find a progenitor He-core mass of 3-4 M{_\odot}, which would imply an initial mass of 13-15 M{_\odot}. Our result supports the case of a relatively low-mass progenitor possibly in a binary system as opposed to a higher mass single star undergoing a luminous blue variable phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the state of the light element abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis in early 2024 with particular focus on the derived baryon abundance. We find that the largest differences between the final baryon abundances are typically driven by the assumed Deuterium burning rates, characterized in this work by the underlying code. The rates from theoretical ab-initio calculations favor smaller baryon abundances, while experimentally-determined rates prefer higher abundances. Through robust marginalization over a wide range of nuclear rates, the recently released $\mathtt{PRyMordial}$ code allows for a conservative estimate of the baryon abundance at $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.02218 \pm 0.00055$ (using PDG-recommended light element abundances) in $\Lambda$CDM and $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.02196 \pm 0.00063$ when additional ultra-relativistic relics are considered ($\Lambda$CDM + $N_\mathrm{eff}$). These additional relics themselves are constrained to $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff} = -0.10 \pm 0.21$ by light element abundances alone.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained from detailed X-ray timing and spectral studies of X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its giant and normal X-ray outbursts between 2017 and 2023 observed by the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We focused on the timing analysis of the normal outbursts. A distinct break is found in the power density spectra of the source. The corresponding break frequency and slope of power-laws around the break vary with luminosity, indicating the change in accretion dynamics with mass accretion rate. Interestingly, we detected quasi-periodic oscillations within a specific luminosity range, providing further insights into the underlying physical processes. We also studied the neutron star spin period evolution and a luminosity variation in pulse profile during the recent 2023 outburst. The spectral analysis was conducted comprehensively for the giant and all other normal outbursts. We identified a double transition at luminosities of $\approx$7.5$\times$10$^{37}$ and 2.1$\times$10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the evolution of continuum parameters like photon index and cutoff energy with luminosity. This indicates three distinct accretion modes experienced by the source mainly during the giant X-ray outburst. A soft blackbody component with a temperature of 0.08-0.7 keV is also detected in spectra. The observed temperature undergoes a discontinuous transition when the pulsar evolves from a sub- to super-Eddington state. Notably, in addition to an evolving 6-7 keV iron line complex, a 1 keV emission line was observed during the super-Eddington state of the source, implying the X-ray reflection from the accretion disc or outflow material.

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting the non-Gaussian information of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) is vital in unlocking the full potential of the rich datasets from the upcoming stage-IV galaxy surveys. Galaxy skew spectra serve as efficient beyond-two-point statistics, encapsulating essential bispectrum information with computational efficiency akin to power spectrum analysis. This paper presents the first cosmological constraints from analyzing the full set of redshift-space galaxy skew spectra of the data from the SDSS-III BOSS, accessing cosmological information down to nonlinear scales. Employing the ${\rm S{\scriptsize IM}BIG}$ forward modeling framework and simulation-based inference via normalizing flows, we analyze the CMASS-SGC sub-sample, which constitute approximately 10\% of the full BOSS data. Analyzing the scales up to $k_{\rm max}=0.5 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$, we find that the skew spectra improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}, \Omega_{\rm b}, h$, and $n_s$ by 34\%, 35\%, 18\%, 10\%, respectively, compared to constraints from previous ${\rm S{\scriptsize IM}BIG}$ power spectrum multipoles analysis, yielding $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.288^{+0.024}_{-0.034}$, $\Omega_{\rm b}= 0.043^{+0.005}_{-0.007}$, $h=0.759^{+0.104}_{-0.050}$, $n_{\rm s} = 0.918^{+0.041}_{-0.090}$ (at 68\% confidence limit). On the other hand, the constraints on $\sigma_8$ are weaker than from the power spectrum. Including the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prior on baryon density reduces the uncertainty on the Hubble parameter further, achieving $h=0.750^{+0.034}_{-0.032}$, which is a 38\% improvement over the constraint from the power spectrum with the same prior. Compared to the ${\rm S{\scriptsize IM}BIG}$ bispectrum (monopole) analysis, skew spectra offer comparable constraints on larger scales ($k_{\rm max}<0.3\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$) for most parameters except for $\sigma_8$.
