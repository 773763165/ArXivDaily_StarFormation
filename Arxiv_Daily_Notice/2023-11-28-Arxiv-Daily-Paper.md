 - **Abstract**
 This work is devoted to studying the influence of the bar on the orbital dynamics of globular clusters. The orbits of 45 globular clusters in the central galactic region with a radius of 3.5 kpc were analyzed using spectral dynamics methods in order to identify objects captured by the bar. To form the 6D phase space required for orbit integration, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3), as well as new refined average distances to globular clusters, were used. Since the parameters of the Milky Way bar are known with very great uncertainty, the orbits were constructed and their frequency analysis was carried out with varying the mass, length and angular velocity of rotation of the bar in a wide range of values with a fairly small step. The integration of orbits was carried out at 2.5 billion years ago. As a result, bar-supporting globular clusters were identified for each set of bar parameters. For the first time, an analytical expression has been obtained for the dependence of the dominant frequency $f_X$ on the angular velocity of rotation of the bar. In addition, the probabilities of capturing globular clusters by the bar were determined when the bar parameters were varied in certain ranges of values according to a random distribution law. A list of 14 globular clusters with the most significant capture probabilities is given, with five GCs - NGC6266, NGC6569, Terzan 5, NGC6522, NGC6540 - showing the probability capture by bar $\geq 0.2$. A conclusion is made about the regularity of the orbits of globular clusters based on the calculation of approximations of the maximum characteristic Lyapunov exponents.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the nature of CXOU J005440.5-374320 (J0054), a peculiar bright ($\sim$$4\times10^{39}$ erg/s) and soft X-ray transient in the spiral galaxy NGC 300 with a 6-hour periodic flux modulation that was detected in a 2014 Chandra observation. Subsequent observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton, as well as a large observational campaign of NGC 300 and its sources performed with the Swift Neil Gehrels Observatory, showed that this source exhibits recurrent flaring activity: four other outbursts were detected across $\sim$8 years of monitoring. Using data from the Swift/UVOT archive and from the XMM-Newton/OM and Gaia catalogues, we noted the source is likely associated with a bright blue optical/ultraviolet counterpart. This prompted us to perform follow-up observations with the Southern African Large Telescope in December 2019. With the multi-wavelength information at hand, we discuss several possibilities for the nature of J0054. Although none is able to account for the full range of the observed peculiar features, we found that the two most promising scenarios are a stellar-mass compact object in a binary system with a Wolf$-$Rayet star companion, or the recurrent tidal stripping of a stellar object trapped in a system with an intermediate-mass ($\sim1000$ $M_\odot$) black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 The Initial-Final Mass-Relation (IFMR) maps the masses of main sequence stars to their white dwarf descendants. The most common approach to measure the IFMR has been to use white dwarfs in clusters. However, it has been shown that wide double white dwarfs can also be used to measure the IFMR using a Bayesian approach. We have observed a large sample of 90 Gaia double white dwarfs using FORS2 on the VLT. Considering 52 DA+DA, DA+DC, and DC+DC pairs, we applied our extended Bayesian framework to probe the IFMR in exquisite detail. Our monotonic IFMR is well constrained by our observations for initial masses of 1-5 Msun, with the range 1-4 Msun mostly constrained to a precision of 0.03 Msun or better. We add an important extension to the framework, using a Bayesian mixture-model to determine the IFMR robustly in the presence of systems departing from single star evolution. We find a large but uncertain outlier fraction of 59$\pm$21 percent, with outlier systems requiring an additional $0.70^{+0.40}_{-0.22}$ Gyr uncertainty in their cooling age differences. However, we find that this fraction is dominated by a few systems with massive components near 0.9 Msun, where we are most sensitive to outliers, but are also able to establish four systems as merger candidates
#### JWST and ALMA discern the assembly of structural and obscured components  in a high-redshift starburst galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations and analysis of the starburst, PACS-819, at z=1.45 ($M_*=10^{10.7}$ M$_{ \odot}$), using high-resolution ($0^{\prime \prime}.1$; 0.8 kpc) ALMA and multi-wavelength JWST images from the COSMOS-Web program. Dissimilar to HST/ACS images in the rest-frame UV, the redder NIRCam and MIRI images reveal a smooth central mass concentration and spiral-like features, atypical for such an intense starburst. Through dynamical modeling of the CO J=5--4 emission with ALMA, PACS-819 is rotation-dominated thus has a disk-like nature. However, kinematic anomalies in CO and asymmetric features in the bluer JWST bands (e.g., F150W) support a more disturbed nature likely due to interactions. The JWST imaging further enables us to map the distribution of stellar mass and dust attenuation, thus clarifying the relationships between different structural components, not discernable in the previous HST images. The CO J = 5 -- 4 and FIR dust continuum emission are co-spatial with a heavily-obscured starbursting core (<1 kpc) which is partially surrounded by much less obscured star-forming structures including a prominent arc, possibly a tidally-distorted dwarf galaxy, and a clump, either a sign of an ongoing violent disk instability or a recently accreted low-mass satellite. With spatially-resolved maps, we find a high molecular gas fraction in the central area reaching $\sim3$ ($M_{\text{gas}}$/$M_*$) and short depletion times ($M_{\text{gas}}/SFR\sim$ 120 Myrs) across the entire system. These observations provide insights into the complex nature of starbursts in the distant universe and underscore the wealth of complementary information from high-resolution observations with both ALMA and JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Nova eruptions occur in cataclysmic variables when enough material has been accreted onto the surface of the white dwarf primary. As a consequence, the material that has been accumulated until then is expelled into the interstellar medium, forming an expanding nova shell around the system. Understanding the physical process that shapes the morphology of nova shells is essential to fully comprehend how the ejection mechanism operates during nova eruptions. Because of its closeness and age, the nova shell around the classical nova RR Pic (Nova Pic 1925) is an ideal target for studying the evolving morphology of nova shells. In this work, we present an IFS study of the RR Pic nova shell, with a particular emphasis on the extraction of the 3D morphology of the shell. The nova shell was observed by the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument placed at the ESO-VLT. The MUSE datacube confirms the presence of the nova shell in H$\rm\alpha$, H$\rm\beta$ and [OIII], and very faintly in [NII]. A comparison with previous observations suggests that the shell continues in its free-expansion phase but with the different parts of the shell apparently expanding at different rates. The data analysis corroborates the previous vision that the shell is composed of an equatorial ring and polar filaments. At the same time, the new data also reveal that [OIII] is confined in gaps located in the tropical regions of the shell where no Hydrogen is observed. The flux measurements indicate that ~99% of the shell flux is confined to the equatorial ring, while the polar filaments show a flux asymmetry between the NE and SW filaments. We have estimated the mass of the shell to be ~5x10$^{-5}$M$_\odot$. From the analysis of the 3D-extracted data, we determine that the ring structure extends ~8,000 au from the central binary, and has a position angle of ~155 deg and an inclination of ~74 deg.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT Collaboration is building an underwater neutrino observatory at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea consisting of two neutrino telescopes, both composed of a three-dimensional array of light detectors, known as digital optical modules. Each digital optical module contains a set of 31 three inch photomultiplier tubes distributed over the surface of a 0.44 m diameter pressure-resistant glass sphere. The module includes also calibration instruments and electronics for power, readout and data acquisition. The power board was developed to supply power to all the elements of the digital optical module. The design of the power board began in 2013, and several prototypes were produced and tested. After an exhaustive validation process in various laboratories within the KM3NeT Collaboration, a mass production batch began, resulting in the construction of over 1200 power boards so far. These boards were integrated in the digital optical modules that have already been produced and deployed, 828 until October 2023. In 2017, an upgrade of the power board, to increase reliability and efficiency, was initiated. After the validation of a pre-production series, a production batch of 800 upgraded boards is currently underway. This paper describes the design, architecture, upgrade, validation, and production of the power board, including the reliability studies and tests conducted to ensure the safe operation at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea throughout the observatory's lifespan

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a young, highly scattered pulsar in a search for highly circularly polarized radio sources as part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) survey. In follow-up observations with Murriyang/Parkes, we identified PSR J1032-5804 and measured a period of 78.7 ms, dispersion measure (DM) of 819$\pm$4 pc cm$^{-3}$, rotation measure of -2000$\pm$1 rad m$^{-2}$, and a characteristic age of 34.6 kyr. We found a pulse scattering timescale at 3 GHz of ~22 ms, implying a timescale at 1 GHz of ~3845 ms, which is the third most scattered pulsar known and explains its non-detection in previous pulsar surveys. We discuss the identification of a possible pulsar wind nebula and supernova remnant in the pulsar's local environment by analyzing the pulsar spectral energy distribution and the surrounding extended emission from multiwavelength images. Our result highlights the possibility of identifying extremely scattered pulsars from radio continuum images. Ongoing and future large-scale radio continuum surveys will offer us an unprecedented opportunity to find more extreme pulsars (e.g., highly scattered, highly intermittent, highly accelerated), which will enhance our understanding of the characteristics of pulsars and the interstellar medium.
#### The Cosmic Dipole in the Quaia Sample of Quasars: A Bayesian Analysis

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14938
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14938
 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian analysis of the Quaia sample of 1.3 million quasars as a test of the cosmological principle. This principle postulates that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, forming the basis of prevailing cosmological models. However, recent analyses of quasar samples have found a matter dipole inconsistent with the inferred kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), representing a tension with the expectations of the cosmological principle. Here, we explore various hypotheses for the distribution of quasars in Quaia, finding that the sample is influenced by selection effects with significant contamination near the galactic plane. After excising these regions, we find significant evidence that the Quaia quasar dipole is consistent with the CMB dipole, both in terms of the expected amplitude and direction. This result is in conflict with recent analyses, lending support to the cosmological principle and the interpretation that the observed dipole is due to our local departure from the Hubble flow.

 - **Abstract**
 The Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) has enabled a renaissance of the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) as a standard candle. In the case of NGC 300, we learned that the precise spectrophotometry of MUSE was crucial to obtain an accurate PNLF distance. We present the advantage of the integral field spectrograph compared to the slit spectrograph in delivering precise spectrophotometry by simulating a slit observation on integral field spectroscopy data. We also discuss the possible systematic shift in measuring the PNLF distance using the least-square method, especially when the PNLF cutoff is affected by small number statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 Mini-EUSO is a wide-angle fluorescence telescope that registers ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the nocturnal atmosphere of Earth from the International Space Station. Meteors are among multiple phenomena that manifest themselves not only in the visible range but also in the UV. We present two simple artificial neural networks that allow for recognizing meteor signals in the Mini-EUSO data with high accuracy in terms of a binary classification problem. We expect that similar architectures can be effectively used for signal recognition in other fluorescence telescopes, regardless of the nature of the signal. Due to their simplicity, the networks can be implemented in onboard electronics of future orbital or balloon experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Craters formed by the impact of agglomerated materials are commonly observed in nature, such as asteroids colliding with planets and moons. In this paper, we investigate how the projectile spin and cohesion lead to different crater shapes. For that, we carried out DEM (discrete element method) computations of spinning granular projectiles impacting onto cohesionless grains, for different bonding stresses, initial spins and initial heights. We found that, as the bonding stresses decrease and the initial spin increases, the projectile's grains spread farther from the collision point, and, in consequence, the crater shape becomes flatter, with peaks around the rim and in the center of craters. Our results shed light on the dispersion of the projectile's material and the different shapes of craters found on Earth and other planetary environments.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we develop a high-precision satellite orbit determination model for satellites orbiting the Earth. Solving this model entails numerically integrating the differential equation of motion governing a two-body system, employing Fehlberg's formulation and the Runge-Kutta class of embedded integrators with adaptive stepsize control. Relevant primary perturbing forces included in this mathematical model are the full force gravitational field model, Earth's atmospheric drag, third body gravitational effects and solar radiation pressure. Development of the high-precision model required accounting for the perturbing influences of Earth radiation pressure, Earth tides and relativistic effects. The model is then implemented to obtain a high-fidelity Earth orbiting satellite propagator, namely the Satellite Ephemeris Determiner (SED), which is comparable to the popular High Precision Orbit Propagator (HPOP). The architecture of SED, the methodology employed, and the numerical results obtained are presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We have recently proposed that supercritical colliding wind binaries (SCWBs) are suitable scenarios for particle acceleration and nonthermal radiation. In these X-ray binary systems (XRBs), the wind from the companion star collides with the wind ejected from the super-Eddington accretion disk of the stellar black hole. Strong shocks are generated in this collision, leading to the acceleration of particles and subsequent broadband emission through different nonthermal radiative processes. In particular, we estimate luminosities of the order of $L\approx 10^{34}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the radio band. One of the major components in these processes is the power provided by the super wind expelled from the disk. Furthermore, some properties of the wind photosphere, such as its geometry or its temperature distribution, also contribute to the absorption and reprocessing of the nonthermal radiation. In this work, we perform a more detailed description of the powerful wind launched from the accretion disk, in order to obtain a better understanding of the above-mentioned processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Our work highlights the crucial role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the context of single field inflation with Multiple Sharp Transitions (MSTs) to untangle the current state of the PBH overproduction issue. We examine the situation for a broad interval of EoS parameter that remains most favourable to explain the recent data released by the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration. Our analysis yields the interval, $0.2 \leq w \leq 1/3$, to be the most acceptable window from the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal and where sizeable PBHs abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$, is observed. We also obtain $w=1/3$, radiation-dominated era, to be the best scenario to explain the early stages of the Universe and address the overproduction problem. Within the range of $1 \leq c_{s} \leq 1.17$, we construct a regularized-renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum whose amplitude obeys the perturbativity criterion while being substantial enough to generate EoS dependent scalar induced gravitational waves ($w$-SIGWs) consistent with NANOGrav-15 data. Working for both $c_{s} = 1\;{\rm and}\;1.17$, we find the $c_{s}=1.17$ case more favourable for generating large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, as potential dark matter candidates with substantial abundance after constraints coming from microlensing experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Firmamento (https://firmamento.hosting.nyu.edu) is a new-concept web-based and mobile-friendly data analysis tool dedicated to multi-frequency/multi-messenger emitters, as exemplified by blazars. Although initially intended to support a citizen researcher project at New York University-Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), Firmamento has evolved to be a valuable tool for professional researchers due to its broad accessibility to classical and contemporary multi-frequency open data sets. From this perspective Firmamento facilitates the identification of new blazars and other multi-frequency emitters in the localisation uncertainty regions of sources detected by current and planned observatories such as Fermi-LAT, Swift , eROSITA, CTA, ASTRI Mini-Array, LHAASO, IceCube, KM3Net, SWGO, etc. The multi-epoch and multi-wavelength data that Firmamento retrieves from over 90 remote and local catalogues and databases can be used to characterise the spectral energy distribution and the variability properties of cosmic sources as well as to constrain physical models. Firmamento distinguishes itself from other online platforms due to its high specialization, the use of machine learning and other methodologies to characterise the data and for its commitment to inclusivity. From this particular perspective, its objective is to assist both researchers and citizens interested in science, strengthening a trend that is bound to gain momentum in the coming years as data retrieval facilities improve in power and machine learning/artificial intelligence tools become more widely available
#### The nature of very-faint X-ray binaries: Near-infrared spectroscopy of  1RXH J173523.7$-$354013 reveals a giant companion

 - **Abstract**
 Very-faint X-ray binaries (VFXBs) are a sub-class of black holes and neutron stars in binaries that appear to be accreting at a very low rate. In addition to providing interesting constraints on poorly understood forms of accretion, elucidating the nature of VFXBs is particularly interesting for binary evolution and population modeling. Through near-infrared (nIR) spectroscopy, we here investigate the nature of the bursting neutron star and VFXB 1RXH J173523.7$-$354013 (J1735), which persistently accretes at an X-ray luminosity of $L_X \sim 10^{34} - 10^{35}~L_{\odot}$. Our analysis shows that the nIR emission is dominated by that of the companion star, which we find to be a late G or early K-type giant, making this the second neutron star identified as a VFXB found to have a giant companion. We discuss how several of the system properties are difficult to reconcile with a wind-fed symbiotic X-ray binary. We therefore also propose an alternative scenario wherein J1735 is a wide binary system (supported by the discovery of a 7.5 d modulation in the nIR light curves) with a quiescent luminosity of $L_X \sim 10^{34} - 10^{35}~L_{\odot}$, in which the donor star is overflowing its Roche lobe. This raises the possibility that J1735 may, every century or more, exhibit very long and very bright outbursts during which it reaches accretion rates around the Eddington limit like the neutron star Z sources.
#### Mapping a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium  using Fourier transformed HI 21cm emission line spectra: Application to the  DRAO Deep Field from DHIGLS and the HI4PI survey

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new method for spatially mapping a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium by analyzing the amplitude structure of $\hat T_b(k_v)$, the Fourier transform of $T_b(v)$, the spectrum of the brightness temperature of HI 21cm line emission with respect to the radial velocity $v$. This advances a broader effort exploiting 21cm emission line data alone (without absorption line data, $\tau$) to extract integrated properties of the multiphase structure of the HI gas and to map each phase separately. Using toy models, we illustrate the origin of interference patterns seen in $\hat T_b(k_v)$. Building on this, a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction is obtained from the amplitude of $\hat T_b$ at high $k_v$. Tested on a numerical simulation of thermally bi-stable turbulence, the lower limit from this method has a strong linear correlation with the "true" cold gas mass fraction from the simulation for relatively low cold gas mass fraction. At higher mass fraction, our lower limit is lower than the "true" value, because of a combination of interference and opacity effects. Comparison with absorption surveys shows a similar behavior, with a departure from linear correlation at $N_{\rm HI}\gtrsim 3-5\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. Application to the DRAO Deep Field (DF) from DHIGLS reveals a complex network of cold filaments in the Spider, an important structural property of the thermal condensation of the HI gas. Application to the HI4PI survey in the velocity range $-90 < v < 90$ km/s produces a full sky map of a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium at 16'.2 resolution. Our new method has the ability to extract a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction for massive amounts of emission line data alone with low computing time and memory, pointing the way to new approaches suitable for the new generation of radio interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM model, is the most suitable description for our universe. This framework can explain the accelerated expansion phase of the universe but still is not immune to open problems when it comes to the comparison with observations. One of the most critical issues is the so-called Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, namely, the difference of about $5\sigma$ as an average between the value of $H_0$ estimated locally and the cosmological value measured from the Last Scattering Surface. The value of this tension changes from 4 to 6 $\sigma$ according to the data used. The current analysis explores the $H_0$ tension in the \textit{Pantheon} sample (PS) of SNe Ia. Through the division of the PS in 3 and 4 bins, the value of $H_0$ is estimated for each bin and all the values are fitted with a decreasing function of the redshift ($z$). Remarkably, $H_0$ undergoes a slow decreasing evolution with $z$, having an evolutionary coefficient compatible with zero up to $5.8\sigma$. If this trend is not caused by hidden astrophysical biases or $z$-selection effects, then the $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity represent a valid model for explaining such a trend.

 - **Abstract**
 The most metal-poor tail of the Milky Way ([Fe/H] $\leq$ $-$2.5) contains a population of stars with very prograde planar orbits, which is puzzling in both their origin and evolution. A possible scenario is that they are shepherded by the bar from the inner Galaxy, where many of the old and low-metallicity stars in the Galaxy are located. To investigate this scenario, we use test-particle simulations with an axisymmetric background potential plus a central bar model. The test particles are generated by an extended distribution function (EDF) model based on the observational constraints of bulge stars. According to the simulation results, a bar with constant pattern speed cannot help bring stars from the bulge to the solar vicinity. In contrast, when the model includes a rapidly decelerating bar, some bulge stars can gain rotation and move outwards as they are trapped in the co-rotation regions of the bar. The resulting distribution of shepherded stars heavily depends on the present-day azimuthal angle between the bar and the Sun. The majority of the low-metallicity bulge stars driven outwards are distributed in the fourth quadrant of the Galaxy with respect to the Sun, and about 10$\%$ of them are within 6 kpc from us. Our experiments indicate that the decelerating bar perturbation can be a contributing process to explain part of the most metal-poor stars with prograde planar orbits seen in the Solar neighborhood but is unlikely to be the dominant one.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiment and hence is modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars as the observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, there exists some universal relations between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study some already established universal relations in non-radial oscillation frequencies with star compactness for the baryonic star with core composed of heavier baryons and for the hybrid star with core composed of strange quark matter in CFL phase surrounded by nucleonic matter. We find the hybrid star with core of quark matter in the CFL phase obeys the same universal relation as the hybrid star with normal quark matter. However, the baryonic star with strange and non-strange heavier baryons at the inner core fails to satisfy the universal relations.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs) are high concentrations of dark matter which are assumed to have formed from amplified primordial perturbations, alongside the primordial black holes (PBHs). In this work we calculate the abundance of UDMHs and improve the previous works by elaborating on the formation process of these halos through including various physical and geometrical modifications in the analysis. In particular, we investigate the impact of angular momentum, dynamical friction and triaxial collapse on the predicted mass functions for UDMHs. We perform the calculations for four primordial power spectra with different amplified features that allow for (PBH and) UDHM formation in a wide mass range. We find that the abundance of UDMHs is prominently enhanced in the presence of these more realistic physical modifications. Comparison of the results with the current observational bounds on PBHs also implies that the UDMHs are expected to significantly outnumber PBHs in broad mass intervals, with the details depending on the primordial power spectrum.

 Women in the Astronomy and STEM fields face systemic inequalities throughout their careers. Raising awareness, supported by detailed statistical data, represents the initial step toward closely monitoring hurdles in career progress and addressing underlying barriers to workplace equality. This, in turn, contributes to rectifying gender imbalances in STEM careers. The International Astronomical Union Women in Astronomy (IAU WiA) working group, a part of the IAU Executive Committee, is dedicated to increasing awareness of the status of women in Astronomy and supporting the aspirations of female astronomers globally. Its mission includes taking concrete actions to advance equal opportunities for both women and men in the field of astronomy. In August 2021, the IAU WiA Working Group established a new organizing committee, unveiling a comprehensive four-point plan. This plan aims to strengthen various aspects of the group's mission, encompassing: (i) Awareness Sustainability: Achieved through surveys and data collection, (ii) Training and Skill Building: Focused on professional development, (iii) Fundraising: To support key initiatives, and (iv) Communication: Dissemination of results through conferences, WG Magazines, newsletters, and more. This publication provides an overview of focused surveys that illuminate the factors influencing the careers of women in Astronomy, with a particular focus on the careers of mothers. It highlights the lack of inclusive policies, equal opportunities, and funding support for women researchers in the field. Finally, we summarize the specific initiatives undertaken by the IAU WiA Working Group to advance inclusivity and equal opportunities in Astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present an analysis of over 34 years of observational data from CAL 87, an eclipsing supersoft X-ray source. The primary aim of our study, which combines previously analysed measurements as well as unexplored publicly available datasets, is to examine the orbital period evolution of CAL 87. After meticulously and consistently determining the eclipse timings, we constructed an O$-$C (observed minus calculated) diagram using a total of 38 data points. Our results provide confirmation of a positive derivative in the system's orbital period, with a determined value of $\dot{P}=+ 8.18\pm1.46\times10^{-11}$ s/s. We observe a noticeable jitter in the eclipse timings and additionally identify a systematic delay in the X-ray eclipses compared to those observed in longer wavelengths. We discuss the interplay of the pertinent factors that could contribute to a positive period derivative and the inherent variability in the eclipses.

 - **Abstract**
 The Universe at the present epoch is found to be a network of matter over-dense and under-dense regions. To date, this picture of the Universe is best revealed through cosmological large-volume simulations and large-scale galaxy redshift surveys, in which, the most important step is the appropriate identification of structures. So far, these structures are identified using various group finding codes, mostly based on the friends-of-friends (FoF) or spherical over-density (SO) algorithms. Although, the main purpose is to identify gravitationally bound structures, surprisingly, the mass information has hardly been used effectively by these codes. Moreover, the methods used so far either constrain the over-density or use the real unstructured geometry only. Even though these are key factors in the accurate determination of structures-mass information, hardly any attempt has been made as yet to consider these important parameters together while formulating the grouping algorithms. In this paper, we present our proposed algorithm which takes care of all the above-mentioned relevant features and ensures the bound structures by means of physical quantities, mainly mass and the total energy information. We introduced a novel concept of physically relevant arm-length for each element depending on their individual gravity leading to a distinct linking length for each unique pair of elements. This proposed algorithm is thus fundamentally new that, not only able to catch the gravitationally bound, real unstructured geometry, it does identify it roughly within a predefined physically motivated density threshold. Such a thing could not be simultaneously achieved before by any of the usual FoF or SO-based methods. We also demonstrate the unique ability of the code in the appropriate identification of structures, both from large volume cosmological simulations as well as from galaxy redshift surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most intense explosions in the universe. GRBs with extended emission (GRB EE) constitute a small subclass of GRBs. GRB EE are divided into EE-I GRBs and EE-II GRBs, according to the Amati empirical relationship rather than duration. We test here if these two types of GRB have different origins based on their luminosity function (and formation rate). Therefore, we use Lynden-Bell's c^- method to investigate the LF and FR of GRBs with EE without any assumption. We calculate the formation rate of two types of GRBs. For EE-I GRBs, the fitting function can be written as \rho (z) \propto {(1 + z)^{ - 0.34 \pm 0.04} for z < 2.39 and \rho (z) \propto {(1 + z)^{ - 2.34 \pm 0.24}} for z>2.39. The formation rate of EE-II can describe as \rho (z) \propto {(1 + z)^{ - 1.05 \pm 1.10}} for z<0.43 and \rho (z) \propto {(1 + z)^{ - 8.44 \pm 1.10}} for z>0.43. The local formation rate are \rho (0) = 0.03 Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} for some EE-I GRBs and \rho (0) = 0.32 Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} for EE-II GRBs. Based on these results, we provide a new evidence that the origins of EE-I GRBs are different from EE-II GRBs from the perspective of event rate. The EE-I GRB could be produced from the death of the massive star, but EE-II GRB bursts may come from other processes that are unrelated to the SFR. Our findings indicate that the GRB with EE could have multiple production channels.

 - **Abstract**
 In the most extreme astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), neutrinos can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFCs) on exceedingly short scales. Intensive simulations have demonstrated that FFCs can attain equilibrium states in certain models. In this study, we utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, by specifically targeting the first two moments of neutrino angular distributions. This makes our approach suitable for state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations. Through effective feature engineering and the incorporation of customized loss functions that penalize discrepancies in the predicted total number of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$, our PINNs demonstrate remarkable accuracies, with an error margin of $\lesssim3\%$. Our study represents a substantial leap forward in the potential incorporation of FFCs into simulations of CCSNe and NSMs, thereby enhancing our understanding of these extraordinary astrophysical events.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation process of the two Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, is still debated with two main competing hypotheses: the capture of an asteroid or a giant impact onto Mars. In order to reveal their origin, the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans to measure Phobos' elemental composition by a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer called MEGANE. This study provides a model of Phobos' bulk elemental composition, assuming the two formation hypotheses. Using the mixing model, we established a MEGANE data analysis flow to discriminate between the formation hypotheses by multivariate analysis. The mixing model expresses the composition of Phobos in 6 key lithophile elements that will be measured by MEGANE (Fe, Si, O, Ca, Mg, and Th) as a linear mixing of two mixing components: material from Mars and material from an asteroid as represented by primitive meteorite compositions. The inversion calculation includes consideration of MEGANE's measurement errors ($E_P$) and derives the mixing ratio for a given Phobos composition, based on which the formation hypotheses are judged. For at least 65\% of the modeled compositions, MEGANE measurements will determine the origin uniquely ($E_P$ = 30\%), and this increases from 74 to 87\% as $E_P$ decreases from 20 to 10\%. Although the discrimination performance depends on $E_P$, the current operation plan for MEGANE predicts an instrument performance for $E_P$ of 20--30\%, resulting in ~70\% discrimination between the original hypotheses. MEGANE observations can also enable the determination of the asteroid type of the captured body or the impactor. The addition of other measurements, such as MEGANE's measurements of the volatile element K, as well as observations by other MMX remote sensing instruments, will also contribute to the MMX mission's goal to constrain the origin of Phobos.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheric compositions of planets offer a unique view into their respective formation processes. State-of-the-art observatories and techniques are finally able to provide high-precision data on atmospheric composition that can be used to constrain planet formation. In this context, we focus on the formation of WASP-77Ab based on previous observations of its atmosphere, which have provided precise C/O and metallicity measurements. We use the SimAb planet formation simulation to model the formation of WASP-77Ab. We assume two compositions for the disk WASP-77Ab was formed within: one of a solar composition and one that represents the composition of WASP-77A. In addition, we considered two different scenarios regarding the migration of the planet and we study the possible planet formation paths that reproduce the composition of WASP-77Ab. This work shows that the planet is expected to have formed in a disk where not many planetesimals could be accreted. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most likely migration scenario is disk-free migration, whereby the planet initiates its Type II migration within the CO ice line and ends it beyond the water ice line.

 - **Abstract**
 After GW170817, kilonovae have become of great interest for the astronomical, astrophysics and nuclear physics communities, due to their potential in revealing key information on the compact binary merger from which they emerge, such as the fate of the central remnant or the composition of the expelled material. Therefore, the landscape of models employed for their analysis is rapidly evolving, with multiple approaches being used for different purposes. In this paper, we present xkn, a semi-analytic framework which predicts and interprets the bolometric luminosity and the broadband light curves of such transients. xkn models the merger ejecta structure accounting for different ejecta components and non-spherical geometries. In addition to light curve models from the literature based on time scale and random-walk arguments, it implements a new model, xkn-diff, which is grounded on a solution of the radiative transfer equation for homologously expanding material. In order to characterize the variety of the ejecta conditions, it employs time and composition dependent heating rates, thermalization efficiencies and opacities. We compare xkn light curves with reference radiative transfer calculations, and we find that xkn-diff significantly improves over previous semi-analytic prescriptions. We view xkn as an ideal tool for extensive parameter estimation data analysis applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Body tides reveal information about planetary interiors and affect their evolution. Most models to compute body tides rely on the assumption of a spherically-symmetric interior. However, several processes can lead to lateral variations of interior properties. We present a new spectral method to compute the tidal response of laterally-heterogeneous bodies. Compared to previous spectral methods, our approach is not limited to small-amplitude lateral variations; compared to finite element codes, the approach is more computationally-efficient. While the tidal response of a spherically-symmetric body has the same wave-length as the tidal force; lateral heterogeneities produce an additional tidal response with an spectra that depends on the spatial pattern of such variations. For Mercury, the Moon and Io the amplitude of this signal is as high as $1\%-10\%$ the main tidal response for long-wavelength shear modulus variations higher than $\sim 10\%$ the mean shear modulus. For Europa, Ganymede and Enceladus, shell-thickness variations of $50\%$ the mean shell thickness can cause an additional signal of $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 10\%$ for the Jovian moons and Encelaudus, respectively. Future missions, such as $ \textit{BepiColombo}$ and $\textit{JUICE}$, might measure these signals. Lateral variations of viscosity affect the distribution of tidal heating. This can drive the thermal evolution of tidally-active bodies and affect the distribution of active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observations of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (LVK) have provided a new opportunity for studying our Universe. By detecting several merging events of black holes (BHs), LVK has spurred the astronomical community to improve theoretical models of single, binary, and multiple star evolution in order to better understand the formation of binary black hole (BBH) systems and interpret their observed properties. The final BBH system configuration before the merger depends on several processes, including those related to the evolution of the inner stellar structure and those due to the interaction with the companion and the environment (such as in stellar clusters). This chapter provides a summary of the formation scenarios of stellar BHs in single, binary, and multiple systems. We review all the important physical processes that affect the formation of BHs and discuss the methodologies used to detect these elusive objects and constrain their properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We study tidal dissipation in models of rotating giant planets with masses in the range $0.1 - 10 M_\mathrm{J}$ throughout their evolution. Our models incorporate a frequency-dependent turbulent effective viscosity acting on equilibrium tides (including its modification by rapid rotation consistent with hydrodynamical simulations) and inertial waves in convection zones, and internal gravity waves in the thin radiative atmospheres. We consider a range of planetary evolutionary models for various masses and strengths of stellar instellation. Dissipation of inertial waves is computed using a frequency-averaged formalism fully accounting for planetary structures. Dissipation of gravity waves in the radiation zone is computed assuming these waves are launched adiabatically and are subsequently fully damped (by wave breaking/radiative damping). We compute modified tidal quality factors $Q'$ and evolutionary timescales for these planets as a function of their ages. We find inertial waves to be the dominant mechanism of tidal dissipation in giant planets whenever they are excited. Their excitation requires the tidal period ($P_\mathrm{tide}$) to be longer than half the planetary rotation ($P_\mathrm{rot}/2$), and we predict inertial waves to provide a typical $Q'\sim 10^3 (P_\mathrm{rot}/1 \mathrm{d})^2$, with values between $10^5$ and $10^6$ for a 10-day period. We show correlations of observed exoplanet eccentricities with tidal circularisation timescale predictions, highlighting the key role of planetary tides. A major uncertainty in planetary models is the role of stably-stratified layers resulting from compositional gradients, which we do not account for here, but which could modify predictions for tidal dissipation rates.
#### Exploring primordial curvature perturbation on small scales with the  lensing effect of fast radio bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological observations, e.g., cosmic microwave background, have precisely measured the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation on larger scales, but smaller scales are still poorly constrained. Since primordial black holes (PBHs) could form in the very early Universe through the gravitational collapse of primordial density perturbations, constrains on the PBH could encodes much information on primordial fluctuations. In this work, we first derive a simple formula for lensing effect to apply PBH constraints with the monochromatic mass distribution to an extended mass distribution. Then, we investigate the latest fast radio burst observations with this relationship to constrain two kinds of primordial curvature perturbation models on the small scales. It suggests that, from the null search result of lensed fast radio burst in currently available observations, the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbation should be less than $8\times 10^{-2}$ at the scale region of $10^5-10^6~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. This corresponds to an interesting mass range relating to binary black holes detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and future Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer.

 - **Abstract**
 The instability strip (IS) of classical Cepheids has been extensively studied theoretically. Comparison of the theoretical IS edges with those obtained empirically, using the most recent Cepheids catalogs available, can provide us with insights into the physical processes that determine the position of the IS boundaries. In this study, we investigate the empirical positions of the IS of the classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), considering any effect that increases its width, to obtain intrinsic edges that can be compared with theoretical models. We use data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone (1O) LMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, together with a recent high-resolution reddening map from the literature. Our final sample includes 2058 F and 1387 1O Cepheids. We studied their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and determined the IS borders by tracing the edges of the color distribution along the strip. We obtain the blue and red edges of the IS in V- and I-photometric bands, in addition to $\log T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log L$. The results obtained show a break located at the Cepheids' period of about 3 days, which was not reported before. We compare our empirical borders with theoretical ones published in the literature obtaining a good agreement for specific parameter sets. The break in the IS borders is most likely explained by the depopulation of second and third crossing classical Cepheids in the faint part of the IS, since blue loops of evolutionary tracks in this mass range do not extend blueward enough to cross the IS at the LMC metallicity. Results from the comparison of our empirical borders with theoretical ones prove that our empirical IS is a useful tool for constraining theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Computing the matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters can be prohibitively slow in cosmological analyses, hence emulating this calculation is desirable. Previous analytic approximations are insufficiently accurate for modern applications, so black-box, uninterpretable emulators are often used. We utilise an efficient genetic programming based symbolic regression framework to explore the space of potential mathematical expressions which can approximate the power spectrum and $\sigma_8$. We learn the ratio between an existing low-accuracy fitting function for $P(k)$ and that obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations and thus still incorporate the physics which motivated this earlier approximation. We obtain an analytic approximation to the linear power spectrum with a root mean squared fractional error of 0.2% between $k = 9\times10^{-3} - 9 \, h{\rm \, Mpc^{-1}}$ and across a wide range of cosmological parameters, and we provide physical interpretations for various terms in the expression. We also provide a simple analytic approximation for $\sigma_8$ with a similar accuracy, with a root mean squared fractional error of just 0.4% when evaluated across the same range of cosmologies. This function is easily invertible to obtain $A_{\rm s}$ as a function of $\sigma_8$ and the other cosmological parameters, if preferred. It is possible to obtain symbolic approximations to a seemingly complex function at a precision required for current and future cosmological analyses without resorting to deep-learning techniques, thus avoiding their black-box nature and large number of parameters. Our emulator will be usable long after the codes on which numerical approximations are built become outdated.

 - **Abstract**
 Both the 1866 and 1946 outbursts of the recurrent symbiotic nova T CrB have displayed a mysterious secondary maximum peaking in brightness ~5 months past the primary one. Common to all previous modeling attempts was the rejection of plain irradiation of the red giant (RG), on the basis that the secondary maximum of T CrB would have been out of phase with the transit at superior conjunction of the RG. Implicit to this line of reasoning is the assumption of a constant temperature for the white dwarf (WD) irradiating the red giant. I show by radiative modeling that irradiation of the RG by a cooling WD nicely reproduces the photometric evolution of the secondary maximum, both in terms of brightness and color, removes the phasing offset, and provides a straightforward explanation that will be easy to test at the next and imminent outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We present infrared aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of newly formed dust from the colliding winds of the massive binary system Wolf-Rayet (WR) 137 with JWST using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). NIRISS AMI observations of WR 137 and a point-spread-function calibrator star, HD~228337, were taken using the F380M and F480M filters in 2022 July and August as part of the Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) program 1349. Interferometric observables (squared visibilities and closure phases) from the WR 137 "interferogram" were extracted and calibrated using three independent software tools: ImPlaneIA, AMICAL, and SAMpip. The analysis of the calibrated observables yielded consistent values except for slightly discrepant closure phases measured by ImPlaneIA. Based on all three sets of calibrated observables, images were reconstructed using three independent software tools: BSMEM, IRBis, and SQUEEZE. All reconstructed image combinations generated consistent images in both F380M and F480M filters. The reconstructed images of WR 137 reveal a bright central core with a $\sim300$ mas linear filament extending to the northwest. A geometric colliding-wind model with dust production constrained to the orbital plane of the binary system and enhanced as the system approaches periapsis provided a general agreement with the interferometric observables and reconstructed images. Based on a colliding-wind dust condensation analysis, we suggest that dust formation within the orbital plane of WR 137 is induced by enhanced equatorial mass-loss from the rapidly rotating O9 companion star, whose axis of rotation is aligned with that of the orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning methods tailored to astrophysics and cosmology. Among the various methods that have been developed, there is one that allows to obtain a bundle of solutions of differential systems without the need of using traditional numerical solvers. We have recently applied this to the cosmological scenario and showed that in some cases the computational times of the inference process can be reduced. In this paper, we present an improvement to the neural network bundle method that results in a significant reduction of the computational times of the statistical analysis. The novelty of the method consists in the use of the neural network bundle method to calculate the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae, which is usually computed through an integral with numerical methods. In this work, we have applied this improvement to the Starobinsky $f(R)$ model, which is more difficult to integrate than the $f(R)$ models analyzed in our previous work. We performed a statistical analysis with data from type Ia supernovae of the Pantheon+ compilation and cosmic chronometers to estimate the values of the free parameters of the Starobinsky model. We show that the statistical analyses carried out with our new method require lower computational times than the ones performed with both the numerical and the neural network method from our previous work. This reduction in time is more significant in the case of a difficult computational problem such as the one we address in this work.
#### Neutron stars in accreting systems -- signatures of the QCD phase  transition

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NS) that are born in binary systems, with a main sequence star companion, can experience mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of material at the NS's surface. This, in turn, leads to the continuous growth of the NS mass and the associated steepening of the gravitational potential. If the central density surpasses the onset for the phase transition from nuclear, generally hadronic matter to deconfined quark-gluon plasma-a quantity currently constrained solely from an upper limit by asymptotic freedom in QCD-the system may experience a dynamic response due to the appearance of additional degrees of freedom in the equation of state (EOS). This might give rise to a rapid softening of the EOS during the transition in the hadron-quark matter co-existence region. Whilst this phenomenon has long been studied in the context of hydrostatic configurations, the dynamical implications of this problem are yet incompletely understood. It is the essence of the present paper to simulate the dynamics of NS, with previously accreted envelopes, caused by the presence of a first-order QCD phase transition. Therefore, the neutrino radiation hydrodynamics treatment is employed based on the fully general relativistic approach in spherical symmetry, implementing three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic model EOS that contains a first-order hadron-quark phase transition. The associated neutrino signal shows a sudden rise of the neutrino fluxes and average energies, becoming observable for the present generation of neutrino detectors for a galactic event, and a gravitational wave mode analysis reveals the behaviors of the dominant $f$ and first gravity $g$ modes that are being excited during the NS evolution across the QCD phase transition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results for the detectability of the O2 and O3 molecular species in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet using reflected light at the visible wavelengths. By quantifying the detectability as a function of signal-to-noise ration (SNR), we can constrain the best methods to detect these biosignatures with nest-generation telescopes designed for high-contrast coronagraph. Using 25 bandpasses between 0.515 and 1 micron, and a pre-constructed grid of geometric albedo spectra, we examined the spectral sensitivity needed to detect these species for a range of molecular abundances. We first replicate a modern-Earth twin atmosphere to study the detectability of current O2 and O3 levels, and then expand to a wider range of literature-driven abundances for each molecule. We constrain the optimal 20%, 30%, and 40% bandpasses based on the effective SNR of the data, and define the requirements for the possibility of simultaneous molecular detection. We present our findings of O2 and O3 detectability as functions of SNR, wavelength, and abundance, and discuss how to use these results for optimizing future instrument designs. We find that O2 is detectable between 0.64 and 0.83 micron with moderate-SNR data for abundances near that of modern-Earth and greater, but undetectable for lower abundances consistent with a Proterozoic Earth. O3 is detectable only at very high SNR data in the case of modern-Earth abundances, however it is detectable at low-SNR data for higher O3 abundances that can occur from efficient abiotic O3 production mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses of samples from asteroid (162173) Ryugu returned by JAXA's Hayabusa2 mission suggest that Ryugu and CI chondrites formed in the same region of the protoplanetary disk, in a reservoir that was isolated from the source regions of other carbonaceous (C-type) asteroids. Here we conduct $N$-body simulations in which CI planetesimals are assumed to have formed in the Uranus/Neptune zone at $\sim15$--25 au from the Sun. We show that CI planetesimals are scattered by giant planets toward the asteroid belt where their orbits can be circularized by aerodynamic gas drag. We find that the dynamical implantation of CI asteroids from $\sim15$--25 au is very efficient with $\sim 5$\% of $\sim 100$-km planetesimals reaching stable orbits in the asteroid belt by the end of the protoplanetary gas disk lifetime. The efficiency is reduced when planetesimal ablation is accounted for. The implanted population subsequently evolved by collisions and was depleted by dynamical instabilities. The model can explain why CIs are isotopically distinct from other C-type asteroids which presumably formed at $\sim5$--10 au.
#### Correlated Spectral and Recurrence Variations of Cygnus X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of recurrence analysis of the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 using combined observations from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-sky Monitor and the Japanese Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image aboard the ISS. From the time-dependent windowed recurrence plot (RP), we compute ten recurrence quantities that describe the dynamical behavior of the source and compare them to the spectral state at each point in time. We identify epochs of state changes corresponding to transitions into highly deterministic or highly stochastic dynamical regimes and their correlation to specific spectral states. We compare k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest models for various sizes of the time-dependent RP. The spectral state in Cygnus X-1 can be predicted with greater than 95 per cent accuracy for both types of models explored across a range of RP sizes based solely on the recurrence properties. The primary features from the RP that distinguish between spectral states are the determinism, Shannon entropy, and average line length, all of which are systematically higher in the hard state compared to the soft state. Our results suggest that the hard and soft states of Cygnus X-1 exhibit distinct dynamical variability and the time domain alone can be used for spectral state classification.
#### SAX J1810.8-2609]{SAX J1810.8-2609: An Outbursting Neutron Star X-ray  Binary with Persistent Spatially Coincident Radio Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Here we report on joint X-ray and radio monitoring of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary SAX J1810.8-2609. Our monitoring covered the entirety of its ~5 month outburst in 2021, revealing a temporal correlation between its radio and X-ray luminosity and X-ray spectral properties consistent with a `hard-only' outburst. During the outburst, the best-fit radio position shows significant variability, suggesting emission from multiple locations on the sky. Furthermore, our 2023 follow-up observations revealed a persistent, unresolved, steep spectrum radio source ~2 years after SAX J1810.8-2609 returned to X-ray quiescence. We investigated potential origins of the persistent emission, which included an unrelated background source, long-lasting jet ejection(s), and SAX J1810 as a transitional millisecond pulsar. While the chance coincidence probability is low (<0.16%), an unrelated background source remains the most likely scenario. SAX J1810.8-2609 goes into outburst every ~5 years, so monitoring of the source during its next outburst at higher sensitivities and improved spatial resolutions (e.g., with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array or Square Kilometre Array) should be able to identify two components (if the persistent emission originates from a background source). If only one source is observed, this would be strong evidence that the persistent emission is local SAX J1810.8-2609, and future monitoring campaigns should focus on understanding the underlying physical mechanisms, as no neutron star X-ray binary has shown a persistent radio signal absent any simultaneous X-ray emission.
