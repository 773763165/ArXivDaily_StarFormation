 - **Abstract**
 The spin frequencies of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries may be limited by the emission of gravitational waves. A candidate for producing such steady emission is a mass asymmetry, or "mountain", sourced by temperature asymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined temperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear species and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture layers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries. However, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of such deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative source of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the pressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that temperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be significant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations, self-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the perturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries, to establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the crustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the possibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and isolated neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-energy radiative output, from the X-ray to the ultraviolet, of exoplanet host stars drives photochemical reactions and mass loss in the upper regions of planetary atmospheres. In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly-a lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1A--20um for each star. While LTT1445Ab, LTT1445Ac, and GJ486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO2 atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50% of Earth's total CO2 budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486. Despite both LTT1445A and GJ486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ486 exhibits two flares with absolute energies of 10^29.5 and 10^30.1 erg (equivalent durations of 4357+/-96 and 19724+/-169 s) occurring three hours apart, captured with HST/COS G130M. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs, as well as the population as a whole.

          Multipoles of the galaxy bispectrum on a light cone: wide-separation and relativistic corrections

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy bispectrum provides access to correlations among different scales that cannot be captured by the power spectrum alone, and with the Stage-IV galaxy surveys it enables the possibility of detecting both primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) and general relativistic effects. Accounting for wide-separation corrections, which arise from the loss of symmetry in the correlation of widely separated points on the past light cone, is essential for their accurate modelling and detection. These corrections can be included perturbatively to the standard bispectrum and we compute them analytically for a generalised line of sight. We include the radial contribution to the wide-separations corrections for the first time. We show that the first-order corrections entering the odd multipoles with respect to the line of sight are large, up to $10 \%$ of the bispectrum monopole, and need to be included when considering the leading-order relativistic effects that could be detectable with surveys like DESI and Euclid. The second-order wide-separation and relativistic contributions, including their mixing terms, have implications for analysis of PNG and we show, for the local type, they can mimic $f_{\rm NL}$ of order 10 in the squeezed limit. We present full analytic expressions for all these contributions to the local bispectrum and its multipoles with a publicly available code for their computation.

 - **Abstract**
 The three dynamically confirmed wind-fed black hole high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) are suggested to all contain a highly spinning black hole (BH). However, based on the theories of efficient angular momentum transport inside the stars, we expect that the first-born BHs in binary systems should have low spins, which is consistent with gravitational-wave observations. As a result, the origin of the high BH spins measured in wind-fed BH-HMXBs remains a mystery. In this paper, we conduct a binary population synthesis study on wind-fed BH-HMXBs at solar metallicity with the use of the newly developed code POSYDON, considering three scenarios for BH accretion: Eddington-limited, moderately super-Eddington, and fully conservative accretion. Taking into account the conditions for accretion-disk formation, we find that regardless of the accretion model, these systems are more likely to have already experienced a phase of Roche-lobe overflow after the BH formation. To account for the extreme BH spins, highly conservative accretion onto BHs is required, when assuming the accreted material carries the specific angular momentum at the innermost stable orbit. Besides, in our simulations we found that the systems with donor stars within the mass range of $10-20\,M_{\odot}$ are prevalent, posing a challenge in explaining simultaneously all observed properties of the BH-HMXB in our Galaxy, Cygnus X-1, and potentially hinting that the accretion efficiency onto non-degenerate stars, before the formation of the BH, is also more conservative than assumed in our simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have left an imprint in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) throughout their evolution in the history of the Universe. This review highlights two types of SGWB: those generated by scalar curvature perturbations associated with PBH formation in the early Universe and those composed of ensembles of GWs emitted by PBH binaries. After describing detection methods and a brief introduction on Bayesian inference, we discuss current constraints imposed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations through the non-detection of the SGWBs and discuss their physical implications.

          Spectro-photometric follow up of the outbursting AM CVn system ASASSN-21br

 - **Abstract**
 We report on spectroscopic and photometric observations of the AM CVn system ASASSN-21br, which was discovered in outburst by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae in February 2021. The outburst lasted for around three weeks, and exhibited a pronounced brightness dip for $\approx$ 4 days, during which the spectra showed a sudden transition from emission- to absorption-line dominated. Only $\approx$ 60 AM CVn systems with derived orbital periods are found in the Galaxy, therefore increasing the sample of AM CVn systems with known orbital periods is of tremendous importance to (1) constrain the physical mechanisms of their outbursts and (2) establish a better understanding of the low-frequency background noise of future gravitational wave surveys. Time-resolved photometry taken during the outburst of ASASSN-21br showed modulation with a period of around 36.65 minutes, which is likely the superhump or orbital period of the system. Time-resolved spectroscopy taken with the Southern African Large Telescope did not show any sign of periodicity in the He I absorption lines. This is possibly due to the origin of these lines in the outbursting accretion disc, which makes it challenging to retrieve periodicity from the spectral lines. Future follow up spectral observations during quiescence might allow us better constrain the orbital period of ASASSN-21br.

 - **Abstract**
 The Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) project conducts a regular monitoring program of the Sun. The GAVRT Solar Patrol project uses a 34 m diameter antenna to produce raster-scan maps of the Sun simultaneously at 4 frequencies ranging from approximately 3 GHz to 14 GHz. On 2024 May 14, as part of regular GAVRT Solar Patrol observations, raster maps were produced when an X8.7 solar flare occurred in active region AR13664. Here we present the GAVRT maps of the May 14 flare along with microwave flux density spectra showing the non-thermal microwave burst emission from mildly relativistic electrons produced in this largest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date. AR13664 reappeared as AR13697 and continued to be very active, producing X flares while GAVRT monitored its activity. GAVRT microwave data provide a powerful complement to the energetic electrons tracked by X-ray, millimeter-wave and {\gamma}-ray emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational lensing signal from the Cosmic Microwave Background is highly valuable to constrain the growth of the structures in the Universe in a clean and robust manner over a wide range of redshifts. One of the theoretical systematics for lensing reconstruction is the impact of the lensing field non-Gaussianities on its estimators. Non-linear matter clustering and post-Born lensing corrections are known to bias standard quadratic estimators to some extent, most significantly so in temperature. In this work, we explore the impact of non-Gaussian deflections on Maximum a Posteriori lensing estimators, which, in contrast to quadratic estimators, are able to provide optimal measurements of the lensing field. We show that these naturally reduce the induced non- Gaussian bias and lead to unbiased cosmological constraints in $\Lambda$CDM at CMB-S4 noise levels without the need for explicit modelling. We also test the impact of assuming a non-Gaussian prior for the reconstruction; this mitigates the effect further slightly, but generally has little impact on the quality of the reconstruction. This shows that higher-order statistics of the lensing deflections are not expected to present a major challenge for optimal CMB lensing reconstruction in the foreseeable future.

          Prospects for the detection of very-high-energy pulsars with LHAASO and SWGO

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsations from the Crab pulsar have been detected by the MAGIC telescopes at energies up to 1.5 TeV, and the pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar was detected by H.E.S.S., reaching tens of TeV. These discoveries, along with the proposed additional emission due to inverse Compton scattering at TeV energies, lead us to consider suitable candidates for detection with current and future extensive air show (EAS) experiments at very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1 $-$ 100 TeV) ranges. Leveraging energy spectrum data from pulsars as observed by Fermi and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and considering the sensitivities of both LHAASO and SWGO, this study evaluates their detectability and estimates the time required for their significant detection. Our results indicate that LHAASO could detect the Crab's pulsed signal within six years, while SWGO might detect Vela's signal within one year. Observations of the most energetic Fermi pulsars with EAS experiments will provide insight into the nature of VHE pulsar emissions, helping to clarify the primary characteristics of VHE pulsars.

          X-ray Observations of Two Type Ia Supernovae with an H$\alpha$ Line in their Optical Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We report on Chandra X-ray observations of SN 2016jae and SN 2018cqj, both low luminosity Type Ia supernova that showed the presence of a H line in their early optical spectrum. No X-ray emission is detected at the location of either SN. Upper limits to the luminosity of up to 2 $\times 10^{40}\,$ erg s$^{-1}$ are calculated for each SN, depending on the assumed spectral model, temperature and column density. This luminosity is comparable to that of another low-luminosity Type Ia SN, SN 2018fhw, that was observed with Chandra. It is generally lower than upper limits calculated for Type Ia-CSM SNe observed in X-rays, and also below that of SN 2012ca, the only Type Ia-CSM SN to have been detected in X-rays. Comparisons are made to other Type Ia SN with a H line observed in X-rays. The observations suggest that while the density into which the SN is expanding may have been high at the time the H$\alpha$ line was detected, it had decreased considerably by the time of X-ray observations.

          A slightly oblate dark matter halo revealed by a retrograde precessing Galactic disk warp

 - **Abstract**
 The shape of the dark matter (DM) halo is key to understanding the hierarchical formation of the Galaxy. Despite extensive efforts in recent decades, however, its shape remains a matter of debate, with suggestions ranging from strongly oblate to prolate. Here, we present a new constraint on its present shape by directly measuring the evolution of the Galactic disk warp with time, as traced by accurate distance estimates and precise age determinations for about 2,600 classical Cepheids. We show that the Galactic warp is mildly precessing in a retrograde direction at a rate of $\omega = -2.1 \pm 0.5 ({\rm statistical}) \pm 0.6 ({\rm systematic})$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ for the outer disk over the Galactocentric radius [$7.5, 25$] kpc, decreasing with radius. This constrains the shape of the DM halo to be slightly oblate with a flattening (minor axis to major axis ratio) in the range $0.84 \le q_{\Phi} \le 0.96$. Given the young nature of the disk warp traced by Cepheids (less than 200 Myr), our approach directly measures the shape of the present-day DM halo. This measurement, combined with other measurements from older tracers, could provide vital constraints on the evolution of the DM halo and the assembly history of the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 High-significance evidences of the existence of a high-energy diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos have emerged in the last decade from several observations by the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino telescope took data for 15 years in the Mediterranean Sea, from 2007 to 2022, and collected a high-purity all-flavour neutrino sample. The search for a diffuse cosmic neutrino signal using this dataset is presented in this article. This final analysis did not provide a statistically significant observation of the cosmic diffuse flux: this is converted into limits on the properties of the cosmic neutrino spectrum. In particular, given the sensitivity of the ANTARES neutrino telescope between 1 and 50 TeV, constraints on single-power-law hypotheses are derived for the cosmic diffuse flux below 20 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray astronomy is a mature area of observational astronomy. After the discovery of the first non-solar X-ray source in 1962, X-ray astronomy proliferated during the Apollo era's space race. Then, it matured as an established area of research during the period of Great Observatories, and now it has become an indispensable tool to understand a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. Consequently, in recent times, niche observational areas in X-ray astronomy have been explored, and attempts have been made to expand the sensitivity of observations vastly. India was an active partner in the growth of X-ray astronomy. In the initial years, India leveraged its expertise in balloon technology to get significant results in the research area of hard X-ray astronomy. During the rapid growth phase of X-ray astronomy, India made divergent all-round efforts. Later on, however, the technical expertise available in India was insufficient to compete with the highly sophisticated satellite experiments from around the world. During this phase, work in X-ray astronomy continued in a few low-key experiments, eventually resulting in the launch of India's first multi-wavelength astronomical satellite, AstroSat, in 2015. In this article, I will trace the journey of X-ray astronomy and the developments in the Indian context. I will also explore the sociological aspects of the growth of X-ray astronomy, and, in the end, I will present a speculative sketch of the future of X-ray astronomy with an emphasis on the Indian contribution.

          Formation of planetary atmospheres: Analytical estimation of vapor production via planetary impacts

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate impact vaporization for planetary atmosphere formation, we have studied the thermodynamic state generated by the shock wave due to a high-velocity impact, called the shock field. We have carried out iSALE simulations for high-velocity vertical impacts using ANEOS for an equation-of-state (EoS) model. To understand the shock fields obtained from simulations, we have investigated the contribution of the thermal and cold terms in the EoS model on the Hugoniot curves. Although the thermal and cold terms are important for the pressure, the internal energy is mainly determined by the thermal term. We thus assume a simple EoS determined by the thermal term and then analytically derive the shock internal-energy field, which reproduces the results of simulations well. Using the analytical solution of internal energy and the Hugoniot curve, we have derived the shock pressure field analytically as well. The analytical solutions for internal energy and pressure are valid even for impact velocities as low as the sound speed. The solution is good for the vertical direction or within the angles of about 60 degrees. We have applied the solution to impact vaporization for the formation of planetary atmospheres. This gives good estimation of reformation of the planetary atmospheres of Earth sized planet.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.

          A non-accreting neutron star and $\delta$ Scuti candidate revealed by asteroseismological modelling and radial velocity measurements

 - **Abstract**
 SZ Lyn is an astrometric binary consisting of a $\delta$ Scuti star and an unseen component. The two stars around each other in an almost circular orbit (e=0.186) with a period of about 3.32 years. We aim to explore the physical properties of the two components using the radial velocity method and asteroseismology. Our results show that the $\delta$ Scuti variable is a post-main sequence star with a helium core ($M_{\rm He}$= 0.1671$^{+0.0028}_{-0.0045}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm He}$= 0.1414$^{+0.0035}_{-0.0020}$ R$_{\odot}$) surrounded by a burning hydrogen shell; its fundamental parameters is accurately calculated to be $M$=1.82$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ M$_{\odot}$, $R$=2.91$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ R$_{\odot}$, $L$=17.07$^{+1.28}_{-2.61}$ L$_{\odot}$, and $X_c$=0.078$^{+0.021}_{-0.004}$; the mass of the invisible object is thus estimated to be $M_{\rm co}$=1.68 $^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ M$_{\odot}$. Combined with the low-resolution LAMOST spectrum, we suggest that the unseen object is an neutron star candidate. Our work demonstrates the methodology of using the radial velocity method and asteroseismology to detect the compact object in such an astrometric binary.

          A Markovian description of the multi-level source function and its application to the Lyman series in the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We introduce a new method to calculate and interpret indirect transition rates populating atomic levels using Markov chain theory. Indirect transition rates are essential to evaluate interlocking in a multi-level source function, which quantifies all the processes that add and remove photons from a spectral line. A better understanding of the multi-level source function is central to interpret optically thick spectral line formation in stellar atmospheres, especially outside local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). Methods. We compute the level populations from a hydrogen model atom in statistical equilibrium, using the solar FALC model, a 1D static atmosphere. From the transition rates, we reconstruct the multi-level source function using our new method and compare it with existing methods to build the source function. We focus on the Lyman series lines and analyze the different contributions to the source functions and synthetic spectra. Results. Absorbing Markov chains can represent the level-ratio solution of the statistical equilibrium equation and can therefore be used to calculate the indirect transition rates between the upper and lower levels of an atomic transition. Our description of the multi-level source function allows a more physical interpretation of its individual terms, particularly a quantitative view of interlocking. For the Lyman lines in the FALC atmosphere, we find that interlocking becomes increasingly important with order in the series, with Ly-{\alpha} showing very little, but Ly-\b{eta} nearly 50% and Ly-{\gamma} about 60% contribution coming from interlocking. In some cases, this view seems opposed to the conventional wisdom that these lines are mostly scattering, and we discuss the reasons why.

          Dynamical evolution timescales for the triple supermassive black hole system in NGC 6240

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the available observational data from the literature, we analysed the dynamics of the NGC 6240 galaxy central supermassive black hole (SMBH) system. For the dynamical modelling of this triple SBMH system, we used the massively parallel and GPU accelerated phi-GPU direct summation N-body code. Following a long-timescale modelling of the triple system, we carried out a very detailed time output analysis of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations for the black holes. According to our Newtonian simulation results, for all models and randomisations, the bound system from S1+S2 components formed at ~3.6 Myr. The formation of the bound hierarchical triple system S+N occurred at ~18 Myr. Over the course of these Newtonian simulations of the evolution of the triple SMBH system and the surrounding environment in NGC 6240, ZLK oscillations were detected (in most cases) for the binary components. The inclination angle between the orbital angular momentum of binary components aptly coincides with the theoretical calculations of the ZLK mechanism. In our set of randomised 15 Newtonian $N$-body dynamical galaxy models in 13 systems, we were able to detect a ZLK mechanism. In contrast, our extra few-body post-Newtonian runs (for one randomisation case) show it is only for the large inner binary initial eccentricity (in our case >0.9 that we are able to observe the possibility of the inner binary merging, due to the post-Newtonian energy radiation effects. For the lower eccentricity cases, the test runs show no sign of possible merging or any ZLK oscillations in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.

 We installed the next-generation automated laser adaptive optics system, Robo-AO-2, on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope on Maunakea in 2023. We engineered Robo-AO-2 to deliver robotic, diffraction-limited observations at visible and near-infrared wavelengths in unprecedented numbers.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Star clusters, composed of stars born from the same molecular cloud, serve as invaluable natural laboratories for understanding the fundamental processes governing stellar formation and evolution. Aims: This study aims to investigate correlations between the Mean Interdistance ($\bar{D_{i}}$), Mean Closest Interdistance ($\bar{D_{c}}$) and Median Weighted Central Interdistance ($\bar{D_{cc}}$) with the age of star clusters, examining their evolutionary trends and assessing the robustness of these quantities as possible age indicators. Methods: We selected a sample of open clusters in the solar region and with a representative number of members (e.g. well populated and without outliers). The interdistances are derived from the spatial distribution of member stars within a cluster. Their evolution over time allows us to use them as an age indicators for star clusters. Results: Our investigation reveals a high-significant correlation between the interdistances and cluster age. Considering the full sample of clusters between 7 and 9 kpc, the relationship is very broad. This is due to uncertainties in parallax, which increase with increasing distance. In particular, we must limit the sample to a maximum distance from the Sun of about 200 pc to avoid artificial effects on cluster shape and on the spatial distribution of their stars along the line of sight. Conclusions: By conservatively restraining the distance to a maximum of $\sim$200 pc, we have established a relationship between the interdistances and the age of the clusters. In our sample, the relationship is mainly driven by the internal expansion of the clusters, and is marginally affected by external perturbative effects. Such relation might enhance our comprehension of cluster dynamics and might be used to derive cluster dynamical ages.

          Evidence for particle acceleration approaching PeV energies in the W51 complex

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex is widely acknowledged to be attributed to the interaction between the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the shock of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C and the dense molecular clouds in the adjacent star-forming region, W51B. However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of $\gamma$ rays emanating from the W51 complex, with energies from 2 TeV to 200 TeV. The LHAASO measurements, for the first time, extend the $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex beyond 100 TeV and reveal a significant spectrum bending at tens of TeV. By combining the ``$\pi^0$-decay bump" featured data from Fermi-LAT, the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the W51 region can be well-characterized by a simple pp-collision model. The observed spectral bending feature suggests an exponential cutoff at $\sim400$~TeV or a power-law break at $\sim200$~TeV in the CR proton spectrum, most likely providing the first evidence of SNRs serving as CR accelerators approaching the PeV regime. Additionally, two young star clusters within W51B could also be theoretically viable to produce the most energetic $\gamma$ rays observed by LHAASO. Our findings strongly support the presence of extreme CR accelerators within the W51 complex and provide new insights into the origin of Galactic CRs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical photometry for the afterglow of GRB 221009A, in some respects the most extraordinary gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed. Good quality in the R-band light curve is obtained, covering 0.32-19.57 days since the Fermi-GBM trigger. We find that a weak bump emerges fromthe declining afterglow at $t \approx 11$ days; a supernova (SN) may be responsible. We use a smooth broken power-law and $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ model to fit the light curve. The best-fitting results reveal that the SN ejected a total mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} = 3.70 M_\odot$, a $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $M_\mathrm{Ni} = 0.23 M_\odot$, and a kinetic energy of $E_\mathrm{SN,K} = 2.35 \times 10^{52} \mathrm{erg}$. We also compare GRB 221009A with other GRB-SN events based on a GRB-associated SN sample, and find that only SN 2003lw and SN 2011kl can be obviously revealed in the afterglow of GRB 221009A by setting these objects at its distance. This suggests that a supernova (SN 2022xiw) is possibly obscured by the brighter afterglow emission from GRB 221009A.

 - **Abstract**
 We report results of intensive time-resolved imaging photometry and synoptic deep imaging of the comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) performed in February 2013. The data were obtained at the Wise Observatory in Israel (WO), at the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in India, and at the Polaris Observatory Association in California, USA. During this period, the comet's heliocentric distance changed from 4.9 to 4.6 AU, just within the orbit of Jupiter. We analyze these early images in an attempt to determine the nuclear rotation period, assuming that at these relatively large heliocentric distances it would be possible to detect the photometric modulation of a rotating nucleus against an underdeveloped coma. Since this is not evident in our February 2013 data, with more than 400 independent photometric measurements analyzed, we can only set upper limits of 0.05 mag for periodic brightness modulations. We discuss (and discount) a possible brightening event (minor outburst) that occurred on $15-16$ February 2013. We also present deep synoptic images of the comet, obtained by combining our exposures for each night, and analyze them. We find that during the period of our observations the comet exhibited a $\sim$$30^{\prime\prime}\simeq 60000$-km tail with no substructures visible and that this appearance did not change throughout our campaign. The comet, as indicated by a single spectroscopic measurement obtained during this observation period, showed a dust coma reflecting the solar light. Our observations indicate that during February 2013, comet ISON was relatively quiet, with the dust coma presumably hiding any light modulation by a spinning nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the dynamics of cosmological models incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), focusing on their stability and causality. We explore two specific NLED models: the Power-Law and Rational Lagrangians. We assess these models' viability in describing the universe's evolution using dynamical systems theory and Bayesian inference. We present the theoretical framework of NLED coupled with general relativity, followed by an analysis of the stability and causality through the squared sound speed of the NLED Lagrangians. We then conduct a detailed dynamical analysis to identify the universe's evolution with this matter content. Our results show that the Power-Law Lagrangian model transitions through various cosmological phases from a Maxwell radiation-dominated state to a matter-dominated state. For the Rational Lagrangian model, including the Maxwell term, stable and causal behavior is observed within specific parameter ranges, with critical points indicating the evolutionary pathways of the universe. To validate our theoretical findings, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using a comprehensive set of observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa). The estimated parameters for both models align with expected values for the current universe, particularly the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the Hubble parameter $h$. However, the parameters $\alpha$ and $b$ are not tightly constrained within the prior ranges. Our model comparison strongly favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the NLED models for late-universe observations, as the NLED model does not exhibit a cosmological constant behavior. Our results highlight the need for further refinement and exploration of NLED-based cosmological models to fully integrate them into the standard cosmological framework.

          Inferring intrahalo light from stellar kinematics -- A deep learning approach

 - **Abstract**
 Disentangling the stellar population in the central galaxy from the intrahalo light can help us shed light on the formation history of the host halo, as the properties of the stellar components are expected to retain traces of its formation history. Many approaches are adopted, depending on different physical assumptions (e.g. the light profile, chemical composition, and kinematical differences) and on whether the full six-dimensional phase-space information is known (much like in simulations) or whether one analyses projected quantities (i.e. observations). This paper paves the way for a new approach to bridge the gap between observational and simulation methods. We propose the use of projected kinematical information from stars in simulations in combination with deep learning to create a robust method for identifying intrahalo light in observational data to enhance understanding and consistency in studying the process of galaxy formation. Using a U-Net, we developed a methodology for predicting these contributions from a sample of mock images from hydrodynamical simulations to train, validate and test the network. Reinforced training (Attention U-Net) was used to improve the first results, as the innermost central regions of the mock images consistently overestimate the stellar intrahalo contribution. Our work shows that adequate training over a representative sample of mock images can lead to good predictions of the intrahalo light distribution. The model is mildly dependent on the training size and its predictions are less accurate when applied to mock images from different simulations. However, the main features (spatial scales and gradients of the stellar fractions) are recovered for all tests. While the method presented here should be considered as a proof of concept, future work is required to enable the application of the proposed model to observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ code is an efficient dark matter simulation suite that flexibly handles the Horndeski family of modified gravity models. In this work we extend the scope of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to accommodate Horndeski theories with K-mouflage screening, allowing for the computation of matter power spectra in the non-linear regime in these models. We explore the boost of the dark matter power spectrum relative to GR-$\Lambda$CDM in K-mouflage gravity, and also discuss how large-scale structure computations change between the Einstein and Jordan frames. A dissection of the relative contributions of the modified background, linear growth, fifth force, and the conformal factor (a new inclusion to $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$) to the boost factor is presented. The ability of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to run with general Horndeski models and multiple screening mechanisms makes it an ideal tool for testing gravity with upcoming galaxy survey data.

 Characterization of atmospheric turbulence is essential to understanding image quality of astronomical telescopes and applying adaptive optics systems. In this study, the vertical distributions of optical turbulence at the Peak Terskol Observatory (43.27472N 42.50083E, 3127 m a.s.l.) using the Era-5 re-analysis, scintillation measurements and sonic anemometer data are investigated. For the reanalysis grid node closest to the observatory, vertical profiles of the structural constant of the air refractive index turbulent fluctuations $C^2_n$ were obtained. The calculated $C^2_n(z)$ vertical profiles are compared with the vertical distribution of turbulence intensity obtained from tomographic measurements with Shack-Hartmann sensor. The Fried parameter r0 at the location of Terskol Peak Observatory was estimated. Using combination of atmospheric models and scheme paramaterization of turbulence, $C^2_n(z)$ profiles at Mt. Kurapdag were obtained. The r0 values at the Peak Terskol Observatory are compared with estimated values of this length at the ten astronomical sites including Ali, Lenghu and Daocheng.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quantitative spectral analysis of the extreme nitrogen-enhanced supergiant HD 93840 (BN1 Ib) at an intermediate galactic latitude. Based on an optical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared (spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full characterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified (photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a marked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for the star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current position above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the supernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition, with a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed shell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield a rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star population scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing to the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The SHALON atmospheric Cherenkov telescope has detected very high energy gamma-ray emission at TeV energies from eight red dwarfs, namely, V388 Cas, V547 Cas, V780 Tau, V962 Tau, V1589 Cyg, GJ 1078, GJ 3684 and GL 851.1. Consequently, these red dwarfs have been suggested as sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this work, we search for soft gamma-ray emission from these TeV bright red dwarfs between 0.75-30 MeV using archival data from the COMPTEL gamma-ray imaging telescope, as a follow-up to a similar search for GeV gamma-ray emission using the Fermi-LAT telescope. Although, prima-facie, we detect non-zero photon flux from three red dwarfs with high significance, these signals can attributed to contamination from nearby sources such as Crab and Cygnus, which are within the angular resolution of COMPTEL, and have been previously detected as very bright point sources at MeV energies. Therefore, we could not detect any statistically significant signal ($>3\sigma$) from any of these eight red dwarfs from 0.75-30 MeV. We then report the 95% confidence level upper limits on the differential photon flux (at 30 MeV), integral photon flux and integral energy flux for all of the eight red dwarfs. The integral energy flux limits range between $10^{-11}-10^{-10} \rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Using new continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey and archival VLA, 4.86 GHz data, we present direct observational evidence of hierarchical triggering relating three epochs of massive star formation in a ring-like H II region, G24.47+0.49. We find from radio flux analysis that it is excited by a massive star(s) of spectral type O8.5V-O8V from the first epoch of star formation. The swept-up ionized ring structure shows evidence of secondary collapse, and within this ring a burst of massive star formation is observed in different evolutionary phases, which constitutes the second epoch. ATOMS spectral line (e.g., HCO$^+$(1-0)) observations reveal an outer concentric molecular gas ring expanding at a velocity of $\sim$ 9 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$, constituting the direct and unambiguous detection of an expanding molecular ring. It harbors twelve dense molecular cores with surface mass density greater than 0.05 $\rm g\,cm^{-2}$, a threshold typical of massive star formation. Half of them are found to be subvirial, and thus in gravitational collapse, making them third epoch of potential massive star-forming sites.

 Low sky brightness is crucial for ground-based astronomical observations, because it limits the observational capability to detect fainter sources. Lenghu, located on the Tibetan Plateau in China, has been identified as an high-quality astronomical site in China, including dark sky in optical band. In this work, we will report the preliminary results of near-infrared sky brightness measurements at Lenghu. Utilizing a wide-field small telescope equipped with an InGaAs camera, we have been conducting long-term monitoring of near-infrared sky brightness in the J and H' bands, respectively, since January 2024. For each image, photometry and astrometry were performed, then sky background was calibrated by standard stars from the 2MASS catalog. This report includes preliminary results on the sky brightness at zenith in the J and H' bands, as well as their variations with solar elevation at Lenghu. Our initial results indicate that the near-infrared sky brightness at Lenghu is comparable to that of other world-class sites, and long-term monitoring will be continued.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol is an abundant molecule in space. The column density of CH$_3^{18}$OH is in some star-forming regions so high that the search for CH$_3^{17}$OH is promising. But only very few transition frequencies of CH$_3^{17}$OH with a microwave accuracy have been published thus far. We recorded the rotational spectrum of CH$_3^{17}$OH between 38 and 1095 GHz employing a methanol sample enriched in $^{17}$O to 20\%. A torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed to fit the data, as in our previous studies. We searched for rotational transitions of CH$_3^{17}$OH in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N). The observed spectra were modeled under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The assignments cover $0 \le J \le 45$, $K_a \le 16$, and mainly the $v_ t = 0$ and 1 torsional states. The Hamiltonian model describes our data well. The model was applied to derive a line list for radio-astronomical observations. We report a tentative detection of CH$_3^{17}$OH along with secure detections of the more abundant isotopologs of methanol toward Sgr B2(N2b). The derived column densities yield isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 25, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = 240, and $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O = 3.3, which are consistent with values found earlier for other molecules in Sgr B2. The agreement between the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O isotopic ratio that we obtained for methanol and the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O ratios reported in the past for other molecules in Sgr B2(N) strongly supports our tentative interstellar identification of CH$_3^{17}$OH. The accuracy of the derived line list is sufficient for further radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog toward other star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied eight new doubly eclipsing stellar systems. We found that they are all rare examples of quadruple systems of 2 + 2 architecture, where both inner pairs are eclipsing binaries. Until now, such a configuration had only been proven for dozens of systems on the whole sky. We enlarged this rare group of systems with four stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy and four brighter stars on the northern sky. These analysed systems are the following: OGLE SMC-ECL-2339 (both eclipsing periods of 0.72884 days and 3.39576 days; mutual orbital period of 5.95 years); OGLE SMC-ECL-3075 (1.35890 d, 2.41587 d, 9.75 yr); OGLE SMC-ECL-4756 (0.91773 d, 2.06047 d, 4.34 yr); OGLE SMC-ECL-6093 (0.90193 d, 2.03033 d, 31.2 yr); GSC 01949-01700 (0.24058 d, 0.75834 d, 21.7 yr); ZTF J171602.61+273606.5 (0.36001 d, 4.51545 d, 19.5 yr); WISE J210935.8+390501 (0.33228 d, 3.51575 d, 1.9 yr); and V597 And (0.46770 d, 0.35250, 20.4 yr). These systems constitute a rare selection of W UMa stars among the doubly eclipsing quadruples. For all of the systems, new dedicated observations were obtained as well. V597 And is definitely the most interesting system for several reasons: (1) the system is the brightest in our sample; (2) it is a rare quintuple (2 + 2) + 1 system; and (3) it is also closest to the Sun. It yielded the predicted angular separation of the two components of 57 mas, which is probably within the detection limits for modern, high-angular-resolution techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging spectroscopy, i.e., the generation of spatially resolved count spectra and of cubes of count maps at different energies, is one of the main goals of solar hard X-ray missions based on Fourier imaging. For these telescopes, so far imaging spectroscopy has been realized via the generation of either count maps independently reconstructed at the different energy channels, or electron flux maps reconstructed via deconvolution of the bremsstrahlung cross-section. Our aim is to introduce the Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy method (RIS), in which regularization implemented in the count space imposes a smoothing constraint across contiguous energy channels, without the need to deconvolve the bremsstrahlung effect. STIX records imaging data computing visibilities in the spatial frequency domain. Our RIS is a sequential scheme in which part of the information coded in the image reconstructed at a specific energy channel is transferred to the reconstruction process at a contiguous channel via visibility interpolation based on Variably Scaled Kernels. In the case of STIX visibilities recorded during the November 11, 2022 flaring event, we show that RIS is able to generate hard X-ray maps whose morphology smoothly evolves from one energy channel to the contiguous one, and that from these maps it is possible to infer spatially-resolved count spectra characterized by notable numerical stability. We also show that the performances of this approach are robust with respect to both the image reconstruction method and the count energy channel utilized to trigger the sequential process. RIS is appropriate to construct image cubes from STIX visibilities that are characterized by a smooth behavior across count energies, thus allowing the generation of numerically stable (and, thus, physically reliable) local count spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances of Sun-like stars are crucial for understanding the detailed properties of their planets. However, measuring elemental abundances in M stars is challenging due to their faintness and pervasive molecular features in optical spectra. To address this, elemental abundances of Sun-like stars have been proposed to constrain those of M stars by scaling [X/H] with measured [Fe/H]. This study tests the robustness of this practice using M- and GK-dwarf stellar abundances and rigorous statistical methods. We compile elemental abundances for 43 M dwarfs for 10 major rock-forming elements (Fe, C, O, Mg, Si, Al, Ca, Na, Ni, and Ti) from high-resolution near-infrared stellar surveys. We perform bootstrap-based linear regressions on the M dwarfs to determine the trends of [X/H] vs. [Fe/H] and compare them with GK dwarfs. A 2-sample, multivariate Mahalanobis Distance test is applied to assess the significance of differences in [X/H]--[Fe/H] trends for individual elemental pairs between M and GK dwarfs. The null hypothesis of no significant difference in chemical trends between M and GK dwarfs is strongly rejected for all elements except Si, for which rejection is marginal, and Na and Ni, for which results are inconclusive. This suggests that assuming no difference may lead to biased results and inaccurate constraints on rocky planets around M dwarfs. Therefore, it is crucial for both the stellar and exoplanet communities to recognise these differences. To better understand these differences, we advocate for dedicated modelling techniques for M dwarf atmospheres and more homogeneous abundance analyses. Our statistically constrained trends of [X/H]--[Fe/H] for M dwarfs offer a new constraint on estimating M-dwarf elemental abundances given measured [Fe/H], aiding in characterising the properties of M dwarf-hosted rocky worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy presents one of the most successful approaches for investigating the atmospheres of exoplanets. We analyzed the near-infrared high-resolution transmission spectrum of a hot Saturn, HD 149026 b, taken using CARMENES spectrograph ($\mathcal{R}\sim80,400$). We found evidence of H$_2$O at an S/N of $\sim$4.8. We also performed grid search using a Bayesian framework and constrained the orbital velocity $K_\mathrm{p}$ and rest velocity $V_{\mathrm{rest}}$ to $158.17^{+8.31}_{-7.90}$ $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $2.57^{+0.54}_{-0.57}$ $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. Whilst the retrieved $K_\mathrm{p}$ value is consistent with theoretical prediction, the retrieved $V_{\mathrm{rest}}$ value is highly red-shifted ($>$3-$\sigma$). This might be an indication of either anomalous atmospheric dynamics at play or an orbit with non-zero eccentricity. Additionally, we searched for HCN but no successful detection has been made possibly due to the relatively low S/N dataset. The detection of H$_2$O and subsequent abundance retrieval, coupled with analysis of other species such as CO at the $K$-band, for example, might help us to get some information about the atmospheric C/O ratio and metallicity, which in turn could give us some insight into the planet formation scenario.

          The radio properties of z>3.5 quasars: Are most high-redshift radio-loud active galactic nuclei obscured?

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the radio properties of powerful (rest-frame luminosity $\gtrsim10^{28}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 500 MHz) high-redshift (z > 3.5) quasars. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of radio-loud sources at the epoch when they reach the highest space density. We selected 29 radio-loud quasars at low radio frequencies (76 MHz). Their radio spectra, covering the range from 76 MHz to 5 GHz, are generally well reproduced by a single power law. We created samples that were matched in radio luminosity at lower redshift (from z~1.3 to z~2.8) to investigate any spectral evolution. We find that the fraction of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) strongly increases with redshift (from ~8% at z=1.2 to ~45% at z>3.5). This effect is also observed in quasars with lower luminosities (down to $\sim 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). The increase in the fraction of FSRQs with redshift corresponds to a decrease in the steep-spectrum radio quasars. This result can be explained, assuming that the beaming factor and the slope of the luminosity function do not change with redshift, if high-redshift radio-loud sources can be recognized as quasars only when they are seen at a small viewing angle ($\lesssim 25^\circ$), while most of them, about 90%, are obscured in the UV and optical bands. We also found a trend for the size of radio sources to decrease with increasing redshift. Because projection effects are insufficient to cause this trend, we suggest that the large amount of gas causing the nuclear obscuration also hampers the growth of the more distant sources.

          Nonparametric signal separation in very-high-energy gamma ray observations with probabilistic neural networks

 - **Abstract**
 An intriguing challenge in observational astronomy is the separation signals in areas where multiple signals intersect. A typical instance of this in very-high-energy (VHE, E$\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray astronomy is the issue of residual background in observations. This background arises when cosmic-ray protons are mistakenly identified as gamma-rays from sources of interest, thereby blending with signals from astrophysical sources of interest. We introduce a deep ensemble approach to determine a non-parametric estimation of source and background signals in VHE gamma observations, as well as a likelihood-derived epistemic uncertainty on these estimations. We rely on minimal assumptions, exploiting the separability of space and energy components in the signals, and defining a small region in coordinate space where the source signal is assumed to be negligible compared to background signal. The model is applied both on mock observations, including a simple toy case and a realistic simulation of dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center, as well as true observations from the public H.E.S.S. data release, specifically datasets of the Crab nebula and the pulsar wind nebula MSH 15-52. Our method performs well in mock cases, where the ground truth is known, and compares favorably against conventional physical analysis approaches when applied to true observations. In the case of the mock dark matter signal in the Galactic center, our work opens new avenues for component separation in this complex region of the VHE sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Three fibre feed integral field units (IFUs), called Slit Mask IFUs (SMI), are being developed in the SAAO fibre-lab for the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS). The smaller, 200 micron fibre IFU (SMI-200) has 309 x 0.9 arcsec diameter spatial elements covering an elongated hexagonal footprint of 18 $\times$ 23 arcsec is now being commissioned. The larger, 300 (400) micron fibre IFU, SMI-300 (SMI-400), has 221 $\times$ 1.35 arcsec (178 $\times$ 1.8 arcsec) diameter spatial elements covering an on-sky area of 18 $\times$ 29 sq. arcsec (21 $\times$ 44 sq. arcsec). In all SMI units there are two groups of 13 fibres offset by roughly 50 arcsec on either side of the primary array to sample sky. SMI-200 provides a median spectral resolution of 2400 at H$\upalpha$ wavelengths in a low resolution mode simultaneously covering 370 to 740 nm. At a higher grating angles the SMI-200 delivers spectral resolution up to 10,000. A future red spectrograph arm for RSS will extend the simultaneous wavelength coverage up to 900 nm at a median resolution of 6000 for the same IFU. With this upcoming red arm and with the fibre-fed, near-infrared spectrograph NIRWALS on SALT, SMI-300 enables wavelength coverage from blue to NIR wavelengths at the same spatial resolution and footprint. The SMI units are inserted in the same fashion as the existing long-slit cassettes at the SALT focal plane. Prismatic fold mirrors direct the focal plane into the fibre IFU and then back into the RSS collimator after the fibres are routed 180 deg within the cassette and formatted into a pseudo-slit. Fold-prisms ensure that the spectrograph collimator continues to see the same focal plane. In this paper we report the laboratory characterization and on-sky commissioning-performance of the first Slit Mask IFU, SMI-200.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectra of singly ionised Strontium and Yttrium (Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}) have been proposed as identifications of certain spectral features in the AT2017gfo spectrum. With the growing demand for NLTE simulations of Kilonovae, there is a increasing need for atomic data for these and other $r$-process elements. Our goal is to expand upon the current set of atomic data for $r$-process elements, by presenting transition probabilities and Maxwellian-averaged effective collision strengths for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}. The Breit-Pauli and DARC $R$-matrix codes are employed to calculate the appropriate collision strengths, which are thermally averaged according to a Maxwellian distribution to calculate excitation and de-excitation rates. The {\sc tardis} and {\sc ColRadPy} packages are subsequently used to perform LTE and NLTE modelling respectively. A complete set of transition probabilities and effective collision strengths involving levels for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} have been calculated for temperature ranges compatible with kilonova plasma conditions. Forbidden transitions were found to disagree heavily with the Axelrod approximation, an approximation which is currently employed by other models within the literature. Theoretically important spectral lines are identified with both LTE and NLTE modelling codes. LTE simulations in {\sc tardis} reveal no new significant changes to the full synthetic spectra. NLTE simulations in {\sc ColRadPy} provide indications of which features are expected to be strong for a range of regimes, and we include luminosity estimates. Synthetic emission spectra over KNe densities and temperatures reveal potentially interesting spectral lines in the NIR.

 - **Abstract**
 Taurus is a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment optimized to map the E-mode polarization and Galactic foregrounds at the largest angular scales ($\ell$ $\lt$ 30) and improve measurements of the optical depth to reionization ($\tau$). This will pave the way for improved measurements of the sum of neutrino masses in combination with high-resolution CMB data while also testing the $\Lambda CDM$ model on large angular scales and providing high-frequency maps of polarized dust foregrounds to the CMB community. These measurements take advantage of the low-loading environment found in the stratosphere and are enabled by NASA's super-pressure balloon platform, which provides access to 70% of the sky with a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. Here we describe a general overview of Taurus, with an emphasis on the instrument design. Taurus will employ more than 10,000 100 mK transition edge sensor bolometers distributed across two low-frequency (150, 220 GHz) and one high-frequency (280, 350 GHz) dichroic receivers. The liquid helium cryostat housing the detectors and optics is supported by a lightweight gondola. The payload is designed to meet the challenges in mass, power, and thermal control posed by the super-pressure platform. The instrument and scan strategy are optimized for rigorous control of instrumental systematics, enabling high-fidelity linear polarization measurements on the largest angular scales.

          Wind line variability and intrinsic errors in observational mass loss rates

 - **Abstract**
 UV wind line variability in OB stars appears to be universal. To quantify this variation and to estimate its effect on a mass loss rate determined from a single observation, we use the IUE archive to identify non-peculiar OB stars with well developed but unsaturated Si IV 1400 doublets and at least 10 independent observations. This resulted in 1699 spectra of 25 stars. We use SEI modelling to translate the profile variations into optical depth variations and, hence, variations in measured mass loss rates. These variations quantify the intrinsic error inherent in any mass loss rate derived from a single observation. The derived rates have an overall RMS variation of about 22%, but this differs with effective temperature, being as small at 8% for the hottest stars and up to 45% for the cooler ones. Furthermore, any single determination can differ from the mean by a factor of 2 or more. Our results also imply that mass loss rates determined from non-simultaneous observations (such as UV and ground based data) need not agree. We also use our results to examine the nature of the wind structures responsible for the variability. Our findings suggest that the optical depth variations result from optically very thick structures occulting more or less of the line of sight to the stellar disk. Further, the smaller optical depth variations in the hottest stars suggests that the responsible structures are disrupted in their more powerful winds.

          How Land-Mass Distribution Influences the Atmospheric Dynamics of Tidally Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially-habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally-locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land-ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres and with the sub-stellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the southern hemisphere are $50\rightarrow100\%$ faster than similar jets in the northern hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material towards the south-pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of land-mass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the day-side land-fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modelling a flat land-mass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.

          First detection of the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ methanol maser transitions at $J=7$ and $10$

 - **Abstract**
 Class\,I methanol masers provide sensitive information about the shocked environment around star-forming regions. Among the brightest Class~I methanol masers, we have those in the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, currently reported for the $J=4-9$ transitions, with the only exception being the $J=7$ one at 181.295~GHz, and never expanded to higher $J$ transitions. We aim to search for population inversion in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transition lines at 181.295 and 326.961\,GHz, respectively, and also extend the number of known low-mass star-forming sources harboring Class\,I methanol masers. We employed the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12\,m telescope to survey low-mass Galactic sources, focusing on methanol emission lines. We conducted rotation diagrams for all sources with detected $J=7$ methanol line transitions, while employing radiative transfer modeling (both in and out of local thermodynamic equilibrium) to characterize methanol excitation conditions in detail for one specific source with detected masers. We have detected the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transitions in six out of nineteen sources. Among them, we firmly determined the $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ maser nature in CARMA\,7, L1641N, NGC\,2024, and Serpens FIRS, and we claim for the presence of inverted population emission in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ line toward CARMA\,7 and L1641N. This represents the first report of methanol maser emission in these particular transitions. Our study supports previous works indicating that conditions for Class\,I methanol maser emission are satisfied in low-mass star-forming regions and expands the range of detectable frequencies toward higher values.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers of stellar populations for old, metal-poor components in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group. Their luminosities have a metallicity-dependence, but determining spectroscopic [Fe/H] metallicities for RR Lyrae stars, especially at distances outside the solar neighbourhood, is challenging. Using 40 RRLs with metallicities derived from both Fe(II) and Fe(I) abundances, we verify the calibration between the [Fe/H] of RR Lyrae stars from the Calcium triplet. Our calibration is applied to all RR Lyrae stars with Gaia RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 as well as to 80 stars in the inner Galaxy from the BRAVA-RR survey. The co-added Gaia RVS RR Lyrae spectra provide RR Lyrae metallicities with an uncertainty of 0.25~dex, which is a factor of two improvement over the Gaia photometric RR Lyrae metallicities. Within our Galactic bulge RR Lyrae star sample, we find a dominant fraction with low energies without a prominent rotating component. Due to the large fraction of such stars, we interpret these stars as belonging to the $in-situ$ metal-poor Galactic bulge component, although we can not rule out that a fraction of these belong to an ancient accretion event such as Kraken/Heracles.
