 - **Abstract**
 Molecular oxygen in our atmosphere has increased from less than a part per million in the Archean Eon, to a fraction of a percent in the Proterozoic, and finally to modern levels during the Phanerozoic. The ozone layer formed with the early Proterozoic oxygenation. While oxygen itself has only minor radiative and climatic effects, the accompanying ozone has important consequences for Earth climate. Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a 3-D general circulation model, we test the effects of various levels of ozone on Earth's climate. When CO2 is held constant, the global mean surface temperature decreases with decreasing ozone, with a maximum drop of ~3.5 K at near total ozone removal. By supplementing our GCM results with 1-D radiative flux calculations, we are able to test which changes to the atmosphere are responsible for this temperature change. We find that the surface temperature change is caused mostly by the stratosphere being much colder when ozone is absent; this makes it drier, substantially weakening the greenhouse effect. We also examine the effect of the structure of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere on the formation of clouds, and on the global circulation. At low ozone, both high and low clouds become more abundant, due to changes in the tropospheric stability. These generate opposing short-wave and long-wave radiative forcings that are nearly equal. The Hadley circulation and tropospheric jet streams are strengthened, while the stratospheric polar jets are weakened, the latter being a direct consequence of the change in stratospheric temperatures. This work identifies the major climatic impacts of ozone, an important piece of the evolution of Earth's atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 From high resolution cosmological simulations of the Local Group in realistic environment, namely HESTIA simulations, we study the position and kinematic deviations that may arise between the disc of a Milky Way (or Andromeda)-like galaxy and its halo. We focus on the 3-dimensional analysis of the centres of mass (COM). The study presents two parts. We first consider individual particles to track down the very nature and amplitude of the physical deviations of the COM with respect to the distance from the disc centre. Dark matter dominates the behaviour of the COM of all particles at all distances. But the total COM is also very close to the COM of stars. In the absence of a significant merger, the velocity offsets are marginal (10 km/s) but the positional shifts can be important compared to the disc characteristics (>10 kpc). In the event of a massive accretion, discrepancies are of the same order as the recent finding for the MW under the Magellanic Clouds influence. In a second part, the accent is put on the study of various populations of subhaloes and satellites. We show that satellites properly represent the entire subhalo population. There exists strong mismatch in phase space between the satellites' COM and the host disc. Moreover, the results are highly inhomogeneous between the simulations, and thus between the accretion histories. Finally, we point out that these shifts are mainly due to a few of the most massive objects.
#### Disentangling Stellar Age Estimates from Galactic Chemodynamical  Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar ages are key for determining the formation history of the Milky Way, but are difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, methods that use chemical abundances to infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the chemodynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework for making probabilistic predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the contribution of both stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those predictions using SHAP values. We apply this interpretable prediction framework to both a simulated Milky Way sample containing stars in a variety of evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red clump stars. We find that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver for age estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution model. We show that as a result of the use of non-intrinsic Galactic chemical information, trends estimated with the predicted ages, such as the age-metallicity relation, can deviate from the truth.

 - **Abstract**
 Episodic accretion is a low-mass pre-main sequence phenomenon characterized by sudden outbursts of enhanced accretion. These objects are classified into two: protostars with elevated levels of accretion that lasts for decades or more, called FUors, and protostars with shorter and repetitive bursts, called EXors. HBC 494 is a FUor object embedded in the Orion Molecular Cloud. Earlier Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) continuum observations showed an asymmetry in the disk at 0.''2 resolution. Here, we present follow-up observations at ~0.''03, resolving the system into two components: HBC 494 N (primary) and HBC 494 S (secondary). No circumbinary disk was detected. Both disks are resolved with a projected separation of ~0.''18 (75 au). Their projected dimensions are 84+/-1.8 x 66.9+/-1.5 mas for HBC 494 N and 64.6+/-2.5 x 46.0+/-1.9 mas for HBC 494 S. The disks are almost aligned and with similar inclinations. The observations show that the primary is ~5 times brighter/more massive and ~2 times bigger than the secondary. We notice that the northern component has a similar mass to the FUors, while the southern has to EXors. The HBC 494 disks show individual sizes that are smaller than single eruptive YSOs. In this work, we also report 12CO, 13CO, and C18O molecular line observations. At large scale, the 12CO emission shows bipolar outflows, while the 13CO and C18O maps show a rotating and infalling envelope around the system. At a smaller scale, the 12CO and 13CO moment zero maps show cavities within the continuum disks' area, which may indicate continuum over-subtraction or slow-moving jets and chemical destruction along the line-of-sight.

 - **Abstract**
 What is the nature of a star forming clump? Observations reveal these to be chaotic environments being modified and influenced by many physical processes. However, numerical simulations often define these initial star forming clumps to be idealised objects. In this paper, we define and analyse 109 star forming clumps extracted from our previous low-mass star cluster simulations. To define a clump, we identify all the gas in a simulation that ever becomes bound to or accreted onto a star, then follow the gas backwards in time until it decreases to a critical density. This gas, and its neighbouring gas, is defined as our star forming clump. Our clumps span a mass range of $0.15 \lesssim M/$M$_\odot \lesssim 10.2$, while the density range within each clump spans 2--4 orders of magnitude. The gas density distribution is not smooth, indicating that it is highly structured. The clumps are turbulent, with no coherent rotation. Independent of the initial magnetic field strength of the parent cloud, all clumps yield a similar range of field strengths. The clump magnetic field is ordered, but not reflective of the initial field geometry of the parent cloud. In general, most clump properties have a slight trend with clump mass but are independent of (or only very weakly dependent on) the properties of the parent cloud. We conclude that stars are born from a wide variety of environments and there is not a single universal star forming clump.
#### Solution To The Cosmic Rays Puzzle ?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations provide compelling evidence that the bulk of the high energy cosmic rays (CRs) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are co-produced by highly relativistic jets of plasmoids of stellar matter. These jets are launched by fall back matter on newly born neutron stars and stellar black holes in core collapse of stripped envelope massive stars with or without an associated supernova. The electrons in the plasmoids produce GRB pulses mainly by inverse Compton scattering of photons on their path, while magnetic reflection of the charged particles produces the high energy cosmic rays.
#### Formation of complex organic molecules on interstellar CO ices? Insights  from computational chemistry simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon ($^3$P) atom is a reactive species that, according to laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations, condensates with interstellar ice components. This fact is of uttermost importance for the chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM) because the condensation reaction is barrierless and the subsequent species formed are still reactive given their open-shell character. Carbon condensation on CO-rich ices forms the \ch{C=C=O} ($^3$$\Sigma$$^-$) species, which can be easily hydrogenated twice to form ketene (H$_2$CCO). Ketene is very reactive in terrestrial conditions, usually found as an intermediate hard to be isolated in chemical synthesis laboratories. These characteristics suggest that ketene can be a good candidate to form interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) via a two-step process, i.e., its activation followed by a radical-radical coupling. In this work, reactions between ketene and atomic H, and the OH and NH$_2$ radicals on a CO-rich ice model have been explored by means of quantum chemical calculations complemented by kinetic calculations to evaluate if they are favourable in the ISM. Results indicate that H addition to ketene (helped by tunneling) to form the acetyl radical (CH$_3$CO) is the most preferred path, as the reactions with OH and NH$_2$ possess activation energies ($\geq$ 9kJ/mol) hard to surmount in the ISM conditions, unless external processes provide energy to the system. Thus, acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) and, probably, ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) formation via further hydrogenations are the possible unique operating synthetic routes. Moreover, from the computed relatively large binding energies of OH and NH$_2$ on CO ice, slow diffusion is expected, hampering possible radical-radical couplings with CH$_3$CO. The astrophysical implications of these findings are discussed considering the incoming James Webb Space Telescope observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from a search for gravitational-wave transients associated with core-collapse supernovae observed optically within 30 Mpc during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. No gravitational wave associated with a core-collapse supernova has been identified. We then report the detection efficiency for a variety of possible gravitational-wave emissions. For neutrino-driven explosions, the distance at which we reach 50% detection efficiency is up to 8.9 kpc, while more energetic magnetorotationally-driven explosions are detectable at larger distances. The distance reaches for selected models of the black hole formation, and quantum chromodynamics phase transition are also provided. We then constrain the core-collapse supernova engine across a wide frequency range from 50 Hz to 2 kHz. The upper limits on gravitational-wave energy and luminosity emission are at low frequencies down to $10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$ and $5 \times 10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$/s, respectively. The upper limits on the proto-neutron star ellipticity are down to 5 at high frequencies. Finally, by combining the results obtained with the data from the first and second observing runs of LIGO and Virgo, we improve the constraints of the parameter spaces of the extreme emission models. Specifically, the proto-neutron star ellipticities for the long-lasting bar mode model are down to 1 for long emission (1 s) at high frequency.
#### A Parametric Model for Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16176
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a parametric model for studying self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The model uses an analytical density profile, calibrated using a controlled N-body SIDM simulation that covers the entire gravothermal evolution, including core-forming and -collapsing phases. By normalizing the calibrated density profile, we obtain a universal description for SIDM halos at any evolution phase. The model allows us to infer properties of SIDM halos based on their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts. As a basic application, we only require two characteristic parameters of an isolated CDM halo at $z=0$. We then extend the model to incorporate effects induced by halo mass changes, such as major mergers or tidal stripping, making it applicable to both isolated halos and subhalos. The parametric model is tested and validated using cosmological zoom-in SIDM simulations available in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) is NASA's next astrophysics flagship mission, expected to launch in late 2026. As one of Roman's core community science surveys, the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) will collect photometric and astrometric data for over 100 million stars in the Galactic bulge to search for microlensing planets. To assess the potential with which Roman can detect exoplanets via transit, we developed and conducted pixel-level simulations of transiting planets in the GBTDS. From these simulations, we predict that Roman will find between $\sim$60,000 and $\sim$200,000 transiting planets, over an order of magnitude more planets than are currently known. While the majority of these planets will be giants ($R_p>4R_\oplus$) on close-in orbits ($a<0.3$ au), the yield also includes between $\sim$7,000 and $\sim$12,000 small planets ($R_p<4 R_\oplus$). The yield for small planets depends sensitively on the observing cadence and season duration, with variations on the order of $\sim$10-20% for modest changes in either parameter, but is generally insensitive to the trade between surveyed area and cadence given constant slew/settle times. These predictions depend sensitively on the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function, highlighting an incredible opportunity to understand exoplanet demographics across a comprehensive set of stellar populations and Galactic environments.
#### Spectroscopic survey of faint planetary-nebula nuclei. II. The subdwarf  O central star of Fr 2-30

 - **Abstract**
 Fr 2-30 = PN? G126.8-15.5 is a faint emission nebula, hosting a 14th-mag central star that we identify here for the first time. Deep Halpha and [O III] images reveal a roughly elliptical nebula with dimensions of at least 22'x14', fading into a surrounding network of even fainter emission. Optical spectrograms of the central star show it to have a subdwarf O spectral type, with a Gaia parallax distance of 890 pc. A model-atmosphere analysis gives parameters of Teff = 60,000 K, log g = 6.0, and a low helium content of nHe/nH = 0.0017. The location of the central star in the log g -- Teff plane is inconsistent with a post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolutionary status. Two alternatives are that it is a helium-burning post-extreme-horizontal-branch object, or a hydrogen-burning post-red-giant-branch star. In either case the evolutionary ages are so long that a detectable planetary nebula (PN) should not be present. We find evidence for a variable radial velocity (RV), suggesting that the star is a close binary. However, there are no photometric variations, and the spectral-energy distribution rules out a companion earlier than M2 V. The RVs of the star and surrounding nebula are discordant, and the nebula lacks typical PN morphology. We suggest that Fr 2-30 is a "PN mimic" -- the result of a chance encounter between the hot sdO star and an interstellar cloud. However, we note the puzzling fact that there are several nuclei of genuine PNe that are known to be in evolutionary states similar to that of the Fr 2-30 central star.
#### A New Forced Photometry Service for the Zwicky Transient Facility

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16279
 - **Abstract**
 We describe the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Forced Photometry Service (ZFPS) as developed and maintained by the ZTF Science Data System Team at IPAC/Caltech. The service is open for public use following a subscription. The ZFPS has been operational since early 2020 and has been used to generate publication quality lightcurves for a myriad of science programs. The ZFPS has been recently upgraded to allow users to request forced-photometry lightcurves for up to 1500 sky positions per request in a single web-application submission. The underlying software has been recoded to take advantage of a parallel processing architecture with the most compute-intensive component rewritten in C and optimized for the available hardware. The ZTF processing cluster consists of 66 compute nodes, each hosting at least 16 physical cores. The compute nodes are generally idle following nightly real-time processing of the ZTF survey data and when other ad hoc processing tasks have been completed. The ZFPS and associated infrastructure at IPAC/Caltech therefore enable thousands of forced-photometry lightcurves to be generated along with a wealth of quality metrics to facilitate analyses and filtering of bad quality data prior to scientific use.
