#### A VLBI Proper Motion Analysis of the Recoiling Supermassive Black Hole  Candidate Mrk 1018

 - **Abstract**
 Mrk 1018 is a nearby changing-look AGN that has oscillated between spectral Type 1.9 and Type 1 over a period of 40 years. Recently, a recoiling supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario has been proposed to explain the spectral and flux variability observed in this AGN. Detections of rSMBHs are important for understanding the processes by which SMBH binaries merge and how rSMBHs influence their galactic environment through feedback mechanisms. However, conclusive identification of any rSMBHs has remained elusive to date. In this paper, we present an analysis of 6.5 years of multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) monitoring of Mrk 1018. We find that the radio emission is compact down to 2.4 pc, and displays flux density and spectral variability over the length of our campaign, typical of a flat spectrum radio core. We observe proper motion in RA of the radio core at -36.4 $\pm$ 8.6 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ (4.2$\sigma$), or $0.10c \pm 0.02c$ at the redshift of Mrk 1018. No significant proper motion is found in DEC (31.3 $\pm$ 25.1 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$). We discuss possible physical mechanisms driving the proper motion, including a rSMBH. We conclude that the apparent velocity we observe of the VLBI radio core is too high to reconcile with theoretical predictions of rSMBH velocities and that the proper motion is most likely dominated by an unresolved, outflowing jet component. Future observations may yet reveal the true nature of Mrk 1018. However, our observations are not able to confirm it as a true rSMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanism of globular clusters (GCs) has long been debated by astronomers. It was recently proposed that Supersonically Induced Gas Objects (SIGOs), which formed in the early Universe due to the supersonic relative motion of baryons and dark matter at recombination, could be the progenitors of early globular clusters. In order to become GCs, SIGOs must form stars relatively efficiently despite forming outside of dark matter halos. We investigate the potential for star formation in SIGOs using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, including the aforementioned relative motions of baryons and dark matter, molecular hydrogen cooling in primordial gas clouds, and including explicit star formation. We find that SIGOs do form stars and that the nascent star clusters formed through this process are accreted by dark matter halos on short timescales (a few hundreds of Myr). Thus, SIGOs may be found as intact substructures within these halos, analogous to many present-day GCs. From this result, we conclude that SIGOs are capable of forming star clusters with similar properties to globular clusters in the early Universe and we discuss their detectablity by upcoming JWST surveys.
#### HI Absorption in Low-power Radio AGNs Detected by FAST

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of three HI absorbers toward low-power radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a pilot HI absorption survey with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Compared to past studies, FAST observations have explored lower radio powers by $\sim$0.4 dex and detected these weakest absorbers at given redshifts. By comparing the gas properties and kinematics of sources along radio powers, we aim to explore the interplay between AGN and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). Compared to brighter sources at similar redshifts, our observations suggest a slightly lower detection rate of HI absorption lines ($\sim$$11.5\%$) in low-power radio AGNs with $\text{log}(P_{\text{1.4 GHz}}/\text{W Hz}^{-1})=21.8-23.7$. The low-power sources with $\text{log}(P_{\text{1.4 GHz}}/\text{W Hz}^{-1})<23$ have a lower detection rate of $\sim$$6.7\%$. Due to the incompleteness of the sample, these detection rates may represent the lower limits. The selection of more extended sources and dilution by HI emission at lower redshifts may contribute to the lower detection rate of HI absorption lines. These detected absorbers present relatively narrow line widths and comparable column densities consistent with previous observations. One absorber has a symmetric profile with a large velocity offset, while the other two show asymmetric profiles that can be decomposed into multiple components, suggesting various possibilities of gas origins and kinematics. These HI absorbers may have connections with rotating disks, gas outflows, galactic gas clouds, gas fueling of the AGN, and jet-ISM interactions, which will be further investigated with the upcoming systematic survey and spatially resolved observations.
#### The Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle  Distribution Reveal a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the  Galactic Plane

 - **Abstract**
 We have examined the distribution of the position angle (PA) of the Galactic center filaments with lengths $L > 66''$ and $ < 66''$ as well as their length distribution as a function of PA. We find bimodal PA distributions of the filaments, long and short populations of radio filaments. Our PA study shows the evidence for a distinct population of short filaments with PA close to the Galactic plane. Mainly thermal short radio filaments ($<66''$) have PAs concentrated close to the Galactic plane within $60^\circ < \rm PA <120^\circ$. Remarkably, the short filament PAs are radial with respect to the Galactic center at $l <0^\circ$, and extend in the direction toward Sgr A*. On a smaller scale, the prominent Sgr E HII complex G358.7-0.0 provides a vivid example of the nearly radial distribution of short filaments. The bimodal PA distribution suggests different origin for two distinct filament populations. We argue that alignment of the short filament population results from the ram pressure of a degree-scale outflow from Sgr A* that exceeds the internal filament pressure, and aligns them along the Galactic plane. The ram pressure is estimated to be 2$\times10^6\,$ cm$^{-3}\,$ K at a distance of 300pc, requiring biconical mass outflow rate $10^{-4}$ \msol\, yr$^{-1}$ with an opening angle of $\sim40^\circ$. This outflow aligns not only the magnetized filaments along the Galactic plane but also accelerates thermal material associated with embedded or partially embedded clouds. This places an estimate of $\sim$6 Myr as the age of the outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of all archival 5--14 micron spectra of field ultracool dwarfs from the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope has shown that absorption by silicates in the 8--11 micron region is seen in most L-type (1300 K to 2200 K) dwarfs. The absorption is caused by silicate-rich clouds in the atmospheres of L dwarfs and is strongest at L4--L6 spectral types. Herein we compare averages of the mid-infrared silicate absorption signatures of L3--L7 dwarfs that have low ($\lesssim$10$^{4.5}$ cm s$^{-2}$) vs.\ high ($\gtrsim$10$^5$ cm s$^{-2}$) surface gravity. We find that the silicate absorption feature is sensitive to surface gravity and indicates a difference in grain size and composition between dust condensates in young and old mid-L dwarfs. The mean silicate absorption profile of low-gravity mid-L dwarfs matches expectations for $\sim$1 micron-sized amorphous iron- and magnesium-bearing pyroxene (Mg$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$SiO$_3$) grains. High-gravity mid-L dwarfs have silicate absorption better represented by smaller ($\lesssim$0.1 $\mu$m) and more volatile amorphous enstatite (MgSiO$_3$) or SiO grains. This is the first direct spectroscopic evidence for gravity-dependent sedimentation of dust condensates in ultracool atmospheres. It confirms theoretical expectations for lower sedimentation efficiencies in low-gravity atmospheres and independently confirms their increased dustiness.
#### Rapid Variability of the accretion disk wind in the narrow line Seyfert  1, PG 1448+273

 - **Abstract**
 PG 1448+273 is a luminous, nearby ($z=0.0645$), narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy, which likely accretes close to the Eddington limit. XMM-Newton observations of PG 1448+273 in 2017 revealed the presence of an ultra fast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron K absorption profile, with an outflow velocity of about $0.1c$. Here, the first NuSTAR observation of PG 1448+273, performed in 2022 and coordinated with XMM-Newton is presented, which shows remarkable variability of its ultra fast outflow. The average count rate is a factor of 2 lower during the last 60 ks of the NuSTAR observation, where a much faster component of the ultra fast outflow was detected with a terminal velocity of $0.26\pm0.04c$. This is significantly faster than the outflow component which was initially detected in 2017, when overall PG 1448+273 was observed at a lower X-ray flux and which implies an order of magnitude increase in the wind kinetic power between the 2017 and 2022 epochs. Furthermore, the rapid variability of the ultra fast outflow in 2022, on timescales down to 10 ks, suggests we are viewing through a highly inhomogeneous disk wind in PG 1448+273, where the passage of a denser wind clump could account for the increase in obscuration in the last 60 ks of the NuSTAR observation.

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsar B0458+46 was previously believed to have a distance of about 1.3$~$kpc and to be associated with a nearby supernova remnant, SNR HB9 (G160.9+2.6). We observe the neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption spectrum of PSR B0458+46 by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), and detect two absorption lines at radial velocities of $V_{\rm LSR} = {-7.7}~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ and $-28.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$. Based on the Galactic rotation curve with a modification factor correcting for the systematic stream in the anticenter region, we derive the kinematic distance of the farther absorption clouds, which are found to be located $2.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ kpc away, just beyond the Perseus Arm. We also obtain a direct distance estimation of the absorption clouds, being $2.3_{-0.7}^{+1.1}$ kpc, based on a comparison of their velocity with the HI emission in the Perseus and Outer Arms that was well-defined by recently measured parallax tracers. As a result, we conclude that PSR B0458+46 should be located beyond the Perseus Arm, with a lower limit distance of 2.7 kpc, and therefore not associated with SNR HB9. The doubled distance indicates a deficiency of thermal electrons in the immediate outer Galaxy, with much less density than current models predict. Additionally, we detect a new high-velocity HI cloud in the direction of this pulsar.
#### Inaccuracies and biases of the Gaussian size deconvolution for extracted  sources and filaments

 - **Abstract**
 A simple Gaussian size deconvolution method is routinely used to remove the blur of observed images caused by insufficient angular resolutions of existing telescopes, thereby to estimate the physical sizes of extracted sources and filaments. The size deconvolution method is expected to work when the structures, as well as the telescope beams, have Gaussian shapes. This study employs model images of the spherical and cylindrical objects with Gaussian and power-law shapes, representing the dense cores and filaments. The images are convolved to a wide range of angular resolutions to probe various degrees of resolvedness of the models. Simplified flat, convex, and concave backgrounds are added to the images, then planar backgrounds across the footprints of the structures are subtracted and sizes are measured and deconvolved. When background subtraction is inaccurate, the structures acquire profoundly non-Gaussian profiles. The deconvolved half maximum sizes can be strongly under- or overestimated, by factors of up to ~20 when the structures are unresolved or partially resolved. For resolved structures, the errors are within a factor of ~2, although for some power-law models show the factors of up to ~6. The size deconvolution method cannot be applied to unresolved structures, it can be used only for the Gaussian-like structures, including the critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres, when they are at least partially resolved. The method must be considered inapplicable for the power-law structures with shallow profiles. This work also reveals subtle properties of convolution for different geometries. When convolved with different kernels, spherical objects and cylindrical filaments with identical profiles obtain different widths and shapes. A filament, imaged by the telescope with a non-Gaussian PSF, could appear substantially shallower than the structure is in reality, even when it is resolved.
#### HYPERION. Merger and outflow in the most luminous $z>6$ quasar

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA deep observations of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m emission line and the continuum at 253 GHz and 99 GHz towards SDSS J0100+2802 at $z\simeq 6.3$, the most luminous QSO at z$>$6. It belongs to the HYPERION sample of luminous QSOs at $z\sim 6-7.5$. The observations (at 2.2$''$ resolution in band 3 and 0.9$''$ resolution in band 6) are optimized to detect extended emission around the QSO. We detect a merging, tidally disrupted companion both in [CII] and in continuum, stretching on scales up to 20 kpc from the quasar, with a knotty morphology. For the newly-detected companion we estimate a dust mass of $M_{\rm dust}=(0.6-4.3)\times 10^7\ \rm M_\odot$, an SFR in the range $[43-402]\ \rm M_\odot$, that is remarkably similar to the SFR of the QSO, and a neutral gas mass of $M_{\rm HI}=3.3\times 10^9\ \rm M_{\odot}$, suggesting that both the QSO and its companion are gas rich and that the major merging may be at the origin of the boosted star formation. This close merging companion is undetected by deep JWST imaging observations, supporting the effectiveness of ALMA in detecting dust obscured sources especially in the vicinity of optically bright quasars. We also detect a broad blueshifted component in the [CII] spectrum aligned with the radio jet of the QSO, suggesting that this may be the first detection of a radio jet - driven outflow at such high redshift. We estimate a mass outflow rate in the range $\dot{M}_{\rm out}=(115-269)\ \rm M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$. The outflow energetics is similar to that of ionized outflows found in other QSOs host at lower redshift, and the low momentum loading factor suggests that this outflow would not be very effective in removing the gas from the entire galaxy. These results highlight the importance of deep medium-resolution ALMA observations for the study of QSOs and their environment at the Epoch of Reionization.
#### In-situ enrichment in heavy elements of hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Radius and mass measurements of short-period giant planets reveal that many of these planets contain a large amount of heavy elements, in sharp contrast with the expectations of the conventional core-accretion model for the origin of giant planets. Aims: The proposed explanations for the heavy-element enrichment of giant planets fall short of explaining the most enriched planets. We look for additional processes that can explain the full envelope of inferred enrichments. Methods: We revisit the dynamics of pebbles and dust in the vicinity of giant planets using analytic estimates. Although our results are derived in the framework of a viscous alpha-disk we also discuss the case of disks driven by angular momentum removal in magnetized winds. Results: When giant planets are far from the star, dust and pebbles are confined in a pressure bump at the outer edge of the planet-induced gap. Instead, when the planets reach the inner part of the disk (r << 2 au), dust penetrates the gap together with the gas. The dust/gas ratio can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude if radial drift of dust is not impeded farther out by other barriers. Thus, hot planets undergoing runaway gas accretion can swallow a large amount of dust. Conclusions: Whereas the gas accreted by giant planets in the outer disk is very dust-poor, that accreted by hot planets can be extremely dust-rich. Thus, provided that a large fraction of the atmosphere of hot-Jupiters is accreted in situ, a large amount of dust can be accreted as well. We draw a distinction between this process and pebble accretion, which is ineffective at small stellocentric radii, even for super-Earths. Giant planets farther out in the disk are extremely effective barriers against the flow of pebbles and dust across their gap.
#### SOFIA/HAWC+ far-infrared polarimetric large area CMZ exploration  (fireplace) survey I: General results from the pilot program

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first data release (DR1) of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. The survey was taken using the 214-micron band of the HAWC+ instrument with the SOFIA telescope (19.6" resolution; 0.7 pc). In this first data release we present dust polarization observations covering a ~0.5degree region of the Galactic Center's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), centered on the Sgr B2 complex. We detect ~25,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors, after applying the standard SOFIA cuts for minimum signal-to-noise in fractional polarization and total intensity of 3 and 200, respectively. Analysis of the magnetic field orientation suggests a bimodal distribution in the field direction. This bimodal distribution shows enhancements in the distribution of field directions for orientations parallel and perpendicular to the Galactic plane, which is suggestive of a CMZ magnetic field configuration with polodial and torodial components. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of individual clouds included in our survey (i.e., Sgr B2, Sgr B2-NW, Sgr B2-Halo, Sgr B1, and Clouds-E/F) shows these clouds have fractional polarization values of 1-10% at 214-micron, with most of the emission having values <5%. A few of these clouds (i.e., Sgr B2, Clouds-E/F) show relatively low fractional polarization values toward the cores of the cloud, with higher fractional polarization values toward the less dense periphery. We also observe higher fractional polarization towards compact HII regions which could indicate an enhancement in the grain alignment in the dust surrounding these sources.
