#### Title:
          The cosmic timeline implied by the highest redshift quasars

 - **Abstract**
 The conventional picture of supermassive black-hole growth in the standard model had already been seriously challenged by the emergence of $\sim 10^9\;M_\odot$ quasars at $z\sim 7.5$, conflicting with the predicted formation of structure in the early $\Lambda$CDM Universe. But the most recent {\it JWST} discovery of a $\sim 10^8\;M_\odot$ source at $z\sim 10.1$ argues even more strongly against the possibility that these black holes were created in Pop II or III supernovae, followed by Eddington-limited accretion. Attempts at resolving this anomaly have largely focused on the formation of seeds via an exotic, direct collapse of primordial gas to an initial mass $\sim 10^5\;M_\odot$ -- a process that has never been seen anywhere in the cosmos. Our goal in this {\it Letter} is to demonstrate that the emergence of these black holes is instead fully consistent with standard astrophysics in the context of the alternative Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe. We show that, while the predicted evolution in the standard model is overly compressed, the creation, growth and appearance of such high-$z$ quasars fall comfortably within the evolutionary history in this cosmology, thereby adding considerable observational support to the existing body of evidence favoring it over the standard scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing (WL) convergence peaks contain valuable cosmological information in the regime of non-linear collapse. Using the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we study the physical origin and redshift distributions of the objects generating WL peaks selected from a WL convergence map mimicking a $\textit{Euclid}$ signal. We match peaks to individual haloes and show that the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$~>~5$) WL peaks measured by Stage IV WL surveys primarily trace $M_{\mathrm{200c}} > 10^{14}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ haloes. We find that the WL peak sample can compete with the purity and completeness of state-of-the-art X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster abundance inferences. By comparing the distributions predicted by simulation variations that have been calibrated to the observed gas fractions of local clusters and the present-day galaxy stellar mass function, or shifted versions of these, we illustrate that the shape of the redshift distribution of SNR$~>~5$ peaks is insensitive to baryonic physics while it does change with cosmology. The difference highlights the potential of using WL peaks to constrain cosmology. As the number density of WL peaks scales differently with cosmology and baryonic feedback, WL peak statistics can simultaneously calibrate baryonic feedback and constrain cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerous aspects of the evolution of the LP 890-9 (SPECULOOS-2/TOI-4306) planetary system, focusing on the likelihood that planet c can support life. We find that the host star reaches the main sequence in 1 Gyr and that planet c lies close to the inner boundary of the habitable zone. We find the magma ocean stage can last up to 50 Myr, remove 8 Earth-oceans of water, and leave up to 2000 bars of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, if the planet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water will be lost during the star's pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape processes. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion resonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal dissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of mantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c's orbit may require more than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach hundreds of terawatts. We thus conclude that the habitability of planet c depends most strongly on the initial volatile content and internal properties, but no data yet preclude the viability of an active biosphere on the planet.

          Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) -- I. First steps towards commensal surveys with VLBI

 - **Abstract**
 The high angular resolution and sensitivity of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offer a unique tool to identify and study active galactic nuclei and star-formation activity over cosmic time. However, despite recent technical advances, such as multiple phase centre correlation, VLBI surveys have thus far been limited to either a few well-studied deep-fields or wide-areas to a relatively shallow depth. To enter the era of extensive statistical studies at high angular resolution, a significantly larger area of the sky must be observed to much better sensitivity with VLBI. The Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) is a proposed commensal observing mode for the EVN and e-MERLIN, where single-target principle investigator-led observations are re-correlated at the position of known radio sources within 12 arcmin of the pointing centre. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this methodology by detecting a 5.6 mJy core-jet object at 1.7 GHz that would have otherwise been lost from the parent data set. This is the first object to be recovered as part of the SWEEPS pilot programme, which highlights the potential for increasing sample sizes of VLBI-detected radio sources with commensal observing modes in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to poor observational constraints on the low-mass end of the subhalo mass function, the detection of dark matter (DM) subhalos on sub-galactic scales would provide valuable information about the nature of DM. Stellar wakes, induced by passing DM subhalos, encode information about the mass of the inducing perturber and thus serve as an indirect probe for the DM substructure within the Milky Way (MW). Our aim is to assess the viability and performance of deep learning searches for stellar wakes in the Galactic stellar halo caused by DM subhalos of varying mass. We simulate massive objects (subhalos) moving through a homogeneous medium of DM and star particles, with phase-space parameters tailored to replicate the conditions of the Galaxy at a specific distance from the Galactic center. The simulation data is used to train deep neural networks with the purpose of inferring both the presence and mass of the moving perturber, and assess subhalo detectability in varying conditions of the Galactic stellar and DM halos. We find that our binary classifier is able to infer the presence of subhalos, showing non-trivial performance down to a subhalo mass of $5 \times 10^7 \rm \, M_\odot$. We also find that our binary classifier is generalisable to datasets describing subhalo orbits at different Galactocentric distances. In a multiple-hypothesis case, we are able to discern between samples containing subhalos of different masses. Out of the phase-space observables available to us, we conclude that overdensity and velocity divergence are the most important features for subhalo detection performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the origin and orbital evolution of S-stars in the Galactic Center using models of binary disruption and relaxation processes. We focus on explaining the recently discovered "zone of avoidance" in S-star orbital parameters, defined as a region where no S-stars are observed with pericenters $\log(r_p / {\rm AU}) \leq 1.57 + 2.6(1 - e)$ pc. We demonstrate that the observed S-star orbital distributions, including this zone of avoidance and their thermal eccentricity distribution, can be largely explained by continuous disruption of binaries near the central supermassive black hole, followed by orbital relaxation. Our models consider binaries originating from large scales (5--100 pc) and incorporate empirical distributions of binary properties. We simulate close encounters between binaries and the black hole, tracking the remnant stars' orbits. The initially highly eccentric orbits of disrupted binary remnants evolve due to non-resonant and resonant relaxation in the Galactic Center potential. While our results provide insights into the formation mechanism of S-stars, there are limitations, such as uncertainties in the initial binary population and mass-function and simplifications in our relaxation models. Despite these caveats, our study demonstrates the power of using S-star distributions to probe the dynamical history and environment of the central parsec of our Galaxy.

          The imprint of cosmic voids from the DESI Legacy Survey DR9 LRGs in the Planck 2018 lensing map through spectroscopically calibrated mocks

 - **Abstract**
 The cross-correlation of cosmic voids with the lensing convergence ($\kappa$) map of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations provides a powerful tool to refine our understanding of the cosmological model. However, several studies have reported a moderate tension between the lensing imprint of cosmic voids on the observed CMB and the simulated $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM signal. To address this "lensing-is-low" tension and to obtain new, precise measurements, we exploit the large DESI Legacy Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) dataset, covering approximately 19,500 $°^2$ of the sky and including about 10 million LRGs at $z < 1.05$. Our $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM template was created using the Buzzard mocks, which we specifically calibrated to match the clustering properties of the observed galaxy sample by exploiting more than one million DESI spectra. We identified our catalogs of 3D voids in the range $0.35 < z < 0.95$, dividing the sample into bins according to the redshift and $\lambda_\mathrm{v}$ values of the voids. We report a 14$\sigma$ detection of the lensing signal, with $A_\kappa = 1.016 \pm 0.054$, which increases to 17$\sigma$ when considering the void-in-void ($A_\kappa = 0.944 \pm 0.064$) and the void-in-cloud ($A_\kappa = 0.975 \pm 0.060$) populations individually, the highest detection significance for studies of this kind. We observe a full agreement between the observations and $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM predictions across all redshift bins, sky regions, and void populations considered. In addition to these findings, our analysis highlights the importance of matching sparseness and redshift error distributions between mocks and observations, as well as the role of $\lambda_\mathrm{v}$ in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection and characterization of TOI-4994b (TIC 277128619b), a warm Saturn-sized planet discovered by the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-4994b transits a G-type star (V = 12.6 mag) with a mass, radius, and effective temperature of $M_{\star} =1.005^{+0.064}_{-0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{\star} = 1.055^{+0.040}_{-0.037} R_{\odot}$, and $T_{\rm eff} = 5640 \pm 110$ K. We obtained follow-up ground-based photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and the Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) telescopes, and we confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-4994b with multiple radial velocity observations from the PFS, CHIRON, HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE instruments. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities, we determine that TOI-4994b is in a 21.5-day, eccentric orbit ($e = 0.32 \pm 0.04$) and has a mass of $M_{P}= 0.280^{+0.037}_{-0.034} M_{J}$, a radius of $R_{P}= 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.027}R_{J}$, and a Saturn-like bulk density of $\rho_{p} = 0.78^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ $\rm g/cm^3$. We find that TOI-4994 is a potentially viable candidate for follow-up stellar obliquity measurements. TOI-4994b joins the small sample of warm Saturn analogs and thus sheds light on our understanding of these rare and unique worlds.

          Accretion of Uranus and Neptune: confronting different giant impact scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 The origins of Uranus and Neptune are not fully understood. Their inclined rotation axes -- obliquities -- suggest that they experienced giant impacts during their formation histories. Simulations modeling their accretion from giant impacts among ~5 Earth masses planetary embryos -- with roughly unity impactors' mass ratios -- have been able to broadly match their current masses, final mass ratio, and obliquity. However, due to angular momentum conservation, planets produced in these impacts tend to rotate too fast, compared to Uranus and Neptune. One potential solution for this problem consists of invoking instead collisions of objects with large mass ratios (e.g. a proto-Uranus with 13 Mearth and an embryo of 1 Mearth). Smooth-particle hydrodynamics simulations show that in this scenario final planets tend to have rotation periods more consistent with those of Uranus and Neptune. Here we performed a large suite of N-body numerical simulations modelling the formation of Uranus and Neptune to compare these different dynamical views. Our simulations start with a population of protoplanets and account for the effects of type-I migration, inclination and eccentricity tidal damping. Our results show that although scenarios allowing for large impactors' mass ratio favour slower rotating planets, the probability of occurring collisions in these specific simulations is significantly low. This is because gas tidal damping is relatively less efficient for low-mass embryos (<~1 Merath) and, consequently, such objects are mostly scattered by more massive objects (~13 Mearth) instead of colliding with them. Altogether, our results show that the probability of broadly matching the masses, mass ratio, and rotation periods of Uranus and Neptune in these two competing formation scenarios is broadly similar, within a factor of ~2, with overall probabilities of the order of ~0.1-1%.

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in Chastain et al. (2023). We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanation for the variability. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.

          Exomoons of Circumbinary Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Exomoon discovery is on the horizon. Although several exomoon candidates exist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around circumbinary planets (CBPs). Circumbinary planets are predicted to have migrated to their current location from a farther region of the protoplanetary disc where they formed. An exomoon of a CBP therefore represents a fascinating yet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would shed light on the robustness of moon formation in more dynamically active planetary systems. In this work, we simulate exomoons around migrating CBPs. We show that for fully migrated CBPs a moon is capable of surviving the migration if it is formed within ~5-10% of the planet's Hill Radius. Roughly 30-40% of the surviving moons are in the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary habitability even if the known CBPs all gas giants. The majority of moons fall off of their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs (i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). A subset of exomoons are ejected from the system entirely. This last class presents a new mechanism for producing free-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and expected in the Roman microlensing survey.

          Constraining differential rotation in gamma Doradus stars from inertial dips properties

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dips in the gravity modes period spacing versus period diagram of gamma Doradus stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic studies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of gravito-inertial modes in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main sequence stars with pure inertial modes in their convective core. They allow to study stellar internal properties. This window on stellar internal dynamics is extremely valuable in the context of the understanding of angular momentum transport inside stars, since it allows us to probe rotation in their core. We investigate the signature and the detectability of a differential rotation between the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma Doradus stars from the inertial dip properties. We study the coupling between gravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and pure inertial modes in the convective core in the sub-inertial regime, allowing for a two-zones differential rotation from the two sides of the boundary. Taking a bi-layer rotation profile, we derive the wave equations in the convective core and the radiative envelope. We solve the coupling equation numerically and match the result to an analytical derivation of the Lorentzian dip. We then use typical values of measured near-core rotation and buoyancy travel time to infer ranges of parameters for which differential core to near-core rotation would be detectable in current Kepler data. We show that increasing the convective core rotation with respect to the near-core rotation leads to a shift of the period of the observed dip to lower periods. In addition, the dip gets deeper and thinner as the convective core rotation increases. We demonstrate that such a signature is detectable in Kepler data, given appropriate dip parameter ranges and near-core structural properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary pulsar J0348+0432 was previously shown to have a mass of approximately 2\,${\rm M_\odot}$, based on the combination of radial-velocity and model-dependent mass parameters derived from high-resolution optical spectroscopy of its white-dwarf companion. We present follow-up timing observations that combine archival observations with data acquired by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) pulsar instrument. We find that the inclusion of CHIME/Pulsar data yields an improved measurement of general-relativistic orbital decay in the system that falls within 1.2 $\sigma$ of the original values published by Antoniadis et al. (2013) while being roughly 6 times more precise due to the extended baseline. When we combine this new orbital evolution rate with the mass ratio determined from optical spectroscopy, we determine a pulsar mass of 1.806(37)\,${\rm M_\odot}$. For the first time for this pulsar, timing alone significantly constrains the pulsar mass. We explain why the new mass for the pulsar is $10\%$ lower and discuss how the mis-modeling of the initial observations of the white dwarf companion likely led to an inaccurate determination of the pulsar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical evidence suggests that the Sun was born near 5 kpc from the Galactic center, within the corotation radius of the Galactic bar, around 6-7 kpc. This presents challenges for outward migration due to the Jacobi energy constraint, preventing stars from easily overcoming the corotation barrier. In this study, we use test particle simulations to explore two possible migration pathways for the Sun: a "trapped" scenario, where the Sun's orbit was influenced by a slowing Galactic bar, and an "untrapped" scenario driven by dynamic spiral arms. Our results demonstrate that both mechanisms can explain how the Sun migrated from its birth radius (approximately 5 kpc) to its current orbital radius around 8.5-9 kpc. Furthermore, we investigate the environmental changes experienced by the Sun along these migration pathways, focusing on variations in radiation hazards and comet fluxes, which may have impacted planetary habitability. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of galactic habitability, emphasizing that the path a star takes within the Milky Way can significantly affect its surrounding environment and the potential for life. We propose a new concept of "Galactic habitable orbits," which accounts for evolving galactic structures and their effects on stellar and planetary systems. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the solar system's migration and its implications for habitability within the Milky Way.

          X-ray Spectral and Timing Properties of the Black Hole Binary XTE J1859+226 and their Relation to Jets

 - **Abstract**
 We compiled the X-ray and soft gamma-ray observations of the Galactic black hole binary XTE J1859+226 in the 1999--2000 outburst from RXTE, ASCA, BeppoSAX and CGRO. Throughout systematic spectral analysis using a two-component model consisting of a multi-temperature accretion disk plus a fraction of its flux convolved with an empirical Comptonized powerlaw component, we found that the innermost radius ($r_{\rm in}$) and temperature (Tin) of the disk are very variable with time in the rising phase of soft X-ray flux where Type-A/B/C low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were found. After this phase, $r_{\rm in}$ remains constant at around 60 km assuming a distance of 8 kpc and an inclination angle of 67$^{\circ}$, and Tin smoothly decays with time. The constant $r_{\rm in}$ suggests a presence of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), with $r_{\rm in}$ repeatedly moving closer and farther away from the ISCO in the rising phase. Both disk parameters are remarkably correlated with independently analyzed timing properties such as QPO frequency and rms variability. Type-A/B QPOs are seen only when $r_{\rm in}$ is close to the ISCO, while Type-C are seen when $r_{\rm in}$ is truncated and the frequency changes with a relation of $r^{-1.0}_{\rm in}$, supporting that Type-C QPOs occur at the inner edge of the truncated disk. Accurate determinations of the frequency--$r_{\rm in}$ relation for various objects should be a powerful tool to discriminate plausible Type-C QPO models. Furthermore, we suggest that jet ejection events may occur when $r_{\rm in}$ rapidly approaches to the ISCO, along with rapid changes of the disk flux, the rms variability and the hardness ratio. A rapid shrinkage of $r_{\rm in}$ down to the ISCO can be a useful index as a precursor of radio flares for triggering Target-of-Opportunity observations and would provide constraints on jet launching mechanisms.

For instance, previous analyses using the SEOBNRv4PHM, IMRPhenomXPHM models, and NRSur7dq4 have led to varying results regarding event properties. This variability complicates the interpretation of the data and understanding of the astrophysical phenomena involved. There is an ongoing need to reassess candidate events with the best available interpretations and models. Current approaches lack efficiency or consistency, making it challenging to perform large-scale reanalyses with updated models or improved techniques. It is imperative that investigations into waveform systematics be reproducible. Frameworks like asimov can facilitate large-scale reanalyses with consistent settings and high-quality results, and can reliably show how different waveform models affect the interpretation of gravitational wave events. This, in combination with other provided tools, allow for reanalysis of several events from the GWTC-3 catalog. We include access to full analysis settings that facilitate public use of GWOSC data on the Open Science Grid, particularly those conducted with the IMRPhenomPv2, SEOBNRv4PHM, SEOBNRv5PHM, and NRSur7dq4 waveform models. Our parameter inference results find similar conclusions to previously published work: for several events, all models largely agree, but for a few exceptional events these models disagree substantially on the nature of the merging binary.

 - **Abstract**
 Finding pulsars in binaries are important for measurements of the masses of neutron stars, for tests of gravity theories, and for studies of star evolution. We are carrying out the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey (GPPS) by using the the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Here we present the Keplerian parameters for 112 newly discovered pulsars in the FAST GPPS survey, and obtain timing solutions for 27 pulsars. Companions of these pulsars are He white dwarfs, CO/ONe white dwarfs, neutron stars, main sequence stars and ultra light objects or even planets. Our observations uncover eclipses of 8 binary systems. The optical counterpart for the companion of PSR J1908+1036 is identified. The Post-Keplerian parameter \Dot{\omega} for the double neutron star systems PSR J0528+3529 and J1844-0128 have been determined, with which the total masses of the binary systems are determined.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary millisecond pulsars with a massive white dwarf (WD) companion are intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs). They are formed via the Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) evolution channel if they are in compact orbits with an orbital period of less than 1 day. They are fairly rare in the known pulsar population, only five such IMBPs have been discovered before, and one of them is in a globular cluster. Here we report six IMBPs in a compact orbit, PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1919+1341, J1943+2210, J1947+2304 and J2023+2853, discovered during the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), doubling the number of such IMBPs due to the high survey sensitivity in the short survey time of 5 minutes. Follow-up timing observations show that they all have either a CO WD or an ONeMg WD companion with a mass greater than about 0.8~M$_\odot$ in a very circular orbit with an eccentricity in the order of $\lesssim10^{-5}$. PSR J0416+5201 should be an ONeMg WD companion with a remarkable minimum mass of 1.28 M$_\odot$. These massive white dwarf companions lead to a detectable Shapiro delay for PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1943+2210, and J2023+2853, indicating that their orbits are highly inclined. From the measurement of the Shapiro delay, the pulsar mass of J1943+2210 was constrained to be 1.84$^{\,+0.11}_{-0.09}$~M$_\odot$, and that of PSR J2023+2853 to be 1.28$^{\,+0.06}_{-0.05}$~M$_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Impact flashes on the moon are caused by high-speed collisions of celestial bodies with the lunar surface. The study of the impacts is critical for exploring the evolutionary history and formation of the Moon, and for quantifying the risk posed by the impacts to future human activity. Although the impacts have been monitored from the Earth by a few projects in past 20 years, the events occurring on the lunar far side have not been explored systematically so far. We here present an end-to-end image simulator dedicated to detecting and monitoring the impacts from space, which is useful for future mission design. The simulator is designed for modularity and developed in the Python environment, which is mainly composed of four components: the flash temporal radiation, the background emission, the telescope and the detector used to collect and measure the radiation. Briefly speaking, with a set of input parameters, the simulator calculates the flash radiation in the context of the spherical droplet model and the background emission from the lunar surface. The resulting images are then generated by the simulator after considering a series observational effects, including the stray light, transmission of the instrument, point spread function and multiple kinds of noise caused by a CCD/CMOS detector. The simulator is validated by comparing the calculation with the observations taken on the ground. The modular design enables the simulator to be improved and enhanced by including more complex physical models in the future, and to be flexible for other future space missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the binary and stellar properties of the double-degenerate system NLTT 16249. An analysis of new echelle spectra, supported by a joint study of a DQZ velocity template NLTT 44303, confirms the orbital period and constrains the mass ratio revealing a carbon-polluted DQ white dwarf that is up to ~6 percent more massive than its hydrogen-rich DA companion. Our new model atmosphere analysis of the DA and DQ components, constrained by an accurate Gaia parallax measurement that places the binary at a distance of 57.8 pc, reveals lower mass and temperature than previously estimated for both components, but with higher carbon and nitrogen abundances in the DQ atmosphere. The two components are nearly coeval and could have been generated following a single common envelope event.

 - **Abstract**
 We reformulate the gain correction problem of the radio interferometry as an optimization problem with regularization, which is solved efficiently with an iterative algorithm. Combining this new method with our previously proposed imaging method, PRIISM, the whole process of the self-calibration of radio interferometry is redefined as a single optimization problem with regularization. As a result, the gains are corrected, and an image is estimated. We tested the new approach with ALMA observation data and found it provides promising results.

          Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles

 - **Abstract**
 We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only <15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of TOI-1685 b, a hot rocky super-Earth orbiting an M2.5V star, during a full orbit. We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98$\pm$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline". Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.

          Transiting Jupiters around M-dwarfs have similar masses to FGK warm-Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets ($\gtrsim$ 8$R_{\oplus}$) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters ( $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_J$) around M-dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of $v$sin$i$ related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published non-detections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an investigation of the X-ray emission associated with the Wolf-Rayet star, WR 48-6, using observations from the XMM Newton and Chandra X-ray telescopes covering two epochs separated by eleven months. The X-ray spectrum of WR 48-6 is well explained by a two-temperature plasma model, with cool and hot plasma temperatures of $0.8_{-0.2}^{\,+0.1}$ and $2.86_{-0.66}^{\,+1.01}$ keV. No significant X-ray variability is observed during these two epochs of observations. However, an increase in the local hydrogen column density accompanied by a decrease in the intrinsic X-ray flux between two epochs of observations is seen. Additionally, the intrinsic X-ray luminosity is found to be more than $10^{33} \rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ during both epochs of observations. Based on the analysis presented, WR 48-6 is a promising colliding wind binary candidate with a possible companion of spectral type O5-O6.

          SpyDust: an improved and extended implementation for modeling spinning dust radiation

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents 'SpyDust', an improved and extended implementation of the spinning dust emission model based on a Fokker-Planck treatment. 'SpyDust' serves not only as a Python successor to 'spdust', but also incorporates some corrections and extensions. Unlike 'spdust', which is focused on specific grain shapes, 'SpyDust' considers a wider range of grain shapes and provides the corresponding grain dynamics, directional radiation field and angular momentum transports. We recognise the unique effects of different grain shapes on emission, in particular the shape-dependent mapping between rotational frequency and spectral frequency. In addition, we update the expressions for effects of electrical dipole radiation back-reaction and plasma drag on angular momentum dissipation. We also discuss the degeneracies in describing the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of spinning dust grains with the interstellar environmental parameters. Using a typical Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) environment as an example, we perform a perturbative analysis of the model parameters, revealing strong positive or negative correlations between them. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows that four dominant modes can linearly capture most of the SED variations, highlighting the degeneracy in the parameter space of the SED shape in the vicinity of the chosen CNM environment. This opens the possibility for future applications of moment expansion methods to reduce the dimensionality of the encountered SED parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Building fast and accurate ways to model the distribution of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is essential for interpreting upcoming 21 cm observations. A key component of semi-numerical models of reionization is the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which represents the fraction of mass within dark matter halos at each location. Using high-dynamic range N-body simulations to obtain this is computationally prohibitive and semi-analytical approaches, while being fast, end up compromising on accuracy. In this work, we bridge the gap by developing a machine learning model that can generate $f_{\text{coll}}$ maps by sampling from the full distribution of $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on the dark matter density contrast $\delta$. The conditional distribution functions and the input density field to the model are taken from low-dynamic range N-body simulations that are more efficient to run. We evaluate the performance of our ML model by comparing its predictions to a high-dynamic range N-body simulation. Using these $f_{\text{coll}}$ maps, we compute the HI and HII maps through a semi-numerical code for reionization. We are able to recover the large-scale HI density field power spectra $(k \lesssim 1\ h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ at the $\lesssim10\%$ level, while the HII density field is reproduced with errors well below 10% across all scales. Compared to existing semi-analytical prescriptions, our approach offers significantly improved accuracy in generating the collapse fraction field, providing a robust and efficient alternative for modeling reionization.

          Testing the Universality of Self-Organized Criticality in Galactic, Extra-Galactic, and Black-Hole Systems

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we are testing whether the power law slopes ($\alpha_F$, $\alpha_E$) of fluxes $(F)$, fluences or energies $(E)$ are universal in their size distributions, $N(F) \propto F^{-\alpha_F}$ and $N(E) \propto E^{-\alpha_E}$, in astrophysical observations of galactic, extragalactic, and black-hole systems. This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized criticality (SOC) systems. The test decides whether (i) power laws are a natural consequence of the scale-freeness and inherent universality of SOC systems, or (ii) if they depend on more complex physical scaling laws. The former criterion allows quantitative predictions of the power law-like size distributions, while the later criterion requires individual physical modeling for each SOC variable and data set. Our statistical test, carried out with 61 published data sets, yields strong support for the former option, which implies that observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do not require specific physical models to understand their statistical distributions. The observations show a mean and standard deviation of $\alpha_F=1.78\pm0.29$ for SOC fluxes, and $\alpha_E=1.66\pm0.22$ for SOC fluences, and thus are consistent with the prediction of the fractal-diffusive SOC model, with $\alpha_F=1.80$ and $\alpha_E=1.67$.

 - **Abstract**
 Many physical models contain nuisance parameters that quantify unknown and irrelevant properties of an experiment. Typically, these cannot be measured except by fitting the models to the data from the experiment, requiring simultaneous measurement of interesting parameters that are our target of inference and nuisance terms that are not directly of interest. A recent example of this is fitting Effective Field Theory (EFT) models to large-scale structure (LSS) data to make cosmological inferences. These models have a large number of nuisance parameters that are typically correlated with cosmological parameters in the posterior, leading to strong dependence on the nuisance parameter priors. We introduce a reparametrization method that leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to decorrelate nuisance parameters from the parameters of interest in the likelihood, even in the presence of non-linear relationships. This reparametrization forms a natural basis within which to define priors that are independent between nuisance and target parameters: the separation means that the marginal posterior for cosmological parameters does not depend on simple priors placed on nuisance terms. In application to EFT models using LSS data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to robust cosmological inference.

          Signatures of the Shock Interaction as an Additional Power Source in the Nebular Spectra of SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\sim\pm 5650\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ from the rest velocity of H$\alpha$, which are seen for only a few SNe to date. These features indicate energy deposition from shocks generated by the interaction of ejecta with a CSM expelled nearly 350 $-$ 640 years pre-explosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the literature, that include varying shock powers, suggest a shock power of at least $\sim 5 \times 10 ^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I] doublet, along with other prominent emission lines, provides evidence for clumpiness, dust formation, and asymmetry within the ejecta and/or the surrounding CSM. These emission lines also helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\approx0.19^{\scriptscriptstyle +0.08}_{\scriptscriptstyle -0.04} M_\odot$), He-core mass ($<3 M_\odot$) and the zero-age main sequence mass ($\lesssim 12 M_\odot$) of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. The comparison with other Type II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and evidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and dynamics.

          Angular Momentum Drain: Despinning Embedded Planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in a protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta distributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for impacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque exerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum drain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in the low velocity regime of a disk wind. Though spin-down associated with impacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is inefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the gravitational focusing regime, though even less efficiently than for lower mass planetesimals. The angular momentum transfer is most effective when the wind speed is low, the projectile density is high compared to the bulk planetesimal density, and the planetesimal is composed of low-strength material. Due to its inefficiency, we find that angular momentum drain due to impacts within a pebble cloud does not by itself facilitate collapse of single planetesimals.
