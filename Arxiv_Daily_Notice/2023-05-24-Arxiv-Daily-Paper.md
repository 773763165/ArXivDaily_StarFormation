 - **Abstract**
 Chemical abundances are an essential tool in untangling the Milky Way's enrichment history. However, the evolution of the interstellar medium abundance gradient with cosmic time is lost as a result of radial mixing processes. For the first time, we quantify the evolution of many observational abundances across the Galactic disk as a function of lookback time and birth radius, $R_\text{birth}$. Using an empirical approach, we derive $R_\text{birth}$ estimates for 145,447 APOGEE DR17 red giant disk stars, based solely on their ages and [Fe/H]. We explore the detailed evolution of 6 abundances (Mg, Ca ($\alpha$), Mn (iron-peak), Al, C (light), Ce (s-process)) across the Milky Way disk using 87,426 APOGEE DR17 red giant stars. We discover that the interstellar medium had three fluctuations in the metallicity gradient $\sim 9$, $\sim 6$, and $\sim4$ Gyr ago. The first coincides with the end of high-$\alpha$ sequence formation around the time of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus disruption, while the others are likely related to passages of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. A clear distinction is found between present-day observed radial gradients with age and the evolution with lookback time for both [X/Fe] and [X/H], resulting from the significant flattening and inversion in old populations due to radial migration. We find the [Fe/H]--[$\alpha$/Fe] bimodality is also seen as a separation in the $R_\text{birth}$--[X/Fe] plane for the light and $\alpha$-elements. Our results recover the chemical enrichment of the Galactic disk over the past 12 Gyr, providing tight constraints on Galactic disk chemical evolution models.
#### On the origin of the Galactic thin and thick discs, their abundance  gradients and the diagnostic potential of their abundance ratios

 - **Abstract**
 Using a semi-analytical model of the evolution of the Milky Way, we show how secular evolution can create distinct overdensities in the phase space of various properties (e.g. age vs metallicity or abundance ratios vs age) corresponding to the thin and thick discs. In particular, we show how key properties of the Solar vicinity can be obtained by secular evolution, with no need for external or special events, like galaxy mergers or paucity in star formation. This concerns the long established double-branch behaviour of [alpha/Fe] vs metallicity and the recently found non-monotonic evolution of the stellar abundance gradient, evaluated at the birth radii of stars. We extend the discussion to other abundance ratios and we suggest a classification scheme, based on the nature of the corresponding yields (primary vs secondary or odd elements) and on the lifetimes of their sources (short-lived vs long-lived ones). The latter property is critical in determining the single- or double- branch behavior of an elementary abundance ratio in the Solar neighborhood. We underline the high diagnostic potential of this finding, which can help to separate clearly elements with sources evolving on different timescales and help determining the site of e.g. the r-process(es). We define the "abundance distance" between the thin and thick disc sequences as an important element for such a separation. We also show how the inside-out evolution of the Milky Way disc leads rather to a single-branch behavior in other disc regions.
#### Top-shaped Asteroids as Lens-shaped Bodies

 - **Abstract**
 Several asteroids are known to be shaped like toy tops. This paper models Top-Shaped Asteroids (TSAs) as Homogeneous Symmetric Lenses (HSLs), and derives their rotational, self-gravitational, and total energies as functions of their mass, density, and angular momentum. Then we raise, test, and ultimately reject the hypothesis that TSAs take the shape of lowest total energy, subject to the constraint that they keep the same mass, density, and angular momentum, while remaining HSLs. Other processes must control the shapes of TSAs. For completeness, we also describe a Core-Mantle Model for TSAs, as well as an Inverted Core-Mantle Model, and derive their self-gravitational energies, along with their rotational energies. The gravitational potential at the center of an HSL then is derived.
#### Interstellar Bow Shocks around Fast Stars Passing through the Local  Interstellar Medium

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13449
 - **Abstract**
 Bow-shocks are produced in the local interstellar medium by the passage of fast stars from the Galactic thin-disk and thick-disk populations with velocities $V_* = $ 40-80 km/s. Stellar transits of local H I clouds occur every 3500-7000 yr on average and last between $10^4$ and $10^5$ yr. There could be 10-20 active bow shocks around low-mass stars inside clouds within 10-15 pc of the Sun. At local cloud distances of 3-10 pc, their turbulent wakes have transverse radial extents $R_{\rm wake} \approx$ 10-300 AU, angular sizes 10-100 arcsec, and Lyman-alpha surface brightnesses of 2-8 Rayleighs in gas with total hydrogen density $n_H \approx 0.1~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $V_* =$ 40-80 km/s. These transit wakes may cover an area fraction $f_A \approx (R_{\rm wake}/R_{\rm cl}) \approx 10^{-3}$ of local H I clouds and be detectable in IR (dust), UV (Lya, two-photon), or non-thermal radio emission. Turbulent heating in these wakes could produce the observed elevated rotational populations of H$_2$ ($J \geq 2$) and influence the endothermic formation of CH$^+$ in diffuse interstellar gas at $T > 10^3$ K.
#### FAST search for circumstellar atomic hydrogen. II. Is BD+303639 an  interacting planetary nebula?

 - **Abstract**
 The young, compact, very high surface brightness but low excitation planetary nebula (PN) BD+303639 is one of the very few PNe that have been reported to exhibit the 21cm HI emission line. As part of a long-term programme to search for circumstellar atomic hydrogen, we observed the 21cm feature toward BD+303639 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Assuming a direct association between the PN and the detected HI emission, these new observations show that this surrounding emission is significantly more spatially extended than indicated by previous interferometric observations, and can be resolved into two velocity components. The estimated HI mass is larger than 100M_sun, invalidating an origin from the host star itself or its ejecta for the emitting material. We discuss the possibility that the extended HI emission stems from the interstellar medium (ISM) swept out over time by the stellar wind. Moreover, we report tentative detections of HI absorption features lying near and blueward of the systemic velocity of this PN, which are probably from a stalled asterosphere at the outer boundary of the expanding ionized region. The mass of the gas producing the HI absorption is insufficient to solve the so-called `PN missing mass problem'. We demonstrate the capability of FAST to investigate the interaction process between a PN and the surrounding ISM.
#### Investigating star formation activity in the Sh 2-61 H II region

 - **Abstract**
 Using the multiwavelength data sets, we studied the star formation activity in H II region Sh 2-61 (hereafter S61). We identified a clustering in the region and estimated the membership using the Gaia proper motion data. The physical environment of S61 is inspected using infrared to radio wavelength images. We also determined the Lyman continuum flux associated with the H II region and found that the H II region is formed by at least two massive stars (S1 and S2). We also analyzed the 12CO (J =3-2) JCMT data of S61, and a shell structure accompanying three molecular clumps are observed towards S61. We found that the ionized gas in S61 is surrounded by dust and a molecular shell. Many young stellar objects and three molecular clumps are observed at the interface of the ionized gas and the surrounding gas. The pressure at the interface is higher than in a typical cool molecular cloud.
#### A partially stripped massive star in a Be binary at low metallicity: A  missing link towards Be X-ray binaries and double neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Standard binary evolutionary models predict a significant population of core helium-burning stars that lost their hydrogen-rich envelope after mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow. However, there is a scarcity of observations of such stripped stars in the intermediate mass regime (~1.5 - 8$ M_{\odot}$), which are thought to be prominent progenitors of SN Ib/c. Especially at low metallicity, a significant fraction of these stars is expected to be only partially stripped, retaining a significant amount of hydrogen on their surfaces. For the first time, we discovered a partially stripped massive star in a binary with a Be-type companion located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using a detailed spectroscopic analysis. The stripped-star nature of the primary is revealed by the extreme CNO abundance pattern and very high luminosity-to-mass ratio, which suggest that the primary is likely shell-hydrogen burning. Our target SMCSGS-FS 69 is the most luminous and most massive system among the known stripped star + Be binaries, with Mstripped ~3$ M_{\odot}$ and MBe ~17$ M_{\odot}$. Binary evolutionary tracks suggest an initial mass of Mini $\gtrsim 12 M_{\odot}$ for the stripped star and predict it to be in a transition phase towards a hot compact He star, which will eventually produce a stripped-envelope supernova. Our target marks the first representative of a so-far missing evolutionary stage in the formation pathway of Be X-ray binaries and double neutron star mergers.
