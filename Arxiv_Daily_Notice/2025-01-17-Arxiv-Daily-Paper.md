 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimal belts are ubiquitous around nearby stars, and their spatial properties hold crucial information for planetesimal and planet formation models. We present resolved dust observations of 74 planetary systems as part of the REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS) survey and archival reanalysis. We uniformly modelled interferometric visibilities for the entire sample to obtain the basic spatial properties of each belt, and combined these with constraints from multi-wavelength photometry. We report key findings from a first exploration of this legacy dataset: (1) Belt dust masses are depleted over time in a radially dependent way, with dust being depleted faster in smaller belts, as predicted by collisional evolution. (2) Most belts are broad discs rather than narrow rings, with much broader fractional widths than rings in protoplanetary discs. We link broad belts to either unresolved substructure or broad planetesimal discs produced if protoplanetary rings migrate. (3) The vertical aspect ratios (h = H/R) of 24 belts indicate orbital inclinations of 1-20 degrees, implying relative particle velocities of 0.1-4 km/s, and no clear evolution of heights with system age. This could be explained by early stirring within the belt by large bodies (with sizes of at least 140 km to the size of the Moon), by inheritance of inclinations from the protoplanetary disc stage, or by a diversity in evolutionary pathways and gravitational stirring mechanisms. We release the REASONS legacy multidimensional sample of millimetre-resolved belts to the community as a valuable tool for follow-up multi-wavelength observations and population modelling studies.

          Spin-Orbit Alignment in Merging Binary Black Holes Following Collisions with Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Merging binary black holes (BBHs) formed dynamically in dense star clusters are expected to have uncorrelated spin--orbit orientations since they are assembled through many random interactions. However, measured effective spins in BBHs detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA hint at additional physical processes that may introduce anisotropy. Here we address this question by exploring the impact of stellar collisions, and accretion of collision debris, on the spin--orbit alignment in merging BBHs formed in dense star clusters. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we study the regime where the disruption of a massive star by a BBH causes the stellar debris to form individual accretion disks bound to each black hole. We show that these disks, which are randomly oriented relative to the binary orbital plane after the initial disruption of the star, can be reoriented by strong tidal torques in the binary near pericenter passages. Following accretion by the BHs on longer timescales, BBHs with small but preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.2$) are formed. Our results indicate that BBH collisions in young massive star clusters could contribute to the observed trend toward small positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and we suggest that the standard assumption often made that dynamically assembled BBHs should have isotropically distributed BH spins is not always justified.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, is an infrared observatory of novel design: deployable, with active optics, fully open to space for radiative cooling and orbiting the Lagrange point no. 2. This article explains the rationale leading to this specific design and describes the various other architectures that were considered along the way: from a monolithic 10-meter telescope in geosynchronous orbit to a 6-meter one in High Earth Orbit, then a 16-meter observatory on the Moon, a 4- or 6-meter one in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, and a segmented 8-meter one passively cooled to 50 K at L2, which was finally descoped to 6.6 meters. It also addresses the optimization for scientific performance, the challenge of dealing with such an ultra-low operating temperature, cost issues, supporting technology, modifications made during final design and, finally, how the architecture performs on orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 GX 339$-$4 is one of the prototypical black hole X-ray transients, exhibiting recurrent outbursts that allow detailed studies of black hole accretion and ejection phenomena. In this work we present four epochs of optical and near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. The dataset includes two hard state spectra, collected during the 2013 and 2015 outbursts, and two soft state spectra observed during the 2021 outburst. Strong Balmer, Paschen, He I and He II emission lines are consistently observed in all spectra, while Brackett transitions and the Bowen blend are only prominent in the soft state. Although P-Cygni profiles are not identified, the presence of wind signatures, such as extended emission wings, flat-top and asymmetric red-skewed profiles, is consistently observed through most emission lines, suggesting the presence of wind-type ejecta. These features are particularly evident in the hard state, but they are also observed in the soft state, especially in the near-infrared. This strengthens the case for state-independent winds in black hole transients and increases the evidence for wind signatures in low-to-intermediate orbital inclination systems. We also study the spectral energy distribution, which provides evidence for the presence of synchrotron emission during the hard state. The jet significantly affects the near-infrared continuum, greatly diluting the emission features produced in the accretion flow. The simultaneous identification of both jet and wind signatures during the hard state reinforces the idea of a complex outflow scenario, in which different types of ejecta coexist.

          A novel q-PED method: precise physical properties of a merger-origin binary Cepheid OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a double-lined binary (SB2) classical Cepheid, OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347, was discovered, with the orbital period (P$_{\rm orb} = 59$ days) five times shorter than of any binary Cepheid known before. The expected mass of the Cepheid was below $3.5$ M$_\odot$, which, if confirmed, would also probe the uncharted territory. The system configuration also pointed to the Cepheid as a merger. We present a novel method for determining precise physical parameters of binary Cepheids using both theory and observations. This q-PED method combines the measured mass ratio (q), pulsation (P), and evolutionary (E) models, and the known distance (D) supplemented with multi-band photometry. Applying it, we determined the mass of the Cepheid of $3.42 \pm 0.09$ M$_\odot$, its radius of $13.65 \pm 0.27$ R$_\odot$, the companion mass of $1.89 \pm 0.04$ M$_\odot$ and radius of $12.5 \pm 0.62$ R$_\odot$. With the current configuration, the apparent evolutionary age difference of almost $1$ Gyr between the components strongly favors the Cepheid merger origin scenario. If so, the actual age of the Cepheid would be $1.1$ Gyr, on the edge of Population II stars, indicating a significant fraction of Cepheids may be much older than typically assumed. We also applied our method to an eclipsing binary Cepheid with accurately determined physical parameters, obtaining a close agreement, which confirmed our method's reliability.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) often display coincident absorption from species with widely varying ionization states, providing direct evidence for complex, multiphase interactions. Motivated by these measurements, we perform a series of cloud-crushing simulations that model cold clouds traveling through the hot CGM. We analyze the ion distributions of these clouds, generate mock absorption spectra, and study their implications on quasar (QSO) absorption observations. Our results show interesting multiphase features, in which ions with significantly different ionization potentials exist in the same absorber and share similar spectral features. However, our simulations are unable to explain high ions like O \textsc{vi} and their coexistence with lower ions that appear in many observed QSO absorption systems.

          TeV afterglow emission from a multi-component GRB jet using the kinetic approach

 - **Abstract**
 Recent years have seen a growing sample of TeV emission detections in gamma-ray burst afterglows, as well as an increasing role for structured jets in afterglow modelling. Using a kinetic approach, we show that the structure of an afterglow jet impacts its TeV emission, with jets where the energy falls off more sharply with angle showing a decrease in Inverse Compton (IC) peak flux relative to synchrotron peak flux. We use a modified version of the code katu, to which we have added adiabatic expansion and a fully self-consistent treatment of IC cooling both for the electron and photon populations. We compare our results to the semi-analytical code afterglowpy, finding a good agreement with our model except at early times off axis where the effects of baryon loading are important. We compare electron cooling in the cases where there is no IC cooling, Thomson cooling and an inclusion of Klein-Nishina effects, finding that the spectra can only be distinguished if the Compton potential is significantly increased. The smooth and gradual transition of our KN cooling also leads to a disparity in the cooling between our results and semi-analytical solutions based on asymptotic limits. Finally, we combine best fit parameters from afterglowpy to reproduce the light curves of GRB 170817A in our model. For our choice of parameters, we find that GRB 170817 would not have been detected in the TeV domain if seen on-axis, even by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We confirm the planetary nature of a pair of transiting sub-Neptune exoplanets orbiting the bright F-type sub-giant star TOI-6054 ($V=8.02$, $K=6.673$) as a part of the OrCAS radial velocity survey using WIYN/NEID observations. We find that TOI-6054b and TOI-6054c have radii of $2.65 \pm 0.15$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $2.81 \pm 0.18$ $R_{\oplus}$, respectively, and masses of $12.4 \pm 1.7$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $9.2 \pm 2.0$ $M_{\oplus}$. The planets have zero-albedo equilibrium temperatures of $1360 \pm 33$ K and $1144 \pm 28$ K. The host star has expanded and will evolve off of the Main Sequence within the next $\sim$500 Myr, and the resulting increase in stellar luminosity has more than doubled the stellar flux the two planets receive compared to the start of the host star's main sequence phase. Consequently, TOI-6054b may be losing some of its primordial H/He atmosphere -- if it has one. Based on dynamical simulations performed using the orbital parameters of the two planets, TOI-6054b, and TOI-6054c are very likely in a 5:3 mean motion resonance. The TOI-6054 system thus has the potential to be an excellent candidate for future atmospheric follow-up observations, with two similarly sized sub-Neptunes around a bright star. We also estimate that if TOI-6054b is currently losing its H/He atmosphere this should be observable from space and from the ground.

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the origins of cosmic rays and their secondary messengers, focusing on the potential role of four BL Lacs W Comae, 1ES 1959+650, PKS 2005-489, and PKS 2155-304 as potential sources of astrophysical neutrinos and gamma rays. We analyzed a single-zone model to understand the interactions between high-energy protons and ambient photons within blazar jets, leading to neutrino production observables and gamma-ray emission. This modeling contextualizes the emissions within multiwavelength observations and evaluates the capabilities of the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) in detecting these emissions. Our estimations suggest that these sources could be effective emitters of CRs, highlighting the need for future multimessenger observations to further investigate and constrain this class of sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. During the primary Kepler mission, between 2009 and 2013, about 150,000 pre-selected targets were observed with a 29.42 minute-long cadence. However, a survey of background stars that fall within the field of view (FOV) of the downloaded apertures of the primary targets has revealed a number of interesting objects. In previous papers we have presented surveys of short period Eclipsing Binaries and RR Lyrae stars. Aims. The current survey of the Kepler background is concentrated on identifying longer-period eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars. These will be the subject of later papers. In the course of this survey, in addition to eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars, seven exoplanet candidates have been uncovered and in this paper we report on these candidates. Methods. We use Lomb-Scargle (LS), light curve transit search and Phase Dispersion Minimisation (PDM) methods to reveal pixels that show significant periodicities, resulting in the identification of the seven exoplanet candidates. We have prepared the light curves for analysis using Pytransit software and cross matched the pixel coordinates with Gaia and other catalogues to identify the sources. this http URL identify seven Hot Jupiter exoplanet candidates with planet radii ranging from 0.8878 to 1.5174 RJup and periods ranging from 2.5089 to 4.7918 days.

          JERALD: high-fidelity dark matter, stellar mass and neutral hydrogen maps from fast N-body simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new code and approach, JERALD -- JAX Enhanced Resolution Approximate Lagrangian Dynamics -- , that improves on and extends the Lagrangian Deep Learning method of Dai & Seljak (2021), producing high-resolution dark matter, stellar mass and neutral hydrogen maps from lower-resolution approximate $N$-body simulations. The model is trained using the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite (for a fixed cosmology), specifically designed for the intergalactic medium and the neutral hydrogen distribution in the cosmic web. The output is tested in the redshift range from $z=5$ to $z=0$ and the generalization properties of the learned mapping is demonstrated. JERALD produces maps with dark matter, stellar and neutral hydrogen power spectra in excellent agreement with full-hydrodynamic simulations with $8\times$ higher resolution, at large and intermediate scales; in particular, JERALD's neutral hydrogen power spectra agree with their higher-resolution full-hydrodynamic counterparts within 90% up to $k\simeq1\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$ and within 70% up to $k\simeq10\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$. JERALD provides a fast, accurate and physically motivated approach that we plan to embed in a statistical inference pipeline, such as Simulation-Based Inference, to constrain dark matter properties from large- to intermediate-scale structure observables.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment that currently consists of three 0.42m small-aperture telescopes (SATs) and one 6m large- aperture telescope (LAT), located at an elevation of 5200m in the Atacama Desert in Chile. At the LAT's focal plane, SO will install >62,000 transition-edge sensor detectors across 13 optics tubes (OTs) within the Large Aperture Telescope Receiver (LATR), the largest cryogenic camera ever built to ob- serve the CMB. Here we report on the validation of the LATR in the laboratory and the subsequent dark testing and validation within the LAT. We show that the LATR meets cryogenic, optical, and detector specifications required for high-sensitivity measurements of the CMB. At the time of writing, the LATR is installed in the LAT with six OTs (corresponding to >31,000 detectors), and the LAT mirrors and remaining seven OTs are undergoing development.

          Probing Cosmology with 92 Localized Fast Radio Bursts and DESI BAO

 - **Abstract**
 Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) with $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$. Given the cosmological origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the combination of their dispersion measures and host galaxy redshifts makes localized FRBs a valuable tool for probing cosmology. Using an updated sample of 92 localized FRBs, along with DESI BAO, PlantheonPlus and CMB data, we constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) under the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We find that even without incorporating CMB data, DDE remains preferred with $w_0 = -0.855 ^{+0.084}_{-0.084}$ and $w_a = -1.174^{+0.462}_{-0.491}$ at a confidence level of $\sim2.5 \sigma$. A joint analysis constrains these to be $w_0 = -0.784^{+0.064}_{-0.064}$ and $w_a = -0.872^{+0.269}_{-0.278}$, showing a discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM at a $\sim3.1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, using localized FRBs alone, we estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ to be $69.04^{+2.30}_{-2.07}$ and $75.61^{+2.23}_{-2.07} \, \rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$, assuming the Galactic electron density models to be NE2001 (Cordes \& Lazio) and YMW16 (Yao et al.), respectively. Thus, accurate accounting of the Galactic dispersion measure is crucial for resolving the Hubble tension with FRBs. Future BAO measurements, next-generation CMB experiments, and more localized FRBs will further constrain the DE EoS and the cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a search for high-energy astrophysical neutrino multiplets, detections of multiple neutrino clusters in the same direction within 30 days, based on an analysis of 11.4 years of IceCube data. A new search method optimized for transient neutrino emission with a monthly time scale is employed, providing a higher sensitivity to neutrino fluxes. This result is sensitive to neutrino transient emission, reaching per-flavor flux of approximately $10^{-10}\ {\rm erg}\ {\rm cm}^{-2}\ {\rm sec}^{-1}$ from the Northern sky in the energy range $E\gtrsim 50$~TeV. The number of doublets and triplets identified in this search is compatible with the atmospheric background hypothesis, which leads us to set limits on the nature of neutrino transient sources with emission timescales of one month.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova model including newly calculated neutrino-induced reaction rates with both collective and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) neutrino-flavor oscillations considered. We show that the measurement of a pair of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La or $^6$Li/$^7$Li and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in presolar grains that are inferred to have originated from core-collapse supernovae could constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy. The new shell-model and the model of quasi-particle random phase approximation in the estimate of three important neutrino-induced reactions, $\nu+^{16}$O, $\nu+^{20}$Ne, and $\nu+^{138}$Ba are applied in our reaction network. The new rates decrease the calculated $^{7}$Li/$^{6}$Li ratio by a factor of five compared with the previous study. More interestingly, these new rates result in a clear separation of the isotopic ratio of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B between normal and inverted mass hierarchies in the O/Ne, O/C, and C/He layers where $^{138}$La abundance depends strongly on the mass hierarchy. In these layers, the sensitivity of the calculated abundances of $^{10,11}$B and $^{6,7}$Li to the nuclear reaction uncertainties is also tiny. Therefore, we propose that the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La and $^6$Li/$^7$Li vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in type X silicon carbide grains sampled material from C/He layer can be used as a new probe to constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from long-term simultaneous monitoring observations of SiO and H2O masers toward the Mira variable star WX Serpentis. This study has been conducted with 21m single-dish radio telescopes of the Korean VLBI Network from 2009 June to 2021 June. Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2, J=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO maser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting an asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O maser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The intensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the optical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the phase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO masers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O maser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms are different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant single-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars. However, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a radial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted velocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving outward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material ejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial asymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent small-scale structures in the envelopes and winds of massive stars have long been suggested as the cause for excessive line broadening that could not be explained by other mechanisms such as thermal broadening. However, the origin of these structures, particularly in the envelope, has not been extensively studied. We study the origin of structures seen in 2D unified stellar atmosphere and wind simulations of O stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Particularly, we study whether the structure growth in the simulations is consistent with sub-surface convection, as is commonly assumed to be the origin of this turbulence. Using a linear stability analysis of the optically thick envelopes of massive stars, we identified multiple instabilities that could drive structure growth. We quantified the structure growth in the non-linear simulations of O stars and WR stars by computing density power spectra and tracking their temporal evolution. Then, we compared these results to the analytical results from the stability analysis. The stability analysis leads to two possible instabilities: the convective instability and an acoustic instability. Analytic expressions for the growth rates of these different instabilities are found. In particular, strong radiative diffusion damps the growth rate $\omega$ of the convective instability leading to a distinct $\omega \sim 1/k^2$ dependence on wavenumber $k$. From our power spectra analysis of the simulations, however, we find that structure growth rather increases with $k$ - tentatively as $\omega \sim \sqrt{k}$. Our results suggest that structures in luminous O and WR star envelopes do not primarily develop from the sub-surface convective instability. Rather the growth seems compatible with either the acoustic instability in the radiation-dominated regime or with Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, although the exact origin remains inconclusive for now.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the detectability of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using mock observations from the Mini SiTian array. We select 100 host galaxy samples from a simulated galaxy catalog based on specific criteria such as redshift, BH mass, and event rate. Taking into account the site conditions and survey strategy, we simulate observations over a 440 deg$^2$ field. The results indicate that $0.53\pm 0.73$ TDEs can be detected per year when observing in both $g$ and $r$ bands with 300-second exposures every 3 days. Applying this method to the SiTian project, we expect to discover approximately 204 TDEs annually, heralding a new era in TDE science.

 - **Abstract**
 Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.

 Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. The previous letter in this series describes our project and associated TRON pipeline designed to mine archival MeerKAT data for transient and variable sources. In this letter, we report on a new transient, a radio flare, associated with Gaia DR3 6865945581361480448, a G type star, whose parallax places it at a distance of 1334 pc. Its duration and high degree of circular polarization suggests electron cyclotron maser instability as the mechanism, consistent with an RS CVn variable.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of the origin of gamma-ray emissions in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an enigma. Through a joint analysis of GRB 180427A, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and AstroSat's Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager, we identify emissions from two distinct regions with varying polarisation properties. Time-resolved polarisation analysis reveals a synchronous evolution of the polarisation angle (PA) and fraction (PF) with two emission pulses, peaking with a delay of $4.82 \pm 0.12\, \mathrm{s}$. Spectral analysis indicates that the first pulse is dominated by blackbody radiation, while the second pulse exhibits a non-thermal spectrum (power law with an exponential cutoff). Using a bottom-to-top approach through simulations, we decouple the polarisation properties of the individual spectral components, revealing polarisation fractions of 25\% - 40\% for the blackbody spectrum and 30\% - 60\% for the non-thermal spectrum. At a redshift of $z \sim 0.05$, the blackbody emission originates from the jet photosphere at $10^{11}\, \mathrm{cm}$, whereas the non-thermal emission arises from an optically thin region at $10^{15}\, \mathrm{cm}$. The changing dominance of these emissions explains the observed PA shift of $60^\circ \pm 22.3^\circ$. The spectral cutoff at 1 MeV suggests pair opacity due to the jet's low bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim$ tens). The high polarisation and hard spectral slopes ($\alpha > -0.5$) imply a top-hat jet structure observed off-axis, near the jet's edge. This off-axis viewing introduces anisotropy in the radiation within the viewing cone ($1/\Gamma$), accounting for the observed polarisation.

 - **Abstract**
 The classical picture of our Solar System being the archetypal outcome of planet formation has been rendered obsolete by the astonishing diversity of extrasolar-system architectures. From rare hot-Jupiters to abundant super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, most detected exoplanets have no analogs in our system, and their interior and atmospheric compositions remain largely unknown. Fortunately, new methodologies enable us to analyze exoplanet atmospheres, inferring their compositions, temperatures, dynamics, and even formation pathways. Specifically, ground-based high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy (HRDS) can disentangle spectral-line profiles of weak exo-atmospheric signals from the dominating features of Earth's atmosphere in the observed flux. For over a decade, HRDS has focused on hot Jupiters (close-orbiting gas giants) due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, which makes them ideal laboratories for advancing our knowledge. However, there have been concerns regarding potential biases in exo-atmospheric-detection methods, hindering comparative planetology. Here we propose a modeling framework based on extensive simulations of HRDS exo-atmospheric observations to systematically explore in-silico underlying biases in commonly-used pipelines, particularly under the presence of observational noise. Our findings show that exo-atmospheric detection-significances are highly contingent on details of the analysis-pipeline used, with different techniques responding differently to noise: A given technique may fail to recover a true-signal that is detected by another. Noise effects in the computed significances are non-trivial and pipeline-dependent. Statistical analyses provide a complementary tool to contextualize signal-significances, which will gain in relevance as we move towards studying the atmospheres of smaller, potentially habitable exoplanets with even weaker signals.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple populations are ubiquitous in the old massive globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way. It is still unclear how they arose during the formation of a GC. The topic of iron and metallicity variations has recently attracted attention with the measurement of iron variations among the primordial population (P1) stars of Galactic GCs. We use the spectra of more than 8000 RGB stars in 21 Galactic GCs observed with MUSE to derive individual stellar metallicities [M/H]. For each cluster, we use the HST photometric catalogs to separate the stars into two main populations (P1 and P2). We measure the metallicity spread within the primordial population of each cluster by combining our metallicity measurements with the stars $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color. We also derive metallicity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm [M/H]}$) for the P1 and P2 stars of each GC. In all but three GCs, we measure a significant correlation between the metallicity and the $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color of the P1 stars such that stars with larger $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ have higher metallicities. We measure metallicity spreads that range from 0.03 to 0.24 dex and correlate with the GC masses. As for the intrinsic metallicity dispersions, when combining the P1 and P2 stars, we measure values ranging from 0.02 dex to 0.08 dex that correlate very well with the GC masses. We compared the metallicity dispersion among the P1 and P2 stars and found that the P2 stars have metallicity dispersions that are smaller or equal to that of the P1 stars. We find that both the metallicity spreads of the P1 stars (from the $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ spread in the chromosome maps) and the metallicity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm [M/H]}$) correlate with the GC masses, as predicted by some theoretical self-enrichment models presented in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass and supermassive black holes abound in the Universe, whereas intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of ~10^2-10^5 solar masses in between are largely missing observationally, with few cases found only. Here we report the real-time discovery of a long-duration X-ray transient, EP240222a, accompanied by an optical flare with prominent H and He emission lines revealed by prompt follow-up observations. Its observed properties evidence an IMBH located unambiguously in the halo of a nearby galaxy and flaring by tidally disrupting a star -- the only confirmed off-nucleus IMBH-tidal disruption event so far. This work demonstrates the potential of sensitive time-domain X-ray surveys, complemented by timely multi-wavelength follow-ups, in probing IMBHs, their environments, demographics, origins and connections to stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.

          The White Dwarf Pareto: Tracing Mass Loss in Binary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 The white dwarf mass distribution has been studied primarily at two extremes: objects that presumably evolved as single stars and members of close binaries that likely underwent substantial interaction. This work considers the intermediate separation regime of ~1 au and demonstrates how binary interaction affects white dwarf masses. The binary mass ratio distribution is utilized for this purpose. Modeled as a truncated Pareto profile, this distribution provides insights into the populations' properties and evolutionary history. When applied to homogeneous samples of binaries with giant primaries of similar age, the distribution's shape constrains the fraction of white dwarf companions, the white dwarf mass distribution, and the properties of their progenitors. As a test case, this method is applied to a small spectroscopic sample of binaries in open clusters with red giant primaries and orbital periods between 0.5 and 20 years. The analysis reveals that white dwarfs in these systems are ~20% less massive than their isolated counterparts, with a typical mass of ~0.55 Msun. Their progenitors likely lost 80-85% of their mass, with binary interactions enhancing mass loss by an additional ~0.2 Msun. These findings highlight the utility of this approach for studying binary evolution and improving population models, particularly with future datasets from Gaia and other large-scale surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chern-Simons gravitational term during inflation is usually coupled to the inflaton field. The resulting theory suffers from ghost-field formation in the tensor sector, which limits the observational effects of P-violation on cosmological correlators. In this work, we consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to an isocurvature component in a multi-field model of inflation. Since the resulting theory does not affect the quadratic action of tensor perturbations, ghost fields do not appear. This operator provides (P-violating) interactions between the isocurvature perturbation and the curvature and tensor perturbations. We show that combining these couplings with interactions between the curvature and isocurvature components coming from a turning trajectory, the resulting $\langle sst \rangle_{PV}$ non-Gaussianities can reach $f^{sst, PV}_{\rm NL}=B_{PV}^{\zeta\zeta h}(k,k,k)/P^2_{\zeta}(k)\sim \mathcal O(1)$ within the parameter space of the theory. Our result motivates the systematic study of the Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to isocurvature fields in multi-field models of inflation with couplings between the curvature and isocurvature fields or other mechanisms that transfer effects on the isocurvature field into the curvature field.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal locking of planets to their host stars results in an atmospheric circulation with a hotspot fixed to the frame of reference of the planet. On the other hand, asynchronously rotating planets feature moving hotspots either lagging or leading the corresponding substellar point as it translates along the surface. We show that a planet falling in the latter category could mimic the circulation of tidally synchronous planets under the influence of time-varying instellation, possibly provided by pulsating or multiple star systems. This happens when the planets diurnal period is in resonance with the period of instellation variation, leading to a planet-frame-fixed hotspot. Slight differences in the above periods lead to East-West or West-East creeping hotspots with a period significantly longer than both. The rate of hotspot motion is given by the difference between the diurnal and instellation variation rates, similar to the lower envelope frequency of beat patterns formed by two superposed waves in linear wave theory. We call this phenomenon beating. A combination of the radiative, rotational, wave propagation, and drag timescales establishes dynamical constraints on beating. Based on this we classify a set of Kepler and TESS circumbinary planets with two candidates exhibiting climatic departures from the no-variation scenario. In general, hotter and faster-spinning planets are more susceptible to climatic departures. Beating, if it occurs, may additionally create optimistic extensions of habitable zones for corresponding systems.

 We introduce the Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources (SHORES) multiple pencil beam survey that observed at 2.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 29 fields in total intensity and polarization within the Herschel-ATLAS Southern Galactic Field. This paper presents the observations, calibration and analysis of the 27 shallow fields that cover an overall area of $\sim 26$ square degree with increasing sensitivity towards the phase centers of each pointing according to the ATCA 22 m dish response function, down to $\sigma\lesssim 33\, \mu$Jy. Two additional (deep) fields have been observed to even higher sensitivity. All the SHORES observations have been calibrated to account also for linear polarization. Polarization and deeper field analysis will be presented in future papers. The SHORES shallow-field sample considered in the present paper counts $2294$ sources detected with BLOBCAT to signal-to-noise ratio $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$. Simulations determined that our procedure and final catalog is 95% reliable above $497.5\, \mu$Jy and $95\%$ complete to the $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$ significance level. By exploiting ATCA E-W 6 km configuration we reached resolutions of $3.2\times 7.2$ arcsec, to which level $81\%$ of our sources are unresolved. We determined source counts down to the $150\, \mu$Jy level. For the sources with a counterpart in H-ATLAS, the FIR-radio correlation is calculated and discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

 - **Abstract**
 Sgr A* is currently very faint. However, X-ray radiation reflected by the Sgr A complex, a group of nearby molecular clouds, suggests that it went through one or more periods of high activity some hundreds of years ago. We aim to determine whether previously proposed physical scenarios are consistent with the observed X-ray variability over the past 25 years, and to characterize the spatial distribution, shape, and internal structure of the clouds. We exploit the full set of XMM-Newton observations, extending the previously studied dataset on variability by at least 12 years. Starting from the recent IXPE result that places the so-called Bridge cloud 26 pc behind Sgr A*, we reconstruct the LOS position of the other clouds, assuming that they were illuminated by a single flare. Additionally, we derive the probability density function (PDF) of the molecular density. We also study the 3D geometry of the complex in case two flares illuminate the clouds. As of spring 2024, the lightfront is still illuminating the Sgr A complex, with the Bridge currently being the brightest cloud. The other clouds in the complex have faded significantly. In the single flare scenario, the Sgr A complex is located $\simeq$ 25 pc behind Sgr A*. In the past 25 years, the illuminated region spans 10-15 pc along the LOS. The derived PDF is roughly log-normal, consistent with previous Chandra results, with a possible high-density excess. Both a single and a multiple flares scenario can explain the observed X-ray variability. Previous concerns about the single flare scenario, raised by shorter monitoring, are now overcome in the 25 years of monitoring. If two flares illuminate the clouds, they must be separated by at least $\sim$ 30 years. We speculate that these clouds are closer to Sgr A* than the nuclear molecular ring at $\simeq$ 100-200 pc and possibly drifting from the ring to the inner region of the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical and orbital parameters of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) provide valuable information about the Solar System's formation and evolution. In particular, the characterization of binaries provides insights into the formation mechanisms that may be playing a role at such large distances from the Sun. Studies show two distinct populations, and (38628) Huya occupies an intermediate position between the unequal-size binaries and those with components of roughly equal sizes. In this work, we predicted and observed three stellar occultation events by Huya. Huya and its satellite - S/2012 (38628) 1 - were detected during occultations in March 2021 and again in June 2023. Additionally, an attempt to detect Huya in February 2023 resulted in an additional single-chord detection of the secondary. A spherical body with a minimum diameter of D = 165 km can explain the three single-chord observations and provide a lower limit for the satellite size. The astrometry of Huya's system, as derived from the occultations and supplemented by observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck Observatory, provided constraints on the satellite orbit and the mass of the system. Therefore, assuming the secondary is in an equatorial orbit around the primary, the limb fitting was constrained by the satellite orbit position angle. The system density, calculated by summing the most precise measurement of Huya's volume to the spherical satellite average volume, is $\rho_{1}$ = 1073 $\pm$ 66 kg m$^{-3}$. The density that the object would have assuming a Maclaurin equilibrium shape with a rotational period of 6.725 $\pm$ 0.01 hours is $\rho_{2}$ = 768 $\pm$ 42 kg m$^{-3}$. This difference rules out the Maclaurin equilibrium assumption for the main body shape.
