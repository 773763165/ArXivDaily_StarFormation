#### Impact of moment-based, energy integrated neutrino transport on  microphysics and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extensive study of the effects of neutrino transport in 3-dimensional general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using our moment-based, energy-integrated neutrino radiation transport (M1) scheme. We consider a total of 8 BNS configurations, while varying equation of state models, mass ratios and grid resolutions, for a total of 16 simulations. We find that M1 neutrino transport is crucial in modeling the local absorption of neutrinos and the deposition of lepton number throughout the medium. We provide an in-depth look at the effects of neutrinos on the fluid dynamics and luminosity during the late inspiral and post-merger phases, the properties of ejecta and outflow, and the post-merger nucleosynthesis. The simulations presented in this work comprise an extensive study of the combined effect of the equation of state and M1 neutrino transport in GRHD simulations of BNS mergers, and establish that the solution provided by our M1 scheme is robust across system properties and provides insight into the effects of neutrino trapping in BNS mergers.
#### Fast infrared winds during the radio-loud and X-ray obscured stages of  the black hole transient GRS~1915+105

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole transient GRS~1915+105 entered a new phase of activity in 2018, generally characterised by low X-ray and radio fluxes. This phase has been only interrupted by episodes of strong and variable radio emission, during which high levels of X-ray absorption local to the source were measured. We present 18 epochs of near-infrared spectroscopy (2018--2023) obtained with GTC/EMIR and VLT/X-shooter, spanning both radio-loud and radio-quiet periods. We demonstrate that radio-loud phases are characterised by strong P-Cygni line profiles, indicative of accretion disc winds with velocities of up to $\mathrm{\sim 3000~km~s^{-1}}$. This velocity is consistent with those measured in other black hole transients. It is also comparable to the velocity of the X-ray winds detected during the peak outburst phases in GRS~1915+105, reinforcing the idea that massive, multi-phase outflows are characteristic features of the largest and most powerful black hole accretion discs. Conversely, the evolution of the Br$\gamma$ line profile during the radio-quiet phases follows the expected trend for accretion disc lines in a system that is gradually decreasing its intrinsic luminosity, exhibiting weaker intensities and more pronounced double-peaks.
#### Differential rotation in convecting spherical shells with non-uniform  viscosity and entropy diffusivity

 - **Abstract**
 Contemporary three-dimensional physics-based simulations of the solar convection zone disagree with observations. They feature differential rotation substantially different from the true rotation inferred by solar helioseismology and exhibit a conveyor belt of convective "Busse" columns not found in observations. To help unravel this so-called "convection conundrum", we use a three-dimensional pseudospectral simulation code to investigate how radially non-uniform viscosity and entropy diffusivity affect differential rotation and convective flow patterns in density-stratified rotating spherical fluid shells. We find that radial non-uniformity in fluid properties enhances polar convection, which, in turn, induces non-negligible lateral entropy gradients that lead to large deviations from differential rotation geostrophy due to thermal wind balance. We report simulations wherein this mechanism maintains differential rotation patterns very similar to the true solar profile outside the tangent cylinder, although discrepancies remain at high latitudes. This is significant because differential rotation plays a key role in sustaining solar-like cyclic dipolar dynamos.
#### An improved method to measure $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm  ^{14}N/^{15}N$ abundance ratios: revisiting CN isotopologues in the Galactic  outer disk

 - **Abstract**
 The variations of elemental abundance and their ratios along the Galactocentric radius result from the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disks. The $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio in particular is often used as a proxy to determine other isotopic ratios, such as $\rm ^{16}O/^{18}O$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$. Measurements of $\rm ^{12}CN$ and $\rm ^{13}CN$ (or $\rm C^{15}N$) -- with their optical depths corrected via their hyper-fine structure lines -- have traditionally been exploited to constrain the Galactocentric gradients of the CNO isotopic ratios. Such methods typically make several simplifying assumptions (e.g. a filling factor of unity, the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, and the neglect of the cosmic microwave background) while adopting a single average gas phase. However, these simplifications introduce significant biases to the measured $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$. We demonstrate that exploiting the optically thin satellite lines of $\rm ^{12}CN$ constitutes a more reliable new method to derive $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ from CN isotopologues. We apply this satellite-line method to new IRAM 30-m observations of $\rm ^{12}CN$, $\rm ^{13}CN$, and $\rm C^{15}N$ $N=1\to0$ towards 15 metal-poor molecular clouds in the Galactic outer disk ($R_{\rm gc} > $ 12 kpc), supplemented by data from the literature. After updating their Galactocentric distances, we find that $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ gradients are in good agreement with those derived using independent optically thin molecular tracers, even in regions with the lowest metallicities. We therefore recommend using optically thin tracers for Galactic and extragalactic CNO isotopic measurements, which avoids the biases associated with the traditional method.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) are characterized by different geometric and physical properties, but their observed properties are often similar, making them difficult to distinguish. Therefore, it is desirable to search for their spectral features that could be easily identified from observations. We present spectral and timing signatures of NSs and WDs hosted in accreting X-ray binaries that can be easily identified from X-ray observations. We perform spectral and timing analysis of 4U~1636--53 and SS~Cygni, as typical representatives of such NS and WD binaries, based on their X-ray observations by RXTE, ASCA, Suzaku and BeppoSAX uising {\it Comptonization} spectral model. As a result, we formulate a criterion that makes it easy to distinguish NS from WD in such binaries: NS X-rays exhibits clear quasi-stable behavior with the index $\Gamma\to2$ and is characterized by quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) at $\nu_{QPO} >0.5$~Hz, although WD X-rays is stable with $\Gamma \to1.85$ and is accompanied by QPOs at $\nu_{QPO}<0.05$~Hz during source outbursts. In addition, we revealed that in 4U~1636--53 the mHz QPOs anti-correlate with the plasma temperature, $T_e$ of Compton cloud (or the corona around a NS. This allowed us to associate mHz-QPOs with the corona dynamics during outburst cycle. The above index effect, now well established for 4U~1636--53 and SS~Cygni using extensive observations, has previously been found in other low-mass X-ray NS and WD binaries and agrees well with the criterion for distinguishing NSs and WDs presented here.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the signal of secondary halo bias as a function of a variety of intrinsic and environmental halo properties, and characterize its statistical significance as a function of cosmological redshift. Using fixed and paired $N$-body simulations of dark-matter halos -- the \texttt{UNIT} simulation -- with masses above $10^{11}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$ identified over a wide range of cosmological redshifts ($0<z<5$), we explore the behavior of the scaling relations among different halo properties. We include novel environmental properties based on the halo distribution as well as the underlying dark-matter field. We implement an object-by-object estimator of large-scale effective bias and test its validity against standard approaches. With a bias assigned to each tracer, we perform a statistical analysis aiming at characterizing the distribution of bias and the signal of secondary halo bias. We show how the halo scaling relations linking direct probes of the halo potential well do not depend on the environment. On the contrary, links between halo mass and the so called set of secondary halo properties are sensitive to the cosmological environment. We show that the signal of secondary bias derives statistically from secondary correlations beyond the standard link to halo mass. We show that the secondary bias arise through non-local and/or environmental properties related either to the halo distribution or to the properties of the underlying dark-matter field. Properties such as the tidal field and the local Mach number generates the signals of secondary bias with the highest significance. We propose applications of the assignment of individual bias for the generation of mock catalogs containing the signal of secondary bias, as well as a series of cosmological analyses aiming at mining large galaxy data sets.
#### Constraining Background N2 Inventories on Directly Imaged Terrestrial  Exoplanets to Rule Out O2 False Positives

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging spectroscopy with future space-based telescopes will constrain terrestrial planet atmospheric composition and potentially detect biosignature gases. One promising indication of life is abundant atmospheric O2. However, various non-biological processes could also lead to O2 accumulation in the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets around Sun-like stars. In particular, the absence of non-condensible background gases such as N2 could result in appreciable H escape and abiotic O2 buildup, so identifying background atmosphere composition is crucial for contextualizing any O2 detections. Here, we perform retrievals on simulated directly imaged terrestrial planets using rfast, a new exoplanet atmospheric retrieval suite with direct imaging analysis capabilities. By simulating Earth-analog retrievals for varied atmospheric compositions, cloud properties, and surface pressures, we determine what wavelength range, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are necessary to constrain background gases' identity and abundance. We find N2 backgrounds can be uniquely identified with S/N$\sim$20 observations, provided that wavelength coverage extends beyond $\sim$1.6 $\mu$m to rule out CO-dominated atmospheres. Additionally, there is a low probability of O2-dominated atmospheres due to an O2-N2 degeneracy that is only totally ruled out at S/N$\sim$40. If wavelength coverage is limited to 0.2-1.1 $\mu$m, then although all other cosmochemically plausible backgrounds can be readily excluded, N2 and CO backgrounds cannot be distinguished. Overall, our simulated retrievals and associated integration time calculations suggest that near-infrared coverage to at least 1.6 $\mu$m and apertures approaching 8m are needed to confidently rule out O2 biosignature false positives within feasible integration times

 - **Abstract**
 New observations are presented of four evolved objects that display long, multi-year variations in their light curves. These are interpreted as good evidence of their binary nature, with the modulation caused by the barycenter motion of the evolved star resulting in a periodic obscuration by a circumbinary disk. Although protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe) commonly possess bipolar nebulae, which are thought to be shaped by a binary companion, there are very few PPNe in which a binary companion has been found. Three of the objects in this study appear to be PPNe, IRAS 07253-2001, 08005-2356, and 17542-0603, with long periods of 5.2, 6.9, and 8.2 yrs, respectively. The binary nature of IRAS 08005-2356 has recently been confirmed by a radial velocity study. Two samples, one of PPNe and the other of post-AGB star candidates, are investigated for further evidence on how common is a long-period light curve variation. Both samples suggest such light variations are not common. The fourth object, IRAS 20056+1834 (QY Sge), is an obscured RV Tau variable of the RVb subclass, with a long period of 3.9 yrs and pulsation periods of 102.9 and 51.5 days. The period of this object is seen to vary by 2%. Evidence is presented for a recent mass ejection in IRAS 17542-0603.

 - **Abstract**
 Age is one of the most fundamental parameters of stars, yet it is one of the hardest to determine as it requires modelling various aspects of stellar formation and evolution. When we compare the ages derived from isochronal and dynamical traceback methods for six young stellar associations, we find a systematic discrepancy. Specifically, dynamical traceback ages are consistently younger by an average of $\langle\Delta_{\rm Age}\rangle = 5.5 \pm 1.1$ Myr. We rule out measurement errors as the cause of the age mismatch and propose that $\Delta_{\rm Age}$ indicates the time a young star remains bound to its parental cloud before moving away from its siblings. In this framework, the dynamical traceback "clock" starts when a stellar cluster or association begins to expand after expelling most of the gas, while the isochronal "clock" starts earlier when most stars form. The difference between these two age-dating techniques is a powerful tool to constraint evolutionary models, as isochronal ages cannot be younger than dynamical traceback ages. Measuring the $\Delta_{\rm Age}$ accurately and understanding its variations across different environments will provide further information on the impact of local conditions and stellar feedback on the formation and dispersal of stellar clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Space safety and astronomy are at odds. The problem posed by space debris and derelict satellites in the low Earth orbit is an existential threat to all space operations. These dangerous objects in space are more easily tracked with ground-based LiDAR if they are highly reflective, especially in the near-infrared (NIR) range. At the same time, reflective objects in orbit are the bane of ground-based astronomers, causing light pollution and marring images with bright streaks. How can this tension be resolved? The hypothesis tested is that a near-infrared-transparent (NIRT) coating which is opaque in the visible light range and transparent in the NIR range is a promising candidate for use in satellite construction. This experiment tests whether typical spacecraft surfaces such as anodized aluminum or multi-layer insulation (MLI) with a NIRT coating applied will absorb visible light and reflect NIR. The findings confirm the efficacy of the NIRT coating for this purpose, reducing visible light reflection by 47% (+/-3%) and increasing reflection in the NIR by 7% (+/-2%). This promising novel NIRT coating may help provide a path forward to resolve the tension between astronomy and the space industry.

 - **Abstract**
 We have been performing daily observations of bright microquasars at 1.2-20~GHz with the Northern sector of RATAN-600 radio telescope for more than ten years. During the 2019--2021 observations we recorded bright flares, which we call giant flares because fluxes reach record levels -- above 20~Jy -- during these events. In this paper we report the results of intraday variations of the Cygnus~X-3} microquasar in multi-azimuth observations made with the "North sector with a flat-sheet reflector" during giant flares of Cygnus X-3. These were the first such observations made simultaneously at several frequencies on a short time scale (10 minutes). Observational data consists of 31 measurement made within +/-2.7 hours of the culmination of the object. We are the first to discover the evolution of the spectrum of the flare emission of Cygnus~X-3 on a time scale comparable to the orbital period of the binary. The measurement data allowed us to determine the temporal and spectral parameters of radio emission, which are typical for synchrotron flare emission in relativistic jets. Evolution of the radio emission of X-ray binaries on short time scales is a key to understanding the formation of jet outbursts in the process of mass accretion of the matter of the donor star onto the relativistic object.
#### Improving Monte Carlo radiative transfer in the regime of high optical  depths: The minimum scattering order

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer (RT) simulations are a powerful tool that enables the calculation of synthetic images of a wide range of astrophysical objects. These simulations are often based on the Monte Carlo (MC) method, as it provides the needed versatility that allows the consideration of the diverse and often complex conditions found in those objects. However, this method faces fundamental problems in the regime of high optical depths which may result in noisy images and underestimated flux values. In this study, we propose an advanced MCRT method, i.e., an enforced minimum scattering order that is aimed at providing a minimum quality of determined flux estimates. For that purpose, we extended our investigations of the scattering order problem and derived an analytic expression for the minimum number of interactions that depends on the albedo and optical depth of the system, which needs to be considered to achieve a certain coverage of the scattering order distribution. The method is based on the utilization of this estimated minimum scattering order and enforces the consideration of a sufficient number of interactions during a simulation. Moreover, we identified two notably distinct cases that shape the kind of complexity that arises in MCRT simulations: the albedo-dominated and the optical depth-dominated case. Based on that, we analyzed implications regarding the best usage of a stretching method as a means to alleviate the scattering order problem. We find that its most suitable application requires taking into account the albedo and the optical depth. Then, we argue that the derived minimum scattering order can be used to assess the performance of a stretching method with regard to the scattering orders its usage promotes. Finally, we stress the need for developing advanced pathfinding techniques to fully solve the problem of MCRT simulations in the regime of high optical depths.
#### Discovery of torque reversal in the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304-1

 - **Abstract**
 We study the long-term spin period evolution of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304-1 and discover a new torque reversal after nearly three years of spinning up. The averaged spin-up rate before the torque reversal is $\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-13}$ Hz s$^{-1}$ which changes to an averaged spin-down rate of $\sim -5 \times 10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. The pulsar is detected at low luminosities (about ${2}\times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$) near periastron passages during the torque reversal suggesting that accretion is not quenched during this period. The long-term optical observations of the companion star suggest that the activity of the companion star may have decreased compared to the period when X-ray outbursts were earlier detected from the pulsar. The spin-up rates estimated during regular bright outbursts of the pulsar are observed to decrease systematically as the pulsar enters a low activity state after the outbursts and undergoes torque reversal. We explore plausible mechanisms to explain the torque reversal and long-term spin-down in this pulsar.
#### A tale of many $H_0$

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble parameter $H_0$, is not a univocally-defined quantity: it relates redshifts to distances in the near Universe, but is also a key parameter of the $\Lambda$CDM standard cosmological model. As such, $H_0$ affects several physical processes at different cosmic epochs, and multiple observables. We have counted more than a dozen $H_0$'s which are expected to agree if a) there are no significant systematics in the data and their interpretation and b) the adopted cosmological model is correct. With few exceptions (proverbially confirming the rule) these determinations do not agree at high statistical significance; their values cluster around two camps: the low (68 km/s/Mpc) and high (73 km/s/Mpc) camp. It appears to be a matter of anchors: the shape of the Universe expansion history agrees with the model, it is the normalizations that disagree. Beyond systematics in the data/analysis, if the model is incorrect there are only two viable ways to "fix" it: by changing the early time ($z\gtrsim 1100$) physics and thus the early time normalization, or by a global modification, possibly touching the model's fundamental assumptions (e.g., homogeneity, isotropy, gravity). None of these three options has the consensus of the community. The research community has been actively looking for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM for two decades; the one we might have found makes us wish we could put the genie back in the bottle.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmosphere analyses of the three hottest hypervelocity stars (space velocities between $\approx$ 1500-2800 km s$^{-1}$) known to date, which were recently discovered spectroscopically and identified as runaways from Type Ia supernovae. The hottest of the three (J0546$+$0836, effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 95,000 $\pm$ 15,000 K, surface gravity log g = $5.5 \pm 0.5$) has an oxygen-dominated atmosphere with a significant amount of carbon (C = $0.10 \pm 0.05$, O = $0.90 \pm 0.05$, mass fractions). Its mixed absorption+emission line spectrum exhibits photospheric absorption lines from O V and O VI as well as O III and O IV emission lines that are formed in a radiation-driven wind with a mass-loss rate of the order of $10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Spectroscopically, J0546$+$0836 is a [WC]-PG1159 transition-type pre-white dwarf. The second object (J0927$-$6335) is a PG1159-type white dwarf with a pure absorption-line spectrum dominated by C III/C IV and O III/O IV. We find $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 60,000 $\pm$ 5000 K, log g = $7.0 \pm 0.5$, and a carbon- and oxygen-dominated atmosphere with C = $0.47 \pm 0.25$, O = $0.48 \pm 0.25$, and possibly a minute amount of helium (He = $0.05 \pm 0.05$). Comparison with post-AGB evolutionary tracks suggests a mass of $M\approx0.5$ $M_\odot$ for both objects, if such tracks can safely be applied to these stars. We find the third object (J1332$-$3541) to be a relatively massive ($M=0.89 M_\odot$) hydrogen-rich (DAO) white dwarf with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 65,657 $\pm$ 2390 K, log g = $8.38 \pm 0.08$, and abundances H = $0.65 \pm 0.04$ and He = $0.35 \pm 0.04$. We discuss our results in the context of the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D$^6$) scenario proposed for the origin of these stars.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the goals of Space Weather studies is to achieve a better understanding of impulsive phenomena, such as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), in order to improve our ability to forecast them and mitigate the risk to our technologically driven society. The essential part of achieving this goal is to assess the performance of forecasting models. To this end, the quality and availability of suitable data are of paramount importance. In this work, we have merged already publicly available data of CMEs from both in-situ and remote instrumentation in order to build a database of CME properties. To evaluate the accuracy of such a database and confirm the relationship between in-situ and remote observations, we have employed the drag-based model (DBM) due to its simplicity and inexpensive cost of computational resources. In this study, we have also explored the parameter space for the drag parameter and solar wind speed using a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate how well the DBM determines the propagation of CMEs for the events in the dataset. The dataset of geoeffective CMEs constructed as a result of this work provides validation of the initial hypothesis about DBM, and solar wind speed and also yields further insight into CME features like arrival time, arrival speed, lift-off time, etc. Using a data-driven approach, this procedure allows us to present a homogeneous, reliable, and robust dataset for the investigation of CME propagation. On the other hand, possible CME events are identified where DBM approximation is not valid due to model limitations and higher uncertainties in the input parameters, those events require more thorough investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of sub-second time variability of the X-ray emission of the black-hole binary GRS 1915+105 are very complex and strictly connected to its patterns of variability observed on long time scales. A key aspect for determining the geometry of the accretion flow is the study of time lags between emission at different energies, as they are associated to key time scales of the system. In particular, it is important to examine the lags associated to the strong low-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs), as the QPOs provide unambiguous special frequencies to sample the variability. We have analyzed data from an observation with the AstroSat satellite, in which the frequency of the low-frequency QPO varies smoothly between 2.5 and 6.6 Hz on a time scale of ~10 hours. The derived phase lags show the same properties and evolution of those observed on time scales of a few hundred days, indicating that changes in the system geometry can take place on times below one day. We fit selected energy spectra of the source and rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO with a time-variable Comptonization model, as done previously to RossiXTE data of the same source, and find that indeed the derived parameters match those obtained for variations on much longer time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We have monitored the Didymos-Dimorphos binary system in imaging polarimetric mode before and after the impact from the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission. A previous spectropolarimetric study showed that the impact caused a dramatic drop in polarisation. Our longer-term monitoring shows that the polarisation of the post-impact system remains lower than the pre-impact system even months after the impact, suggesting that some fresh ejecta material remains in the system at the time of our observations, either in orbit or settled on the surface. The slope of the post-impact polarimetric curve is shallower than that of the pre-impact system, implying an increase in albedo of the system. This suggests that the ejected material is composed of smaller and possibly brighter particles than those present on the pre-impact surface of the asteroid. Our polarimetric maps show that the dust cloud ejected immediately after the impact polarises light in a spatially uniform manner (and at a lower level than pre-impact). Later maps exhibit a gradient in polarisation between the photocentre (which probes the asteroid surface) and the surrounding cloud and tail. The polarisation occasionally shows some small-scale variations, the source of which is not yet clear. The polarimetric phase curve of Didymos-Dimorphos resembles that of the S-type asteroid class.

 - **Abstract**
 This study combines cosmic chronometer (CC) Hubble parameter data with growth rate (f) observations to constrain the $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ parameter. Utilizing a consistency relation independent of cosmological models, we employ Gaussian process regression to reconstruct Hubble parameter and growth rate values. The resulting $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2$ constraint is $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2=0.139\pm0.017$. Incorporating $H_0$ measurements, we find $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ values from CC data ($0.308\pm0.057$), tip of the Red Giant Branch ($0.285\pm0.038$), and SHOES measurements ($0.259\pm0.033$). Interestingly, a higher mean $H_0$ correlates with a lower mean $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. In summary, our cosmological model-independent approach offers valuable constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$, affirming the consistency of FLRW and Newtonian perturbation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Transiting planets with orbital periods longer than 40 d are extremely rare among the 5000+ planets discovered so far. The lack of discoveries of this population poses a challenge to research into planetary demographics, formation, and evolution. Here, we present the detection and characterization of HD88986b, a potentially transiting sub-Neptune, possessing the longest orbital period among known transiting small planets (< 4 R$_{\oplus}$) with a precise mass measurement ($\sigma_M/M$ > 25%). Additionally, we identified the presence of a massive companion in a wider orbit around HD88986. Our analysis reveals that HD88986b, based on two potential single transits on sector 21 and sector 48 which are both consistent with the predicted transit time from the RV model, is potentially transiting. The joint analysis of RV and photometric data show that HD88986b has a radius of 2.49$\pm$0.18 R$_{\oplus}$, a mass of 17.2$^{+4.0}_{-3.8}$ M$_{\oplus}$, and it orbits every 146.05$^{+0.43}_{-0.40}$ d around a subgiant HD88986 which is one of the closest and brightest exoplanet host stars (G2V type, R=1.543 $\pm$0.065 R$_{\odot}$, V=$6.47\pm 0.01$ mag, distance=33.37$\pm$0.04 pc). The nature of the outer, massive companion is still to be confirmed; a joint analysis of RVs, Hipparcos, and Gaia astrometric data shows that with a 3$\sigma$ confidence interval, its semi-major axis is between 16.7 and 38.8 au and its mass is between 68 and 284 M$_{Jup}$. HD88986b's wide orbit suggests the planet did not undergo significant mass loss due to extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star. Therefore, it probably maintained its primordial composition, allowing us to probe its formation scenario. Furthermore, the cold nature of HD88986b (460$\pm$8 K), thanks to its long orbital period, will open up exciting opportunities for future studies of cold atmosphere composition characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploiting the Persistent Homology technique and an associated complementary representation which enables us to construct a synergistic pipeline for different topological features quantified by Betti curves in reducing the degeneracy between cosmological parameters, we investigate the footprint of summed massive neutrinos ($M_{\nu}$) in different density fields simulated by the publicly available Quijote suite. Evolution of topological features in the context of super-level filtration on three-dimensional density fields, reveals remarkable indicators for constraining the $M_{\nu}$ and $\sigma_8$. The abundance of 2-holes is more sensitive to the presence of $M_{\nu}$, also the persistence of topological features plays a crucial role in cosmological inference and reducing the degeneracy associated with $M_{\nu}$ simulation rather than their birth thresholds when either the total matter density ($m$) field or those part including only cold dark matter+baryons ($cb$) is utilized. Incorporating the Betti-1 and Betti-2 for $cb$ part of $M^+_{\nu}$ simulation marginalized over the thresholds implies $5\%$ variation compared to the massless neutrinos simulation. The constraint on $M_{\nu}$ from $\beta_k$ and its joint analysis with birth threshold and persistency of topological features for total mass density field smoothed by $R=5$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ at zero redshift reach to $0.0172$ eV and $0.0152$ eV, at $1\sigma$ confidence interval, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: High-resolution spectrographs fed by adaptive optics (AO) provide a unique opportunity to characterize directly imaged exoplanets. Observations with such instruments allow us to probe the atmospheric composition, spin rotation, and radial velocity of the planet, thereby helping to reveal information on its formation and migration history. The recent upgrade of the Cryogenic High-Resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES+) at the VLT makes it a highly suitable instrument for characterizing directly imaged exoplanets. Aims: In this work, we report on observations of $\beta$ Pictoris b with CRIRES+ and use them to constrain the planets atmospheric properties and update the estimation of its spin rotation. Methods: The data were reduced using the open-source \textit{pycrires} package. We subsequently forward-modeled the stellar, planetary, and systematic contribution to the data to detect molecules in the planet's atmosphere. We also used atmospheric retrievals to provide new constraints on its atmosphere. Results: We confidently detected water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of $\beta$ Pictoris b and retrieved a slightly sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio, which is in agreement with previous results. The interpretation is hampered by our limited knowledge of the C/O ratio of the host star. We also obtained a much improved constraint on its spin rotation of $19.9 \pm 1.0$ km/s, which gives a rotation period of $8.7 \pm 0.8$ hours, assuming no obliquity. We find that there is a degeneracy between the metallicity and clouds, but this has minimal impact on the retrieved C/O, $v\sin{i}$, and radial velocity. Our results show that CRIRES+ is performing well and stands as a highly useful instrument for characterizing directly imaged planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the approximations needed to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios. We examine the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model, a slowly evolving dark energy, an interacting dark energy model and massive neutrinos. For each, we test approximations for the perturbative kernel calculations, including the omission of screening terms and the use of perturbative kernels based on the Einstein-de Sitter universe; we explore different infrared-resummation schemes, tracer bias models and a linear treatment of massive neutrinos; we employ two models for redshift space distortions, the Taruya-Nishimishi-Saito prescription and the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure. This work further provides a preliminary validation of the codes being considered by Euclid for the spectroscopic clustering probe in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios. We calculate and compare the $\chi^2$ statistic to assess the different modelling choices. This is done by fitting the spectroscopic clustering predictions to measurements from numerical simulations and perturbation theory-based mock data. We compare the behaviour of this statistic in the beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cases, as a function of the maximum scale included in the fit, to the baseline $\Lambda$CDM case. We find that the Einstein-de Sitter approximation without screening is surprisingly accurate for all cases when comparing to the halo clustering monopole and quadrupole obtained from simulations. Our results suggest that the inclusion of multiple redshift bins, higher-order multipoles, higher-order clustering statistics (such as the bispectrum) and photometric probes such as weak lensing, will be essential to extract information on massive neutrinos, modified gravity and dark energy.
#### Detection of the relativistic Shapiro delay in a highly inclined  millisecond pulsar binary PSR J1012$-$4235

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1012$-$4235 is a 3.1ms pulsar in a wide binary (37.9 days) with a white dwarf companion. We detect, for the first time, a strong relativistic Shapiro delay signature in PSR J1012$-$4235. Our detection is the result of a timing analysis of data spanning 13 years and collected with the Green Bank, Parkes, and MeerKAT Radio Telescopes and the Fermi $\gamma$-ray space telescope. We measured the orthometric parameters for Shapiro delay and obtained a 22$\sigma$ detection of the $h_{\rm 3}$ parameter of 1.222(54) $\mu$s and a 200$\sigma$ detection of $\varsigma$ of 0.9646(49). With the assumption of general relativity, these measurements constrain the pulsar mass ($M_{\rm p}=1.44^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$M$_{\odot}$), the mass of the white dwarf companion ($M_{\rm c} = 0.270^{+0.016}_{-0.015}$M$_{\odot}$ ), and the orbital inclination ($i=88.06^{+0.28}_{-0.25} \deg$). Including the early $\gamma$-ray data in our timing analysis facilitated a precise measurement of the proper motion of the system of 6.58(5) mas yr$^{-1}$. We also show that the system has unusually small kinematic corrections to the measurement of the orbital period derivative, and therefore has the potential to yield stringent constraints on the variation of the gravitational constant in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore fitting gamma-ray burst spectra with three physically-motivated models, and thus revisit the viability of synchrotron radiation as the primary source of GRB prompt emission. We pick a sample of 100 bright GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), based on their energy flux values. In addition to the standard empirical spectral models used in previous GBM spectroscopy catalogs, we also consider three physically-motivated models; (a) a Thermal Synchrotron model, (b) a Band model with a High-energy Cutoff, and (c) a Smoothly Broken Power Law (SBPL) model with a Multiplicative Broken Power Law (MBPL). We then adopt the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to compare the fits obtained and choose the best model. We find that 42% of the GRBs from the fluence spectra and 23% of GRBs from the peak-flux spectra have one of the three physically-motivated models as their preferred one. From the peak-flux spectral fits, we find that the low-energy index distributions from the empirical model fits for long GRBs peak around the synchrotron value of -2/3, while the two low-energy indices from the SBPL+MBPL fits of long GRBs peak close to the -2/3 and -3/2 values expected for a synchrotron spectrum below and above the cooling frequency.
