 An intensive reverberation mapping campaign on the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk817 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed significant variations in the response of the broad UV emission lines to fluctuations in the continuum emission. The response of the prominent UV emission lines changes over a $\sim$60-day duration, resulting in distinctly different time lags in the various segments of the light curve over the 14 months observing campaign. One-dimensional echo-mapping models fit these variations if a slowly varying background is included for each emission line. These variations are more evident in the CIV light curve, which is the line least affected by intrinsic absorption in Mrk817 and least blended with neighboring emission lines. We identify five temporal windows with distinct emission line response, and measure their corresponding time delays, which range from 2 to 13 days. These temporal windows are plausibly linked to changes in the UV and X-ray obscuration occurring during these same intervals. The shortest time lags occur during periods with diminishing obscuration, whereas the longest lags occur during periods with rising obscuration. We propose that the obscuring outflow shields the ultraviolet broad lines from the ionizing continuum. The resulting change in the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum, as seen by clouds at a range of distances from the nucleus, is responsible for the changes in the line response.

 - **Abstract**
 Intensity mapping experiments will soon have surveyed large swathes of the sky, providing information about the underlying matter distribution of the early universe. The resulting maps can be used to recover statistical information, such as the power spectrum, about the measured spectral lines (for example, HI, [CII], and [OIII]). However precise power spectrum measurements, such as the 21 cm autocorrelation, continue to be challenged by the presence of bright foregrounds and non-trivial systematics. By crosscorrelating different data sets, it may be possible to mitigate the effects of both foreground uncertainty and uncorrelated instrumental systematics. Beyond their own merit, crosscorrelations could also be used to recover autocorrelation information. Such a technique was proposed in Beane et al. (2019) for recovering the 21 cm power spectrum. Generalizing their result, we develop a statistical framework for combining multiple crosscorrelation signals in order to infer information about the corresponding autocorrelations. We do this first within the Least Squares Estimator (LSE) framework, and show how one can derive their estimator, along with several alternative estimators. We also investigate the posterior distribution of recovered autocorrelation and associated model parameters. We find that for certain noise regimes and cosmological signal modeling assumptions this procedure is effective at recovering autospectra from a set of crosscorrelations. Finally, we showcase our framework in the context of several near-future line intensity mapping experiments.
#### A Nitrogen-rich SNR in M31: SNR Interaction with the CSM at Late Times

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00754
 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a supernova remnant (SNR) in M31 which is unlike any other remnant known in that galaxy. An optical MMT spectrum of WB92-26 sampling most of this marginally resolved object reveals strong lines of [O II], [Ne III], H I, [O III], [O I], [N II] and [S II], though the H I lines are very weak and the [N II] lines are very strong. Multiple velocity components are visible in those lines, with broad wings extending to $-2000$ and $+1500$ or $2000$ km/s (the heliocentric velocity of M31 is $-300$ km/s). The lines show strong peaks or shoulders near $-750$ km/s, $-50$ km/s, and $+800$ km/s in the M31 frame. The density implied by the [S II] ratio combined with the X-ray luminosity, FUV flux and optical size lead us to conclude that the optical emission lines are generated by shock waves, not photoionization. Consideration of the velocity structure indicates that the emission is from a shock in the circumstellar medium (CSM). This CSM must be depleted in H and enriched in He and N through CNO processing, and it must have had a high velocity before the explosion of the parent star, to explain the broad wings in the emission lines. We estimate the CSM shell to have a mass of 2 Msun, implying a Core Collapse SN. It is likely that Eta Car will produce a remnant resembling WB92-26 a few thousand years after it explodes.

 - **Abstract**
 There is controversy surrounding the origin and evolution of our universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study, we consider the possibility that some of these black holes formed from the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations. Since the mass of a primordial black hole is limited by the size of the cosmological horizon at the time of collapse, these SMBHs must form rather late, and are naively in conflict with CMB spectral distortion constraints. Such limits, however, can be avoided if the distribution of primordial curvature perturbations is highly non-Gaussian. In this study, we present a model of multi-field inflation -- the curvaton model supplemented with self-interactions -- which can viably yield such dramatic non-Gaussinities. Furthermore, we calculate the maximal abundance of black holes that can be generated in this scenario and find this to be consistent with the observed population of high-redshift SMBHs. This result is particularly timely in light of recent evidence from the NANOGrav experiment for a stochastic gravitational wave background consistent with SMBH mergers.
#### Mode coupling coefficients between the convective core and radiative  envelope of $γ\,$Doradus and slowly pulsating B stars

 - **Abstract**
 Signatures of coupling between an inertial mode in the convective core and a gravito-inertial mode in the envelope have been found in four-year Kepler light curves of 16 rapidly rotating $\gamma\,$Doradus ($\gamma\,$Dor) stars. This makes it possible to obtain a measurement of the rotation frequency in their convective core. Despite their similar internal structure and available data, inertial modes have not yet been reported for slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars. We aim to provide a numerical counterpart of the recently published theoretical expressions for the mode-coupling coefficients, $\varepsilon$ and $\tilde{\varepsilon}$. These coefficients represent the two cases of a continuous and a discontinuous Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency profile at the core-envelope interface, respectively. We used asteroseismic forward models of two samples consisting of 26 SPB stars and 37 $\gamma\,$Dor stars to infer their numerical values of $\varepsilon$. The asteroseismically inferred values of $\varepsilon$ for the two samples are between 0.0 and 0.34. While $\varepsilon$ is most strongly correlated with the near-core rotation frequency for $\gamma\,$Dor stars, the fractional radius of the convective core instead provides the tightest correlation for SPB stars. We find $\varepsilon$ to decrease mildly as the stars evolve. Our asteroseismic results for the mode coupling support the theoretical interpretation and reveal that young, fast-rotating $\gamma\,$Dor stars are most suitable for undergoing couplings between inertial modes in the rotating convective core and gravito-inertial modes in the radiative envelope. The phenomenon has been found in 2.4\% of such pulsators with detected period spacing patterns, whereas it has not been seen in any of the SPB stars so far.

#### Constraints to the semimajor axis of outer particles with nodal  librations by general relativity effects

 - **Abstract**
 We study nodal librations of outer particles in the framework of the elliptical restricted three-body problem including general relativity (GR) effects. From an analytical treatment based on secular interactions up to quadrupole level, we derive equations that define the nodal libration region of an outer test particle, which depends on the physical and orbital parameters of the bodies of the system. From this, we analyze how the GR constrains the semimajor axis of outer test particles that experience nodal librations under the effects of an inner planet around a single stellar component. Such an upper limit of the semimajor axis, which is called a2,lim , depends on the mass of the star ms, the mass m1, the semimajor axis a1, and the eccentricity e1 of the inner planet, and the eccentricity e2 of the outer test particle. On the one hand, our results show that the greater m1, a1, and e2 and the smaller ms, the greater the value of a2,lim. On the other hand, for fixed ms, m1, a1, and e2, a2,lim does not strongly depend on e1, except for large values of such an orbital parameter. We remark that N-body experiments of particular scenarios that include GR show results consistent with the analytical criteria derived in the present research. Moreover, the study of hypothetical small body populations of real systems composed of a single star and an inner planetary-mass companion show that the GR effects can play a very important role in their global dynamics.
#### The MPI + CUDA Gaia AVU-GSR Parallel Solver Toward Next-generation  Exascale Infrastructures

 - **Abstract**
 We ported to the GPU with CUDA the Astrometric Verification Unit-Global Sphere Reconstruction (AVU-GSR) Parallel Solver developed for the ESA Gaia mission, by optimizing a previous OpenACC porting of this application. The code aims to find, with a [10,100]$\mu$as precision, the astrometric parameters of $\sim$$10^8$ stars, the attitude and instrumental settings of the Gaia satellite, and the global parameter $\gamma$ of the parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism, by solving a system of linear equations, $A\times x=b$, with the LSQR iterative algorithm. The coefficient matrix $A$ of the final Gaia dataset is large, with $\sim$$10^{11} \times 10^8$ elements, and sparse, reaching a size of $\sim$10-100 TB, typical for the Big Data analysis, which requires an efficient parallelization to obtain scientific results in reasonable timescales. The speedup of the CUDA code over the original AVU-GSR solver, parallelized on the CPU with MPI+OpenMP, increases with the system size and the number of resources, reaching a maximum of $\sim$14x, >9x over the OpenACC application. This result is obtained by comparing the two codes on the CINECA cluster Marconi100, with 4 V100 GPUs per node. After verifying the agreement between the solutions of a set of systems with different sizes computed with the CUDA and the OpenMP codes and that the solutions showed the required precision, the CUDA code was put in production on Marconi100, essential for an optimal AVU-GSR pipeline and the successive Gaia Data Releases. This analysis represents a first step to understand the (pre-)Exascale behavior of a class of applications that follow the same structure of this code. In the next months, we plan to run this code on the pre-Exascale platform Leonardo of CINECA, with 4 next-generation A200 GPUs per node, toward a porting on this infrastructure, where we expect to obtain even higher performances.

 - **Abstract**
 Experimental data suggest that the Higgs potential has a lower ground state at high field values. Consequently, decaying from the electroweak to the true vacuum nucleates bubbles that expand rapidly and can have dire consequences for our Universe. This overview of our last study [1] regarding the cosmological implications of vacuum metastability during Starobinsky inflation was presented at the HEP2023 conference. Following the framework established in [2], we showcased our state-of-the-art lower bounds on the non-minimal coupling $\xi$, which resulted from a dedicated treatment of the effective Higgs potential in $R+R^2$ gravity. The effects of this consideration involved the generation of destabilising terms in the potential and the sensitive dependence of bubble nucleation on the last moments of inflation. In this regime, spacetime deviates increasingly from de Sitter and thus the validity of our approach reaches its limit, but at earlier times, we recover our result hinting against eternal inflation.
#### Achromatic rapid flares in hard X-rays in the $γ$-ray binary LS I  +61-303

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the presence of very rapid hard X-ray variability in the $\gamma$-ray binary LS I +61 303. The results were obtained by analysing NuSTAR data, which show two achromatic strong flares on ks time-scales before apastron. The Swift-BAT orbital X-ray light curve is also presented, and the NuSTAR data are put in the context of the system orbit. The spectrum and estimated physical conditions of the emitting region indicate that the radiation is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons, likely produced in a shocked pulsar wind. The achromaticity suggests that losses are dominated by escape or adiabatic cooling in a relativistic flow, and the overall behaviour in hard X-rays can be explained by abrupt changes in the size of the emitting region and/or its motion relative to the line of sight, with Doppler boosting potentially being a prominent effect. The rapid changes of the emitter could be the result of different situations such as quick changes in the intra-binary shock, variations in the re-accelerated shocked pulsar wind outside the binary, or strong fluctuations in the location and size of the Coriolis shock region. Although future multi-wavelength observations are needed to further constrain the physical properties of the high-energy emitter, this work already provides important insight into the complex dynamics and radiation processes in LS I +61-303.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST Camera pixel response has been characterized using laboratory measurements with a grid of artificial stars. We quantify the contributions to photometry, centroid, point-spread function size, and shape measurement errors due to small anomalies in the LSSTCam CCDs. The main sources of those anomalies are quantum efficiency variations and pixel area variations induced by the amplifier segmentation boundaries and "tree-rings" -- circular variations in silicon doping concentration. We studied the effects using artificial stars projected on the sensors and find that the resulting measurement uncertainties pass the ten-year LSST survey science requirements. In addition, we verify that the tree-ring effects can be corrected using flat-field images if needed, because the astronomic shifts and shape measurement errors they induce correlate well with the flat-field signal. Nevertheless, further sensor anomaly studies with on-sky data should probe possible temporal and wavelength-dependent effects.
#### Estimating the coincidence rate between the optical and radio array of  IceCube-Gen2

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00961
 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube-Gen2 Neutrino Observatory is proposed to extend the all-flavour energy range of IceCube beyond PeV energies. It will comprise two key components: I) An enlarged 8$\,$km$^3$ in-ice optical Cherenkov array to measure the continuation of the IceCube astrophysical neutrino flux and improve IceCube's point source sensitivity above $\sim\,$100$\,$TeV; and II) A very large in-ice radio array with a surface area of about 500$\,$km$^2$. Radio waves propagate through ice with a kilometer-long attenuation length, hence a sparse radio array allows us to instrument a huge volume of ice to achieve a sufficient sensitivity to detect neutrinos with energies above tens of PeV. The different signal topologies for neutrino-induced events measured by the optical and in-ice radio detector - the radio detector is mostly sensitive to the cascades produced in the neutrino interaction, while the optical detector can detect long-ranging muon and tau leptons with high accuracy - yield highly complementary information. When detected in coincidence, these signals will allow us to reconstruct the neutrino energy and arrival direction with high fidelity. Furthermore, if events are detected in coincidence with a sufficient rate, they resemble the unique opportunity to study systematic uncertainties and to cross-calibrate both detector components. We present the expected rate of coincidence events for 10 years of operation. Furthermore, we analyzed possible detector optimizations to increase the coincidence rate.
#### Effect of Instrumental Polarization with a Half-Wave Plate on the  $B$-Mode Signal: Prediction and Correction

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00967
 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the effect of half-wave plate (HWP) imperfections inducing intensity leakage to the measurement of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization signal with future satellite missions focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The HWP is modeled with the Mueller formalism, and coefficients are decomposed for any incident angle into harmonics of the HWP rotation frequency due to azimuthal angle dependence. Although we use a general formalism, band-averaged matrix coefficients are calculated as an example for a 9-layer sapphire HWP using EM propagation simulations. We perform simulations of multi-detector observations in a band centered at 140\,GHz using \LB instrumental configuration. We show both theoretically and with the simulations that most of the artefacts on Stokes parameter maps are produced by the dipole leakage on $B$-modes induced by the fourth harmonics $M^{(4f)}_{QI}$ and $M^{(4f)}_{UI}$. The resulting effect is strongly linked to the spin-2 focal plane scanning cross linking parameters. We develop a maximum likelihood-based method to correct the IP leakage by joint fitting of the Mueller matrix coefficients as well as the Stokes parameter maps. % by modifying the standard map-making procedure. We show that the residual leakage after correction leads to an additional noise limited uncertainty on $r$ of the order of $10^{-7}$, independently of the value of the Mueller matrix coefficients. We discuss the impact of the monopole signal and the potential coupling with other systematic effects such as gain variations and detector nonlinearities.
#### Spectropolarimetry of Type II supernovae (II) Intrinsic supernova  polarization and its relations with the photometric/spectroscopic properties

 - **Abstract**
 The explosion processes of supernovae (SNe) are imprinted in their explosion geometries. Here, we study the intrinsic polarization of 15 hydrogen-rich core-collapse SNe and explore the relation with the photometric and spectroscopic properties. Our sample shows diverse properties of the continuum polarization. The polarization of most SNe has a low degree at early phases but shows a sudden rise to $\sim 1$ \% degree at certain points during the photospheric phase as well as a slow decline during the tail phase, with a constant polarization angle. The variation in the timing of peak polarisation values implies diversity in the explosion geometry: some SNe have aspherical structures only in their helium cores, while in other SNe these reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope with a common axis from the helium core to the hydrogen envelope. Other SNe show high polarization from early phases and a change of the polarization angle around the middle of the photospheric phase. This implies that the ejecta are significantly aspherical to the outermost layer and have multi-directional aspherical structures. Exceptionally, the Type~IIL SN~2017ahn shows low polarization at both the photospheric and tail phases. Our results show that the timing of the polarization rise in Type~IIP SNe is likely correlated with their brightness, velocity and the amount of radioactive Ni produced: brighter SNe with faster ejecta velocity and a larger $^{56}$Ni mass have more extended-aspherical explosion geometries. In particular, there is a clear correlation between the timing of the polarization rise and the explosion energy, that is, the explosion asphericity is proportional to the explosion energy. This implies that the development of a global aspherical structure, e.g., a jet, might be the key to realising an energetic SN in the mechanism of SN explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-3 is a high-mass X-ray binary with a compact object accreting matter from a Wolf-Rayet donor star. Recently, it has been revealed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) as a hidden Galactic ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) source with a luminosity above the Eddington limit along the direction of a narrow (opening angle <~32 degree) funnel. In between the IXPE observations, we observed Cyg X-3 with the European VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) Network at 22 GHz and the NICER X-ray instrument. To probe possible relations between the X-ray funnel and the potential radio jet from the ULX, we analyzed the simultaneous multi-wavelength data. Our high-resolution VLBI image reveals an elongated structure with a position angle of -3.2+/-0.4 degree, accurately perpendicular to the direction of the linear X-ray polarization. Because Cyg X-3 was in the radio quiescent state on 2022 November 10, we identify the mas-scale structure as the innermost radio jet. The finding indicates that the radio jet propagates along and within the funnel. Moreover, the jet is marginally resolved in the transverse direction. This possibly results from the strong stellar winds and the rapid orbital motion of the binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 In early dark energy (EDE) resolution of Hubble tension, the spectral index $n_s$ of primordial scalar perturbation follows a scaling relation $\delta n_s\simeq 0.4\frac{\delta H_0}{H_0}$, where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. However, this $n_s-H_0$ relation was obtained based on the datasets including Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In this paper, we investigate this scaling relation with Planck-independent CMB data, i.e. ACT and SPT-3G combined with WMAP(+BAO+Pantheon), respectively. Our results show that the WMAP+SPT-3G dataset also follows this scaling relation, while the WMAP+ACT dataset seems to favor smaller $n_s$, which is related to the fact that the critical redshift $z_c$, at which EDE is excited, favored by the WMAP+ACT dataset is lower and closer to the recombination time.

 - **Abstract**
 We have used the IRAM 30-m telescope to map some targets with HCO$^+$ (1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0) lines in order to search for gas infall evidence in the clumps. In this paper, we report the mapping results for 13 targets. All of these targets show HCO$^+$ emissions, while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emissions are observed in ten of them. The HCO$^+$ integrated intensity maps of ten targets show clear clumpy structures, and nine targets show clumpy structures in the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ maps. Using the RADEX radiative transfer code, we estimate the column density of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and determine the abundance ratio [H$^{13}$CO$^+$]/[H$_2$] to be approximately 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-10}$. Based on the asymmetry of the HCO$^+$ line profiles, we identify 11 targets show blue profiles, while six clumps have global infall evidence. We use the RATRAN and two-layer models to fit the HCO$^+$ line profiles of these infall sources, and analyze their spatial distribution of the infall velocity. The average infall velocities estimated by these two models are 0.24 -- 1.85 km s$^{-1}$ and 0.28 -- 1.45 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The mass infall rate ranges from approximately 10$^{-5}$ to 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which suggests that intermediate- or high-mass stars may be forming in the target regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube realtime alert system has been operating since 2016. It provides prompt alerts on high-energy neutrino events to the astroparticle physics community. The localization regions for the incoming direction of neutrinos are published through NASA's Gamma-ray Coordinate Network (GCN). The IceCube realtime system consists of infrastructure dedicated to the selection of alert events, the reconstruction of their topology and arrival direction, the calculation of directional uncertainty contours and the distribution of the event information through public alert networks. Using a message-based workflow management system, a dedicated software (SkyDriver) provides a representational state transfer (REST) interface to parallelized reconstruction algorithms. In this contribution, we outline the improvements of the internal infrastructure of the IceCube realtime system that aims to streamline the internal handling of neutrino events, their distribution to the SkyDriver interface, the collection of the reconstruction results as well as their conversion into human- and machine-readable alerts to be publicly distributed through different alert networks. An approach for the long-term storage and cataloging of alert events according to findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) principles is outlined.

 The KM3NeT Collaboration is building and operating two deep sea neutrino telescopes at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The telescopes consist of latices of photomultiplier tubes housed in pressure-resistant glass spheres, called digital optical modules and arranged in vertical detection units. The two main scientific goals are the determination of the neutrino mass ordering and the discovery and observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe. Neutrinos are detected via the Cherenkov light, which is induced by charged particles originated in neutrino interactions. The photomultiplier tubes convert the Cherenkov light into electrical signals that are acquired and timestamped by the acquisition electronics. Each optical module houses the acquisition electronics for collecting and timestamping the photomultiplier signals with one nanosecond accuracy. Once finished, the two telescopes will have installed more than six thousand optical acquisition nodes, completing one of the more complex networks in the world in terms of operation and synchronization. The embedded software running in the acquisition nodes has been designed to provide a framework that will operate with different hardware versions and functionalities. The hardware will not be accessible once in operation, which complicates the embedded software architecture. The embedded software provides a set of tools to facilitate remote manageability of the deployed hardware, including safe reconfiguration of the firmware. This paper presents the architecture and the techniques, methods and implementation of the embedded software running in the acquisition nodes of the KM3NeT neutrino telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 A prime motivation for compiling catalogues of any celestial X-ray source is to increase our numbers of rare sub-classes. In this work we take a recent multi-mission catalogue of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and look for hitherto poorly-studied ULX candidates that are luminous ($L_{\rm X} \geq 10^{40} \rm ~erg~s^{-1}$), bright ($f_{\rm X} \geq 5 \times 10^{-13} \rm ~erg~cm~s^{-1}$) and have archival XMM-Newton data. We speculate that this luminosity regime may be ideal for identifying new pulsating ULXs (PULXs), given that the majority of known PULXs reach similar high luminosities. We find three sources that match our criteria, and study them using archival data. We find 4XMM J165251.5-591503 to possess a bright and variable Galactic optical/IR counterpart, and so conclude it is very likely to be a foreground interloper. 4XMM J091948.8-121429 does appear an excellent ULX candidate associated with the dwarf irregular galaxy PGC 26378, but has only one detection to date with low data quality. The best dataset belongs to 4XMM J112054.3+531040 which we find to be a moderately variable, spectrally hard ($\Gamma \approx 1.4$) X-ray source located in a spiral arm of NGC 3631. Its spectral hardness is similar to known PULXs, but no pulsations are detected by accelerated pulsation searches in the available data. We discuss whether other missions provide objects for similar studies, and compare this method to others suggested for identifying good PULX candidates.
#### Searching for high-energy neutrinos from shock-interaction powered  supernovae with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube are for the most part unresolved. Extragalactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have been suggested as candidate multi-messenger sources. In interaction-powered supernovae, a shock propagates in a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), producing a bright optical emission and potentially accelerating particles to relativistic energies. Shock interaction is believed to be the main energy source for Type IIn supernovae (identified by narrow lines in the spectrum), hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae and a subset of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae. Production of high-energy neutrinos is expected in collisions between the accelerated protons in the shocks and the cold CSM particles. We select a catalog of interaction-powered supernovae from the Bright Transient Survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility. We exploit a novel modeling effort that connects the time evolution of the optical emission to the properties of the ejecta and the CSM, allowing us to set predictions of the neutrino flux for each source. In this contribution, we describe a stacking search for high-energy neutrinos from this population of CCSNe with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.
#### Non-modulated pyramid wavefront sensor: Why, how and when to use it to  sense and correct atmospheric turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The diffusion of adaptive optics systems in astronomical instrumentation for large ground based telescopes is rapidly increasing and the pyramid wavefront sensor is replacing the Shack-Hartmann as standard solution for single conjugate adaptive optics systems. The pyramid wavefront sensor is typically used with a tip/tilt modulation to increase the linearity range of the sensor, but the non-modulated case is interesting because it maximizes the sensor sensitivity. The latter case is generally avoided for the reduced linearity range that prevents robust operation in the presence of atmospheric turbulence. Aims. We aim to solve part of the issues of the non-modulated pyramid wavefront sensor by reducing the model error in the interaction matrix. We linearize the sensor response in the working conditions without extending the sensor linearity range. Methods. We introduce a new calibration approach to model the response of pyramid wave front sensor in partial correction, where the working conditions in the presence of residual turbulence is considered. Results. We show how in simulations, through the new calibration approach, the pyramid wave front sensor without modulation can be used to sense and correct atmospheric turbulence and when this case is preferable to the modulated case.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Several high-mass transfer cataclysmic variables show evidence for outflow from the system, which could play an important role in their evolution. We investigate the system IX Vel, which was proposed to show similar characteristics. Aims: We study the structure of the IX Vel system, particularly the structure of its accretion flow and accretion disc. Methods: We use high-resolution time-resolved spectroscopy to construct radial velocity curves of the components in IX Vel, we compute Doppler maps of the system which we use to estimate the temperature distribution maps. Results: We improve the spectroscopic ephemeris of the system and its orbital period P_orb = 0.19392793(3) d. We construct Doppler maps of the system based on hydrogen and helium emission lines and the Bowen blend. The maps show features corresponding to the irradiated face of the secondary star, the outer rim of the accretion disc, and low-velocity components located outside the accretion disc and reaching towards L3. We constructed a temperature distribution map of the system using the Doppler maps of Balmer lines. Apart from the features found in the Doppler maps, the temperature distribution map shows a region of high temperature in the accretion disc connecting the expected position of a bright spot and the inner parts of the disc. Conclusions: We interpret the low-velocity emission found in the Doppler map as emission originating in the accretion disc wind and in an outflow region located in the vicinity of the third Lagrangian point L3. This makes IX Vel a member of the RW Sex class of Cataclysmic Variables.

 - **Abstract**
 Current space exploration programs call for the establishment of a permanent Human presence on the Moon. This paper considers periodic orbits of a shuttle between the Earth and the Moon. Such a shuttle will be needed to bring supplies to the Moon outpost and carry back those resources that are in short supply on Earth. To keep this shuttle in permanent periodic orbit it must have a thruster that forces it into an elliptical orbit from perigee near Earth to an apogee just beyond the Moon and back to perigee. The impacts of the Earth, Moon and Sun gravity on this orbit are considered. For this model we determine the eccentricity that minimizes the thrust requirements and the lunar $\Delta\, v$ requirements. We show that optimal placements of the eccentricity of the shuttle orbit can produce significant improvement in thrust (and fuel) requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 The prediction of the strength of an upcoming solar cycle has been a long-standing challenge in the field of solar physics. The inherent stochastic nature of the underlying solar dynamo makes the strength of the solar cycle vary in a wide range. Till now, the polar precursor methods and the dynamo simulations, that use the strength of the polar field at the cycle minimum to predict the strength of the following cycle has gained reasonable consensus by providing convergence in the predictions for solar cycles 24 and 25. Recently, it has been shown that just by using the observed correlation of the polar field rise rate with the peak of the polar field at the cycle minimum and the amplitude of the following cycle, a reliable prediction can be made much earlier than the cycle minimum. In this work, we perform surface flux transport (SFT) simulations to explore the robustness of this correlation against the stochastic fluctuations of BMR tilt properties including anti-Joy and anti-Hale type anomalous BMRs, and against the variation of meridional flow speed. We find that the observed correlation is a robust feature of the solar cycles and thus it can be utilized for a reliable prediction of solar cycle much earlier than the cycle minimum, the usual landmark of the solar cycle prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 On Earth, the development of technology required easy access to open air combustion, which is only possible when oxygen partial pressure, P(O$_2$), is above 18\%. This suggests that only planets with significant atmospheric oxygen concentrations will be capable of developing ``advanced'' technospheres and hence detectable technosignatures.
#### Search for Galactic core-collapse supernovae in a decade of data taken  with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been continuously taking data to search for O(0.5-10) s long neutrino bursts since 2007. Even if a Galactic core-collapse supernova is optically obscured or collapses to a black hole instead of exploding, it will be detectable via the O(10) MeV neutrino burst emitted during the collapse. We discuss a search for such events covering the time between April 17, 2008 and December 31, 2019. Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 years of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on a 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O-Ne-Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ~ 25kpc was determined to be 0.23/yr. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal pollution onto white dwarfs is a wide-spread phenomenon that remains puzzling. Some of these white dwarfs also harbour gaseous debris disks. Their emission lines open a unique window to the physical properties of the polluting material, lending insights to their origin. Here, we model the emission line kinematics for the gas disk around SDSS J1228+1040, a system that has been continuously monitored for over two decades. Our model shows that the disk mass is strongly peaked at one solar radius (modulo the unknown inclination), and the disk eccentricity decreases from a value of 0.44 at the disk inner edge, to nearly zero at the outer edge. This eccentricity profile is exactly what one expects if the disk is in a global eccentric mode, precessing rigidly under the combined forces of general relativity and gas pressure, and with a period of 20 yrs. The gas disk contains a mass that is roughly equivalent to that of a 100-km rocky body, while the mass of the accompanying dust disk is likely insignificant. The disk eccentricity confirms an origin in tidal disruption, and we suggest that the disrupted body is sourced from a Mars-mass planetesimal disk within a few AU. More detailed analysis of this disk is warranted.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of selfinteracting boson stars with different scalar potentials going beyond the commonly used $\phi^4$ ansatz are studied. The scalar potential is extended to different values of the exponent $n$ of the form $V \propto \phi^n$. Two stability mechanism for boson stars are introduced, the first being a mass term and the second one a vacuum term. We present analytic scale-invariant expressions for these two classes of equations of state. The resulting properties of the boson star configurations differ considerably from previous calculations. We find three different categories of mass-radius relation: the first category resembles the mass-radius curve of selfbound stars, the second one those of neutron stars and the third one is the well known constant radius case from the standard $\phi^4$ potential. We demonstrate that the maximal compactness can reach extremely high values going to the limit of causality $C_\text{max} = 0.354$ asymptotically for $n\to\infty$. The maximal compactnesses exceed previously calculated values of $C_\text{max}=0.16$ for the standard $\phi^4$-theory and $C_\text{max}=0.21$ for vector-like interactions and is in line with previous results for solitonic boson stars. Hence, boson stars even described by a simple modified scalar potential in the form of $V \propto \phi^n$ can be ultra compact black hole mimickers where the photon ring is located outside the radius of the star.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution 3D maps of interstellar dust are critical for probing the underlying physics shaping the structure of the interstellar medium, and for foreground correction of astrophysical observations affected by dust. We aim to construct a new 3D map of the spatial distribution of interstellar dust extinction out to a distance of 1.25 kpc from the Sun. We leverage distance and extinction estimates to 54 million nearby stars derived from the Gaia BP/RP spectra. Using the stellar distance and extinction information, we infer the spatial distribution of dust extinction. We model the logarithmic dust extinction with a Gaussian Process in a spherical coordinate system via Iterative Charted Refinement and a correlation kernel inferred in previous work. We probe our 661 million dimensional posterior distribution using the variational inference method MGVI. Our 3D dust map achieves an angular resolution of 14' (Nside = 256). We sample the dust extinction in 516 distance bins spanning 69 pc to 1250 pc. We obtain a maximum distance resolution of 0.4 pc at 69 pc and a minimum distance resolution of 7 pc at 1.25 kpc. Our map resolves the internal structure of hundreds of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood and will be broadly useful for studies of star formation, Galactic structure, and young stellar populations. It is available for download in a variety of coordinate systems at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8187943 and can also be queried via the publicly available dustmaps Python package.
