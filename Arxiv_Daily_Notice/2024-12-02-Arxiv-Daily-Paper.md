#### Title:
          Comparison of Fast, Hybrid Imaging Architectures for Multi-scale, Hierarchical Aperture Arrays

 - **Abstract**
 Two major areas of modern radio astronomy, namely, explosive astrophysical transient phenomena and observations of cosmological structures, are driving the design of aperture arrays towards large numbers of low-cost elements consisting of multiple spatial scales spanning the dimensions of individual elements, the size of stations (groupings of individual elements), and the spacing between stations. Such multi-scale, hierarchical aperture arrays require a combination of data processing architectures -- pre-correlation beamformer, generic version of FFT-based direct imager, post-correlation beamformer, and post-correlation FFT imager -- operating on different ranges of spatial scales to obtain optimal performance in imaging the entire field of view. Adopting a computational cost metric based on the number of floating point operations, its distribution over the dimensions of discovery space, namely, field of view, angular resolution, polarisation, frequency, and time is examined to determine the most efficient hybrid architectures over the parameter space of hierarchical aperture array layouts. Nominal parameters of specific upcoming and planned arrays -- the SKA at low frequencies (SKA-low), SKA-low-core, a proposed long baseline extension to SKA-low (LAMBDA-I), compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), and a lunar array (FarView-core) -- are used to determine the most optimal architecture hierarchy for each from a computational standpoint, and provide a guide for designing hybrid architectures for multi-scale aperture arrays. For large, dense-packed layouts, a FFT-based direct imager is most efficient for most cadence intervals, and for other layouts that have relatively lesser number of elements or greater sparsity in distribution, the best architecture is more sensitive to the cadence interval, which in turn is determined by the science goals.

          Searching for compact hierarchical triple systems candidates in astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions

 - **Abstract**
 Compact hierarchical triple (CHT) systems, where a tertiary component orbits an inner binary, provide critical insights into stellar formation and evolution. Despite their importance, the detection of such systems, especially compact ones, remains challenging due to the complexity of their orbital dynamics and the limitations of traditional observational methods. This study aims to identify new CHT star systems among Gaia astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions by analysing the radial velocity (RV) amplitude of these systems, thereby improving our understanding of stellar hierarchies. We selected a sample of bright astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions from the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Stars catalogue. The RV peak-to-peak amplitude was used as an estimator, and we applied a new method to detect potential triple systems by comparing the RV-based semi-amplitude with the astrometric semi-amplitude. We used available binary and triple star catalogues to identify and validate candidates, with a subset confirmed through further examination of the RV and astrometric data. Our analysis resulted in the discovery of 956 CHT candidates among the orbital sources as well as another 3,115 probable close binary sources in stars with accelerated solutions. Exploring the inclination, orbital period, and eccentricity of the outer companion in these CHT systems provides strong evidence of mutual orbit alignment, as well as a preference towards moderate outer eccentricities. Our novel approach has proven effective in identifying potential triple systems thereby increasing their number in the catalogues. Our findings emphasise the importance of combined astrometric and RV data analysis in the study of multiple star systems.

          "Nuclear thermometers" reveal the origin of the universal r-process nucleosynthesis

 - **Abstract**
 The resembling behaviour of giant dipole resonances built on ground and excited states supports the validity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis and assigns giant dipole resonances as spectroscopic probes -- or ``nuclear thermometers'' -- to explore the cooling of the kilonova ejecta in neutron-star mergers down to the production of heavy elements beyond iron through the rapid-neutron capture or r-process. In previous work, we found a slight energy increase in the giant dipole resonance built on excited states at the typical temperatures of $1.0\gtrapprox T\gtrapprox0.7$ MeV where seed nuclei are produced, before ongoing neutron capture. Crucial data are presented here supporting an enhanced symmetry energy at $T=0.51$ MeV (or $5.9\times 10^9$ K) -- where the r-process occurs -- that lowers the binding energy in the Bethe-Weizsäcker semi-empirical mass formula and results in the close in of the neutron drip line. Ergo, providing an origin to the universality of elemental abundances by limiting the reaction network for r-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced symmetry energy away from the ground state is further supported by shell-model calculations of the nuclear electric dipole ({\sc E1}) polarizability -- inversely proportional to the symmetry energy -- as a result of the destructive contribution of the products of off-diagonal {\sc E1} matrix elements.

          Signatures of warm dark matter in the cosmological density fields extracted using Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to construct a machine-learning approach that allows for a pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) density field for various warm dark matter (WDM) models using the Lyman-alpha forest. With this regression machinery, we constrain the mass of a potential WDM particle from observed Lyman-alpha sightlines directly from the density field. We design and train a Bayesian neural network on the supervised regression task of recovering the optical depth-weighted density field $\Delta_\tau$ as well as its reconstruction uncertainty from the Lyman-alpha forest flux field. We utilise the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite at $4.1\leq z \leq 5.0$ as the main training and validation dataset. Leveraging the density field recovered by our neural network, we construct an inference pipeline to constrain the WDM particle masses based on the probability distribution function of the density fields. We find that our trained Bayesian neural network can accurately recover within a $1\sigma$ error $\geq 85\%$ of the density field pixels from a validation simulated dataset that encompasses multiple WDM and thermal models of the IGM. When predicting on Lyman-alpha skewers generated using the alternative hydrodynamical code Nyx not included in the training data, we find a $1\sigma$ accuracy rate $\geq 75\%$. We consider 2 samples of observed Lyman-alpha spectra from the UVES and GHOST instruments, at $z=4.4$ and $z=4.9$ respectively and fit the density fields recovered by our Bayesian neural network to constrain WDM masses. We find lower bounds on the WDM particle mass of $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} \geq 3.8$ KeV and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} \geq 2.2$ KeV at $2\sigma$ confidence, respectively. We are able to match current state-of-the-art WDM particle mass constraints using up to 40 times less observational data than Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques based on the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 A pulsar's scintillation bandwidth is inversely proportional to the scattering delay, making accurate measurements of scintillation bandwidth critical to characterize unmitigated delays in efforts to measure low-frequency gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. In this pilot work, we searched for a subset of known pulsars within $\sim$97% of the data taken with the PUPPI instrument for the AO327 survey with the Arecibo telescope, attempting to measure the scintillation bandwidths in the dataset by fitting to the 2D autocorrelation function of their dynamic spectra. We successfully measured 38 bandwidths from 23 pulsars (six without prior literature values), finding that: almost all of the measurements are larger than the predictions from NE2001 and YMW16 (two popular galactic models); NE2001 is more consistent with our measurements than YMW16; Gaussian fits to the bandwidth are more consistent with both electron density models than Lorentzian ones; and for the 17 pulsars with prior literature values, the measurements between various sources often vary by factors of a few. The success of Gaussian fits may be due to the use of Gaussian fits to train models in previous work. The variance of literature values over time could relate to the scaling factor used to compare measurements, but also seems consistent with time-varying interstellar medium parameters. This work can be extended to the rest of AO327 to further investigate these trends, highlighting the continuing importance of large archival datasets for projects beyond their initial conception.

 - **Abstract**
 The Coronagraphic Instrument onboard the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is an important stepping stone towards the characterization of habitable, rocky exoplanets. In a technology demonstration phase conducted during the first 18 months of the mission (expected to launch in late 2026), novel starlight suppression technology may enable direct imaging of a Jupiter analog in reflected light. Here we summarize the current activities of the Observation Planning working group formed as part of the Community Participation Program. This working group is responsible for target selection and observation planning of both science and calibration targets in the technology demonstration phase of the Roman Coronagraph. We will discuss the ongoing efforts to expand target and reference catalogs, and to model astrophysical targets (exoplanets and circumstellar disks) within the Coronagraph's expected sensitivity. We will also present preparatory observations of high priority targets.

          Development of an MKID frequency-to-pixel LED mapper for SPT-3G+

 - **Abstract**
 SPT-3G+ is the next-generation camera for the South Pole Telescope (SPT). SPT is designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the mm/sub-mm sky. The planned focal plane consists of 34,000 microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), divided among three observing bands centered at 220, 285, and 345 GHz. Each readout line is designed to measure 800 MKIDs over a 500 MHz bandwidth, which places stringent constraints on the accuracy of the frequency placement required to limit resonator collisions that reduce the overall detector yield. To meet this constraint, we are developing a two-step process that first optically maps the resonance to a physical pixel location, and then next trims the interdigitated capacitor (IDC) to adjust the resonator frequency. We present a cryogenic LED apparatus operable at 300 mK for the optical illumination of SPT-3G+ detector arrays. We demonstrate integration of the LED controls with the GHz readout electronics (RF-ICE) to take data on an array of prototype SPT-3G+ detectors. We show that this technique is useful for characterizing defects in the resonator frequency across the detector array and will allow for improvements in the detector yield.

          The transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays: the high-energy end of the Galactic spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays (CRs) is essential to make sense of the Local cosmic ray spectrum. Several models have been proposed to account for this transition in the 0.1 - 10 $\times 10^{18}$ eV range. For instance: ankle models, where the change from a steep Galactic component to a hard extragalactic spectrum occurs in the $4-10 \times 10^{18}$ eV region, dip models, where the interactions of CR protons with the CMB producing electron-positron pairs shape the ankle, or mixed composition models, in which extragalactic CRs are composed of nuclei of various types. In all these scenarios, the low-energy part of the transition involves the high-energy part of the Galactic component. Therefore, any information on the Galactic component, such as maximum energy, chemical composition, and spectrum after propagation, is crucial to understanding the Galactic-extragalactic transition. We briefly review the high-energy part of the CR spectrum expected from the best potential sources of Galactic CRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules has been a primary focus in studying the atmospheres of hot Jupiters, as doing so can help constrain the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The C/O ratio can help reveal the evolution and formation pathways of hot Jupiters and provide a strong understanding of the atmospheric composition. In the last decade, high-resolution spectral analyses have become increasingly useful in measuring precise abundances of several carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules. This allows for a more precise constraint of the C/O ratio. We present four transits of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b observed between 1.45 $-$ 2.45 $\mu$m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating InfraRed Spectrometer (IGRINS) on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected H$_2$O at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3.51. We tested for the presence of CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$, but we did not detect these carbon-bearing species. We ran a retrieval for all four molecules and obtained a water abundance of $\log_{10}(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = -2.24^{+0.57}_{-0.48}$. We obtained an upper limit on the C/O ratio of C/O $<$ 0.95. These findings are consistent with previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The LISA space observatory will explore the sub-Hz spectrum of gravitational wave emission from the Universe. The space environment, where will be immersed in, is responsible for charge accumulation on its free falling test masses (TMs) due to the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEP) impinging on the spacecraft. Primary and secondary particles produced in the spacecraft material eventually reach the TMs by depositing a net positive charge fluctuating in time. This work is relevant for any present and future space missions that, like LISA, host free-falling TMs as inertial reference. Aims. The coupling of the TM charge with native stray electrostatic field produces noise forces on the TMs, which can limit the performance of the LISA mission. A precise knowledge of the charging process allows us to predict the intensity of these charge-induced disturbances and to design specific counter-measures. Methods. We present a comprehensive toolkit that allows us to calculate the TM charging time-series in a geometry representative of LISA mission, and the associated induced forces under different conditions of the space environment by considering the effects of short, long GCR flux modulations and SEPs. Results. We study, for each of the previously mentioned conditions, the impact of spurious forces associated with the TM charging process on the mission sensitivity for gravitational wave detection.

          Stellar evolution along the AGB as revealed by the shape of Miras' visual light curves

 - **Abstract**
 A new analysis of a sample of visual light curves of Long Period Variable (LPV) Mira stars is presented. The curves cover the past four decades and are selected from the AAVSO data base as including a very large number of high-density and high-quality observations. The aim of the analysis is to offer a more precise, more quantitative and more systematic picture than available from earlier studies. The results corroborate earlier descriptions and reveal new correlations between the shapes of the light curves and the time spent by the star on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A family of nearly sinusoidal curves, associated with M-type spectral types and displaying no sign of having entered the thermally-pulsing phase (TP-AGB) is identified with good confidence. All other curves are clearly distinct from this family and usually start departing from it by displaying a broader luminosity minimum, implying a slowing down of the rate of luminosity increase on the ascending branch. This slowing down feature, referred to as a hump, spans across the ascending branch as the spectral-type of the star evolves from M to C. It may go all the way to maximal light or stop earlier, covering only part of the ascending branch. While this general average trend is established with good confidence, deviations from it cause a significant scatter of the parameters defining the shapes of the curves. Comments aimed at shedding light on the underlying physics are presented together with speculative interpretations, in the hope that they could encourage and inspire new studies, in particular based on simulations using state-of-the-art models of the inner star dynamics.

          Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- III: Long term evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. QPEs have shown to be invaluable in probing the orbits of SMOs in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this paper, we extend previous orbital analyses in Refs. arXiv:2401.11190, arXiv:2405.06429 by including extra effects, the SMO orbital decay due to collisions with the disk and the disk precession. We find clear Bayes evidence for orbital decay in GSN 069 and for disk precession in eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources. The detection of these effects provides informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. With tighter constraints on the SMO orbital parameters, we further confirm that these two QPE EMRIs are nearly circular orbiters which are consistent with the wet EMRI formation channel prediction, but are incompatible with either the dry loss-cone channel or the Hills mechanism. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of ultralight dark matter helps constrain the lower bound on minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales similar to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay and gravitational redshift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.

 - **Abstract**
 The daily measurements of the disc-integrated solar radio flux, observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, and 8800 MHz during the time interval of 1989 January 1 to 2019 December 17, are used to investigate the temporal evolution of radial differential rotation of solar corona using the methods of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and wavelet analysis. Overall, the results reveal that over the 30-year period, the rotation rates for the observed solar radio flux within the frequency range of 245\textendash8800 MHz show an increase with frequency. This verifies the existence of the radial differential rotation of the solar corona over long timescales of nearly 3 solar cycles. Based on the radio emission mechanism, to some extent, the results can also serve as an indicator of how the rotation of the solar upper atmosphere varies with altitude within a specific range. From the temporal variation of rotation cycle lengths of radio flux, the coronal rotation at different altitudes from the low corona to approximately 1.3 $R_{\odot}$ exhibits complex temporal variations with the progression of the solar cycle. However, in this altitude range, over the past 30 years from 1989 to 2019, the coronal rotation consistently becomes gradually slower as the altitude increases. Finally, the EEMD method can extract rotation cycle signals from these highly randomized radio emissions, and so it can be used to investigate the rotation periods for the radio emissions at higher or lower frequencies.

          A new method for studying the blazar variability on the shortest time scales and its application to S5 1803+784

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method for investigating the evolution of the properties of the blazar brightness variability on timescales from a few hours to a few days. Its essence lies in detecting sequentially located time intervals along the entire light curve, within which it is possible to determine the characteristic time of variability using the structure function. We applied this method to a uniform data series lasting several days provided by the TESS mission for blazar S5 1803+784. Then, we analyzed the found time parameters of variability coupled with the data of B-, V-, R-, and I-photometric observations. A correlation was found between the amplitude and the characteristic time of variability. The relation of these values with the spectral index of radiation has not been revealed. We conclude that the variability on a short time scale is formed due to the different Doppler factors for having different volume parts of the optical emitting region. At the same time, the radiation spectrum deflects slightly from the power-law.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit pulses of radiation at regular intervals, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The precise recording and modelling of the arrival times of pulsar emission is known as timing analysis. Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a subclass of pulsars that emit pulses very sporadically. Because of the sparse pulse times of arrival (ToAs) typically available for these sources, they are much more difficult to time than regular pulsars, to the extent that few RRATs currently have coherent timing solutions. In this work, we present the results of timing analyses for four RRATs discovered by the MeerTRAP transient survey using MeerKAT. We incorporated additional pulse ToAs from each source that have been detected since their original analysis. We confirmed the known timing solution for PSR J1843$-$0757, with a period of $P=2.03$ seconds, and a period derivative of $\dot{P}=4,13\times10^{-15}$. However, our analysis did not comport with the solution of MTP0005, which we conclude may have been mistakenly identified with the known PSR J1840$-$0815 in the original analysis. Finally, the spin period for MTP0007 was determined to be $1.023(1)$ seconds using a brute-force period fitting approach.

 - **Abstract**
 The innermost parts of the Milky Way (MW) are very difficult to observe due to the high extinction along the line of sight, especially close to the disc mid-plane. However, this region contains the most massive complex stellar component of the MW, the bulge, primarily composed of disc stars whose structure is (re-)shaped by the evolution of the bar. In this work, we extend the application of the orbit superposition method to explore the present-day 3D structure, orbital composition, chemical abundance trends and kinematics of the MW bulge. Thanks to our approach, we are able to transfer astrometry from Gaia and stellar parameters from APOGEE DR 17 to map the inner MW without obscuration by the survey footprint and selection function. We demonstrate that the MW bulge is made of two main populations originating from a metal-poor, high-{\alpha} thick disc and a metal-rich, low-{\alpha} thin disc, with a mass ratio of 4:3, seen as two major components in the MDF. Finer MDF structures hint at multiple sub-populations associated with different orbital families of the bulge, which, however, have broad MDFs themselves. Decomposition using 2D GMMs in [Fe/H] -[Mg/Fe] identifies five components including a population with ex-situ origin. Two dominant ones correspond to the thin and thick discs and two in between trace the transition between them. We show that no universal metallicity gradient value can characterise the MW bulge. The radial gradients closely trace the X-shaped bulge density structure, while the vertical gradient variations follow the boxy component. While having, on average, subsolar metallicity, the MW bulge populations are more metal-rich compared to the surrounding disc, in agreement with extragalactic observations and state-of-the-art simulations reinforcing its secular origin.

          Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of a slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool giant secondary star.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing number of man-made debris in Earth's orbit poses a threat to active satellite missions due to the risk of collision. Characterizing unknown debris is, therefore, of high interest. Light Curves (LCs) are temporal variations of object brightness and have been shown to contain information such as shape, attitude, and rotational state. Since 2015, the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) group of Space Research Institute (IWF) Graz has been building a space debris LC catalogue. The LCs are captured on a Single Photon basis, which sets them apart from CCD-based measurements. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have emerged as a viable technique for analyzing LCs. This work aims to classify Single Photon Space Debris using the ML framework. We have explored LC classification using k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Random Forest (RDF), XGBoost (XGB), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers in order to assess the difference in performance between traditional and deep models. Instead of performing classification on the direct LCs data, we extracted features from the data first using an automated pipeline. We apply our models on three tasks, which are classifying individual objects, objects grouped into families according to origin (e.g., GLONASS satellites), and grouping into general types (e.g., rocket bodies). We successfully classified Space Debris LCs captured on Single Photon basis, obtaining accuracies as high as 90.7%. Further, our experiments show that the classifiers provide better classification accuracy with automated extracted features than other methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Since the mechanism of energy release from solar flares is still not fully understood, the study of fine-scale features developing during flares becomes important for progressing towards a consistent picture of the essential physical mechanisms. Aims. We aim to probe the fine structures in flare ribbons at the chromospheric level using high-resolution observations with imaging and spectral techniques. Methods. We present a GOES C2.4 class solar flare observed with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The high-resolution SST observations offer spectroscopic data in the H-alpha, Ca II 8542 Å, and H-beta lines, which we use to analyse the flare ribbon. Results. Within the eastern flare ribbon, chromospheric bright blobs were detected and analysed in Ca II 8542 Å, H-alpha, and H-beta wavelengths. A comparison of blobs in H-beta observations and Si IV 1400 Å has also been performed. These blobs are observed as almost circular structures having widths from 140 km-200 km. The intensity profiles of the blobs show a red wing asymmetry. Conclusions. From the high spatial and temporal resolution H-beta observations, we conclude that the periodicity of the blobs in the flare ribbon, which are near-equally spaced in the range 330-550 km, is likely due to fragmented reconnection processes within a flare current sheet. This supports the theory of a direct link between fine-structure flare ribbons and current sheet tearing. We believe our observations represent the highest resolution evidence of fine-structure flare ribbons to date.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarimetry is a fine tool to probe the accretion geometry and physical processes operating in the proximity of compact objects, black holes and neutron stars. Recent discoveries made by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer put our understanding of the accretion picture in question. The observed high levels of X-ray polarization in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are challenging to achieve within the conventional scenarios. In this work we investigate a possibility that a fraction (or even all) of the observed polarized signal arises from scattering in the equatorial accretion disk winds, the slow and extended outflows, which are often detected in these systems via spectroscopic means. We find that the wind scattering can reproduce the levels of polarization observed in these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback uncertainty is a limiting systematic for next-generation weak gravitational lensing analyses. At the same time, high-resolution weak lensing maps are best analyzed at the field-level. Thus, robustly accounting for the baryonic effects in the projected matter density field is required. Ideally, constraints on feedback strength from astrophysical probes should be folded into the weak lensing field-level likelihood. We propose a macroscopic method based on an empirical correlation between feedback strength and an optimal transport cost. Since feedback is local re-distribution of matter, optimal transport is a promising concept. In this proof-of-concept, we de-baryonify projected mass around individual halos in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We choose the de-baryonified solution as the point of maximum likelihood on the hypersurface defined by fixed optimal transport cost around the observed full-physics halos. The likelihood is approximated through a normalizing flow trained on multiple gravity-only simulations. We find that the set of de-baryonified halos reproduces the correct convergence power spectrum suppression. There is considerable scatter when considering individual halos. We outline how the optimal transport de-baryonification concept can be generalized to full convergence maps.

 This study re examines the effect of nuclear deformation on the calculated Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of neutron deficient (178 192Hg, 185 194Pb and 196 206Po) nuclei. The nuclear ground state properties and shape parameters were calculated using the Relativistic Mean Field model. Three different density dependent interactions were used in the calculation. Estimated shape parameters were later used within the framework of deformed proton-neutron quasi random phase approximations model, with a separable interaction, to calculate the GT strength distributions, half lives and branching ratios for these neutron deficient isotopes. It was concluded that half lives and GT strength distributions vary considerably with change in shape parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi-LAT satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified about 2900 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, including 69 reported here for the first time. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of about 500 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3.0. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources for understanding the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be effectively measured using Fermi-LAT data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the most nearby giant spiral galaxy, an opportunity to study with high resolution dynamical phenomena occurring in nuclear disks and bulges, able to explain star formation quenching, and galaxy evolution through collisions and tides. Multi-wavelength data have revealed in the central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered tilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our goal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical model, reproducing the global features of the observations. We are reporting about integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas with H$\alpha$ and [NII] obtained with SITELLE, the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) at the Canada France Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Using the fully sampled velocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas velocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope, and the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the main disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central kpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with small contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo. The kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this potential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit helps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas components, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are compatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as previously proposed. The kinematical observations correspond to a dynamical re-orientation of the perturbed nuclear disk, through warps and tearing disk into ring, following the collision.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars are mostly found in binary and multiple systems, as at least 50% of all solar-like stars have companions - a fraction that goes up to 100% for the most massive stars. Moreover, a large fraction of them will interact in some way or another over the course of their lives. Such interactions can, and often will, alter the structure and evolution of both components in the system. This will, in turn, lead to the production of exotic objects whose existence cannot be explained by standard single star evolution models, including gravitational wave progenitors, blue stragglers, symbiotic and barium stars, novae, and supernovae. More generally, binary stars prove crucial in many aspects, ranging from cultural ones, to constraining models of stellar evolution, star formation, and even, possibly, of gravity itself. They also provide a quasi-model independent way to determine stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. We here provide a brief summary of the importance of binary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}

 - **Abstract**
 The CMB polarization is the Everest in the quest to characterize the earliest photons from the Universe. After a long list of ever-decreasing upper limits, a detection of polarization was made in 2002 by the DASI team at ell =~ 500. The experiment described in this thesis is designed to make a more detailed measurements at higher angular resolution. The E-mode polarization power spectrum not only provides a more direct link to the properties of the last scattering surface than the temperature anisotropy but also offers complementary information which can be used to break various degeneracies in the determination of cosmological parameters. Most importantly, the existence of polarization is a robust prediction of the standard cosmological picture so a precise measurement of the CMB polarization should come as a confirmation of the standard model. However, polarization measurements represent an experimental challenge. The weakness of the polarization signal requires both a demanding instrumental sensitivity and focused attention to all sources of systematic error. This thesis describes the design, construction, and testing of a 90 GHz four-element array of correlation polarimeters to probe the E-mode polarization power spectrum at multipoles (ell) ranging from 500 to 1500. The array was fielded in Jan 2003 on the 7-meter Crawford Hill antenna, in Holmdel, New Jersey and observed for two months. The receiver calibration is described in detail, as well as the characterization of the pointing and beams. Preliminary analysis indicates that the instrument is sufficiently sensitive to detect the few micro Kelvin signal of the CMB polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of one-loop corrections on long CMB scale modes in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase is under debate. In this work, we investigate the regularization and renormalization of the one-loop corrections of curvature perturbation power spectrum. Employing the UV-IR regularizations and performing the in-in analysis, we calculate the regularized one-loop corrections, including tadpole, in the power spectrum associated with cubic and quartic Hamiltonians. We show that the fully regularized and renormalized fractional loop correction in the power spectrum is controlled by the peak of the power spectrum at the end of USR phase, scaling like $ e^{6 \Delta {\cal N}}$ in which $\Delta {\cal N} $ is the duration of the USR phase. This confirms the original conclusion that the loop corrections can get out of perturbative control if the transition from the intermediate USR phase to the final SR phase is instantaneous and sharp.

 - **Abstract**
 In modern cosmology, the discovery of the Universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ SH0ES Type Ia Supernovae and BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as recently included Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma Ray Bursts data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee model and compare it with the standard LCDM cosmology. Our results indicate that the bumblebee theory provides a compatible fit with current observational data across a range of its parameters, suggesting it as a viable alternative to the LCDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.2^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.

          Potential technosignature from anomalously low deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) in planetary water depleted by nuclear fusion technology

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion is viewed as an ideal energy source for humanity in the far future, given a vast seawater supply of D. Here, we consider long-lived, extraterrestrial, technological societies that develop DD fusion. If such a society persists over geologic timescales, oceanic deuterium would diminish. For an ocean mass and initial D/H that are Earth-like, fusion power use of only $\sim$10 times that projected for humankind next century would deplete the deuterium-hydrogen ratio (D/H) in $\sim$(a few)$\times 10^8$ years to values below that of the local Interstellar Medium (ISM). Ocean masses of a few percent Earth's would reach anomalously low D/H in $\sim10^6$ to $10^7$ years. The timescale shortens with greater energy consumption, smaller oceans, or lower initial D/H. Here, we suggest that anomalous D/H in planetary water below local ISM values of $\sim16\times 10^{-6}$ (set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis plus deuterium loss onto dust or small admixtures of deuterium-poor stellar material) may be a technosignature. Unlike SETI from radio signals, anomalous D/H would persist for eons, even if civilizations perish or relocate. We discuss wavelengths of strong absorption features for detecting D/H anomalies in atmospheric water vapor. These are vibrational O-D stretching at 3.7 $\mu$m in transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like worlds, $\sim1.5$ $\mu$m (in the wings of the 1.4 $\mu$m water band) in the shorter near-infrared for direct imaging by Habitable Worlds Observatory, and 3.7 $\mu$m or $\sim7.5$ $\mu$m (in the wings of the broad 6.3 $\mu$m bending vibration of water) for concepts like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE).

 - **Abstract**
 Hot sub-luminous stars represent a population of stripped and evolved red giants located at the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB). Since they exhibit a wide range of variability due to pulsations or binary interactions, unveiling their intrinsic and extrinsic variability is crucial for understanding the physical processes responsible for their formation. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they overlap with interacting binaries such as Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). By leveraging cutting-edge clustering algorithm tools, we investigate the variability of 1,576 hot subdwarf variable candidates using comprehensive data from Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations. We present a novel approach that utilises the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction algorithms to facilitate the identification and classification of different populations of variable hot subdwarfs and Cataclysmic Variables in a large dataset. In addition to the Gaia time-series statistics table, we adopt extra statistical features that enhance the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results lead to the identification of 85 new hot subdwarf variables based on Gaia and TESS lightcurves and 108 new variables based on Gaia lightcurves alone, including reflection-effect systems, HW Vir, ellipsoidal variables, and high-amplitude pulsating variables. A significant number of known Cataclysmic Variables (140) distinctively cluster in the 2-D feature space among an additional 152 objects that we consider new Cataclysmic Variable candidates. This study paves the way for more efficient and comprehensive analyses of stellar variability from both ground and space-based observations, as well as the application of machine learning classifications of variable candidates in large surveys.
