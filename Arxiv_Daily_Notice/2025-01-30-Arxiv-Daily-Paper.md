 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a design for a drop tower test to evaluate a numerical model for a structurally reconfigurable spacecraft with actuatable joints, referred to as a transformable spacecraft. A mock-up robot for a 3U-sized transformable spacecraft is designed to fit in a limited time and space of the microgravity environment available in the drop tower. The robot performs agile reorientation, referred to as nonholonomic attitude control, by actuating joints in a particular manner. To adapt to the very short duration of microgravity in the drop tower test, a successive joint actuation maneuver is optimized to maximize the amount of attitude reorientation within the time constraint. The robot records the angular velocity history of all four bodies, and the data is analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. We confirm that the constructed numerical model sufficiently replicates the robot's motion and show that the post-experiment model corrections further improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations. Finally, the difference between this drop tower test and the actual orbit demonstration is discussed to show the prospect.

 - **Abstract**
 In this report we summarize the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC) from the 16th IACHEC Workshop at Parador de La Granja, Spain. Sixty-one scientists directly involved in the calibration of operational and future high-energy missions gathered during 3.5 days to discuss the status of the cross-calibration between the current international complement of X-ray observatories, and the possibilities to improve it. This summary consists of reports from the Working Groups with topics ranging across: the identification and characterization of standard calibration sources, multi-observatory cross-calibration campaigns, appropriate and new statistical techniques, calibration of instruments and characterization of background, preservation of knowledge, and results for the benefit of the astronomical community.

          The initial-to-final mass relation of white dwarfs in intermediate-separation binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the applicability of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR) for white dwarfs (WDs) in intermediate-separation binary systems (approximately 1 AU), using astrometric binaries identified in open clusters from Gaia DR3. A careful analysis of the astrometric orbits and spectral energy distributions isolates 33 main-sequence (MS) stars with highly likely WD companions. By combining cluster age estimates, dynamically measured WD masses, and, where available, WD cooling temperatures, we derive progenitor masses for 26 WD candidates. Our analysis suggests the presence of two distinct WD populations: (i) low-mass WDs, likely shaped by binary interactions during the progenitor's red-giant phase; and (ii) "spender" WDs, which experienced higher-than-expected mass loss and have progenitor masses above the IFMR predictions. The rest of the candidates, referred to as the "others", represent systems with inconclusive formation mechanisms. We suggest that at least some of these systems might be hierarchical triples, where the companion to the MS is a double WD or a double-WD merger product. However, follow-up studies are required to determine the nature of each case. These results highlight significant deviations from the IFMR derived for isolated WDs, emphasizing the role of binary evolution. Follow-up observations, particularly in the far-ultraviolet, are crucial for refining these findings and advancing our understanding of mass transfer processes and binary evolution pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a rapid follow-up campaign on the Type IIb Supernova (SN) 2022hnt. We present a daily, multi-band, photometric follow-up using the Las Cumbres Observatory, the Zwicky Transient Facility, the orbiting \textit{Swift} observatory, and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). A distinctive feature in the light curve of SN 2022hnt and other IIb SNe is an early narrow peak prior to the ${}^{56}$Ni peak caused by rapid shock cooling of the hydrogen envelope, which can serve as an important probe of the properties of the massive progenitor star in the moments before explosion. Using SN 2022hnt as a case study, we demonstrate a framework of considerations for the application of shock cooling models to type IIb SNe, outlining a consistent procedure for future surveys of Type IIb SNe progenitor and explosion properties. \hll{We fit several recent models of shock-cooling emission and obtain progenitor radii between $\sim50$ and $\sim100$ $R_\odot$, as well as hydrogen-enriched envelope masses between $\sim0.01$ and $\sim0.1$ $M_\odot$, both consistent with values for other IIb SNe. One of these models is the model of \cite{Morag2023}, marking the first time this model has been applied to a Type IIb SN.} We evaluate contrasting predictions between shock-cooling models to construct a fiducial parameter set which can be used for comparison to other SNe. Finally, we investigate the possibility of extended wind breakout or precursor emission captured in the earliest detections.

          Dynamics of small, constant size particles in a protoplanetary disk with an embedded protoplanet

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disk dynamics are useful tools for understanding the formation of planetary systems, including our own. Approximations are necessary to make these simulations computationally tractable. A common assumption when simulating dust fluids is that of a constant Stokes number, a dimensionless number that characterizes the interaction between a particle and the surrounding gas. Constant Stokes number is not a good approximation in regions of the disk where the gas density changes significantly, such as near a planet-induced gap. In this paper, we relax the assumption of constant Stokes number in the popular FARGO3D code using semi-analytic equations for the drag force on dust particles, which enables an assumption of constant particle size instead. We explore the effect this change has on disk morphology and particle fluxes across the gap for both outward- and inward-drifting particles. The assumption of constant particle size, rather than constant Stokes number, is shown to make a significant difference in some cases, emphasizing the importance of the more accurate treatment.

 - **Abstract**
 Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we analyzed the close binary open clusters CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, which are in close spatial proximity, using photometric and astrometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 catalog. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), resulting in 106 and 146 members for CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, respectively. The mean proper motion components ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta$, $\mu_{\delta}$) were determined to be (0.646$\pm$0.155, -0.769$\pm$0.124) mas yr$^{-1}$ for CWNU 2666, and (0.665$\pm$0.131, -0.728$\pm$0.107) mas yr$^{-1}$ for HSC 224. The isochrone distances ($d_{\rm iso}$) were estimated as 1885$\pm$44 pc for CWNU 2666 and 1866$\pm$29 pc for HSC 224. The corresponding cluster ages ($t$) were derived as 160$\pm$15 Myr and 140$\pm$15 Myr, respectively. The astrometric and fundamental astrophysical parameters derived in this study demonstrate that the two open clusters are a close pair of open clusters.

          A closer look at LTT\,9779b: The ESPRESSO endeavour to pierce the atmospheric veil

 - **Abstract**
 The proliferation of exoplanet discoveries in exotic environments like the Neptune desert challenges our understanding of planetary atmospheres under intense irradiation. The unexpected discovery of LTT9779 b, an ultra-hot Neptune within this desert, offers a prime opportunity for atmospheric studies. We build on prior observations of LTT9779 b from TESS, Spitzer, and CHEOPS, incorporating new VLT/ESPRESSO data to probe its atmospheric dynamics. Preliminary analyses suggest a metal-rich atmosphere and a high day-side geometric albedo, possibly indicating silicate clouds. Minimal atmospheric escape is observed, contrasting existing models of planetary evolution under extreme irradiation. We obtained the transmission spectrum of LTT9779 b between 0.4 and 0.78 microns with ESPRESSO, addressing systematics across three transits. Our analysis focused on the sodium doublet and H-alpha, using cross-correlation with models containing Na, K, FeH, TiO, and VO. No significant atmospheric signal was detected, with metallicity limits set at [Fe/H] >= 2.25 (>= 180 times solar). The non-detection aligns with a high-metallicity, cloud-free model, implying a high mean molecular weight and reduced atmospheric scale height. We interpret this as evidence for a metal-rich atmosphere with suppressed spectral features, possibly due to high-altitude clouds or hazes. These findings are consistent with JWST observations, supporting the hypothesis of metal-rich atmospheres obscured by aerosols in extreme environments.

          The collisionless hydrodynamics: On the nonexistence of collisionless shocks

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless shocks, essential for astrophysics, perhaps do not exist as statistically stationary solutions. If so, any quantitative statement about a collisionless shock should be qualified by the age of the shock. A theoretical description of the upstream of the 1+1 dimensional electrostatic collisionless shock is developed -- collisionless hydrodynamics. Peculiarities of collisionless hydrodynamics prevent a shock formation when a piston is driven into cold plasma. An exact self-similar solution is found instead; the spatial extent of the solution grows linearly in time. Direct numerical simulations of plasma kinetics in 1+1 dimensions confirm the hydrodynamic result -- a statistically steady collisionless shock doesn't exist. Instead, at each fixed time, there is a continuous succession in space of marginally stable velocity distribution functions. The spatial support of this continuous succession grows linearly in time.

          Carving Out the Inner Edge of the Period Ratio Distribution through Giant Impacts

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of orbital period ratios between adjacent observed exoplanets is approximately uniform, but exhibits a strong falloff toward close orbital separations. We show that this falloff can be explained through past dynamical instabilities carving out the period ratio distribution. Our suite of numerical experiments would have required $\sim 3$ million CPU-hours through direct N-body integrations, but was achieved with only $\approx 50$ CPU-hours by removing unstable configurations using the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) machine learning model. This highlights the role of dynamical instabilities in shaping the observed exoplanet population, and shows that the inner part of the period ratio distribution provides a valuable observational anchor on the giant impact phase of planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field surveys have markedly enhanced the discovery and study of solar system objects (SSOs). The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) represents the foremost facility dedicated to optical time-domain surveys in the northern hemisphere. To fully exploit WFST's capabilities for SSO detection, we have developed a heliocentric-orbiting objects processing system (HOPS) tailored for identifying these objects. This system integrates HelioLinC3D, an algorithm well suited for the WFST survey cadence, characterized by revisiting the same sky field twice on the majority of nights. In this paper, we outline the architecture and processing flow of our SSO processing system. The application of the system to the WFST pilot survey data collected between March and May 2024 demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of both temporal efficiency and completeness. A total of 658,489 observations encompassing 38,520 known asteroids have been documented, and 241 newly discovered asteroids have been assigned provisional designations. In particular, 27% of these new discoveries were achieved using merely two observations per night on three nights. The preliminary results not only illuminate the effectiveness of integrating HelioLinC3D within the SSO processing system, but also emphasize the considerable potential contributions of WFST to the field of solar system science.

          Core mass function in view of fractal and turbulent filaments and fibers

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the core mass function (CMF) can be driven by filament fragmentation. To model a star-forming system of filaments and fibers, we develop a fractal and turbulent tree with a fractal dimension of 2 and a Larson's law exponent ($\beta$) of 0.5. The fragmentation driven by convergent flows along the splines of the fractal tree yields a Kroupa-IMF-like CMF that can be divided into three power-law segments with exponents $\alpha$ = $-0.5$, $-1.5$, and $-2$, respectively. The turnover masses of the derived CMF are approximately four times those of the Kroupa IMF, corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 0.25. Adopting $\beta=1/3$, which leads to fractional Brownian motion along the filament, may explain a steeper CMF at the high-mass end, with $\alpha=-3.33$ close to that of the Salpeter IMF. We suggest that the fibers of the tree are basic building blocks of star formation, with similar properties across different clouds, establishing a common density threshold for star formation and leading to a universal CMF.

          The growth of super-large pre-planetary pebbles to an impact erosion limit

 - **Abstract**
 Early dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is dominated by sticking collisions. However, this initial phase of particle growth faces constraints - notably from destructive encounters. To find the maximum particle size achievable, we studied collisional processes during a prolonged microgravity experiment aboard a suborbital flight. Here, we specifically report an impact erosion limit. We observed individual basalt beads, each measuring 0.5 mm in diameter, colliding with and either eroding or adhering to a cluster several centimeters in size. This cluster, formed from tribocharged particles, simulates an electrostatic growth phase that surpasses the classical bouncing barrier. We find a threshold velocity of about 0.5 m/s, distinguishing between additive and erosive impacts of individual beads. Numerical simulations of grain impacts into clusters, testing both low and high charge constituents corroborate the experimental findings of surface erosion within the observed velocity range. This specific velocity threshold suggests the potential formation of pebbles several centimeters in size within protoplanetary disks. Such dimensions place these pebbles well into a regime where hydrodynamic interaction might facilitate the formation of planetesimals.

          The current cratering rate on the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to compute the impact rates for objects with a diameter of 1 km onto the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus using our latest dynamical simulations of the evolution of outer solar system coupled with the best estimates of the current population of objects beyond Neptune and their size-frequency distribution. We use the outcome of the last 3.5~Gyr of evolution of the outer solar system from our database of simulations and combine this with observational constraints of the population beyond Neptune to compute the flux of objects entering the Centaur region, with uncertainties. The initial conditions resemble the current population rather than a near-circular, near-planar disc usually assumed just before the onset of giant planet migration. We obtain a better estimate of the impact probability of a Centaur with the satellites from enacting simulations of planetesimals flying past the satellites on hyperbolic orbits, which agree with literature precedents. We find that our impact rate of objects greater than 1 km in diameter with Jupiter is 0.0012/yr, which is a factor of 3--6 lower than previous estimates of 0.0044/yr from Nesvorny et al. (2023) and 0.0075/yr from Zahnle et al. (2003). On the other hand our impact probabilities with the satellites scaled to the giant planets are consistent with these earlier literature estimates, as is the leakage rate of objects from beyond Neptune into the Centaur region. However, our absolute impact probabilities with the giant planets are lower. We attribute this to our choice of initial conditions.

          Detection of Oscillation-like Patterns in Eclipsing Binary Light Curves using Neural Network-based Object Detection Algorithms

 - **Abstract**
 The primary aim of this research is to evaluate several convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithms for identifying oscillation-like patterns in light curves of eclipsing binaries. This involves creating a robust detection framework that can effectively process both synthetic light curves and real observational data. The study employs several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Single Shot MultiBox Detector, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, You Only Look Once, and EfficientDet besides a custom non-pretrained model implemented from scratch. Synthetic light curve images and images derived from observational TESS light curves of known eclipsing binaries with a pulsating component were constructed with corresponding annotation files using custom scripts. The models were trained and validated on established datasets, followed by testing on unseen {\it{Kepler}} data to assess their generalization performance. The statistical metrics are also calculated to review the quality of each model. The results indicate that the pre-trained models exhibit high accuracy and reliability in detecting the targeted patterns. Faster R-CNN and You Only Look Once, in particular, showed superior performance in terms of object detection evaluation metrics on the validation dataset such as mAP value exceeding 99\%. Single Shot MultiBox Detector, on the other hand, is the fastest although it shows slightly lower performance with a mAP of 97\%. These findings highlight the potential of these models to contribute significantly to the automated determination of pulsating components in eclipsing binary systems, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive astrophysical investigations.

          A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Ultralarge Cosmological N-body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical minihalo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a minihalo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming minihalos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.

          Can circumstellar interaction explain the strange light curve features of Type Ib/c supernovae?

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The evolution and the surrounding of stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are still under debate: some studies suggest single-star, while others prefer massive binary progenitors. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the exploding star and its interaction with circumstellar matter could significantly modify the overall light curve features of these objects. To better understand the effect of stellar evolution and circumstellar interaction, systematic hydrodynamic calculations are needed. Aims. Here, we test the hypothesis that circumstellar matter generated by an extreme episodic $\eta$ Carinae-like eruption that occurs days or weeks before the supernova explosion may explain the controversies related to the general light curve features of stripped-envelope supernovae. Methods. In this work, we present our bolometric light curve calculations of both single- and binary progenitors generated by hydrodynamic simulations via MESA and SNEC. We also studied the effect of an interaction with a close, low-mass circumstellar matter assumed to be created just a few days or weeks before the explosion. Beyond generating a model light curve grid, we compared our results with some observational data. Results. We found that merely the shape of the supernova light curve could indicate that the cataclysmic death of the massive star happened in a binary system or was related to the explosion of a single star. Moreover, our study also shows that a confined dense circumstellar matter may be responsible for the strange light curve features (bumps, re-brightening, or steeper tail) of some Type Ib/c supernovae.

          HI Intensity Mapping with the MIGHTEE Survey: First Results of the HI Power Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum analysis with the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. We use data covering $\sim$ 4 square degrees in the COSMOS field using a frequency range 962.5 MHz to 1008.42 MHz, equivalent to HI emission in $0.4<z<0.48$. The data consists of 15 pointings with a total of 94.2 hours on-source. We verify the suitability of the MIGHTEE data for HI intensity mapping by testing for residual systematics across frequency, baselines and pointings. We also vary the window used for HI signal measurements and find no significant improvement using stringent Fourier mode cuts. Averaging in the power spectrum domain, i.e. using incoherent averaging, we calculate the first upper limits from MIGHTEE on the HI power spectrum at scales $0.5 Mpc^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10 Mpc^{-1}$. We obtain the best 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 28.6 mK$^{2}$Mpc${^3}$ on $k\sim$2 Mpc$^{-1}$. Our results are consistent with the power spectrum detected with observations in the DEEP2 field with MeerKAT. The data we use here constitutes a small fraction of the MIGHTEE survey and demonstrates that combined analysis of the full MIGHTEE survey can potentially detect the HI power spectrum at $z\lesssim0.5$ in the range $0.1 Mpc^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10 Mpc^{-1}$ or quasi-linear scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH) has recently been detected within dense clouds in the interstellar medium. However, it is also likely present within interstellar ices, as well as on the icy surfaces of outer Solar System bodies, where it may react to form more complex prebiotic molecules such as amino acids. In this work, we aimed to provide IR spectra of NH$_2$OH in astrophysical ice analogues that will help in the search for this molecule in various astrophysical environments. Furthermore, we aimed to provide quantitative information on the stability of NH$_2$OH upon exposure to ionizing radiation analogous to cosmic rays, as well as on the ensuing chemistry and potential formation of complex prebiotic molecules. Ices composed of NH$_2$OH, H$_2$O, and CO were prepared by vapor deposition and IR spectra were acquired between $4000-500$~cm$^{-1}$ ($2.5-20 \mu$m) prior and during irradiation using 15 keV protons. In interstellar ice analogues, the most prominent IR absorption band of NH$_2$OH is that at about 1188~cm$^{-1}$, which may be a good candidate to use in searches of this species in icy space environments. Calculated effective destruction cross-sections and G-values for the NH$_2$OH-rich ices studied show that NH$_2$OH is rapidly destroyed upon exposure to ionizing radiation (more rapidly than a number of previously studied organic molecules), and that this destruction is slightly enhanced when it is mixed with other icy species. The irradiation of a NH$_2$OH:H$_2$O:CO ternary ice mixture leads to a rich chemistry that includes the formation of simple inorganic molecules such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and H$_2$O$_2$, as well as ammonium salts and, possibly, complex organic molecules relevant to life such as formamide, formic acid, urea, and glycine.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the numerous molecular systems found in the interstellar medium (ISM), vinyl cyanide is the first identified olephinic nitrile. While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross sections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, a Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\approx$ 5. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols are capable of having a huge influence on reflected, emitted and transmitted planetary spectra. The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) using the PRISM mode on board of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is providing valuable data of transit spectra over a wide spectral range that is able to cover the whole contribution of aerosols, potentially disentangling them from other constituents and thus allowing to constrain their properties. We aim to investigate whether NIRSpec/PRISM JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, in addition to being useful to detect and determine the abundance of gases more accurately than any previous instruments, are also capable of studying the physical properties of the aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. We perform nested sampling Bayesian retrievals with MultiNest library. We use the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the Modelled Optical Properties of enSeMbles of Aerosol Particles (MOPSMAP) database as tools for the forward simulations and NIRSpec/PRISM JWST previously published observations of WASP-39b as input data. Retrievals indicate that models including an aerosol extinction weakly increasing or sharply decreasing with wavelength are decisively better than those with a flat transmission and that this increased degree of complexity is supported by the kind of data that JWST/NIRSpec can provide. Given other physical constraints from previous works, the scenario of weakly increasing particle extinction is favoured. We also find that this also has an effect on the retrieved gas abundances. JWST observations have the potential to study some physical characteristics of exoplanetary clouds, in particular their overall dependence of transmissivity with wavelength. In fact, it is important to implement more detailed aerosol models as their extinction may affect significantly retrieved molecular abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary objectives of the SPHEREx mission is to understand the origin of molecules such as H2O, CO2, and other volatile compounds at the early stages of planetary system formation. Because the vast majority of these compounds -- typically exceeding 95% -- exist in the solid phase rather than the gaseous phase in the systems of concern here, the observing strategy planned to characterize them is slightly unusual. Specifically, SPHEREx will target highly obscured sources throughout the Milky Way, and observe the species of concern in absorption against background illumination. SPHEREx spectrophotometry will yield ice column density measurements for millions of obscured Milky Way sources of all ages and types. By correlating those column densities with source ages, the SPHEREx mission will shed light on whether those molecules were formed in situ along with their nascent stellar systems, or whether instead they formed elsewhereand were introduced into those systems after their formation. To that end, this work describes version 7.1 of the SPHEREx Target List of Ice Sources (SPLICES) for the community. It contains about 8.6 million objects brighter than W2~12 Vega mag over much of the sky, principally within a broad strip running the length of the Milky Way midplane, but also within high-latitude molecular clouds and even the Magellanic Clouds.

          Planetesimal formation in a pressure bump induced by infall

 - **Abstract**
 Infall of interstellar material is a potential non-planetary origin of pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks. While pressure bumps arising from other mechanisms have been numerically demonstrated to promote planet formation, the impact of infall-induced pressure bumps remains unexplored. We aim to investigate the potential for planetesimal formation in an infall-induced pressure bump, starting with sub-micrometer-sized dust grains, and to identify the conditions most conducive to triggering this process. We developed a numerical model that integrates axisymmetric infall, dust drift, and dust coagulation, along with planetesimal formation via streaming instability. Our parameter space includes gas viscosity, dust fragmentation velocity, initial disk mass, characteristic disk radius, infall rate and duration, as well as the location and width of the infall region. An infall-induced pressure bump can trap dust from both the infalling material and the outer disk, promoting dust growth. The locally enhanced dust-to-gas ratio triggers streaming instability, forming a planetesimal belt inside the central infall location until the pressure bump is smoothed out by viscous gas diffusion. Planetesimal formation is favored by a massive, narrow streamer infalling onto a low-viscosity, low-mass, and spatially extended disk containing dust with a high fragmentation velocity. This configuration enhances the outward drift speed of dust on the inner side of the pressure bump, while also ensuring the prolonged persistence of the pressure bump. Planetesimal formation can occur even if the infalling material consists solely of gas. A pressure bump induced by infall is a favorable site for dust growth and planetesimal formation, and this mechanism does not require a preexisting massive planet to create the bump.
