 - **Abstract**
 Context. AM CVn binaries, that is, systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a helium-rich (semi-)degenerate object, are potential progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae and strong sources of persistent gravitational wave radiation. For a long time, it has been believed that these systems cannot descend from cataclysmic variables (CVs), at least not in large numbers, because the initial conditions need to be fine-tuned and, even worse, the resulting surface hydrogen abundance would be high enough to be detected which contradicts a defining feature of AM CVn binaries. Aims. Here we show that both claimed weaknesses of the CV formation channel for AM CVn binaries are model-dependent and rely on poorly constrained assumptions for magnetic braking. Methods. We performed binary evolution simulations with the MESA code for different combinations of post-common-envelope white dwarf and companion masses as well as orbital periods assuming strong magnetic braking. Results. We found that AM CVn binaries with extremely-low surface hydrogen abundances are one natural outcome of CV evolution if the donor star has developed a non-negligible helium core prior to the onset of mass transfer. In this case, after hydrogen envelope exhaustion during CV evolution, the donor becomes degenerate and its surface hydrogen abundance substantially drops and becomes undetectable. Our simulations also show that the CV formation channel is able to explain the observed AM CVn binaries with very low mass and bloated donor stars (Gaia14aae and ZTF J1637+49) which has not been demonstrated for any alternative formation channel. Conclusions. CVs with evolved donors are likely the progenitors of at least a fraction of AM CVn binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic bulge and bar are critical to our understanding of the Milky Way. However, due to the lack of reliable stellar distances, the structure and kinematics of the bulge/bar beyond the Galactic center have remained largely unexplored. Here, we present a method to measure distances of luminous red giants using a period-amplitude-luminosity relation anchored to the Large Magellanic Cloud, with random uncertainties of 10-15% and systematic errors below 1-2%. We apply this method to data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to measure distances to $190,302$ stars in the Galactic bulge and beyond out to 20 kpc. Using this sample we measure a distance to the Galactic center of $R_0$ = $8108\pm106_{\rm stat}\pm93_{\rm sys}$ pc, consistent with astrometric monitoring of stars orbiting Sgr A*. We cross-match our distance catalog with Gaia DR3 and use the subset of $39,566$ overlapping stars to provide the first constraints on the Milky Way's velocity field ($V_R,V_\phi,V_z$) beyond the Galactic center. We show that the $V_R$ quadrupole from the bar's near side is reflected with respect to the Galactic center, indicating that the bar is both bi-symmetric and aligned with the inner disk, and therefore dynamically settled along its full extent. We also find that the vertical height $V_Z$ map has no major structure in the region of the Galactic bulge, which is inconsistent with a current episode of bar buckling. Finally, we demonstrate with N-body simulations that distance uncertainty plays a major factor in the alignment of the major and kinematic axes of the bar and distribution of velocities, necessitating caution when interpreting results for distant stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold Jovian planets play an important role in sculpting the dynamical environment in which inner terrestrial planets form. The core accretion model predicts that giant planets cannot form around low-mass M dwarfs, although this idea has been challenged by recent planet discoveries. Here, we investigate the occurrence rate of giant planets around low-mass (0.1-0.3M$_\odot$) M dwarfs. We monitor a volume-complete, inactive sample of 200 such stars located within 15 parsecs, collecting four high-resolution spectra of each M dwarf over six years and performing intensive follow-up monitoring of two candidate radial-velocity variables. We use TRES on the 1.5 m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and CHIRON on the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5 m telescope for our primary campaign, and MAROON-X on Gemini North for high-precision follow-up. We place a 95%-confidence upper limit of 1.5% (68%-confidence limit of 0.57%) on the occurrence of $M_{\rm P}$sin$i > $1M$_{\rm J}$ giant planets out to the water snow line and provide additional constraints on the giant planet population as a function of $M_{\rm P}$sin$i$ and period. Beyond the snow line ($100$ K $< T_{\rm eq} < 150$ K), we place 95%-confidence upper limits of 1.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4% (68%-confidence limits of 0.58%, 0.66%, and 1.7%) for 3M$_{\rm J} < M_{\rm P}$sin$i < 10$M$_{\rm J}$, 0.8M$_{\rm J} < M_{\rm P}$sin$i < 3$M$_{\rm J}$, and 0.3M$_{\rm J} < M_{\rm P}$sin$i < 0.8$M$_{\rm J}$ giant planets; i.e., Jupiter analogs are rare around low-mass M dwarfs. In contrast, surveys of Sun-like stars have found that their giant planets are most common at these Jupiter-like instellations.
#### Day-night transport induced chemistry and clouds on WASP-39b I:  Gas-phase composition

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has recently detected the first robust photochemical product on an exoplanet: sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) on WASP-39b (Rustamkulov et al. 2023; Alderson et al. 2023; Tsai et al. 2023b). The data from the NIRISS instrument also reveal signs of partial coverage of clouds (Feinstein et al. 2023). Most of the previous studies have focused on interpreting spectral data with 1D models. To explore how the chemical species and cloud particles are altered by global circulation, we applied a 2D photochemical model and a 2D microphysical cloud model separately to post-process the thermal and dynamical structures simulated by a 3D general circulation model (GCM) of WASP-39b. We found that SO$_2$ produced by photochemistry on the dayside can be transported to the nightside owing to the efficient replenishment of horizontal transport. The morning-evening limb differences in methane (CH$_4$) abundances predicted by the 1D models disappeared after horizontal transport is included. Similarly, the inclusion of horizontal transport also reduced the limb differences in SO$_2$. Our modeling results suggest that the fast zonal wind results in minimal or negligible limb asymmetry in composition. Based on the synthetic spectra generated by our 2D atmosphere simulations, we propose that observing SO$_2$ absorption in the emission spectra of WASP-39b at different phases may offer opportunities to probe the horizontal quenching process of photochemical products. We will focus on the gas-phase chemistry in this paper and leave the results regarding clouds in the subsequent paper as part of the series.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet atmospheres are the key to understanding the nature of exoplanets. To this end, transit spectrophotometry provides us opportunities to investigate the physical properties and chemical compositions of exoplanet atmospheres. We aim to detect potential atmospheric signatures in 12 gaseous giant exoplanets using transit spectrophotometry and we try to constrain their atmospheric properties. The targets of interest were observed using transit spectrophotometry with the GTC OSIRIS instrument. We estimated the transit parameters and obtained the optical transmission spectra of the target planets using a Bayesian framework. We analyzed the spectral features in the transmission spectra based on atmospheric retrievals. Most of the observed transmission spectra were found to be featureless, with only the spectrum of CoRoT-1b showing strong evidence for atmospheric features. However, in combination with the previously published near-infrared transmission spectrum, we found multiple interpretations for the atmosphere of CoRoT-1b due to the lack of decisive evidence for alkali metals or optical absorbers. Featureless spectra are not necessarily indicative of cloudy atmospheres if they poorly constrain the altitudes of cloud decks. Precise constraints on the models of hazes and clouds strongly depend on the significance of the observed spectral features. Further investigations on these exoplanets, especially CoRoT-1b, are required to confirm the properties of their atmospheres.
#### Chemo-Dynamical Tagging in the Outskirts: The Origins of Stellar  Substructures in the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed chemical analysis from APOGEE-2S observations of stars in six regions of recently discovered substructures in the outskirts of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) extending to 20 degrees from the Large MC (LMC) center. We also present, for the first time, the metallicity and alpha-abundance radial gradients of the LMC and SMC out to 11 degrees and 6 degrees, respectively. Our chemical tagging includes 13 species including light, alpha, and Fe-peak elements. We find that the abundances of all of these chemical elements in stars populating two regions in the northern periphery - along the northern "stream"-like feature - show good agreement with the chemical patterns of the LMC, and thus likely have an LMC origin. For substructures located in the southern periphery of the LMC, we find more complex chemical and kinematical signatures, indicative of a mix of LMC-like and SMC-like populations. However, the southern region closest to the LMC shows better agreement with the LMC, whereas that closest to the SMC shows a much better agreement with the SMC chemical pattern. When combining this information with 3-D kinematical information for these stars, we conclude that the southern region closest to the LMC has likely an LMC origin, whereas that closest to the SMC has an SMC origin, and the other two southern regions have a mix of LMC and SMC origins. Our results add to the evidence that the southern substructures of the LMC periphery are the product of close interactions between the LMC and SMC, and thus likely hold important clues that can constrain models of their detailed dynamical histories.
#### A high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of aminoacrylonitrile and an  interstellar search towards G+0.693

 - **Abstract**
 Cyanides, ranging from three carbon atoms to PAHs, and alkenyl compounds are abundant in the interstellar medium (ISM). Aminoacrylonitrile (3-Amino-2-propenenitrile, H$_{2}$N-CH=CH-CN), an alkenyl cyanide, thus represents a promising candidate for new interstellar detection. A comprehensive spectroscopic laboratory investigation of aminoacrylonitrile in its rotational ground vibrational state has been herein performed. The measurements carried out up to the THz regime made it possible to generate a precise set of reliable rest frequencies for its search in space up to sub-millimetre wavelengths. The $Z$-aminoacrylonitrile ($Z$-apn) isomer spectrum has been recorded employing a source-modulated sub-millimetre spectrometer, from 80 GHz to 1 THz. A combination of Doppler and sub-Doppler measurement regimes allowed to record 600 new lines. The collected data have enabled the characterisation of a set of spectroscopic parameters up to decic centrifugal distortion constants. The catalogue generated from the improved spectral data has been used for the search of $Z$-apn in the spectral survey of the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud located in the central molecular zone, in the proximity of the Galactic centre.
#### Expulsion of counter Evershed flows from sunspot penumbrae

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to the Evershed flow directed from the umbra towards the outer boundary of the sunspot, under special circumstances, a counter Evershed flow (CEF) in the opposite direction also occurs. We aim to characterize the proper motions and evolution of three CEFs observed by the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Japanese Hinode spacecraft and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We use state-of-the-art inversions of the radiative transfer equation of polarized light applied to spectropolarimetric observations of the Fe I line pair around 630 nm. The three CEFs appeared within the penumbra. Two of the CEF structures, as part of their decay process, were found to move radially outwards through the penumbra parallel to the penumbral filaments with speeds, deduced from their proper motions, ranging between 65 and 117 m/s. In these two cases, a new spot appeared in the moat of the main sunspot after the CEFs reached the outer part of the penumbra. Meanwhile, the CEFs moved away from the umbra, and their magnetic field strengths decreased. The expulsion of these two CEFs seems to be related to the normal Evershed flow. The third CEF appeared to be dragged by the rotation of a satellite spot. Chromospheric brightenings were found to be associated with the CEFs, and those CEFs that reached the umbra-penumbra boundary showed enhanced chromospheric activity. The two CEFs, for which line-of-sight velocity maps were available during their formation phase, appear as intrusions into the penumbra. They may be associated with magnetic flux emergence.
#### AFGL 5180 and AFGL 6366S: sites of hub-filament systems at the opposite  edges of a filamentary cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-scale and multi-wavelength study to unveil massive star formation (MSF) processes around sites AFGL 5180, and AFGL 6366S, both hosting a Class II 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission. The radio continuum map at 8.46 GHz reveals a small cluster of radio sources toward AFGL 5180. Signatures of the early stages of MSF in our target sites are spatially seen at the opposite edges of a filamentary cloud (length $\sim$5 pc), which is observed in the sub-millimeter dust continuum maps. Using the near-infrared photometric data, the spatial distribution of young stellar objects is found toward the entire filament, primarily clustered at its edges. The getsf utility on the Herschel far-infrared images reveals a hub-filament system (HFS) toward each target site. The analysis of the molecular line data, which benefits from large area coverage ($\sim$1 degree $\times$ 1 degree), detects two cloud components with a connection in both position and velocity space. This supports the scenario of a cloud-cloud collision (CCC) that occurred $\sim$1 Myr ago. The filamentary cloud, connecting AFGL 5180 and AFGL 6366S, seems spatially close to an HII region Sh2-247 excited by a massive O9.5 star. Based on the knowledge of various pressures exerted by the massive star on its surroundings, the impact of its energetic feedback on the filamentary cloud is found to be insignificant. Overall, our observational outcomes favor the possibility of the CCC scenario driving MSF and the formation of HFSs toward the target sites.
