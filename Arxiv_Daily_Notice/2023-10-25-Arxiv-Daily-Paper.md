 - **Abstract**
 Prompt $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ density cusps are the densest and most abundant dark matter systems. If the dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), recent studies have shown that prompt cusps dominate the aggregate dark matter annihilation rate. This article explores whether individual prompt cusps could be detected as gamma-ray sources. At the Fermi telescope's point-source sensitivity, WIMPs with the canonical annihilation cross section could form detectable prompt cusps if the particle mass is of order 10 GeV. These objects could be 10-100 pc away and weigh under a solar mass; they would subtend around 0.1 degrees on the sky. For GeV-scale dark matter particles with below-canonical cross sections, searches for individual prompt cusps can be more sensitive than searches for the annihilation signals from galactic dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by efforts to return humanity to the Moon, three cases are reviewed for X-ray astronomy from the lunar surface: (1) Facilitation of ambitious engineering designs including high throughput telescopes, long focal length optics and X-ray interferometery; (2) Occultation studies and the gain they enable in astrometric precision; (3) Multimessenger time-domain coordinated observations. The potential benefits of, and challenges presented by, operating from the Moon are discussed. Some of these cases have relatively low mass budgets and could be conducted as early pathfinders, while others are more ambitious and will likely need to await improvements in technology or well-developed lunar bases.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) were proposed as promising sites for discovering intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), possibly providing crucial insights into the formation and evolution of these elusive objects. The Galactic GC 47 Tucanae (also known as NGC 104) has been suggested as a potential IMBH host, but, previous studies have yielded conflicting results. We, therefore, present self-consistent dynamical models based on distribution functions (DFs) that depend on action integrals to assess the presence (or absence) of an IMBH in 47 Tucanae. Leveraging state-of-the-art Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope data, we analyzed the three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of the cluster's central regions, fitting individual star velocities down to the sub-arcsec scale (approximately $10^{-2}$ pc). According to our analysis, the inner kinematics of 47 Tucanae is incompatible with a central BH more massive than 578 M$_\odot$ (at $3\sigma$). This is the most stringent upper limit on the mass of a putative IMBH in 47 Tucanae that has been put by any dynamical study.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, with TeV--PeV energies, offer unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Their incoming directions and flavor composition -- i.e., the proportion of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos in their flux -- are, individually, rewarding observables. Combined, they offer new opportunities, hitherto unexplored, that we expose for the first time. Anisotropy in the arrival directions of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos may reveal multiple populations of neutrino sources, differently distributed in the sky, and test whether neutrinos of different flavor propagate preferentially along certain directions, such as expected from breaking Lorentz invariance. Using 7.5 years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we make the first measurement of the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, constrain the presence of flavor dipoles and quadrupoles, and improve constraints on "compass asymmetries" introduced by Lorentz invariance violation. In the near future, upcoming neutrino telescopes will improve these measurements across the board.
#### Emergence of the Temperature-Density Relation in the Low Density  Intergalactic Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the evolution of the phase diagram of the low-density intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization in simulation boxes with varying reionization histories from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers project. The PDF of gas temperature at fixed density exhibits two clear modes: a warm and cold temperature mode, corresponding to the gas inside and outside of ionized bubbles. We find that the transition between the two modes is "universal" in the sense that its timing is accurately parameterized by the value of the volume-weighted neutral fraction for any reionization history. This "universality" is more complex than just a reflection of the fact that ionized gas is warm and neutral gas is cold: it holds for the transition at a fixed value of gas density, and gas at different densities transitions from the cold to the warm mode at different values of the neutral fraction, reflecting a non-trivial relationship between the ionization history, the evolving gas density PDF, and the spectrum of ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the "emergence" of the tight temperature-density relation in the warm mode is also approximately "universally" controlled by the volume-weighted neutral fraction for any reionization history. In particular, the "emergence" of the temperature-density relation (as quantified by the rapid decrease in its width) occurs when the neutral fraction is $10^{-4}\lesssim X_\mathrm{HI} \lesssim10^{-3}$ for any reionization history. Our results indicate that the neutral fraction is a primary quantity controlling the various properties of the temperature-density relation, regardless of reionization history.
#### Direct detection and characterization of exoplanets using imaging  Fourier transform spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based direct imaging provides prospects for detection and spectral characterization of exoplanets at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Integral field spectrographs (IFS) have been historically baselined for these mission concepts. However, multiple studies have revealed that detector noise is a serious obstacle for such instruments when observing extremely faint targets such as Earth-like planets. Imaging Fourier transform spectrographs (iFTS) are generally less sensitive to detector noise, and have several other compelling features such as simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy, smaller-format detector requirements, and variable spectral resolution. To date, they have not been studied as options for such missions. In this work, we compare the capabilities of integral field spectrographs and imaging Fourier transform spectrographs to directly obtain spectra from an Earth-like planet using analytic and numerical models. Specifically, we compare the required exposure time to achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio of the two architectures over a range of detector and optical system parameters. We find that for a 6-meter telescope, an IFS outperforms an iFTS at optical wavelengths. In the near-IR, the relative efficiency of an IFS and iFTS depends on the instrument design and detector noise. An iFTS will be more efficient than an IFS if the readout noise of near-IR detector is above 2-3 e-/pix/frame (t_frame=1000s), which correspond to half to one-third of detector noise of the state-of-art. However, if the readout noise is further reduced to below this threshold, the performance of an IFS will experience a substantial improvement and become more efficient. These results motivate consideration of an iFTS as an alternative option for future direct imaging space missions in the near-IR.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and evolution of planetary rings and moons remains an active area of study, particularly as they relate to the impact history and volatile inventory of the outer solar system. The Uranian system contains a complex system of rings that are coplanar with the highly inclined planetary equator relative to the orbital plane. Uranus also harbors five primary regular moons that play an important role in the distribution of material that surrounds the planet. Here we present the results of a dynamical simulation suite for the Uranian system, intended to explore the interaction between the five primary regular moons and particles within the system. We identify regions of extreme mass loss within 40 planetary radii of Uranus, including eccentricity excitation of particle orbits at resonance locations that can promote moonlet formation within the rings. We calculate a total dynamical particle mass loss rate of 35\% within $0.5 \times 10^6$ years, and 40\% mass loss within $10^7$ years. We discuss the implications for post-impact material, including dynamical truncation of stable ring locations, and/or locations of moon formation promoted by dynamical excitation of ring material.
#### Diffuse supernova neutrino background with up-to-date star formation  rate measurements and long-term multi-dimensional supernova simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of current and future neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande (SK), JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande (HK), and DUNE is expected to allow for the detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). However, the DSNB model ingredients like the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) rate, neutrino emission spectra, and the fraction of failed supernovae are not precisely known. We quantify the uncertainty on each of these ingredients by (i) compiling a large database of recent star formation rate density measurements, (ii) combining neutrino emission from long-term axisymmetric CCSNe simulations and strategies for estimating the emission from the protoneutron star cooling phase, and (iii) assuming different models of failed supernovae. Finally, we calculate the fluxes and event rates at multiple experiments and perform a simplified statistical estimate of the time required to significantly detect the DSNB at SK with the gadolinium upgrade and JUNO. Our fiducial model predicts a flux of $5.1\pm0.4^{+0.0+0.5}_{-2.0-2.7}\,{\rm cm^2~s^{-1}}$ at SK employing Gd-tagging, or $3.6\pm0.3^{+0.0+0.8}_{-1.6-1.9}$ events per year, where the errors represent our uncertainty from star formation rate density measurements, uncertainty in neutrino emission, and uncertainty in the failed-supernova scenario. In this fiducial calculation, we could see a $3\sigma$ detection by $\sim2030$ with SK-Gd and a $5\sigma$ detection by $\sim2035$ with a joint SK-Gd/JUNO analysis, but background reduction remains crucial.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous surveys in the far-infrared have found very few, if any, M-dwarf debris discs among their samples. It has been questioned whether M-dwarf discs are simply less common than earlier types, or whether the low detection rate derives from the wavelengths and sensitivities available to those studies. The highly sensitive, long wavelength Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array can shed light on the problem. This paper presents a survey of M-dwarf stars in the young and nearby Beta Pictoris Moving Group with ALMA at Band 7 (880\,$\mu$m). From the observational sample we detect two new sub-mm excesses that likely constitute unresolved debris discs around GJ\,2006\,A and AT\,Mic\,A and model distributions of the disc fractional luminosities and temperatures. From the science sample of 36 M-dwarfs including AU\,Mic we find a disc detection rate of 4/36 or 11.1$^{+7.4}_{-3.3}$\% that rises to 23.1$^{+8.3}_{-5.5}$\% when adjusted for completeness. We conclude that this detection rate is consistent with the detection rate of discs around G and K type stars and that the disc properties are also likely consistent with earlier type stars. We additionally conclude that M-dwarf stars are not less likely to host debris discs, but instead their detection requires longer wavelength and higher sensitivity observations than have previously been employed.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed chemical diversity of Milky Way stars places important constraints on Galactic chemical evolution and the mixing processes that operate within the interstellar medium. Recent works have found that the chemical diversity of disk stars is low. For example, the APOGEE "chemical doppelganger rate," or the rate at which random pairs of field stars appear as chemically similar as stars born together, is high, and the chemical distributions of APOGEE stars in some Galactic populations are well-described by two-dimensional models. However, limited attention has been paid to the heavy elements (Z > 30) in this context. In this work, we probe the potential for neutron-capture elements to enhance the chemical diversity of stars by determining their effect on the chemical doppelganger rate. We measure the doppelganger rate in GALAH DR3, with abundances rederived using The Cannon, and find that considering the neutron-capture elements decreases the doppelganger rate from 2.2% to 0.4%, nearly a factor of 6, for stars with -0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1. While chemical similarity correlates with similarity in age and dynamics, including neutron-capture elements does not appear to select stars that are more similar in these characteristics. Our results highlight that the neutron-capture elements contain information that is distinct from that of the lighter elements and thus add at least one dimension to Milky Way abundance space. This work illustrates the importance of considering the neutron-capture elements when chemically characterizing stars and motivates ongoing work to improve their atomic data and measurements in spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In line with the Astro2020 Decadal Report State of the Profession findings and the NASA core value of Inclusion, the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Bridge Program was created to provide financial and programmatic support to efforts that work to increase the representation and inclusion of students from under-represented minorities in the STEM fields. To ensure an effective program, particularly for those who are often left out of these conversations, the NASA SMD Bridge Program Workshop was developed as a way to gather feedback from a diverse group of people about their unique needs and interests. The Early Career Perspectives Working Group was tasked with examining the current state of bridge programs, academia in general, and its effect on students and early career professionals. The working group, comprised of 10 early career and student members, analyzed the discussions and responses from workshop breakout sessions and two surveys, as well as their own experiences, to develop specific recommendations and metrics for implementing a successful and supportive bridge program. In this white paper, we will discuss the key themes that arose through our work, and highlight select recommendations for the NASA SMD Bridge Program to best support students and early career professionals.

 - **Abstract**
 About 3,500 planetary nebulae (PNe) are currently known in the Milky Way, which shows a great discrepancy with the expected number for these objects, regardless of the reference used, $33-59 \times 10^{3}$. The same holds for symbiotic stars (SySts) as well, since the expected number in the Galaxy ($3-400 \times 10^{3}$) differs considerably from the amount of known ones (approximately 300). Studies on PNe and SySts are of great importance because they provide vital clues to the understanding of the late-stage of stellar evolution for low-to-intermediate mass stars. In addition, these classes of objects play a large role in the chemical evolution of the Galaxy through the ejection of their material to the interstellar medium (ISM), enriching it with the various chemical elements produced throughout their evolution. This project aims to contribute to the detection of new PNe and SySts in the Galaxy, thus decreasing the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical populations. Using simultaneously the third data release from the optical survey VPHAS+ (The VST Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Bulge), which maps the southern hemisphere of the Galaxy's plane with the $r$, $i$, and H{$\alpha$} filters, and the IR colors of the catalog AllWISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer + The Two Micron All Sky Survey), we end up with a number of PN and SySt candidates. Subsequently, we confirm the nature of these objects through spectroscopic observations at the SOAR telescope (Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope). So far, we have selected PN candidates and performed the spectroscopic follow-up of 8 of them. In this presentation we show the project's preliminary results, which consist of the discovery of at least one new planetary nebula, and other emission-line sources still to be confirmed either as PN or SySt.
#### Misaligned precessing jets are choked by the accretion disk wind

 - **Abstract**
 We analytically and numerically study the hydrodynamic propagation of a precessing jet in the context of tidal disruption events (TDEs) where the star's angular momentum is misaligned with the black hole spin. We assume that a geometrically thick accretion disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the black hole spin axis and that the jet is aligned with the instantaneous disk angular momentum. At large spin-orbit misalignment angles, the duty cycle along a given direction that the jet sweeps across is much smaller than unity. The faster jet and slower disk wind alternately fill a given angular region, which leads to strong shock interactions between the two. We show that precessing jets can only break out of the wind confinement if the misalignment angle is less than a few times the jet opening angle. The very small event rate of observed jetted TDEs is then explained by the condition of double alignment: both the stellar angular momentum and the observer's line of sight are nearly aligned with the black hole spin. In most TDEs, the jets are initially choked by the disk wind and may only break out later when the disk eventually aligns itself with the spin axis due to the viscous damping of the precession. Such late-time jets may produce delayed radio rebrightening as seen in many optically selected TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gemini Infrared Multi-Object Spectrograph (GIRMOS) will be a near-infrared, multi-object, medium spectral resolution, integral field spectrograph (IFS) for Gemini North Telescope, designed to operate behind the future Gemini North Adaptive Optics system (GNAO). In addition to a first ground layer Adaptive Optics (AO) correction in closed loop carried out by GNAO, each of the four GIRMOS IFSs will independently perform additional multi-object AO correction in open loop, resulting in an improved image quality that is critical to achieve top level science requirements. We present the baseline parameters and simulated performance of GIRMOS obtained by modeling both the GNAO and GIRMOS AO systems. The image quality requirement for GIRMOS is that 57% of the energy of an unresolved point-spread function ensquared within a 0.1 x 0.1 arcsecond at 2.0 {\mu} m. It was established that GIRMOS will be an order 16 x 16 adaptive optics (AO) system after examining the tradeoffs between performance, risks and costs. The ensquared energy requirement will be met in median atmospheric conditions at Maunakea at 30{\deg} from zenith.
#### Photometric Binaries in 14 Magellanic Cloud Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars play a major role in determining the dynamic evolution of star clusters. We used images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope to study fourteen Magellanic Clouds star clusters that span an age interval between $\sim 0.6$ and $2.1$ Gyr and masses of $10^{4}-10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We estimated the fraction of binary systems composed of two main-sequence stars and the fraction of candidate blue-straggler stars (BSSs). Moreover, we derived the structural parameters of the cluster, including the core radius, the central density, the mass function, and the total mass. We find that the fraction of binaries with a mass ratio larger than 0.7 ranges from $\sim$7%, in NGC1846, to $\sim$20%, in NGC2108. The radial and luminosity distribution can change from one cluster to another. However, when we combine the results from all the clusters, we find that binaries follow a flat radial trend and no significant correlation with the mass of the primary star. We find no evidence for a relation between the fractions of binaries and BSSs. We combined the results on binaries in the studied Magellanic Cloud clusters with those obtained for 67 Galactic globular clusters and 78 open clusters. We detect a significant anti-correlation between the binary fraction in the core and the mass of the host cluster. However, star clusters with similar masses exhibit a wide range of binary fractions. Conversely, there is no evidence of a correlation between the fraction of binaries and either the cluster age or the dynamic age.
#### Immediate Afterglow Physical Characteristics and Broadband Spectra  Evidence Synchrotron self-Compton Emission as the Reason for VHE Production  in TeV GRB 190114C

 - **Abstract**
 Long GRB 190114C, identified on January 14th, 2019, was the first Gamma-ray Burst that substantially violated the defined 10 GeV energy limit of the Synchrotron model, with an observed emission between 0.2 - 1 TeV and a low redshift of z = 0.425. This paper analyzes its immediate afterglow broadband spectrum from 10$^{17}$ to 10$^{26}$ Hz based on observations by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT), Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), and Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescope (MAGIC). We first calculate the physical characteristics necessary to understand the conditions in the burst's emitting region, then conduct temporal and spectral analyses by deriving light curves and spectra using a chain polynomial best-fit in the context of the forward shock model in a homogeneous circumburst density. The Spectral Energy Distributions are found to be double-peaked for T$_0$ + 68-180s, and we show the distribution consists of a distinct Synchrotron component followed by an inverse Compton component explained by high-energy electrons up-scattering Synchrotron photons. We find our calculated Bulk Lorentz Factor = 351 sufficiently explains the peak of the inverse Compton component at sub-TeV energy levels in the immediate afterglow, and that the Comptonization of the burst proceeds in the Klein-Nishina regime. We conclude this further evidences Synchrotron self-Compton emission as the mechanism behind the production of Very-High-Energy photons in GRB 190114C.
#### Orbital evolution of LIGO/Virgo binaries in stellar clusters driven by  cluster tides, stellar encounters and general relativity

 - **Abstract**
 Origin of LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave events may involve production of binaries with relativistic components in dense stellar systems - globular or nuclear star clusters - and their subsequent evolution towards merger. Orbital parameters of these binaries (the inner orbit) and their motion inside the cluster (the outer orbit) evolve due to both external agents - random encounters with cluster stars and cluster tides due to the smooth cluster potential - and the internal ones - various sources of dissipation and precession within the binary. We present a numerical framework - Binary Evolution in Stellar Clusters (BESC) - that follows the evolution of the binary inner and outer orbits accounting for all these effects simultaneously, enabling efficient Monte Carlo studies. The secular effect of cluster tides is computed in the singly-averaged approximation, without averaging over the outer binary orbit. As to stellar encounters, we include the effects of both close and distant flybys on the inner and outer orbits of the binary, respectively. In particular, this allows us to explicitly account for the dynamical friction sinking the binary towards the cluster centre. Also, given our focus on the LIGO/Virgo sources, we include the general relativistic precession (which suppresses cluster tides at high eccentricities) and the gravitational wave emission (shrinking the binary orbit). We use BESC to illustrate a number of characteristic binary evolutionary outcomes and discuss relative contributions of different physical processes. BESC can also be used to study other objects in clusters, e.g. blue stragglers, hot Jupiters, X-ray binaries, etc.
#### Mapping the Galactic disk with the LAMOST and Gaia Red clump sample:  VIII: Mapping the kinematics of the Galactic disk using mono-age and  mono-abundance stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the kinematic properties of the different Galactic disk populations, as defined by the chemical abundance ratios and stellar ages, across a large disk volume (4.5 $\leq$ R $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-Gaia red clump sample stars. We determine the median velocities for various spatial and population bins, finding large-scale bulk motions, such as the wave-like behavior in radial velocity, the north-south discrepancy in azimuthal velocity and the warp signal in vertical velocity, and the amplitudes and spatial-dependences of those bulk motions show significant variations for different mono-age and mono-abundance populations. The global spatial behaviors of the velocity dispersions clearly show a signal of spiral arms and, a signal of the disk perturbation event within 4 Gyr, as well as the disk flaring in the outer region (i.e., $R \ge 12$ kpc) mostly for young or alpha-poor stellar populations. Our detailed measurements of age/[$\alpha$/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations for different disk volumes indicate that young/$\alpha$-poor populations are likely originated from dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while old/$\alpha$-enhanced populations require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms such as merger and accretion, or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an initial-final mass relation derived from the spectroscopically-complete volume-limited 40 pc sample of white dwarfs. The relation is modelled using population synthesis methods to derive an initial stellar population which can be fit to the observed mass distribution of white dwarfs. The population synthesis accounts for binary evolution, where higher-mass white dwarfs are more likely to be merger products than their lower-mass counterparts. Uncertainties are accounted from the initial mass function, stellar metallicity and age of the Galactic disc. We also consider biases induced by the spectral type of the white dwarf where pure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs are likely to have more accurate masses, whilst the full white dwarf sample will have fewer biases arising from spectral evolution. We provide a four-piece segmented linear regression using Monte Carlo methods to sample the 1-$\sigma$ range of uncertainty on the initial stellar population. The derived initial-final mass relation provides a self-consistent determination of the progenitor mass for white dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood which will be useful to study the local stellar formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 While there have been nearly two dozen of spiral arms detected from planet-forming disks in near-infrared scattered light, none of their substellar drivers have been confirmed. By observing spiral systems in at least two epochs spanning multiple years, and measuring the motion of the spirals, we can distinguish the cause of the spirals, and locate the orbits of the driving planets if they trigger the spirals. Upon a recent validation of this approach using the co-motion between a stellar companion and a spiral, we obtained a second epoch observation for the spiral system in the disk of V1247 Ori in the $H$-band polarized scattered light using VLT/SPHERE/IRDIS. Combining our observations with archival IRDIS data, we established a $4.8$ yr timeline to constrain the V1247 Ori spiral motion. We obtained a pattern speed of $0.40^{\circ} \pm 0.09^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the north-east spiral. This corresponds to an orbital period of $900\pm200$ yr, and thus the semi-major axis of the hidden planetary driver is $118\pm19$ au for a 2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 M$_\odot$ central star. The location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust continuum observations, providing joint support for the existence of a companion driving the scattered-light spirals while carving a millimeter gap. With an angular separation of 0.29" $\pm$ 0.05", this hidden companion is an ideal target for JWST imaging.

 The last two decades have brought spectacular advances in astrophysics of cosmic rays (CRs) and space- and ground-based astronomy. Launches of missions that employ forefront detector technologies enabled measurements with large effective areas, wide fields of view, and precision that we recently could not even dream of. Meanwhile, interpretation of the individual slices of information about the internal working of the Milky Way provided by such experiments poses challenges to the traditional astrophysical models. New mysteries arise in the composition and spectra of CR species at low and high energies, in the energy range where we thought the main features were already understood fairly well. This accumulation of unsolved puzzles highlights the peculiarity of the current epoch and means that major breakthroughs are still ahead. In my talk, I review the current state of direct measurements of CRs and discuss their possible interpretations. Unfortunately, many important ideas and publications are not discussed here due to the space limitations.

 - **Abstract**
 Environmental and instrumental conditions can cause anomalies in astronomical images, which can potentially bias all kinds of measurements if not excluded. Detection of the anomalous images is usually done by human eyes, which is slow and sometimes not accurate. This is an important issue in weak lensing studies, particularly in the era of large scale galaxy surveys, in which image qualities are crucial for the success of galaxy shape measurements. In this work we present two automatic methods for detecting anomalous images in astronomical datasets. The anomalous features can be divided into two types: one is associated with the source images, and the other appears on the background. Our first method, called the Entropy Method, utilizes the randomness of the orientation distribution of the source shapes and the background gradients to quantify the likelihood of an exposure being anomalous. Our second method involves training a neural network (autoencoder) to detect anomalies. We evaluate the effectiveness of the Entropy Method on the CFHTLenS and DECaLS DR3 data. In CFHTLenS, with 1171 exposures, the Entropy Method outperforms human inspection by detecting 12 of the 13 anomalous exposures found during human inspection and uncovering 10 new ones. In DECaLS DR3, with 17112 exposures, the Entropy method detects a significant number of anomalous exposures while keeping a low false positive rate. We find that although the neural network performs relatively well in detecting source anomalies, its current performance is not as good as the Entropy Method.

 - **Abstract**
 LHS 1140 b and c are two small temperate exoplanets transiting a nearby M4.5 dwarf. The planetary system was observed with multiple facilities since its discovery in 2017, including MEarth, $Spitzer$, HARPS, ESPRESSO, HST, and TESS, placing strong constraints on the physical parameters of the planets and star. Here, we reanalyse the publicly available ESPRESSO observations of LHS 1140 with the novel line-by-line framework designed to fully exploit the radial velocity content of a stellar spectrum while being resilient to outlier measurements. This analysis reduces radial velocity uncertainties by 60% compared with published values derived from the cross-correlation function method. This improvement, combined with updated stellar parameters, consolidates our knowledge on the mass of LHS 1140 b (5.60$\pm$0.19 M$_{\oplus}$) and LHS 1140 c (1.91$\pm$0.06 M$_{\oplus}$) with unprecedented precision (3%). A joint analysis of transit data obtained with $Spitzer$, HST, and TESS allows us to refine the planetary radius for b (1.730$\pm$0.025 R$_{\oplus}$) and c (1.272$\pm$0.026 R$_{\oplus}$). Stellar abundance measurements of refractory elements (Fe, Mg and Si) obtained with NIRPS are used to constrain the internal structure of LHS 1140 b. This habitable zone planet is unlikely to be a rocky super-Earth, but rather a mini-Neptune with a $\sim$0.1% H/He-rich mass envelope or a water world with a water-mass fraction between 9 and 19% depending on the atmospheric composition and relative abundance of Fe and Mg. Although LHS 1140 c remains consistent with a rocky planet, we detect a 4$\sigma$ discrepancy in the transit depths measured by $Spitzer$ and TESS. Finally, we find no evidence of the candidate LHS 1140 d and attribute this 80-day signal to stellar activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA Large Program toward Oph IRS43, a binary system of solar mass protostars. The 1.3 mm dust continuum observations resolve a compact disk, ~6au radius, around the northern component and show that the disk around the southern component is even smaller, <~3 au. CO, 13CO, and C18O maps reveal a large cavity in a low mass envelope that shows kinematic signatures of rotation and infall extending out to ~ 2000au. An expanding CO bubble centered on the extrapolated location of the source ~130 years ago suggests a recent outburst. Despite the small size of the disks, the overall picture is of a remarkably large and dynamically active region.
#### Constraining exotic dark matter models with the dark ages 21-cm signal

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal from the dark ages is a powerful tool for fundamental cosmology and for probing new physics. While it can be used for precision measurements within standard cosmology, here we study two non-standard models: an excess radio background (ERB) model (possibly generated by dark matter decay) and the millicharged dark matter (mDM) model. These models were inspired by the possible EDGES detection of a strong global 21-cm absorption during cosmic dawn, but more generally they provide a way to anticipate the potential discovery space. We find that during the dark ages the 21-cm global signal in the ERB model reaches a saturated form for an amplitude $A_{\rm r}=0.4$, where $A_{\rm r}$ is the radio background intensity at cosmic dawn relative to the cosmic microwave background. This amplitude is one fifth of the minimum required to explain the EDGES signal, and corresponds to just 0.1\% of the observed extragalactic background; it would give a signal that can be detected at 5.9$\sigma$ significance (compared to 4.1$\sigma$ for the standard signal) and distinguished from the standard (no ERB) signal at 8.5$\sigma$, all with a 1,000 hour global signal measurement. A lower $A_{\rm r}=0.039$ could be distinguished at 5$\sigma$. The 21-cm power spectrum has potentially much more information, but far greater resources would be required for comparable constraints on the ERB signal. For the mDM model, over a range of viable parameters, the global signal detection significance would be $4.7-7.2\,\sigma$, and it could be distinguished from standard at $2.2-9.3\,\sigma$. With an array of global signal antennas achieving an effective 100,000 hr integration, the significance would be 10$\times$ better. Our analysis helps motivate the development of lunar and space-based dark ages experiments.
#### The monopole and quadrupole moments of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)  21-cm bispectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We study the monopole ($\bar{B}^0_0$) and quadrupole ($\bar{B}^0_2$) moments of the 21-cm bispectrum (BS) from EoR simulations and present results for squeezed and stretched triangles. Both $\bar{B}^0_0$ and $\bar{B}^0_2$ are positive at the early stage of EoR where the mean neutral hydrogen (HI) density fraction $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} \approx 0.99$. The subsequent evolution of $\bar{B}^0_0$ and $\bar{B}^0_2$ at large and intermediate scales $(k=0.29$ and $0.56 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively) is punctuated by two sign changes which mark transitions in the HI distribution. The first sign flip where $\bar{B}^0_0$ becomes negative occurs in the intermediate stages of EoR $(\bar{x}_{\rm HI} > 0.5)$, at large scale first followed by the intermediate scale. This marks the emergence of distinct ionized bubbles in the neutral background. $\bar{B}^0_2$ is relatively less affected by this transition, and it mostly remains positive even when $\bar{B}^0_0$ becomes negative. The second sign flip, which affects both $\bar{B}^0_0$ and $\bar{B}^0_2$, occurs at the late stage of EoR $(\bar{x}_{\rm HI} < 0.5)$. This marks a transition in the topology of the HI distribution, after which we have distinct HI islands in an ionized background. This causes $\bar{B}^0_0$ to become positive. The negative $\bar{B}^0_2$ is a definite indication that the HI islands survive only in under-dense regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant mechanism for generating free-floating planets has so far remained elusive. One suggested mechanism is that planets are ejected from planetary systems due to planet-planet interactions. However, instability around a single star requires a very compactly spaced planetary system. We find that around binary star systems instability can occur even with widely separated planets that are on tilted orbits relative to the binary orbit due to combined effects of planet-binary and planet-planet interactions, especially if the binary is on an eccentric orbit. We investigate the orbital stability of planetary systems with various planet masses and architectures. We find that the stability of the system depends upon the mass of the highest mass planet. The order of the planets in the system does not significantly affect stability but, generally, the most massive planet remains stable and the lower mass planets are ejected. The minimum planet mass required to trigger the instability is about that of Neptune for a circular orbit binary and a super-Earth of about $10$ Earth masses for highly eccentric binaries. Hence, we suggest that planet formation around misaligned binaries can be an efficient formation mechanism for free-floating planets. While most observed free-floating planets are giant planets, we predict that there should be more low-mass free floating planets that are as yet unobserved than higher mass planets.

 - **Abstract**
 A kilonova is a short-lived explosive event in the universe, resulting from the merger of two compact objects. Despite its importance as a primary source of heavy elements through r-process nucleosynthesis, its nature is not well understood, due to its rarity. In this work, we introduce a model that determines the density of a radially-stratified relativistic ejecta. We apply the model to kilonova ejecta and explore several hypothesized velocity profiles as a function of the merger's ejection time. These velocity profiles result in diverse density profiles of the ejecta, for which we conduct radiative transfer simulations using TARDIS with the solar r-process composition. Consequently, we investigate the impact of the ejecta velocity profile on the resulting lightcurve and spectral evolution through the line transitions of heavy elements. The change in the rate at which these elements accumulate in the line-forming region leaves its imprint on the kilonova lightcurve at specific wavelengths, causing the lightcurves to decay at different rates. Furthermore, in several profiles, plateau-like behaviors (slow and/or flat decline) are also observed. In conclusion, this work proposes potential scenarios of the kilonova evolution due to the ejecta velocity profile.

 - **Abstract**
 The construction of exact solutions for radiative transfer in a plane-parallel medium has been addressed by Hemsch and Ferziger in 1972 for a partial frequency redistribution model of the formation of spectral lines consisting in a linear combination of frequency coherent and fully incoherent scattering. The method of solution is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the radiation field, leading to two singular integral equations with a Cauchy-type kernel, that have to be solved one after the other. We reconsider this problem, using as starting point the integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation, where the terms involving the coupling between the two scattering mechanisms are clearly displayed, as well as the primary source of photons. With an inverse Laplace transform, we recover the singular integral equations previously established and, with Hilbert transforms as in the previous work, recast them as boundary value problems in the complex plane. Their solutions are presented in detail for an infinite and a semi-infinite medium. The coupling terms are carefully analyzed and consistency with either the coherent or the incoherent limit is systematically checked. We recover the important results of the previous work that an exact solution exists for an infinite medium, whereas for a semi-infinite medium, which requires the introduction of half-space auxiliary functions, the solution is given by a Fredholm integral equation to be solved numerically. The solutions of the singular integral equations are used to construct explicit expressions of the radiation field inside the medium and, for a semi-infinite medium, also those of the emerging field.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binary systems hold a central position within astrophysics in that the fundamental parameters of stars can be determined by direct observations. The simultaneous analyses of high-quality space observations, combined with ground-based photometric data, have allowed more sensitive detection of fundamental stellar parameters by multicolor photometry. In the paper, the fundamental parameters of the component stars for the V1175 Cas binary system were sensitively obtained by a simultaneous analysis of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve, and new CCD observations in {\it BVRI} filters obtained with a 60 cm robotic telescope at the TUBITAK National Observatory. Following the analysis, the masses and radii of the primary and secondary binary components were determined as $M_{1}= 1.64\pm 0.04\,M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 1.63\pm0.07\,M_\odot$, and $R_{1}=1.77\pm 0.05\,R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 1.77\pm 0.25\,R_\odot$, respectively. Moreover, the distance of V1175 Cas was computed as $280\pm32$ pc. The photometric analysis reveals that the components of the system are in a similar evolutionary state. The primary and secondary components exhibit nearly the same masses, while their radii are perfectly matched. Additionally, the ages of the components are also consistent within the statistical uncertainties. Consequently, the system's overall age is assessed to be approximately $750\pm70$ Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CR) is still a matter of debate. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) applied to supernova remnant (SNR) shocks provides the most reliable explanation. However, within the current understanding of DSA several issues remain unsolved, like the CR maximum energy, the chemical composition and the transition region between Galactic and extra-Galactic CRs. These issues motivate the search for other possible Galactic sources. Recently, several young stellar clusters (YSC) have been detected in gamma rays, suggesting that such objects could be powerful sources of Galactic CRs. The energy input could come from winds of massive stars hosted in the clusters which is a function of the cluster total mass and initial mass function of stars. In this work we evaluate the total CR flux produced by a synthetic population of YSCs assuming that the CR acceleration occurs at the termination shock of the collective wind resulting from the sum of cluster's stellar winds. We show that the spectrum produced by YSC can significantly contribute to energies $\gtrsim 100$ TeV if the diffusion inside the wind-blown bubble is Bohm-like and the spectral slope is harder than the one produced by SNRs.
#### Simple numerical X-ray polarization models of reflecting axially  symmetric structures around accreting compact objects

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15647
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15647
 - **Abstract**
 We present a series of numerical models suitable for X-ray polarimetry of accreting systems. Firstly, we provide a spectropolarimetric routine that integrates reflection from inner optically thick walls of a geometrical torus of arbitrary size viewed under general inclination. In the studied example, the equatorial torus surrounding an accreting compact object is illuminated by a central isotropic source of X-ray power-law emission, representing a hot corona. Nearly neutral reprocessing inside the walls is precomputed by Monte Carlo code STOKES that incorporates both line and continuum processes, including multiple scatterings and absorption. Applying a conversion script to the torus reflection output, we created tabular dependencies for a new XSPEC model, called xsstokes. In this version, xsstokes enables efficient X-ray polarimetric fitting of the torus parameters, observer's inclination and primary emission properties, interpolating for arbitrary state of primary polarization. We provide comparisons of the results to a more sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation. Since the polarization interpolation routine works for any axially symmetric reflecting structure, we provide another version of xsstokes that is suitable for approximating nearly neutral reflection from a distant optically thick disc of small geometrical thickness. The second version uses the same precomputed Monte Carlo reprocessing, but assumes local illumination averaged for a range of high incident angles, representing a toy model of a diffuse, vertically extended hot inner accretion flow. Assessing both model variants, we conclude that the resulting polarization can be tens of % and perpendicularly/parallelly oriented towards the axis, if the reflecting medium is rather vertically/equatorially distributed.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are sources of powerful gravitational waves (GWs). We assess the possibility of extracting information about the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter from the GW signal. We use the bounce and early post-bounce signals of rapidly rotating supernovae. A large set of GW signals is generated using general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for various EOS models. The uncertainty in the electron capture rate is parametrized by generating signals for six different models. To classify EOSs based on the GW data, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Even with the uncertainty in the electron capture rates, we find that the CNN models can classify the EOSs with an average accuracy of about 87 percent for a set of four distinct EOS models.

 - **Abstract**
 The early steep decay, a rapid decrease in X-ray flux as a function of time following the prompt emission, is a robust feature seen in almost all gamma-ray bursts with early enough X-ray observations. This peculiar phenomenon has often been explained as emission from high latitudes of the last flashing shell. However, in photospheric models of gamma-ray bursts, the timescale of high-latitude emission is generally short compared to the duration of the steep decay phase, and hence an alternative explanation is needed. In this paper, we show that the early steep decay can directly result from the final activity of the dying central engine. We find that the corresponding photospheric emission can reproduce both the temporal and spectral evolution observed. This requires a late-time behaviour that should be common to all GRB central engines, and we estimate the necessary evolution of the kinetic power and the Lorentz factor. If this interpretation is correct, observation of the early steep decay can grant us insights into the last stages of central activity, and provide new constraints on the late evolution of the Lorentz factor and photospheric radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) includes extensive information on the astrophysical properties of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and luminosity, for over 470 million objects. However, as Gaia's stellar parameters in GSP-Phot module are derived through model-dependent methods and indirect measurements, it can lead to additional systematic errors in the derived parameters. Here we compare GSP-Phot effective temperature estimates with two high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic catalogues, specifically, APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3 to assess Gaia's temperatures reliability. We develop an approach to distinguish good-quality Gaia DR3 effective temperatures using machine-learning methods such as XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM. The models create quality flags, which can help one to distinguish good-quality GSP-Phot effective temperatures. We test our models on three independent datasets, including PASTEL, a compilation of spectroscopically derived stellar parameters from different high-resolution studies. The results of the test suggest that with these models it is possible to filter effective temperatures as accurate as 250~K with $\sim 90$ per cent precision even in complex regions, such as the Galactic plane. Consequently, the models developed herein offer a valuable quality assessment tool for GSP-Phot effective temperatures in Gaia DR3. The dataset with flags for all GSP-Phot effective temperature estimates is publicly available as well as the models themselves.

 During the public Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", thousands of reconstruction algorithms were created and submitted, aiming to estimate the direction of neutrino events recorded by the IceCube detector. Here we describe in detail the three ultimate best, award-winning solutions. The data handling, architecture, and training process of each of these machine learning models is laid out, followed up by an in-depth comparison of the performance on the kaggle datatset. We show that on cascade events in IceCube above 10 TeV, the best kaggle solution is able to achieve an angular resolution of better than 5 degrees, and for tracks correspondingly better than 0.5 degrees. These performance measures compare favourably to the current state-of-the-art in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly multiplexed spectroscopic surveys have changed the astronomy landscape in recent years. However, these surveys are limited to low and medium spectral resolution. High spectral resolution spectroscopy is often photon starved and will benefit from a large telescope aperture. Multiplexed high-resolution surveys require a wide field of view and a large aperture for a suitable large number of bright targets. This requirement introduces several practical difficulties, especially for large telescopes, such as the future ELTs. Some of the challenges are the need for a wide field atmospheric dispersion corrector and to deal with the curved non-telecentric focal plane. Here, we present a concept of Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode for TMT High-Resolution Optical Spectrograph (HROS), we have designed an atmospheric dispersion corrector for individual objects that fit inside a fiber positioner. We present the ZEMAX design and the performance of the atmospheric dispersion corrector for all elevations accessible by TMT.

 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence aims to find evidence of technosignatures, which can point toward the possible existence of technologically advanced extraterrestrial life. Radio signals similar to those engineered on Earth may be transmitted by other civilizations, motivating technosignature searches across the entire radio spectrum. In this endeavor, the low-frequency radio band has remained largely unexplored; with prior radio searches primarily above 1 GHz. In this survey at 110-190 MHz, observations of 1,631,198 targets from TESS and Gaia are reported. Observations took place simultaneously with two international stations (noninterferometric) of the Low Frequency Array in Ireland and Sweden. We can reject the presence of any Doppler drifting narrowband transmissions in the barycentric frame of reference, with equivalent isotropic radiated power of 10 17 W, for 0.4 million (or 1.3 million) stellar systems at 110 (or 190) MHz. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of using multisite simultaneous observations for rejecting anthropogenic signals in the search for technosignatures.

 IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15-52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m and Qa 18.30 $\mu$m, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code CLOUDY with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of SN ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly-formed SN dust.

 SAXO+ is a proposed upgrade to SAXO, the AO system of the SPHERE instrument on the ESO Very Large Telescope. It will improve the capabilities of the instrument for the detection and characterization of young giant planets. It includes a second stage adaptive optics system composed of a dedicated near-infrared wavefront sensor and a deformable mirror. This second stage will remove the residual wavefront errors left by the current primary AO loop (SAXO). This paper focuses on the numerical simulations of the second stage (SAXO+) and concludes on the impact of the main AO parameters used to build the design strategy. Using an end-to-end AO simulation tool (COMPASS), we investigate the impact of several parameters on the performance of the AO system. We measure the performance in minimizing the star residuals in the coronagraphic image. The parameters that we study are : the second stage frequency, the photon flux on each WFS, the first stage gain and the DM number of actuators of the second stage. We show that the performance is improved by a factor 10 with respect to the current AO system (SAXO). The optimal second stage frequency is between 1 and 2 kHz under good observing conditions. In a red star case, the best SAXO+ performance is achieved with a low first stage gain of 0.05, which reduces the first stage rejection.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar convection is visible as a net blueshift of absorption lines, which becomes apparent when observing quiet Sun granulation. This blueshift exhibits variations from the disc centre to the solar limb due to differing projection angles onto the solar atmosphere. Our goal is to investigate convective Doppler velocities based on observations from the disc centre to the solar limb. Consequently, we aim to improve our understanding of atmospheric hydrodynamics and contribute to the improvement of solar and stellar atmospheric models. We used resolved quiet-Sun spectra to investigate the convective velocity shifts of more than 1000\,\ion{Fe}{I} lines across multiple centre-to-limb positions on the solar disc. We determined the Doppler velocities with respect to the line depth. Additionally, we calculated the formation temperature and investigated its correlation with Doppler velocities. The general behaviour of convective line shifts shows a decreasing blueshift as the lines become deeper for all observing positions from the centre to limb. For spectra obtained at the solar limb, even deeper lines exhibit redshifts. We observe a velocity trend for the different observation angles, with a less pronounced convective blueshift towards the solar limb. Convective velocities show a wavelength dependence for each observing angle when analysing on the basis of line depths. We observe a decreasing convective blueshift as the formation temperatures of the lines decrease. The velocity change over temperature ranges proceeds slower towards the solar limb. When investigating Doppler velocities with respect to formation temperature, the disc centre does not exhibit the strongest blueshift.

 - **Abstract**
 I examine the morphologies of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Milky Way Galaxy and conclude that violent binary interaction processes eject the main nebulae of the brightest PNe. The typical morphologies of the brightest PNe are multipolar, namely have been shaped by two or more major jet-launching episodes at varying directions, and possess small to medium departures from pure point-symmetry. The departure from pure point-symmetry is generally not large. This suggests that triple-star interaction is not behind the mass ejection process, but rather a violent binary interaction. By violent interaction I refer to two or more energetic jet-launching episodes within a relatively short time (much shorter than the PN formation time). In particular, I suggest that the timescales of some interactions are shorter than the dynamical timescale of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitor. I discuss some possibilities, including a rapid onset of the common envelope evolution (CEE) and the merger of the companion with the AGB core at the termination of the CEE. I suggest that the most likely companions to experience such interactions are white dwarfs (WDs). Some of these might actually be progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as I suggest for SNR G1.9+0.3, the youngest SN Ia in the Galaxy. I speculate here on a positive correlation (but not one-to-one correspondence) between the brightest PNe and cases of CEE that end with WD-core merger, including progenitors of some SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus-X is considered a region of interest for high-energy astrophysics, since the Cygnus OB2 association has been confirmed as a PeVatron in the Cygnus cocoon. In this research note, we present new high-resolution (16'') $^{12,13}$CO(J=1$\rightarrow$0) and C$^{18}$O (J=1$\rightarrow$0) observations obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m radiotelescope, to complement the Nobeyama Cygnus-X Survey. We discovered 19 new C$^{18}$O clumps associated with the star-forming regions DR-6W, DR-9, and DR13S. We present the physical parameters of these clumps, which are consistent with the neighboring covered regions. We confirm the clumpy nature of these regions and of a filament located between DR6 and DR6W. These results strongly suggest that star formation occurs in these regions with clumps of sizes $\sim$10$^{-1}$ pc, masses $\sim$10$^2$ M$_\odot$, and H$_2$ densities of $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival {\it Fermi}-LAT data with a time span of $\sim12$ years, we study the population of Millisecond Pulsars (MSPs) in Globular Clusters (GlCs) and investigate their dependence on cluster dynamical evolution in the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that the $\gamma$-ray luminosity ($L_{\gamma}$) and emissivity ($\epsilon_{\gamma}=L_{\gamma}/M$) are good indicators of the population and abundance of MSPs in GlCs, and they are highly dependent on the dynamical evolution history of the host clusters. Specifically speaking, the dynamically older GlCs with more compact structures are more likely to have larger $L_{\gamma}$ and $\epsilon_{\gamma}$, and these trends can be summarized as strong correlations with cluster stellar encounter rate $\Gamma$ and the specific encounter rate ($\Lambda=\Gamma/M$), with $L_{\gamma}\propto \Gamma^{0.70\pm0.11}$ and $\epsilon_{\gamma}\propto \Lambda^{0.73\pm0.13}$ for dynamically normal GlCs. However, as GlCs evolve into deep core collapse, these trends are found to be reversed, implying that strong encounters may have lead to the ejection of MSPs from core-collapsed Systems. Besides, the GlCs are found to exhibit larger $\epsilon_{\gamma}$ with increasing stellar mass function slope, decreasing tidal radius and distances from the Galactic Center (GC). These correlations indicate that, as GlCs losing kinetic energy and spiral in towards GC, tidal stripping and mass segregation have a preference in leading to the loss of normal stars from GlCs, while MSPs are more likely to concentrate to cluster center and be deposited into the GC. Moreover, we gauge $\epsilon_{\gamma}$ of GlCs is $\sim10-1000$ times larger than the Galactic bulge, the latter is thought to reside thousands of unresolved MSPs and may responsible for the GC $\gamma$-ray excess, which support that GlCs are generous contributors to the population of MSPs in the GC.

 - **Abstract**
 The lower energy thresholds of large wide-field gamma-ray observatories are often determined by their capability to deal with the very low-energy cosmic ray background. In fact, in observatories with areas of tens or hundreds of thousands of square meters, the number of background events generated by the superposition of random, very low energy cosmic rays is huge and may exceed by far the possible signal events. In this article, we argue that a trigger strategy based on pattern recognition of the shower front can significantly reject the background, keeping a good efficiency and a good angular accuracy (few square degrees) for gamma rays with energies as low as tens of GeV. In this way, alerts can be followed or emitted within time lapses of the order of the second, enabling wide-field gamma-ray observatories to better contribute to global multi-messenger networks of astrophysical observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen deficient stars include the cool R CrB variable (RCBs) and hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdCs) giants through extreme helium stars (EHes) to the very hot helium-rich subdwarfs (He-sdO and O(He) stars) and white dwarfs. With surfaces rich in helium, nitrogen and carbon, their origins have been identified with the merger of two white dwarfs. Using Gaia to focus on the EHes, we aim to identify progenitor populations and test the evolution models. Gaia DR3 measurements and ground-based radial velocities have been used to compute Galactic orbits using galpy. Each orbit has been classified by population; EHe stars are found in all of the thin disk, thick disk, halo and bulge, as are RCB, HdC and He-sdO stars. Spectral energy distributions were constructed for all EHes, to provide angular diameters, and hence radii and luminosities. The EHes fall into two luminosity groups divided at L ~ 2500 solar L. This supports theory for the origin of EHes, and is the strongest confirmation so far in terms of luminosity. The lower luminosity EHes correspond well with the post-merger evolution of a double helium white dwarf binary. Likewise, the higher luminosity EHes match the post-merger evolution of a carbon/oxygen plus helium white dwarf binary. In terms of parent populations, current models predict that double white dwarf mergers should occur in all Galactic populations, but favour mergers arising from recent star formation (i.e. thin disk), whereas the statistics favour an older epoch (i.e. thick disk).

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether the dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation (3G) GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on the three-year observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$ in the four IDE models, but perform not well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta$ with the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of CMB and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of $\beta$ being 0.00068-0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equation of states (EoSs) of NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of NS's EoS in cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of NS.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-cool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived, and uniquely suited to enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial companions with JWST. Amongst them, the most prominent is the M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets, which have been the favored targets of eight JWST Cycle 1 programs. While Cycle 1 observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the planets, they have also revealed that their atmospheric exploration requires a better understanding of their host star. Here, we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system -- and others like it -- in an efficient and robust manner. We notably recommend that -- although more challenging to schedule -- multi-transit windows be prioritized to constrain stellar heterogeneities and gather up to 2$\times$ more transits per JWST hour spent. We conclude that in such systems planets cannot be studied in isolation by small programs, thus large-scale community-supported programs should be supported to enable the efficient and robust exploration of terrestrial exoplanets in the JWST era.
#### Stellar surface information from the Ca II H&K lines I. Intensity  profiles of the solar activity components

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of Earth-like planets with the radial-velocity method is currently limited by the presence of stellar activity signatures. On rotational timescales, spots and plages (or faculae) are known to introduce different RV signals, but their corrections require better activity proxies. The best-known chromospheric activity proxies in the visible are the Ca II H & K lines, but the physical quantities measured by their profiles need to be clarified. We first investigate resolved images of the Sun in order to better understand the spectrum of plages, spots, and the network using the Meudon spectroheliogram. We show that distinct line profiles are produced by plages, spots, and by the network component and we also derived the center-to-limb variations of the three profiles. Some care is required to disentangle their contributions due to their similarities. By combining disk-integrated spectra from the ISS high-resolution spectrograph with SDO direct images of the Sun, we managed to extract a high-resolution emission spectrum of the different components, which tend to confirm the spectra extracted from the Meudon spectroheliogram datacubes. Similar results were obtained with the HARPS-N Sun-as-a-star spectra. We concluded using a three-component model that the temporal variation of the popular S-index contains, on average for the 24th solar cycle: 70 +/- 12% of plage, 26 +/- 12% of network and 4 +/- 4% of spots. This preliminary investigation suggests that a detailed study of the Ca II H & K profiles may provide rich information about the filling factor and distribution of different types of active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The long gamma-ray burst GRB 191221B has abundant observations in X-ray, optical and radio bands. In the literature, the observed optical light curve of GRB 191221B displays a plateau around 0.1-day, which is rather peculiar in gamma-ray bursts. Here we performed detailed analysis of the observational data from Swift/UVOT, VLT and LCO, obtained the light curve of the multi-band afterglow of GRB 191221B. By examining optical, ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio data for this event, we demonstrate that an on-axis two-component jet model can explain the observations. Our analysis suggests that the narrow component has an initial Lorentz factor of 400 and a jet opening half-angle of $1.4^{\circ}$, while the wide component has an initial Lorentz factor of 25 and a jet opening half-angle of $2.8^{\circ}$. The narrow jet dominates the early decay, whereas the wider jet causes the optical plateau and dominates late decay. According to this model, the reason for the absence of the X-ray plateau is due to the steeper spectral index of the wide component, resulting in a less significant flux contribution from the wide jet in the X-ray bands than in the optical bands. Moreover, we have explained the inconsistency in the decay indices of the UVOT and Rc-band data around 2000 seconds using reverse shock emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the propagation of light signals across multiple gravitational lenses. The lenses are assumed to be non-coplanar, far enough from one another for each lens to be treated independently as thin lenses in the limit of weak gravity. We analyze these scenarios using several different tools, including geometric optics, photon mapping, wave optics and ray tracing. Specifically, we use these tools to assess light amplification and image formation by a two-lens system. We then extend the ray tracing analysis to the case of multiple non-coplanar lenses, demonstrating the complexity of images that are projected even by relatively simple lens configurations. We introduce a simple simulation tool that can be used to analyze lensing by non-coplanar gravitational monopoles in the weak gravity limit, treating them as thin lenses.
#### Using CHIRON Spectroscopy to Test the Hypothesis of a Precessing Orbit  for the WN4 star EZ CMa

 - **Abstract**
 The bright WN4 star EZ CMa exhibits a 3.77 day periodicity in photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry but the variations in the measurements are not strictly phase-locked, exhibiting changes in reference times, amplitudes, and the shape of the variability happening over times as short as a few weeks. Recently, 137 days of contiguous, variable photometry from BRITE-Constellation was interpreted as caused either by large-scale dense wind structures modulated by rotation, or by a fast-precessing binary having a slightly shorter 3.626 day orbital period and a fast apsidal motion rate of $1315^\circ\,\text{yr}^{-1}$. We aim at testing the latter hypothesis through analysis of spectroscopy and focus on the N\,{\sc v} $\lambda\,4945$ line. We derive an orbital solution for the system and reject the 3.626 day period to represent the variations in the radial velocities of EZ CMa. An orbital solution with an orbital period of 3.77 days was obtained but at the cost of an extremely high and thus improbable apsidal motion rate. Our best orbital solution yields a period of $3.751\pm0.001$\,days with no apsidal motion. We place our results in the context of other variability studies and system properties. While we cannot fully reject the precessing binary model, we find that the corotating interaction region (CIR) hypothesis is better supported by these and other data through qualitative models of CIRs.
#### A New 2D Energy Balance Model For Simulating the Climates of Rapidly-  and Slowly-Rotating Terrestrial Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Energy balance models (EBMs), alongside radiative-convective climate models (RCMs) and global climate models (GCMs), are useful tools for simulating planetary climates. Historically, planetary and exoplanetary EBMs have solely been 1D latitudinally-dependent models with no longitudinal dependence, until the study of Okuya et al., which focused on simulating synchronously-rotating planets. Following the work of Okuya et al., I have designed the first 2D EBM (PlaHab) that can simulate N2-CO2-H2O-H2 atmospheres of both rapidly-rotating and synchronously-rotating planets, including Mars, Earth, and exoplanets located within their circumstellar habitable zones. PlaHab includes physics for both water and CO2 condensation. Regional topography can be incorporated. Here, I have specifically applied PlaHab to investigate present Earth, early Mars, TRAPPIST-1e and Proxima Centauri b, representing examples of habitable (and potentially habitable) worlds in our solar system and beyond. I compare my EBM results against those of other 1D and 3D models, including those of the recent Trappist-1 Habitable Atmosphere (THAI) comparison project. Overall, EBM results are consistent with those of other 1D and 3D models although inconsistencies among all models continue to be related to the treatment of clouds and other known differences between EBMs and GCMs, including heat transport parameterizations. Although two-dimensional EBMs are a relatively new entry in the study of planetary/exoplanetary climates, their ease-of-use, speed, flexibility, wide applicability, and greater complexity (relative to 1D models), may indicate an ideal combination for the modeling of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres alike.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate outflows and the physics of super-Eddington versus sub-Eddington regimes in black hole systems. Our focus is on prospective science using next-generation high-resolution soft X-ray instruments. We highlight the properties of black hole ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) systems in particular. Owing to scale invariance in accreting black holes, ULX accretion properties including their outflows, inform our understanding not only of the closely-related population of (similar-mass) X-ray binary systems, but also of tidal disruption events (TDEs) around supermassive black holes. A subsample of TDEs are likely to transcend super-Eddington to sub-Eddington regimes as they evolve, offering an important unifying analog to ULXs and sub-Eddington X-ray binaries. We demonstrate how next-generation soft X-ray observations with resolving power > 1000 and collecting area > 1000 cm^2 can simultaneously identify ultrafast and more typical wind components, distinguish between different wind mechanisms, and constrain changing wind properties over characteristic variability timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are highly energetic events that happen in the solar atmosphere. They are mostly observed as X-ray or gamma-ray bursts located on the Sun's surface. While they are known to be sites of particle acceleration, the acceleration process(es) responsible for the observed fluxes remain unsure. The diversity in shape and duration of the gamma-ray fluxes suggests the existence of distinct phases of hadronic acceleration. Moreover, different acceleration processes could explain the differences observed among flares. In this work we search for the evidence of sub-populations within the catalog of gamma-ray solar flares observed by Fermi-LAT. We aim at grouping flares with similar physical properties to be able to probe theoretical models for neutrino production within different classes of flares. We use measurements of the X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes, as well as CMEs and SEPs, to cluster the events using a graph-based algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the most representative features that characterise the identified sub-populations to allow for qualitative analysis and model development.

 - **Abstract**
 The Line Emission Mapper (LEM) is an X-ray Probe with with spectral resolution ~2 eV FWHM from 0.2 to 2.5 keV and effective area >2,500 cm$^2$ at 1 keV, covering a 33 arcmin diameter Field of View with 15 arcsec angular resolution, capable of performing efficient scanning observations of very large sky areas and enabling the first high spectral resolution survey of the full sky. The LEM-All-Sky Survey (LASS) is expected to follow the success of previous all sky surveys such as ROSAT and eROSITA, adding a third dimension provided by the high resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer, with each 15 arcsec pixel of the survey including a full 1-2 eV resolution energy spectrum that can be integrated over any area of the sky to provide statistical accuracy. Like its predecessors, LASS will provide both a long-lasting legacy and open the door to the unknown, enabling new discoveries and delivering the baseline for unique GO studies. No other current or planned mission has the combination of microcalorimeter energy resolution and large grasp to cover the whole sky while maintaining good angular resolution and imaging capabilities. LASS will be able to probe the physical conditions of the hot phases of the Milky Way at multiple scales, from emission in the Solar system due to Solar Wind Charge eXchange, to the interstellar and circumgalactic media, including the North Polar Spur and the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles. It will measure velocities of gas in the inner part of the Galaxy and extract the emissivity of the Local Hot Bubble. By maintaining the original angular resolution, LASS will also be able to study classes of point sources through stacking. For classes with ~$10^4$ objects, it will provide the equivalent of 1 Ms of high spectral resolution data. We describe the technical specifications of LASS and highlight the main scientific objectives that will be addressed. (Abridged)
