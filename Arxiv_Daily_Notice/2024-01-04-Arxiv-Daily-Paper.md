 - **Abstract**
 We present the mid-infrared (5-12 $\mu$m) phase curve of GJ 367b observed by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). GJ 367b is a hot (T_eq=1370 K), extremely dense (10.2 +- 1.3 g/cm^3) sub-Earth orbiting a M dwarf on a 0.32 d orbit. We measure an eclipse depth of 79 +- 4 ppm, a nightside planet-to-star flux ratio of 4 +- 8 ppm, and a relative phase amplitude of 0.97 +- 0.10-- all fully consistent with a zero-albedo planet with no heat recirculation. Su ch a scenario is also consistent with the phase offset of 11 +- 5 degrees East to within 2.2$\sigma$. The emission spectrum is likewise consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo of A_B ~ 0.1, with the exception of one anomalous wavelength bin that we attribute to unexplained systematics. The emission spectrum puts few constraints on the surface composition, but rules out a CO2 atmosphere >~ 1 bar, an outgassed atmosphere >~10 mbar (under heavily reducing conditions), or an outgassed atmosphere >~0.01 mbar (under heavily oxidizing conditions). The lack of day-night heat recirculation implies that 1 bar atmospheres are ruled out for a wide range of compositions, while 0.1 bar atmospheres are consistent with the data. Taken together with the fact that most of the dayside should be molten, our JWST observations suggest the planet must have lost the vast majority of its initial inventory of volatiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Scientists have long speculated about the potential habitability of Venus, not at the 700K surface, but in the cloud layers located at 48-60 km altitudes, where temperatures match those found on Earth's surface. However, the prevailing belief has been that Venus' clouds cannot support life due to the cloud chemical composition of concentrated sulfuric acid-a highly aggressive solvent. In this work, we study 20 biogenic amino acids at the range of Venus' cloud sulfuric acid concentrations (81% and 98% w/w, the rest water) and temperatures. We find 19 of the biogenic amino acids we tested are either unreactive (13 in 98% w/w and 12 in 81% w/w) or chemically modified in the side chain only, after four weeks. Our major finding, therefore, is that the amino acid backbone remains intact in concentrated sulfuric acid. These findings significantly broaden the range of biologically relevant molecules that could be components of a biochemistry based on a concentrated sulfuric acid solvent.

 - **Abstract**
 In ultraviolet (UV) astronomical observations, photons from the sources are very few compared to the visible or infrared (IR) wavelength ranges. Detectors operating in the UV usually employ a photon-counting mode of operation. These detectors usually have an image intensifier sensitive to UV photons and a readout mechanism that employs photon counting. The development of readouts for these detectors is resource-intensive and expensive. In this paper, we describe the development of a low-cost UV photon-counting detector processing unit that employs a Raspberry Pi with its in built readout to perform the photon-counting operation. Our system can operate in both 3x3 and 5x5 window modes at 30 frames per sec (fps), where 5x5 window mode also enables the provision of detection of double events. The system can be built quickly from readily available custom-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and is thus used in inexpensive CubeSats or small satellite missions. This low-cost solution promises to broaden access to UV observations, advancing research possibilities in space-based astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the atmosphere of WASP-121 b, a ultra-hot Jupiter. After reducing the transit, eclipse, and phase-curve observations with a uniform methodology and addressing the biases from instrument systematics, sophisticated atmospheric retrievals are used to extract robust constraints on the thermal structure, chemistry, and cloud properties of the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that the observations are consistent with a strong thermal inversion beginning at ~0.1 bar on the dayside, solar to subsolar metallicity Z (i.e., -0.77 < log(Z) < 0.05), and super-solar C/O ratio (i.e., 0.59 < C/O < 0.87). More importantly, utilizing the high signal-to-noise ratio and repeated observations of the planet, we identify the following unambiguous time-varying signals in the data: i) a shift of the putative hotspot offset between the two phase-curves and ii) varying spectral signatures in the transits and eclipses. By simulating the global dynamics of WASP-121 b atmosphere at high-resolution, we show that the identified signals are consistent with quasi-periodic weather patterns, hence atmospheric variability, with signatures at the level probed by the observations (~5% to ~10%) that change on a timescale of ~5 planet days; in the simulations, the weather patterns arise from the formation and movement of storms and fronts, causing hot (as well as cold) patches of atmosphere to deform, separate, and mix in time.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to study exoplanets, a comprehensive characterization of the fundamental properties of the host stars, such as angular diameter, temperature, luminosity, and age, is essential, as the formation and evolution of exoplanets are directly influenced by the host stars at various points in time. In this paper, we present interferometric observations taken of directly imaged planet host 51 Eridani at the CHARA Array. We measure the limb-darkened angular diameter of HD 29391 to be $\theta_{\rm LD} = 0.450\pm 0.004 \rm ~mas$ and combining with the Gaia zero-point corrected parallax, we get a stellar radius of $1.45 \pm 0.01 \rm~R_{\odot}$. We use the PARSEC isochrones to estimate an age of $23.2^{+1.7}_{-1.6} \rm ~Myr$ and a mass of $1.550 \pm 0.005 \rm ~M_{\odot}$. The age and mass agree well with values in the literature, determined through a variety of methods ranging from dynamical age trace-backs to lithium depletion boundary methods. We derive a mass of $4.1^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \rm ~M_{Jup}$ for 51 Eri b using the Sonora Bobcat models, which further supports the possibility of 51 Eri b forming under either the hot-start formation model or the warm-start formation model.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observations of two self-lensing pulses from KIC 12254688 in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves. This system, containing a F2V star and white-dwarf companion, was amongst the first self-lensing binary systems discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope over the past decade. Each observed pulse occurs when the white dwarf transits in front of its companion star, gravitationally lensing the star's surface, thus making it appear brighter to a distant observer. These two pulses are the very first self-lensing events discovered in TESS observations. We describe the methods by which the data were acquired and detrended, as well as the best-fit binary parameters deduced from our self-lensing+radial velocity model. We highlight the difficulties of finding new self-lensing systems with TESS, and we discuss the types of self-lensing systems that TESS may be more likely to discover in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Linear RMS-flux relation has been well established in different spectral states of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the frequency-dependent RMS-flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial decaying phase of the 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range 1-150 keV. As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear RMS-flux relation at frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying times for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope. Moreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest sensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state transition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time deviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the RMS-flux slope and intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system. One component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk-corona coupling before the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to the reduction of the disk-corona coupling after the break. A further vertical expansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic evolution observed in the RMS-flux slope. In conclusion, we suggest that the RMS-flux slope in 1-150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of the disk-corona coupling and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070 could be partially driven by the changes in the corona geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 To gain a better understanding of the Andromeda galaxy M31 and its role in the Local Group, measuring its mass precisely is essential. In this work, we have constructed the rotation curve of M31 out to $\sim$125 kpc using 13,679 M31 objects obtained from various sources, including the LAMOST data release 9 (LAMOST DR9), the DESI survey, and relevant literature. We divide all objects in our sample into bulge, disk and halo components. For the sources in the M31 disk, we have measured their circular velocities by a kinematic model with asymmetric drift corrections. For the bulge and halo objects, we calculate their velocity dispersions and use the spherical and projected Jeans equation to obtain the circular velocities. Our findings indicate a nearly isotropic nature for the M31 bulge, while the halo exhibits tangential anisotropy. The results show that the rotation curve remains constant at $\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$ up to radius $\sim$25 kpc and gradually decreases to $\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$ further out. Based on the newly determined rotation curve, we have constructed a mass distribution model for M31. Our measurement of the M31 virial mass is $M_{\rm vir} = 1.14^{+0.51}_{-0.35} \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ within $r_{\rm vir} = 220 \pm 25$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare, with data from the quasars, the Hubble parameter measurements, and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, three different relations between X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) and ultraviolet luminosity ($L_{UV}$) of quasars. These three relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary $L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relations which are constructed respectively by considering a redshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the statistical tool called copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a cosmological-model-independent description of the cosmic background evolution and dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we find that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and high-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary relations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard relation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of the relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations support the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than $3\sigma$. The Akaike and Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against the standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary relation constructed by considering a redshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars. This suggests that the redshift-evolutionary $L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relation of quasars constructed from copula is favored by the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation (HMSF) is a multiscale, dynamical process in molecular clouds, where filaments transport gas material between larger and smaller scales. We analyze here multiscale gas dynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX observations of the C18O (2-1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3-2), and HCN/H13CN (3-2) lines. We find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission, which drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of G34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale gas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other lines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas inflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We confirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It could be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence originating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.

 - **Abstract**
 For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it is lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has ignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in some special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by its companion in a binary system, where the lens is very close to the source), large angle diffraction could be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive integral formula which has including large angle diffraction case. In this paper, we have investigated how much difference between this general diffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under these special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of amplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than that of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor $r_F\simeq0.674$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\rm LS}=1$ AU and lens mass $M_{\rm L}=1M_\odot$. Their difference is so significant that it is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the proportionality factor $r_F$ is gradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with increasing $D_{\rm LS}$ and it is decreasing with increasing $M_{\rm L}$. As long as $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim3$ AU (with $M_{\rm L}=1M_\odot$) or $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim0.1M_\odot$ (with $D_{\rm LS}=1$ AU ), the difference between new and traditional formulas is enough significant to be detectable. It is promising to test this new general diffractive formula by next-generation GW detectors in the future GW detection.
#### Solar Energetic Particle Charge States and Abundances with Nonthermal  Electrons

 - **Abstract**
 An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various kappa values in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution are about 10-30. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.
#### Explaining supernova remnant G352.7-0.1 as a peculiar type Ia supernova  inside a planetary nebula

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01707
 - **Abstract**
 I identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) G352.7-0.1 and propose that the outer axially-symmetric structure is the remnant of a common envelope evolution (CEE) of the progenitor system, while the inner structure is the ejecta of a thermonuclear explosion triggered by the merger of a white dwarf (WD) and the core of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The main radio structure of SNR G352.7-0.1 forms an outer (large) ellipse. The bright X-ray emitting gas forms a smaller ellipse with a symmetry axis inclined to the symmetry axis of the large radio ellipse. The high abundance of iron and the energy of its X-ray lines suggest a type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The massive swept-up gas suggests a relatively massive progenitor system. I propose a scenario with progenitors of initial masses of M1=5-7Mo and M2=4-5 Mo. At a later phase, the WD remnant of the primary star and the AGB secondary star experience a CEE that ejects the circumstellar material that swept up more ISM to form the large elliptical radio structure. An explosion during the merger of the WD with the core of the AGB star triggered a super-Chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosion that formed the inner structure that is bright in X-ray. A tertiary star in the system caused the misalignment of the two symmetry axes. This study adds to the rich variety of evolutionary routes within the different scenarios of normal and peculiar SNe Ia.
#### Tracing the layers of Photodissociated gas in Trifid Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 Photodissociated gas bears the signature of the dynamical evolution of the ambient interstellar medium impacted by the mechanical and radiative feedback from an expanding HII region. Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of the young Trifid nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the far-infrared fine-structure lines of [C II] at 158 micron and [O I] at 63 micron. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the nebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the HII region expanding with a velocity of 5 km/s. Comparison of ratios of [C II] and [O I] 63 micron intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models indicate a density of 1e4 /cm^3. The red- and blue-shifted PDR shells with a combined mass of 516 Msun have a kinetic energy of ~1e47 erg. This is consistent with the thermal energy of the HII region as well as with the energy deposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over the 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is lower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to the shell being swept up by an expanding HII region, which suggests that significant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the surrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.
#### An Angular Diameter Measurement of $β$ UMa via Stellar Intensity  Interferometry with the VERITAS Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 We use the VERITAS imaging air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) array to obtain the first measured angular diameter of $\beta$ UMa at visual wavelengths using stellar intensity interferometry (SII) and independently constrain the limb-darkened angular diameter. The age of the Ursa Major moving group has been assessed from the ages of its members, including nuclear member Merak ($\beta$ UMa), an A1-type subgiant, by comparing effective temperature and luminosity constraints to model stellar evolution tracks. Previous interferometric limb-darkened angular-diameter measurements of $\beta$ UMa in the near-infrared (CHARA Array, $1.149 \pm 0.014$ mas) and mid-infrared (Keck Nuller, $1.08 \pm 0.07$ mas), together with the measured parallax and bolometric flux, have constrained the effective temperature. This paper presents current VERITAS-SII observation and analysis procedures to derive squared visibilities from correlation functions. We fit the resulting squared visibilities to find a limb-darkened angular diameter of $1.07 \pm 0.04 {\rm (stat)} \pm 0.05$ (sys) mas, using synthetic visibilities from a stellar atmosphere model that provides a good match to the spectrum of $\beta$ UMa in the optical wave band. The VERITAS-SII limb-darkened angular diameter yields an effective temperature of $9700\pm200\pm 200$ K, consistent with ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and an age of $390\pm 29 \pm 32 $ Myr, using MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST). This age is consistent with $408 \pm 6$ Myr from the CHARA Array angular diameter.

 - **Abstract**
 WISE J224607.6-052634.9 (W2246-0526) is a hot dust-obscured galaxy at $z$ = 4.601, and the most luminous obscured quasar known to date. W2246-0526 harbors a heavily obscured supermassive black hole that is most likely accreting above the Eddington limit. We present observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in seven bands, including band 10, of the brightest far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure emission lines of this galaxy: [OI]$_{63\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$, [OI]$_{145\mu m}$, [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [NII]$_{205\mu m}$, [CI]$_{370\mu m}$, and [CI]$_{609\mu m}$. A comparison of the data to a large grid of Cloudy radiative transfer models reveals that a high hydrogen density ($n_{H}\sim3\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) and extinction ($A_{V}\sim300$ mag), together with extreme ionization ($log(U)=-0.5$) and a high X-ray to UV ratio ($\alpha_{ox}\geq-0.8$) are required to reproduce the observed nuclear line ratios. The values of $\alpha_{ox}$ and $U$ are among the largest found in the literature and imply the existence of an X-ray-dominated region (XDR). In fact, this component explains the a priori very surprising non-detection of the [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ emission line, which is actually suppressed, instead of boosted, in XDR environments. Interestingly, the best-fitted model implies higher X-ray emission and lower CO content than what is detected observationally, suggesting the presence of a molecular gas component that should be further obscuring the X-ray emission over larger spatial scales than the central region that is being modeled. These results highlight the need for multiline infrared observations to characterize the multiphase gas in high redshift quasars and, in particular, W2246-0526 serves as an extreme benchmark for comparisons of interstellar medium conditions with other quasar populations at cosmic noon and beyond.
