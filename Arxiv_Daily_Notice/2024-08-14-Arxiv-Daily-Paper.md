 - **Abstract**
 UW Coronae Borealis (UW CrB) is a low mass X-ray binary that shows both Type 1 X-ray and optical bursts, which typically last for 20 s. The system has a binary period of close to 2 hours and is thought to have a relatively high inclination due to the presence of an eclipse in the optical light curve. There is also evidence that an asymmetric disc is present in the system, which precesses every 5.5 days based on changes in the depth of the eclipse. In this paper, we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of UW CrB taken over 2 years. We update the orbital ephemeris using observed optical eclipses and refine the orbital period to 110.97680(1) min. A total of 17 new optical bursts are presented, with 10 of these bursts being resolved temporally. The average $e$-folding time of $19\pm3$s for the bursts is consistent with the previously found value. Optical bursts are observed during a previously identified gap in orbital phase centred on $\phi=0.967$, meaning the reprocessing site is not eclipsed as previously thought. Finally, we find that the apparent P-Cygni profiles present in some of the atomic lines in the optical spectra are due to transient absorption.

          Perturbation Theory Remixed II: Improved Modeling of Nonlinear Bispectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We present the application of the $n$-th order Eulerian Perturbation Theory ($n$EPT) for modeling the matter bispectrum in real space as an advancement over the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT). The $n$EPT method, detailed in Wang et al. (2023) \cite{Wang2023nEPT}, sums up the density perturbations up to the $n$-th order before computing summary statistics such as bispectrum. Taking advantage of grid-based calculation of SPT (GridSPT), we make a realization-based comparison of the analytical nonlinear bispectrum predictions from $n$EPT and SPT against a suite of $N$-body simulations. Using a spherical-bispectrum visualization scheme, we show that $n$EPT bispectrum matches better than SPT bispectrum over a wide range of scales in general $w$CDM cosmologies. Like the power spectrum case, we find that $n$EPT bispectrum modeling accuracy is controlled by $\sigma_8(z) \equiv \sigma_8 D(z)$, where $D(z)$ is the linear growth factor at a redshift $z$. Notably, the 6EPT doubles the bispectrum model's validity range compared to the one-loop SPT for $\sigma_8(z) < 0.5$, corresponding to redshifts $z\ge1$ for the best-fitting Planck-2018 cosmology. For $n\ge5$, however, $n$EPT bispectrum depends sensitively on the cut-off scale or the grid resolution. The percent-level modeling accuracy achieved for the spherical bispectrum (where we average over all triangular configurations) becomes much degraded when fixing configurations. Thus, we show that the validity range of the field-level cosmological inferences must be different from that derived from averaged summary statistics such as $n$-point correlation functions.

          Segue 2 Recently Collided with the Cetus-Palca Stream: New Opportunities to Constrain Dark Matter in an Ultra-Faint Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams in the Milky Way are promising detectors of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. Passing subhalos induce perturbations in streams that indicate the presence of the subhalos. Understanding how known DM-dominated satellites impact streams is a crucial step towards using stream perturbations to constrain the properties of dark perturbers. Here, we cross-match a $\textit{Gaia}$ EDR3 and SEGUE member catalog of the Cetus-Palca stream (CPS) with H3 for additional radial velocity measurements and fit the orbit of the CPS using this 6-D data. We demonstrate for the first time that the ultra-faint dwarf Segue 2 had a recent (77$\pm$5 Myr ago) close flyby (within the stream's 2$\sigma$ width) with the CPS. This interaction enables constraints on Segue 2's mass and density profile at larger radii ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ kpc) than are probed by its stars ($\mathcal{O}(10)$ pc). While Segue 2 is not expected to strongly affect the portion of the stream covered by our 6-D data, we predict that if Segue 2's mass within $\sim 6$ kpc is $5\times 10^9\,M_\odot$, the CPS's velocity dispersion will be $\sim 40$ km/s larger ahead of the impact site than behind it. If no such heating is detected, Segue 2's mass cannot exceed $10^9\,M_\odot$ within $\sim 6$ kpc. The proper motion distribution of the CPS near the impact site is mildly sensitive to the shape of Segue 2's density profile. This study presents a critical test for frameworks designed to constrain properties of dark subhalos from stream perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting exoplanet transits at X-ray wavelengths would provide a window into the effects of high energy irradiation on the upper atmospheres of planets. However, stars are relatively dim in the X-ray, making exoplanet transit detections difficult with current X-ray telescopes. To date, only one exoplanet (HD~189733~b) has an X-ray transit detection. In this study, we investigate the capability of future X-ray observatories to detect more exoplanet transits, focusing on both the NewAthena-WFI instrument and the proposed Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), which provide more light-collecting power than current instruments. We examined all the transiting exoplanet systems in the NASA Exoplanet Archive and gathered X-ray flux measurements or estimates for each host star. We then predicted the stellar count rates for both AXIS and NewAthena and simulated light curves, using null-hypothesis testing to identify the top 15 transiting planets ranked by potential detection significance. We also evaluate transit detection probabilities when the apparent X-ray radius is enlarged due to atmospheric escape, finding that $\geq 5$ of these planetary systems may be detectable on the $>4\sigma$ level in this scenario. Finally, we note that the assumed host star coronal temperature, which affects the shape of an X-ray transit, can also significantly affect our ability to detect the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a population-level analysis of the dayside thermal emission spectra of 19 planets observed with Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 microns, spanning equilibrium temperatures 1200-2700 K and 0.7-10.5 Jupiter masses. We use grids of planet-specific 1D, cloud-free, radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium models (1D-RCTE) combined with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate atmospheric metallicity, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and day-to-night heat redistribution. In general, we find that the secondary eclipse data cannot reject the physics encapsulated within the 1D-RCTE assumption parameterized with these three variables. We find a large degree of scatter in atmospheric metallicities, with no apparent trend, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios that are mainly consistent with solar or subsolar values but do not exhibit population agreement. Together, these indicate either (1) formation pathways vary over the hot and ultra-hot Jupiter population and/or (2) more accurate composition measurements are needed to identify trends. We also find a broad scatter in derived dayside temperatures that do not demonstrate a trend with equilibrium temperature. Like with composition estimates, this suggests either significant variability in climate drivers over the population and/or more precise dayside temperature measurements are needed to identify a trend. We anticipate that 1D-RCTE models will continue to provide valuable insights into the nature of exoplanet atmospheres in the era of JWST.

          Planetary Nebulae Research: Past, Present, and Future

 - **Abstract**
 We review the evolution of our understanding of the planetary nebulae phenomenon and their place in the scheme of stellar evolution. The historical steps leading to our current understanding of central star evolution and nebular formation are discussed. Recent optical imaging, X-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, millimeter wave, radio observations have led to a much more complex picture of the structure of planetary nebulae. The optically bright regions have multiple shell structures (rims, shells, crowns, and haloes), which can be understood within the interacting winds framework. However, the physical mechanism responsible for bipolar and multipolar structures that emerged during the proto-planetary nebulae phase is yet to be identified. Our morphological classifications of planetary nebulae are hampered by the effects of sensitivity, orientation, and field-of-view coverage, and the fraction of bipolar or multipolar nebulae may be much higher than commonly assumed. The optically bright bipolar lobes may represent low-density, ionization-bounded cavities carved out of a neutral envelope by collimated fast winds. Planetary nebulae are sites of active synthesis of complex organic compounds, suggesting that planetary nebulae play a major role in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. Possible avenues of future advancement are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we evaluate the viability of CubeSats as an attractive platform for lightweight instrumentation by describing a proof of concept CubeSat that houses an astrophotonic chip for transit spectroscopy-based exoplanet atmosphere gas sensing. The Twin Earth SEnsoR Astrophotonic CubesaT (TESERACT) was designed to house a correlation spectroscopy chip along with an electrical and optical system for operation. We investigate design challenges and considerations in incorporating astrophotonic instrumentation such as component integration, thermal management and optical alignment. This work aims to be a pathfinder for demonstrating that astrophotonic-based CubeSat missions can perform leading edge, targeted science in lower-cost CubeSat platforms.

 - **Abstract**
 Long baseline optical interferometry and aperture synthesis using ground-based telescopes can enable unprecedented angular resolution astronomy in the optical domain. However, atmospheric turbulence leads to large, dynamic phase errors between participating apertures that limit fringe visibility using telescopes arrays or subaperture configurations in a single large telescope. Diffraction limited optics or adaptive optics can be used to ensure coherence at each aperture, but correlating the phase between apertures requires high speed, high stroke phase correction and recombination that is extremely challenging and costly. As a solution, we show an alternative phase correction and beam combination method using a centimeter-scale silicon astrophotonic chip optimized for H-band operation. The 4.7x10mm silicon photonic chip is fabricated using electron beam lithography with devices with 2 up to 32 independent channels. Light is coupled into the chip using single mode fiber ribbons. An array of microheaters is used to individually tune the effective index of each spiral delay waveguides. Narrowband spectral splitters at each spatial channel divert a modulated digital reference signal from an artificial guide star off-chip for phase measurement. Science light from other wavelengths is coherently combined using on-chip beam combiners and outputted to a single waveguide. We described the role, design, fabrication and characterization of the photonic chip. This photonic phase control scheme can be applied in astronomical interferometry or optical satellite communications.

 - **Abstract**
 The Santa Cruz Extreme AO Lab (SEAL) testbed is an optical bench meant to design and develop new wavefront control techniques for high-contrast imaging for segmented telescopes. These techniques allow for astronomical efficiency in exoplanet imaging and characterization. SEAL consists of several wavefront sensors (WFS) and deformable mirrors (DM) that are currently performing techniques like predictive control or non-linear reconstruction. In this paper, we present the implementation and characterization of a new coronagraphic branch on SEAL and assess the contrast limitations in the testbed. For our coronagraphic branch, we used a vector vortex coronagraph which has high contrast performance. The W. M. Keck Observatory also uses a vortex coronagraph, allowing us to compare the limitations with our own coronagraph. We relied on the testbed and simulations of the vortex coronagraph to compare performance with expected ones. To create a more reliable simulation, we also injected in our numerical model data collected by a Zernike Wavefront sensor (ZWFS) used to perform fine wavefront sensing on the bench. Now that the coronagraphic branch is aligned on SEAL, we will be able to use contrast as a metric for the performance of wavefront control methods on the bench.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is becoming an increasingly significant problem for most radio telescopes. Working with Green Bank Telescope data from PSR J1730+0747 in the form of complex-valued channelized voltages and their respective high-resolution power spectral densities, we evaluate a variety of statistical measures to characterize RFI. As a baseline for performance comparison, we use median absolute deviation (MAD) in complex channelized voltage data and spectral kurtosis (SK) in power spectral density data to characterize and filter out RFI. From a new perspective, we implement the Shapiro-Wilks (SW) test for normality and two information theoretical measures, spectral entropy (SE) and spectral relative entropy (SRE), and apply them to mitigate RFI. The baseline RFI mitigation algorithms are compared against our novel RFI detection algorithms to determine how effective and robust the performance is. Except for MAD, we find significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio through the application of SE, symmetrical SRE, asymmetrical SRE, SK, and SW. These algorithms also do a good job of characterizing broadband RFI. Time- and frequency-variable RFI signals are best detected by SK and SW tests.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs), possibly constituting a non-negligible fraction of dark matter (DM), might be responsible for a number of gravitational wave events detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In this paper, we simulate the evolution of PBH binaries in DM halos and calculate their merger rate up to redshift of 10. We assume that DM halos are made entirely by a combination of single PBHs and PBH binaries. We present the resulting merger rates from the two main channels that lead to merging PBH binaries: two-body captures and binary-single interactions. We account for alternative assumptions on the dark matter halo mass-concentration relationship versus redshift. We also study what impact the PBH mass distribution, centered in the stellar-mass range, has on the PBH merger rate that the ground-based gravitational-wave observatories can probe. We find that under reasonable assumptions on the abundance of PBH binaries relative to single PBHs, the binary-single interaction rates can be dominant over the two-body capture channel. Our work studies in detail the dynamics of PBHs inside DM halos, advancing our understanding on how the current gravitational-wave events constrain the properties of PBHs. Moreover, we make predictions in a redshift range to be probed by future observatories.

          Ancient nova shells of RX Pup indicate evolution of mass transfer rate

 - **Abstract**
 RX Pup is a symbiotic binary which experienced a nova outburst in the 1970's. Here we report a discovery of a ~1300 year old nova shell around the system and a possible detection of a ~7000 year old nova shell. Together with the nova shell ejected in the 1970's this makes RX Pup the first system with three nova shells observed. This triad of eruptions suggests a change in the nova recurrence time. The most likely explanation is an alteration in the mass transfer rate attributed to evolutionary changes of the mass-donor in the system. Notably, comparative analyses with theoretical models indicate an increase in the average mass transfer rate by a factor of three over the past 10,000 years. This makes RX Pup a unique system, which allows us to probe millenium-scale evolution of mass transfer rates in binary systems.

          Generalized flow-composed symplectic methods for post-Newtonian Hamiltonian systems

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the nonseparability of the post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian systems of compact objects, the symplectic methods that admit the linear error growth and the near preservation of first integrals are always implicit as explicit symplectic methods have not been currently found for general nonseparable Hamiltonian systems. Since the PN Hamiltonian has a particular formulation that includes a dominant Newtonian part and a perturbation PN part, we present the generalized flow-composed Runge--Kutta (GFCRK) method with a free parameter $\lambda$ to PN Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that the GFCRK method is symplectic once the underlying RK method is symplectic, and it is symmetric once the underlying RK method is symmetric under the setting $\lambda=1/2$. Numerical experiments with the 2PN Hamiltonian of spinning compact binaries demonstrate the higher accuracy and efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the underlying symplectic RK. Meanwhile, the numerical results also support higher efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the semi-explicit mixed symplectic method of the same order.

 - **Abstract**
 Foreground removal presents a significant obstacle in both current and forthcoming intensity mapping surveys. While numerous techniques have been developed that show promise in simulated datasets, their efficacy often diminishes when applied to real-world data. A primary issue is the frequency-dependent variations in the instrumental response. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing the internal cross-correlation among different frequencies to calibrate the beam's frequency fluctuations. Using a simulated dataset that incorporates frequency-dependent random fluctuations into the beam model, we illustrate that our method can achieve considerable improvements over traditional techniques. Our results represent a step forward in enhancing the precision and reliability of foreground removal in intensity mapping surveys.

          ASASSN-21js: A multi-year transit of a ringed disc

 - **Abstract**
 The early-type star ASASSN-21js started to fade in 2021, as was detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, undergoing a multi-year eclipse that is still underway. We interpret this event as being due to a structured disc of material transiting in front of the star. The disc is in orbit around a substellar object with the mass and luminosity of a brown dwarf or smaller. We want to determine the expected duration and ending date of the eclipse. We modelled a tilted and inclined azimuthally symmetric ring system around an unseen companion and calculated the resulting time-varying light curve as the object transited in front of the star. We made an initial estimate of the ring parameters and used these as inputs to an MCMC algorithm to determine the geometric properties of the rings with associated uncertainties. The model most consistent with the light curve to date is a two-ring system at high inclination with respect to the line of sight that has a semi-major axis of 71.6 stellar radii. With an estimate of the stellar radius, the transverse velocity is around 0.7 km/s, which if bound to the star is an orbit with a semi-major axis of around 13000 au, placing it in the Oort cloud of the parent star. The transit is ongoing and will finish around MJD 61526 (May 1 2027). We encourage the community to continue observing this object in order to understand its properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first X-ray polarization measurements of GX 339-4. IXPE observed this source twice during its 2023-2024 outburst, once in the soft-intermediate state and again during a soft state. The observation taken during the intermediate state shows significant ($4\sigma$) polarization degree P = $1.3\% \pm 0.3\%$ and polarization angle $\theta$ = -74\degree $\pm$ 7\degree only in the 3 - 8 keV band. FORS2 at VLT observed the source simultaneously detecting optical polarization in the B, V, R, I bands (between $0.1%$ and $0.7\%$), all roughly aligned with the X-ray polarization. We also detect a discrete jet knot from radio observations taken later in time; this knot would have been ejected from the system around the same time as the hard-to-soft X-ray state transition and a bright radio flare occurred $\sim$3 months earlier. The proper motion of the jet knot provides a direct measurement of the jet orientation angle on the plane of the sky at the time of the ejection. We find that both the X-ray and optical polarization angles are aligned with the direction of the ballistic jet.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2012, Brazil began the studies to send its first deep space exploration mission, ASTER, which would be the first mission to orbit a triple asteroid system, 2001 SN263. We aim to contribute to the ASTER mission by defining the parameters of a multispectral camera system that will be used to study the asteroid system 2001 SN263, through software simulations that should help planning the data collection. We inserted the shape model of the objects in the software POV-Ray and modeled two cameras, a Wide Angle (WAC) and a Narrow Angle (NAC). We inserted the asteroid's parameters and simulated the satellite position. We created various scenes so we could obtain a good view of the asteroid. Alpha is entirely visible only in the WAC images, while the NAC is expected to reveal surface details. Beta seems relatively small in the WAC images, whereas we obtain a broad view from the NAC at 100 km distance. Gamma, smaller than Beta, should provide more detailed images through the NAC, whereas the WAC images should be able to show its inclined orbit around Alpha. To see Gamma behind Alpha in its revolution movement, we would have to elevate the camera's orbit. The method employed to simulate images generated by satellite cameras can be applied to other scenarios where the target requires imaging, extending beyond the field of planetary geology.

          X-ray spectral properties of the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17498-2921 during its 2023 outburst

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray spectral properties of the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17498$-$2921 during its 2023 outburst. Similar to other accreting millisecond pulsars, the broad-band spectral emission observed quasi-simultaneously by NICER and NuSTAR is well described by an absorbed Comptonized emission with an electron temperature of $\sim$17 keV plus a disk reflection component. The broadening of the disk reflection spectral features, such as a prominent iron emission line at 6.4-6.7 keV, is consistent with the relativistic motion of matter in a disk truncated at $\sim$$21 \, \mathrm{R_g}$ from the source, near the Keplerian co-rotation radius. From the high-cadence monitoring data obtained with NICER, we observe that the evolution of the photon index and the temperature of seed photons tracks variations in the X-ray flux. This is particularly evident close to a sudden $\sim$-0.25 cycles jump in the pulse phase, which occurs immediately following an X-ray flux flare and a drop in the pulse amplitude below the $3\sigma$ detection threshold. We also report on the non-detection of optical pulsations with TNG/SiFAP2 from the highly absorbed optical counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise space-based photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite results in a huge number of exoplanetary candidates. However, the masses of these objects are unknown and must be determined by ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations, frequently revealing the companions to be low-mass stars rather than exoplanets. We present the first orbital and stellar parameter solutions for five such eclipsing binary-star systems using radial-velocity follow-up measurements together with spectral-energy-distribution solutions. TOI-416 and TOI-1143 are totally eclipsing F+M star systems with well-determined secondary masses, radii, and temperatures. TOI-416 is a circular system with an F6 primary and a secondary with a mass of $M_2={0.131(8)}{M_\odot}$. TOI-1143 consists of an F6 primary with an $M_2={0.142(3)}{M_\odot}$ secondary on an eccentric orbit with a third companion. With respect to the other systems, TOI-1153 shows ellipsoidal variations, TOI-1615 contains a pulsating primary, and TOI-1788 has a spotted primary, while all have moderate mass ratios of 0.2-0.4. However, these systems are in a grazing configuration, which limits their full description. The parameters of TOI-416B and TOI-1143B are suitable for the calibration of the radius-mass relation for dwarf stars.

 - **Abstract**
 New ground-based and space-based photometric data have been obtained and archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of three detached early-type and southern-hemisphere eccentric eclipsing binaries GM Nor (P = 1.88 d, e = 0.05), V397 Pup (3.00, 0.30), and PT Vel (1.80, 0.12). Their TESS observations in several sectors have also been included and the corresponding light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. As a result, new accurate photoelectric times of minimum light have been obtained. The newly completed O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values for the elements of apsidal motion were obtained. Using ESO archive spectroscopy, for V397 Pup, the precise absolute parameters were newly derived: M1 = 3.076(35) M$\odot$, M2 = 2.306(35) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.711(55) R$\odot$, R2 = 1.680(55) R$\odot$. For PT Vel the absolute dimensions were improved: M1 = 2.204(25) M$\odot$, M2 = 1.638(25) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.108(30) R$\odot$, R2 = 1.605(30) R$\odot$. For GM Nor, the less accurate absolute parameters based on the light curve analysis were evaluated: M1 = 1.94(15) M$\odot$, M2 = 1.84(14) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.27(20) R$\odot$, R2 = 2.25(20) R$\odot$. We found more precise and relatively short periods of apsidal motion of about 80, 335, and 160 years, along with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.524, -2.361, and -2.563, for GM Nor, V397 Pup, and PT Vel, respectively. Relativistic effects are small but not negligible, making up to 10\% of the total apsidal motion rate in all systems. No marks of the presence of the third body were revealed in the light curves, on the O-C diagrams, or in the reduced spectra of the eccentric systems studied here.

          Likely detection of GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from pulsar wind nebula G32.64+0.53 with Fermi-LAT

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we report the likely GeV {\gamma}-ray emissions originating from the pulsar PSR J1849-0001's pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G32.64+0.53. Our analysis covers approximately 14.7 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) Pass 8. The position of the source and its spectrum matches those in X-ray and TeV energy bands, so we propose that the GeV {\gamma}-ray source is indicative of PWN G32.64+0.53. We interpret the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) using a time-dependent one-zone model, which assumes that the multi-band non-thermal emission of the target source can be generated by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the electrons/positrons. Our findings demonstrate that the model substantially elucidates the observed SED. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the {\gamma}-ray source originates from the PWN G32.64+0.53 powered by PSR J1849-0001. Furthermore, the {\gamma}-rays in TeV bands are likely generated by electrons/positrons within the nebula through Inverse Compton Scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parameter estimation algorithm on kilonova light curves using likelihood-free inference. Our inference is optimized through a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal. We find that parameter inference utilizing a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. The model is capable of retrieving the intrinsic parameters of the kilonova light curves with a comparable accuracy and precision to nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time. This framework has been integrated into the publicly available Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase so users can leverage the model for their inference purposes. This algorithm is broadly applicable to parameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Epsilon Eridani ($\epsilon$ Eri) is one of the first debris disk systems detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). However, the system has thus far eluded detection in scattered light with no components having been directly imaged. Its similarity to a relatively young Solar System combined with its proximity makes it an excellent candidate to further our understanding of planetary system evolution. We present a set of coronagraphic images taken using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraph on the Hubble space telescope at a small inner working angle to detect a predicted warm inner debris disk inside 1". We used three different post-processing approaches; Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Karhunen-Lo`eve Image Processing (KLIP), and Classical reference differential imaging (RDI), to best optimize reference star subtraction, and find that NMF performed the best overall while KLIP produced the absolute best contrast inside 1". We present limits on scattered light from warm dust, with constraints on surface brightness at 6 mJy/as$^2$ at our inner working angle of 0.6". We also place a constraint of 0.5 mJy/as$^2$ outside 1", which gives us an upper limit on the brightness for outer disks and substellar companions. Finally, we calculated an upper limit on the dust albedo at $\omega <$ 0.487.

 - **Abstract**
 With the commissioning of the refurbished adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) for the 6.5-meter MMT Observatory under way, special consideration had to be made to properly calibrate the mirror response functions to generate an interaction matrix (IM). The commissioning of the ASM is part of the MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS) upgrade the observatory's legacy adaptive optics (AO) system. Unlike most AO systems, MAPS employs a convex ASM which prevents the introduction of a calibration source capable of simultaneously illuminating its ASM and wavefront sensor (WFS). This makes calibration of the AO system a significant hurdle in commissioning. To address this, we have employed a hybrid calibration strategy we call the Efficient Synthesis of Calibrations for Adaptive Optics through Pseudo-synthetic and Empirical methods (ESCAPE). ESCAPE combines the DO-CRIME on-sky calibration method with the SPRINT method for computing pseudo-synthetic calibration matrices. To monitor quasi-static system change, the ESCAPE methodology rapidly and continuously generates pseudo-synthetic calibration matrices using continual empirical feedback in either open or closed-loop. In addition, by measuring the current IM in the background while in close-loop, we are also able to measure the optical gains for pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS) systems. In this paper, we will provide the mathematical foundation of the ESCAPE calibration strategy and on-sky results from its application in calibrating the MMT Observatory's ASM. Additionally, we will showcase the validation of our approach from our AO testbed and share preliminary on-sky results from MMT.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of dust clouds at high Galactic latitude based on the Planck 857 GHz dust emission data. Using a clustering hierarchical algorithm, 315 dust cloud at high Galactic latitudes are identified. Additionally, using the optical and ultraviolet extinction of 4 million and 1 million stars, respectively, provided by Sun et al., we derive the distances and physical properties for 190 high Galactic latitude dust clouds and the ultraviolet excess ratios for 165 of them. Through the study of color excess ratios, this work confirms that molecular clouds with large Galactic distances and low extinction likely have a higher proportion of small-sized dust grains. In addition, clouds with well-defined distances in the catalog are used to trace the local bubble, showing good consistency with the boundary of the local bubble from the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Ultracool Dwarf Companion Catalogue of 278 multiple systems, 32 of which are newly discovered, each with at least one spectroscopically confirmed Ultracool Dwarf, within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. This catalogue is compiled using the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars for stellar primaries and the Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample for low-mass companions and includes 241 doubles, 33 triples, and 4 higher-order systems established from positional, proper motion, and parallax constraints. The catalogue seeks to identify probable benchmark systems within 100 pc to obtain model-independent astrophysical parameters of Ultracool Dwarfs. Chance alignment probabilities are calculated to evaluate the physical nature of each system. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 and the Two Micron All Sky Survey are included for all objects. We identify potential unseen companions using a combination of the Renormalised Unit Weight Error, Image Parameter Determination statistics, Non-Single Star solutions, and photometric blending as provided by Gaia, identifying hierarchical Ultracool triple systems. Our catalogue includes 17 White Dwarf - Ultracool Dwarf systems, whose ages are determined using cooling models. We also use the Gaia FLAME results and the BANYAN $\Sigma$ procedures to age 40 and 34 systems respectively, and derive mass estimates from evolutionary models.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a systematic approach to optimize the scheduling of exoplanet observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), focusing on targets discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We developed a methodology to refine transit timing predictions for JWST's Cycle 3 Guest Observer program, specifically for the NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/BOTS observation modes. Our process involved data collection from JWST proposal documents, cross-matching with TESS data, and applying the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm for transit detection and characterization. We created comprehensive timelines for instrument usage and individual proposals, providing a visual representation of the observation schedule from July 2024 to September 2025. This approach demonstrates the potential for improved efficiency in JWST time allocation and sets a foundation for future refinements in astronomical observation planning.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological collider signals of primordial non-Gaussianity arise at tree level when an extra scalar has Hubble mass during inflation. We critically review the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based on Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational floor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the regime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above the gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns during inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.
