 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery and validation of a transiting long-period mini-Neptune orbiting a bright (V = 9.0 mag) G dwarf (TOI 4633; R = 1.05 RSun, M = 1.10 MSun). The planet was identified in data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite by citizen scientists taking part in the Planet Hunters TESS project. Modeling of the transit events yields an orbital period of 271.9445 +/- 0.0040 days and radius of 3.2 +/- 0.20 REarth. The Earth-like orbital period and an incident flux of 1.56 +/- 0.2 places it in the optimistic habitable zone around the star. Doppler spectroscopy of the system allowed us to place an upper mass limit on the transiting planet and revealed a non-transiting planet candidate in the system with a period of 34.15 +/- 0.15 days. Furthermore, the combination of archival data dating back to 1905 with new high angular resolution imaging revealed a stellar companion orbiting the primary star with an orbital period of around 230 years and an eccentricity of about 0.9. The long period of the transiting planet, combined with the high eccentricity and close approach of the companion star makes this a valuable system for testing the formation and stability of planets in binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even effect. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment. However, this star has not necessarily obtained any of its metals from a PISN. So the search continues for a concrete proof of the existence of zero-metallicity PISNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional studies on stellar streams typically involve phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos or ad hoc dark matter (DM) profiles with different degrees of triaxiality, which preclude to gain insights into the nature and mass of the DM particles. Recently, a Maximum Entropy Principle of halo formation has been applied to provide a DM halo model which incorporates the fermionic (quantum) nature of the particles, while leading to DM profiles which depend on the fermion mass. Such profiles develop a more general dense core - diluted halo morphology able to explain the Galactic rotation curve, while the degenerate fermion core can mimic the central massive black hole (BH). We attempt to model the GD-1 stellar stream using a spherical core-halo DM distribution for the host, which, at the same time, explains the dynamics of the S-cluster stars through its degenerate fermion-core with no central BH. We used two optimization algorithms in order to fit both the initial conditions of the stream orbit and the fermionic model. The stream observables are 5D phase-space data from the Gaia DR2 survey. We were able to find good fits for both the GD-1 stream and the S-stars for a family of fermionic core-halo profiles parameterized by the fermion mass. This work provides evidence that the fermionic profile is a reliable model for both the massive central object and the DM of the Galaxy. Remarkably, this model predicts a total MW mass of $2.3\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ which is in agreement with recent mass estimates obtained from Gaia DR3 rotation curves (Gaia RC). In summary, with one single fermionic model for the DM distribution of the MW, we obtain a good fit in three totally different distance scales of the Galaxy: $\sim 10^{-6}$ kpc (central, S-stars), $\sim14$ kpc (mid, GD-1) and $\sim 30$ kpc (boundary, Gaia RC mass estimate).

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth is no longer the only known celestial body containing one or more liquid phases. The Cassini spacecraft has discovered seas of hydrocarbons at the surface of Titan, while a series of corroborating evidences argue in favour of the existence of an aqueous ocean beneath the icy crust of several moons. Capillarity embraces a family of physical processes occurring at the free surface of a liquid. These phenomena depend on the liquid properties and on the local planetary conditions. Capillarity may have important direct or indirect implications on the geoscientific and astrobiological points of view. In this paper, we discuss capillarity physics among solar system objects and expected consequences for planetary science.

 - **Abstract**
 Employing \emph{VI} images of NGC 2419 acquired over 17 years, light curves for most of the known variables in the field of the cluster are produced. A cluster membership analysis for about 3100 stars in the cluster field with proper motions from $Gaia$-DR3, revealed the presence of member stars as far as 140 pc from the cluster center and enabled the construction of a cleaner CMD free of field stars. It was found that RRab and RRc stars share the inter-order region in the instability strip, which is unusual for OoII clusters. Theoretical considerations confirm that Pop II cepheids are descendants of extreme ZAHB blue tail stars with very thin envelopes of about 10\% of the total mass. Member RR Lyrae stars were employed to calculate independent estimates of the mean cluster metallicity and distance; we found [Fe/H]$_{\rm UV}= -1.90 \pm 0.27$ and $D=86.3 \pm 5.0$ kpc from the RRab and [Fe/H]$_{\rm UV}= -1.88 \pm 0.30$ and $D=83.1 \pm 8.1$ kpc from the RRc light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w<-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w>-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L>1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $> 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second and final release of optical spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained during the first and second phases of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I and CSP-II). The newly released data consist of 148 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed in the course of the CSP-I, and 234 spectra of 127 SNe Ia obtained during the CSP-II. We also present 216 optical spectra of 46 historical SNe Ia, including 53 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed by the Cal\'an/Tololo Supernova Survey. We combine these observations with previously published CSP data and publicly-available spectra to compile a large sample of measurements of spectroscopic parameters at maximum light, consisting of pseudo-equivalent widths and expansion velocities of selected features, for 232 CSP and historical SNe Ia (including more than 1000 spectra). Finally, we review some of the strongest correlations between spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia. Specifically, we define two samples: one consisting of SNe Ia discovered by targeted searches (most of them CSP-I objects) and the other composed of SNe Ia discovered by untargeted searches, which includes most of the CSP-II objects. The analysed correlations are similar for both samples. We find a larger incidence of SNe Ia belonging to the Cool (CL)and Broad Line (BL) Branch subtypes among the events discovered by targeted searches, Shallow Silicon (SS) SNe Ia are present with similar frequencies in both samples, while Core Normal (CN) SNe Ia are more frequent in untargeted searches.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We analyze the X-ray image and flux variability of the knot HST-1 in the jet. Our analysis includes all 112 available \textit{Chandra} ACIS-S observations from 2000-2021, with a total exposure time of $\sim$887 ks. We use de-convolved images to study the brightness profile of the X-ray jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1. From 2003-2005 (which coincides with a bright flare from HST-1), we find a correlation between the flux of HST-1 and its offset from the core. In subsequent data, we find a steady increase in this offset, which implies a bulk superluminal motion for HST-1 of 6.6$\pm$0.9 c (2.0$\pm$0.3 pc yr$^{-1}$), in keeping with prior results. We discuss models for the flux-offset correlation that feature either two or four emission regions separated by \textbf{tens} of parsecs. We attribute these results to moving shocks in the jet, that allow us to measure the internal structure of the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The bound and resonance states along with corresponding autoionization widths for nitrogen sulphide (NS) molecule are determined using electron NS$^+$ cation scattering calculations. The calculations are performed for $^2{\Sigma}^+$, $^2{\Pi}$ and $^2\Delta$ total symmetries using the ab initio R-matrix method for both bound and continuum states. Calculations are performed on a grid of 106 points for internuclear separations between 1.32 and 3 $\AA$. The resonance states yield dissociative potential curves which, when considered together with their widths, provide input for models of different electron-cation collision processes including dissociative recombination, and rotational and vibrational excitation. Curves and couplings which will lead directly to dissociative recombination are identified.

 - **Abstract**
 The reactive collisions of the CH$^+$ molecular ion with electrons is studied in the framework of the multichannel quantum defect theory, taking into account the contribution of the core-excited Rydberg states. In addition to the $X^1\Sigma^+$ ground state of the ion, we also consider the contribution to the dynamics of the $a^3\Pi$ and $A^1\Pi$ excited states of CH$^+$. Our results - in the case of the dissociative recombination in good agreement with the storage ring measurements - rely on decisive improvements - complete account of the ionisation channels and accurate evaluation of the reaction matrix - of a previously used model.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are the least known particle in the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. They play a crucial role in cosmology, governing the universe's evolution and shaping the large-scale structures we observe today. In this chapter, we review crucial topics in neutrino cosmology, such as the neutrino decoupling process in the very early universe. We shall also revisit the current constraints on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom and the departures from its standard expectation of 3. Neutrino masses represent the very first departure from the Standard Model of elementary particle physics and may imply the existence of new unexplored mass generation mechanisms. Cosmology provides the tightest bound on the sum of neutrino masses, and we shall carefully present the nature of these constraints, both on the total mass of the neutrinos and on their precise spectrum. The ordering of the neutrino masses plays a major role in the design of future neutrino mass searches from laboratory experiments, such as neutrinoless double beta decay probes. Finally, we shall also present the futuristic perspectives for an eventual direct detection of cosmic, relic neutrinos.
#### Energy dependence of Quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting X-ray  pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an investigation of the energy dependence of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) exhibited by accreting X-ray pulsars using data from archival \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{NuSTAR}, \textit{RXTE}, and \textit{NICER} observations. In a search for the presence of QPOs in 99 \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations, we detected QPOs in eleven observations of five sources, viz., 4U 1626--67 (48 mHz), IGR J19294+1816 (30 mHz), V 0332+53 (2, 18 and 40 mHz), Cen X--3 (30 mHz), and XTE J1858+034 (180 mHz). A positive correlation of the QPO rms amplitude with energy is exhibited by 4U 1626--67, IGR J19294+1816, Cen X--3 and XTE J1858+034, while no energy dependence is observed in V 0332+53. We also analysed the energy spectrum to decouple thermal (soft-excess) from non-thermal emission and determine if the soft-excess has different QPO properties. We found no evidence for different QPO characteristics of the soft excess. The \textit{NuSTAR} observations of V 0332+53 during the Type-I outburst in 2016 show the presence of twin QPOs at 2.5 mHz and 18 mHz, while the \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations during the Type-II outburst in 2015 show a QPO at 40 mHz. We review the observed QPO properties in the context of QPOs found in other types of accreting sources and the models usually used to explain the QPOs in accreting X-ray pulsars.
#### Strength in numbers: A multiphase wind model with multiple cloud  populations

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic outflows have a multiphase nature making them challenging to model analytically. Many previous studies have tried to produce models that come closer to reality. In this work, we continue these efforts and describe the interaction of the hot wind fluid with multiple cold cloud populations, with their number density determined by different probability density functions. To do so, we introduced realistic cloud-wind interaction source terms and a time-varying cooling area. We find that the model reproduces well results from small-scale hydrodynamic simulations, but exhibits a general destructive behavior both for a single cloud population as well as multiple ones. We show that including multiple cloud populations can alter the evolution of the wind drastically. We also compare our model to observations and show that the differential acceleration of multiple clouds can lead to a non-negligible velocity `dispersion' relevant for down-the-barrel studies. Furthermore, we compute the emitted cooling surface brightness and find it generally too faint to explain observed Lyman-$\alpha$ halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Primitive asteroids with low albedos and red slopes in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) are found in both the Main Belt and the Jupiter Trojan clouds. In order to determine whether the VNIR spectral similarities of primitive Main Belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans are reflective of a true compositional similarity, we compare the mid-infrared silicate emission features of Main Belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids. Using archival data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS spectrograph and observations from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy's (SOFIA) FORCAST instrument, we analyze the 5-40 micron spectra of thirteen primitive Main Belt asteroids and compare them to those of Jupiter Trojans in the literature. We find that while many primitive asteroids in the Main Belt resemble their Trojan counterparts with strong spectral signatures of olivine-rich high-porosity silicate regoliths, we identify (368) Haidea as a spectrally distinctive asteroid that lacks strong evidence of olivine in its MIR spectrum. Differences in silicate compositions among D-type asteroids imply a diversity of origins for primitive asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) \cite{DESI:2024mwx} combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.
#### Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XIX. The long-period  solar-type system V454 Aurigae

 - **Abstract**
 V454 Aur is an eclipsing binary system containing two solar-type stars on an orbit of relatively long period (P = 27.02 d) and large eccentricity (e = 0.381). Eclipses were detected using data from the Hipparcos satellite, and a high-quality double-lined spectroscopic orbit has been presented by Griffin (2001). The NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed the system during eight sectors, capturing ten eclipses in their entirety. V454 Aur is unusual in that the primary star - the star eclipsed at the deeper minimum - is less massive, smaller \emph{and} cooler than its companion. This phenomenon can occur in certain configurations of eccentric orbits when the stars are closer together at the primary eclipse, causing a larger area to be eclipsed than at the secondary. We use the radial velocity measurements from Griffin and the light curves from TESS to determine the masses and radii of the component stars for the first time, finding masses of 1.034 +/- 0.006 Msun and 1.161 +/- 0.008 Msun, and radii of 0.979 +/- 0.003 Rsun and 1.211 +/- 0.003 Rsun. Our measurement of the distance to the system is consistent with that from the Gaia DR3 parallax. A detailed spectroscopic study to determine chemical abundances and more precise temperatures is encouraged. Finally, we present equations to derive the effective temperatures of the stars from the inferred temperature of the system as a whole, plus the ratio of the radii and either the surface brightness or light ratio of the stars.

 We carried out very deep VLT/SPHERE imaging polarimetry of the nearby system Eps Eri based on 38.5 hours of integration time with a 600 - 900 nm broadband filter to search for polarized scattered light from a planet or from circumstellar dust using AO, coronagraphy, high precision differential polarimetry, and angular differential imaging. We have improved several data reduction and post-processing techniques and also developed new ones to further increase the sensitivity of SPHERE/ZIMPOL. The data provide unprecedented contrast limits, but no significant detection of a point source or an extended signal from circumstellar dust. For each observing epoch, we obtained a point source contrast for the polarized intensity between $2\cdot 10^{-8}$ and $4\cdot 10^{-8}$ at the expected separation of the planet Eps Eri b of 1'' near quadrature phase. The polarimetric contrast limits are about six to 50 times better than the intensity limits because polarimetric imaging is much more efficient in speckle suppression. Combining the entire 14-month data set to the search for a planet moving on a Keplerian orbit with the K-Stacker software further improves the contrast limits by a factor of about two, to about $8 \cdot 10^{-9}$ at 1''. This would allow the detection of a planet with a radius of about 2.5 Jupiter radii. The surface brightness contrast limits achieved for the polarized intensity from an extended scattering region are about 15 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1'', or up to 3 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ deeper than previous limits. For Eps Eri, these limits exclude the presence of a narrow dust ring and they constrain the dust properties. This study shows that the polarimetric contrast limits for reflecting planets with SPHERE/ZIMPOL can be improved to a level $<10^{-8}$ simply by collecting more data over many nights and using the K-Stacker software.

 - **Abstract**
 The DARWIN/XLZD experiment is a next-generation dark matter detector with a multi-ten-ton liquid xenon time projection chamber at its core. Its principal goal will be to explore the experimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until interactions of astrophysical neutrinos will become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and the charge signals induced by particle interactions in the liquid xenon target will be observed by VUV-sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellent sensitivity to WIMPs with masses above $\sim$5\,GeV, such a detector with its large mass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also be sensitive to other rare interactions, and in particular also to bosonic dark matter candidates with masses at the keV-scale. We present the detector concept, discuss the main sources of backgrounds, the technological challenges and some of the ongoing detector design and R&D efforts, as well as the large-scale demonstrators. We end by discussing the sensitivity to particle dark matter interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of the spin of pulsars and the precision with which these spins can be determined, allows many unique tests of interest to physics and astrophysics. Perhaps the most challenging and revolutionary of these, is the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves. An increasing number of efforts to detect and study long-period gravitational waves by timing an array of pulsars have been ongoing for several decades and the field is moving ever closer to actual gravitational-wave science. In this review article, we summarise the state of this field by presenting the current sensitivity to gravitational waves and by reviewing recent progress along the multiple lines of research that are part of the continuous push towards greater sensitivity. We also briefly review some of the most recent efforts at astrophysical interpretation of the most recent GW estimates derived from pulsar timing.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\%$ to $10\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\beta$ by $23\%$ to $42\%$.

 More than 10,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with a diameter of 80 mm will be installed in multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules (mDOMs) of the IceCube Upgrade. These have been tested and pre-calibrated at two sites. A throughput of more than 1000 PMTs per week with both sites was achieved with a modular design of the testing facilities and highly automated testing procedures. The testing facilities can easily be adapted to other PMTs, such that they can, e.g., be re-used for testing the PMTs for IceCube-Gen2. Single photoelectron response, high voltage dependence, time resolution, prepulse, late pulse, afterpulse probabilities, and dark rates were measured for each PMT. We describe the design of the testing facilities, the testing procedures, and the results of the acceptance tests.
#### More luminous red novae that require jets

 - **Abstract**
 I study two intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) classified as luminous red novae (LRNe) and argue that their modeling with a common envelope evolution (CEE) without jets encounters challenges. LRNe are ILOTs powered by violent binary interaction. Although popular in the literature is to assume a CEE is the cause of LRNe, I here repeat an old claim that many LRNe are powered by grazing envelope evolution (GEE) events; the GEE might end in a CEE or a detached binary system. I find that the LRN AT 2021biy might have continued to experience mass ejection episodes after its eruption and, therefore, might not suffered a full CEE during the outburst. This adds to an earlier finding that a jet-less model does not account for some of its properties. I find that a suggested jet-less CEE model for the LRN AT 2019zhd does not reproduce its photosphere radius evolution. These results that challenge jet-less models of two LRNe strengthen a previous claim that jets play major roles in powering ILOTs and shaping their ejecta and that in many LRNe, the more compact companion launches the jets during a GEE.

 - **Abstract**
 We report metallicities for three $\sim$Gyr-old stars in the Milky Way nuclear star cluster (NSC) using high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We derive effective temperatures from a calibration with Sc line strength, which yields results in good agreement with other methods, and metallicities from spectral fits to Fe I lines. Our derived metallicities range from -1.2 < [Fe/H] < +0.5, a span of 1.7 dex. In addition we use isochrone projection to obtain masses of 1.6 to 4.3 M$_\odot$, and ages assuming single-star evolution. The oldest of these stars is 1.5 Gyr while the youngest and most metal-rich is only 100 Myr. The wide range in metallicity poses interesting questions concerning the chemical evolution and enrichment of the NSC and adds to the evidence for the presence of a young, metal-rich population in the NSC. We suggest that the candidate intermediate-age, metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.2) star may be best explained as a blue straggler from an underlying old population.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which has robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and main halo components in the chemo-dynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the halo component is isotropic and accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\sim85\%$ of the local non-disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar-mass relation and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, we find that $\sim25_{-15}^{+24}\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of non-disk components, we compute the velocity distribution of local DM. The modified heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM shifts to a lower speed and has a sharper peak compared to the SHM, which yields updated detection limits for the DM direct detection experiments. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted in the DM detection experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young ($\sim$ 1 Myrs) massive star formation. The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from $\sim$ 0.1 to 35 $M_\odot$. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) for $2.1\,$Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high resolution spectra which includes a high brilliance X-ray spectrum of $\theta^1$ Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and $400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in $\theta^1$ Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long term light curves spanning $\sim$20 years show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times $10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and high coronal temperatures of 10 to 90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of $\sim200\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, up to $500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-MS stars in a single star-forming region to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Understanding the connection between outflows, winds, accretion and disks in the inner protostellar regions is crucial for comprehending star and planet formation process. Aims. We aim to we explore the inner 300 au of the protostar IRAS 4A2 as part of the ALMA FAUST Large Program. Methods. We analysed the kinematical structures of SiO and CH$_3$OH emission with 50 au resolution. Results. The emission arises from three zones: i) a very compact and unresolved region ($<$50 au) dominated by the ice sublimation zone, at $\pm$1.5 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, traced by methanol; ii) an intermediate region (between 50 au and 150 au) traced by both SiO and CH$_3$OH, between 2 and 6 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, with an inverted velocity gradient (with respect to the large scale emission), whose origin is not clear; iii) an extended region ($>$150 au) traced by SiO, above 7 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, and dominated by the outflow. In the intermediate region we estimated a CH$_3$OH/SiO abundance ratio of about 120-400 and a SiO/H$_2$ abundance of 10$^{-8}$. We explored various possibilities to explain the origin of this region such as, rotating disk/inner envelope, jet on the plane of the sky/precessing, wide angle disk wind. Conclusions. We propose that CH$_3$OH and SiO in the inner 100 au probe the base of a wide-angle disk wind. The material accelerated in the wind crosses the plane of the sky, giving rise to the observed inverted velocity gradient, and sputtering the grain mantles and cores releasing CH$_3$OH and SiO. This is the first detection of a disk wind candidate in SiO, and the second ever in CH$_3$OH.
#### Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields

 - **Abstract**
 We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi> 3$. This is in agreement with the results of previous studies in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.
#### Investigating the correlations between IceCube high-energy neutrinos and  Fermi-LAT $γ$-ray observations. II

 - **Abstract**
 Given that gamma rays with energies larger than TeV are severely absorbed by background radiation fields, for many extragalactic sources, the GeV-TeV gamma-ray observations are the messengers that are closest in energy to the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube. Investigating whether there is a correlation between the gamma-ray and neutrino observations can help us identify high-energy neutrino sources and determine which sources are the main contributors to the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux of IceCube. In previous work, we have already studied the possible gamma-neutrino correlations by analyzing 10 years of IceCube muon-track data. In this work, we further investigate such correlations by employing the IceCube p-value sky map of the scan for point sources. We examine the spatial associations of hotspots in the neutrino sky map with various gamma-ray source samples: the third Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources (3FHL), LAT 14-year source catalog (4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC) and subsets of these samples. Among all the samples, the 3FHL sample shows a possible correlation with the neutrino hotspots, with a pre-trial p-value of $1.1\times10^{-4}$ ($\sim 3.9\,\sigma$). However, this is found to be caused by three already known neutrino sources/source candidates: NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, and PKS 1424+240. In order to validate our analysis procedure and to test the robustness of the previously claimed correlation between the 5BZCAT blazars and neutrino hotspots, we also consider 5BZCAT blazars in our correlation study. We find that the way in which mock sources are generated in the simulation used to derive the chance coincidence probability may have a large impact on the claimed correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi/GBM instrument is a vital source of detections of gamma-ray bursts and has an increasingly important role to play in understanding gravitational-wave transients. In both cases, its impact is increased by accurate positions with reliable uncertainties. We evaluate the RoboBA and BALROG algorithms for determining the position of gamma-ray bursts detected by the Fermi/GBM instrument. We construct a sample of 54 bursts with detections both by Swift/BAT and by Fermi/GBM. We then compare the positions predicted by RoboBA and BALROG with the positions measured by BAT, which we can assume to be the true position. We find that RoboBA and BALROG are similarly precise for bright bursts whose uncertainties are dominated by systematic errors, but RoboBA performs better for faint bursts whose uncertainties are dominated by statistical noise. We further find that the uncertainties in the positions predicted by RoboBA are consistent with the distribution of position errors, whereas BALROG seems to be underestimating the uncertainties by a factor of about two. Additionally, we consider the implications of these results for the follow-up of the optical afterglows of Fermi/GBM bursts. In particular, for the DDOTI wide-field imager we conclude that a single pointing is best. Our sample would allow a similar study to be carried out for other telescopes.
