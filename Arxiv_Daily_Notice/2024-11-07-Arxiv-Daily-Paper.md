 - **Abstract**
 Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) have historically been stigmatized and regarded as pseudoscience due to a general lack of robust evidence. Recently, however, the subject has gained interest among astronomers and the military. This review explores how astronomers can enhance our understanding of these enigmatic phenomena by focusing on empirical tests of specific hypotheses (e.g. the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations) rather than solely collecting and categorizing data. We compare the investigation of UAP to the process of calibration and interpretations of astronomical discoveries and propose a toy model involving a network of neuro-interface extraterrestrial probes to model exotic UAP. This model aids in predicting probe signatures and behaviour, improving detection methods, and addressing ethical concerns in UAP research.

 - **Abstract**
 The instruments at the focus of the Euclid space observatory offer superb, diffraction-limited imaging over an unprecedented (from space) wide field of view of 0.57 deg$^2$. This exquisite image quality has the potential to produce high-precision astrometry for point sources once the undersampling of Euclid's cameras is taken into account by means of accurate, effective point spread function (ePSF) modelling. We present a complex, detailed workflow to simultaneously solve for the geometric distortion (GD) and model the undersampled ePSFs of the Euclid detectors. Our procedure was successfully developed and tested with data from the Early Release Observations (ERO) programme focused on the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. Our final one-dimensional astrometric precision for a well-measured star just below saturation is 0.7 mas (0.007 pixel) for the Visible Instrument (VIS) and 3 mas (0.01 pixel) for the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). Finally, we present a specific scientific application of this high-precision astrometry: the combination of Euclid and Gaia data to compute proper motions and study the internal kinematics of NGC 6397. Future work, when more data become available, will allow for a better characterisation of the ePSFs and GD corrections that are derived here, along with assessment of their temporal stability, and their dependencies on the spectral energy distribution of the sources as seen through the wide-band filters of Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic study of SN 2024bch, a nearby (19.9 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) with prominent early high ionization emission lines. Optical spectra from 2.9 days after the estimated explosion reveal narrow lines of H I, He II, C IV, and N IV that disappear by day 6. High cadence photometry from the ground and TESS show that the SN brightened quickly and reached a peak M$_V \sim$ $-$17.8 mag within a week of explosion, and late-time photometry suggests a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.050 M$_{\odot}$. High-resolution spectra from day 8 and 43 trace the unshocked circumstellar medium (CSM) and indicate a wind velocity of 30--40 km s$^{-1}$, a value consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Comparisons between models and the early spectra suggest a pre-SN mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which is too high to be explained by quiescent mass loss from RSGs, but is consistent with some recent measurements of similar SNe. Persistent blueshifted H I and [O I] emission lines seen in the optical and NIR spectra could be produced by asymmetries in the SN ejecta, while the multi-component H$\alpha$ may indicate continued interaction with an asymmetric CSM well into the nebular phase. SN 2024bch provides another clue to the complex environments and mass-loss histories around massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroastrometry, which measures wavelength-dependent shifts in the center of light, is well-suited for studying objects whose morphology changes with wavelength at very high angular resolutions. Photonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometers have potential to enable measurement of spectroastrometric signals because the relative intensities between the PL output SMFs contain spatial information on the input scene. In order to use PL output spectra for spectroastrometric measurements, it is important to understand the wavelength-dependent behaviors of PL outputs and develop methods to calibrate the effects of time-varying wavefront errors in ground-based observations. We present experimental characterizations of the 3-port PL on the SCExAO testbed at the Subaru Telescope. We develop spectral response models of the PL and verify the behaviors with lab experiments. We find sinusoidal behavior of astrometric sensitivity of the 3-port PL as a function of wavelength, as expected from numerical simulations. Furthermore, we compare experimental and numerically simulated coupling maps and discuss their potential use for offsetting pointing errors. We then present a method of building PL spectral response models (solving for the transfer matrices as a function of wavelength) using coupling maps, which can be used for further calibration strategies.

          The Dog that Didn't Bark: Non-Variable Field Stars in the RR Lyrae Instability Strip

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are easy to identify thanks to their large photometric variation and short periods. All stars in the RRL instability strip are pulsators is often a hidden assumption in most stellar population studies using RRLs. Non-variable stars in the instability strip have been discovered for Cepheids and $\delta$ Scuti, and in this paper, we report the discovery of non-variable filed stars in the RRL instability strip. Using a high-quality sample selected from Gaia DR3, we find at least 15% of the stars in the empirical instability strip where the variable fraction is > 0.7 have near-zero photometric variations or variations that are significantly smaller than typical RRLs. The non-variable stars are mostly bright and close by, on cold orbits in the Galactic plane. Metallicity from Gaia BP/RP spectra suggests the non-variable stars have an average metallicity is ~ -0.5 dex, with a peak at 0. The discovery of these non-variable stars in the RRL instability strip challenges our understanding of stellar physics and further investigation is needed to understand the origin of these stars.

          HD 119130 b is not an "ultra-dense" sub-Neptune

 - **Abstract**
 We present a revised mass measurement for HD 119130 b (aka K2-292 b), a transiting planet ($P = 17$ days, $R_\mathrm{p} = 2.63^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\mathrm{\oplus}$) orbiting a chromospherically inactive G dwarf, previously thought to be one of the densest sub-Neptunes known. Our follow-up Doppler observations with HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES reveal that HD 119130 b is, in fact, nearly one-third as massive as originally suggested by its initial confirmation paper. Our revised analysis finds $M_\mathrm{p} = 8.8 \pm 3.2$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$ ($M_\mathrm{p} < 15.4$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$ at 98\% confidence) compared to the previously reported $M_\mathrm{p} = 24.5 \pm 4.4$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$. While the true cause of the original mass measurement's inaccuracy remains uncertain, we present the plausible explanation that the planet's radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude was inflated due to constructive interference with a second, untreated sinusoidal signal in the data (possibly rotational modulation from the star). HD 119130 b illustrates the complexities of interpreting the RV orbits of small transiting planets. While RV mass measurements of such planets may be precise, they are not necessarily guaranteed to be accurate. This system serves as a cautionary tale as observers and theorists alike look to the exoplanet mass-radius diagram for insights into the physics of small planet formation.

          The impact of observing cadence and undetected companions on the accuracy of planet mass measurements from radial velocity monitoring

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct experiments on both real and synthetic radial velocity (RV) data to quantify the impact that observing cadence, the number of RV observations, and undetected companions all have on the accuracy of small planet mass measurements. We run resampling experiments on four systems with small transiting planets and substantial public data from HIRES in order to explore how degrading observing cadence and the number of RVs affects the planets' mass measurement relative to a baseline value. From these experiments, we recommend that observers obtain 2--3 RVs per orbit of the inner-most planet and acquire at minimum 40 RVs. Following these guidelines, we then conduct simulations using synthetic RVs to explore the impact of undetected companions and untreated red noise on the masses of planets with known orbits. While undetected companions generally do not bias the masses of known planets, in some cases, when coupled with an inadequate observing baseline, they can cause the mass of an inner transiting planet to be systematically overestimated on average.

          On the local formation of the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of seven ~Earth-mass planets, orbiting the 0.09 solar mass M-Dwarf TRAPPIST-1 captivated the public and sparked a proliferation of investigations into the system's origins. Among other properties, the resonant architecture of the planets has been interpreted to imply that orbital migration played a dominant role in the system's early formation. If correct, this hypothesis could imply that all of the seven worlds formed far from the star, and might harbor enhanced inventories of volatile elements. However, multiple factors also contradict this interpretation. In particular, the planets' apparent rocky compositions and non-hierarchical mass distribution might evidence them having formed closer to their current orbital locations. In this paper, we investigate the latter possibility with over 600 accretion simulations that model the effects of collisional fragmentation. In addition to producing multiple TRAPPIST-like configurations, we experiment with a number of different models for tracking the evolution of the planets' volatile contents and bulk iron-to-silicate ratios. We conclude that a trend in bulk iron contents is the more likely explanation for the observed radial trend of decreasing uncompressed densities in the real system. Given the degree of radial mixing that occurs in our simulations, in most cases we find that all seven planets finish with similar volatile contents. Another confounding quality of the TRAPPIST-1 system is the fact that the innermost planets are not in first-order resonances with one-another. By applying a tidal migration model to our most promising accretion model results, we demonstrate cases where higher-order resonances are populated.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the energy spectral density properties of Gravitational waves from Galactic binary populations in the~\text{mHz} band targeted by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission. Our analysis is based on combining BPASS with a Milky Way analogue galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations and the GWs these populations emit. Our investigation compares different functional forms of gravitational wave (GW) ESDs, namely the single power-law, broken power-law, and single-peak models, revealing disparities within and among Galactic binary populations. We estimate the ESDs for six different Galactic binary populations and the ESD of the total Galactic binary population for LISA. Employing a single power-law model, we predict a total Galactic binary GW signal amplitude $\alpha$ = $2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{-8}$ and a slope $\beta$ = $-2.64 ^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ and the ESD $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW}$ = $1.1 ^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^{-9}$ at 3~\text{mHz}. For the Galactic WDB binary GW signal $\alpha = 1^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \times 10^{-10}$, $\beta = -1.56 ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ and $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW} = 18 ^{+1}_{-1} \times 10^{-12}$. Our analysis underscores the importance of accurate noise parameter estimation and highlights the complexities of modelling realistic observations, prompting future exploration into more flexible models.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling of large populations of binary stellar systems is an intergral part of a many areas of astrophysics, from radio pulsars and supernovae to X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational-wave mergers. Binary population synthesis codes that employ self-consistently the most advanced physics treatment available for stellar interiors and their evolution and are at the same time computationally tractable have started to emerge only recently. One element that is still missing from these codes is the ability to generate the complete time evolution of binaries with arbitrary initial conditions using pre-computed three-dimensional grids of binary sequences. Here we present a highly interpretable method, from binary evolution track interpolation. Our method implements simulation generation from irregularly sampled time series. Our results indicate that this method is appropriate for applications within binary population synthesis and computational astrophysics with time-dependent simulations in general. Furthermore we point out and offer solutions to the difficulty surrounding evaluating performance of signals exhibiting extreme morphologies akin to discontinuities.

          Dinosaur in a Haystack : X-ray View of the Entrails of SN 2023ixf and the Radio Afterglow of Its Interaction with the Medium Spawned by the Progenitor Star (Paper 1)

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from our extensive hard-to-soft X-ray (NuSTAR, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton, Chandra) and meter-to-mm wave radio (GMRT, VLA, NOEMA) monitoring campaign of the very nearby (d $=6.9$ Mpc) Type II SN2023ixf spanning $\approx$ 4--165 d post-explosion. This unprecedented dataset enables inferences on the explosion's circumstellar medium (CSM) density and geometry. Specifically, we find that the luminous X-ray emission is well modeled by thermal free-free radiation from the forward shock with rapidly decreasing photo-electric absorption with time. The radio spectrum is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the same shock, and the NOEMA detection of high-frequency radio emission may indicate a new component consistent with the secondary origin. Similar to the X-rays, the level of free-free absorption affecting the radio spectrum rapidly decreases with time as a consequence of the shock propagation into the dense CSM. While the X-ray and the radio modeling independently support the presence of a dense medium corresponding to an \emph{effective} mass-loss rate $\dot{M} \approx 10^{-4}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at $R = (0.4-14) \times 10^{15}$ (for $v_{\rm w}=\rm 25 \,km\,s^{-1}$), our study points at a complex CSM density structure with asymmetries and clumps. The inferred densities are $\approx$10--100 times those of typical red supergiants, indicating an extreme mass-loss phase of the progenitor in the $\approx$200 years preceding core collapse, which leads to the most X-ray luminous Type II SN and the one with the most delayed emergence of radio emission. These results add to the picture of the complex mass-loss history of massive stars on the verge of collapse and demonstrate the need for panchromatic campaigns to fully map their intricate environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The eROSITA instrument on board Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma has completed four scans of the X-ray sky, leading to the detection of almost one million X-ray sources in eRASS1 only, including multiple new X-ray binary candidates. We report on analysis of the X-ray binary 1eRASS J085039.9-421151, using a ~55\,ks long NuSTAR observation, following its detection in each eROSITA scan. Analysis of the eROSITA and NuSTAR X-ray spectra in combination with X-shooter data of the optical counterpart provide evidence of an X-ray binary with a red supergiant (RSG) companion, confirming previous results, although we determine a cooler spectral type of M2-3, owing to the presence of TiO bands in the optical and near infrared spectra. The X-ray spectrum is well-described by an absorbed power law with a high energy cutoff typically applied for accreting high mass X-ray binaries. In addition, we detect a strong fluorescent neutral iron line with an equivalent width of ~700\,eV and an absorption edge, the latter indicating strong absorption by a partial covering component. It is unclear if the partial absorber is ionised. There is no significant evidence of a cyclotron resonant scattering feature. We do not detect any pulsations in the NuSTAR lightcurves, possibly on account of a large spin period that goes undetected due to insufficient statistics at low frequencies or potentially large absorption that causes pulsations to be smeared out. Even so, the low persistent luminosity, the spectral parameters observed (photon index, $\Gamma<1.0$), and the minuscule likelihood of detection of RSG-black hole systems, suggest that the compact object is a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate time series analysis is essential for studying variable astronomical sources, where detecting periodicities and characterizing power spectral density (PSD) are crucial. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram, commonly used in astronomy for analyzing unevenly sampled time series data, often suffers from noise introduced by irregular sampling. This paper presents a new high-pass filter (HPF) periodogram, a novel implementation designed to mitigate this sampling-induced noise. By applying a frequency-dependent high-pass filter before computing the periodogram, the HPF method enhances the precision of PSD estimates and periodicity detection across a wide range of signal characteristics. Simulations and comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate that the HPF periodogram improves accuracy and reliability under challenging sampling conditions, making it a valuable complementary tool for more robust time series analysis in astronomy and other fields dealing with unevenly sampled data.

 - **Abstract**
 Dispersion measures (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the density of electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM) along their lines-of-sight, including the average density versus distance to the source and its variations in direction. While previous study focused on low-redshift, FRBs are potentially detectable out to high redshift, where their DMs can, in principle, probe the epoch of reionization (EOR) and its patchiness. We present the first predictions from large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of fully-coupled galaxy formation and reionization, using Cosmic Dawn (``CoDa")~II to model the density and ionization fields of the universe down to redshifts through the end of the EOR at $z_{re}\approx6.1$. Combining this with an N-body simulation CoDa~II--Dark Matter of the fully-ionized epoch from the EOR to the present, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of FRB DMs as functions of their source redshift. The mean and standard deviation of DM increase with redshift, reaching a plateau by $z(x_{HII}\lesssim0.25)\gtrsim8$, i.e. well above $z_{re}$. The mean-DM asymptote $\mathcal{DM}_{max} \approx 5900~\mathrm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$ reflects the end of the EOR and its duration. The standard deviation there is $\sigma_{DM, max}\approx497 ~\mathrm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$, reflecting inhomogeneities of both patchy reionization and density. Inhomogeneities in ionization during the EOR contribute $\mathcal{O}(1$ per cent) of this value of $\sigma_{DM,max}$ from FRBs at redshifts $z\gtrsim 8$. Current estimates of FRB rates suggest this may be detectable within a few years of observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Open clusters (OCs) are valuable probes of stellar population characteristics. Their age and metallicity provide insights into the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. By studying the metallicity of OCs, we can explore the spatial distribution of composition across the Galaxy and understand stellar birth radii through chemical tagging. However, inferring the original positions of OCs remains a challenge. Aims. This study investigates the distribution of metallicity in the solar neighborhood using data from Gaia DR3 and LAMOST spectra. By measuring accurate ages and metallicities, we aim to derive birth radii and understand stellar migration patterns. Methods. We selected 1131 OCs within 3 kpc of the Sun from Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR8 low-resolution spectra (R=1800). To correct the LAMOST data, we incorporated high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR3 (R=28000) using an artificial neural network. The average metallicity of the OCs was derived from reliable [Fe/H] values of their members. We examined the metallicity distribution across the Galaxy and calculated birth radii based on age and metallicity. Results. The correction method reduces the systematic offset in LAMOST data. We found a metallicity gradient as a function of Galactocentric distance and guiding radii. Comparisons with chemo-dynamic simulations show that observed metallicity values are slightly lower than predicted when uncertainties are ignored, but the metallicity gradients align with previous studies. We also inferred that many OCs near the Sun likely originated from the outer Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The lensing convergence field describing the weak lensing effect of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is expected to be subject to mild deviations from Gaussianity. We perform a suite of full-sky lensing simulations using ray tracing through multiple lens planes - generated by combining $N$-body simulations on smaller scales and low-to-intermediate redshifts with realisations of Gaussian random fields on large scales and at high redshifts. We quantify the non-Gaussianity of the resulting convergence fields in terms of a set of skewness and kurtosis parameters and show that the non-Gaussian information in these maps can be used to constrain cosmological parameters such as the cold dark matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{c} h^2$ or the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbations $A_\mathrm{s}$. We forecast that for future CMB lensing observations, combining the non-Gaussian parameters with the Gaussian information can increase constraining power on $(\Omega_\mathrm{c} h^2, A_\mathrm{s})$ by $30$-$40\%$ compared to constraints from Gaussian observables alone. We make the simulation code for the full-sky lensing simulation available for download from GitHub.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Burst (FRB) is an extremely energetic cosmic phenomenon of short duration. Discovered only recently and with yet unknown origin, FRBs have already started to play a significant role in studying the distribution and evolution of matter in the universe. FRBs can only be observed through radio telescopes, which produce petabytes of data, rendering the search for FRB a challenging task. Traditional techniques are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and generally biased against weak signals. Various machine learning algorithms have been developed and employed, which all require substantial data sets. We here introduce the FAST dataset for Fast Radio bursts EXploration (FAST-FREX), built upon the observations obtained by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our dataset comprises 600 positive samples of observed FRB signals from three sources and 1000 negative samples of noise and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Furthermore, we provide a machine learning algorithm, Radio Single-Pulse Detection Algorithm Based on Visual Morphological Features (RaSPDAM), with significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy for FRB search. We also employed the benchmark comparison between conventional single-pulse search softwares, namely PRESTO and Heimdall, and RaSPDAM. Future machine learning algorithms can use this as a reference point to measure their performance and help the potential improvements.

 - **Abstract**
 The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project has discovered the most repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources of any telescope. However, most of the physical conclusions derived from this sample are based on data with a time resolution of $\sim$1 ms. In this work, we present for the first time a morphological analysis of the raw voltage data for 118 bursts from 32 of CHIME/FRB's repeating sources. We do not find any significant correlations amongst fluence, dispersion measure (DM), burst rate, and burst duration. Performing the first large-scale morphological comparison at timescales down to microseconds between our repeating sources and 125 non-repeating FRBs, we find that repeaters are narrower in frequency and broader in duration than non-repeaters, supporting previous findings. However, we find that the duration-normalized sub-burst widths of the two populations are consistent, possibly suggesting a shared physical emission mechanism. Additionally, we find that the spectral fluences of the two are consistent. When combined with the larger bandwidths and previously found larger DMs of non-repeaters, this suggests that non-repeaters may have higher intrinsic specific energies than repeating FRBs. We do not find any consistent increase or decrease in the DM ($\lessapprox 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) and scattering timescales ($\lessapprox 2$ ms yr$^{-1}$) of our sources over $\sim2-4$ year periods.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) offer an independent method for searching for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), whose wavelike nature induces periodic oscillations in the arrival times of radio pulses. In addition to this gravitational effect, the direct coupling between ULDM and ordinary matter results in pulsar spin fluctuations and reference clock shifts, leading to observable effects in PTAs. The second data release from the European PTA (EPTA) indicates that ULDM cannot account for all dark matter in the mass range $m_{\phi} \in [10^{-24.0}, 10^{-23.3}] \text{ eV}$ based solely on gravitational effects. In this work, we derive constraints on the coupling coefficients by considering both gravitational and coupling effects. Our results demonstrate that EPTA provides stronger constraints on these couplings than previous PTA experiments, and it establishes similar or even tighter constraints compared to other precise experiments, such as atomic clock experiments.

 Spectral line observations are an indispensable tool to remotely probe the physical and chemical conditions throughout the universe. Modelling their behaviour is a computational challenge that requires dedicated software. In this paper, we present the first long-term stable release of Magritte, an open-source software library for line radiative transfer. First, we establish its necessity with two applications. Then, we introduce the overall design strategy and the application/programmer interface (API). Finally, we present three key improvements over previous versions: (1) an improved re-meshing algorithm to efficiently coarsen the spatial discretisation of a model; (2) a variation on Ng-acceleration, a popular acceleration-of-convergence method for non-LTE line transfer; and, (3) a semi-analytic approximation for line optical depths in the presence of large velocity gradients.

 - **Abstract**
 The atomic and molecular compounds of cometary ices serve as valuable knowledge into the chemical and physical properties of the outer solar nebula, where comets are formed. From the cometary atmospheres, the atoms and gas-phase molecules arise mainly in three ways: (i) the outgassing from the nucleus, (ii) the photochemical process, and (iii) the sublimation of icy grains from the nucleus. In this paper, we present the radio and millimeter wavelength observation results of Oort cloud non-periodic comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) band L and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6. We do not detect continuum emissions and an emission line of atomic hydrogen (HI) at rest frequency 1420 MHz from this comet using the GMRT. Based on ALMA observations, we detect the dust continuum emission and rotational emission lines of methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) from comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF). From the dust continuum emission, the activity of dust production (Af$\rho$) of comet ZTF is 2280$\pm$50 cm. Based on LTE spectral modelling, the column density and excitation temperature of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) are (4.50$\pm$0.25)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 70$\pm$3 K. The integrated emission maps show that CH$_{3}$OH was emitted from the coma region of the comet. The production rate of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is (7.32$\pm$0.64)$\times$10$^{26}$ molecules s$^{-1}$. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with respect to H$_{2}$O in the coma of the comet is 1.52%. We also compare our derived abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with the existence modelled value, and we see the observed and modelled values are nearly similar. We claim that CH$_{3}$OH is formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of formaldehyde (H$_{2}$CO) on the grain surface of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF).

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel approach to constrain the $\mu$- and y- distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the COBE/FIRAS data. The analysis draws from the concept of blackbody radiation inversion (BRI), a mathematical technique typically used to determine the temperature distribution from a radiated power spectrum. We study the deviations from the ideal blackbody spectrum or the spectral distortions by incorporating first a non-zero chemical potential $\mu$ via the Bose-Einstein distribution and then the Compton parameter $y$ while keeping the monopole temperature constant. We infer the results as probability distribution functions on these distortions. Finally, we derive $\mu = (8.913 \pm 0.736) \times 10^{-5}$ and $y = (1.532 \pm 0.092) \times 10^{-5}$ at a $68\%$ confidence interval. The results are consistent with prior values and provide tighter constraints on the CMB spectral distortion and synergies of the primordial Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we address whether the age--metallicity relation (AMR) deviates from the expected trend of metallicity increasing smoothly with age. We also show the presence (or absence) of two populations, as recently claimed using a relatively small dataset. Moreover, we studied the Milky Way thin disk's chemical evolution using solar twins, including the effect of radial migration and accretion events. In particular, we exploited high-resolution spectroscopy of a large sample of solar twins in tandem with an accurate age determination to investigate the Milky Way thin disk age--metallicity relationship. Additionally, we derived the stars' birth radius and studied the chemical evolution of the thin disk. We discovered that statistical and selection biases can lead to a misinterpretation of the observational data. An accurate accounting of all the uncertainties led us to detect no separation in the AMR into different populations for solar twins around the Sun (-0.3 < [Fe/H] < 0.3 dex). This lead us to the conclusion that the thin disk was formed relatively smoothly. For the main scenario of the Milky Way thin disk formation, we suggest that the main mechanism for reaching today's chemical composition around the Sun is radial migration with the possible contribution of well-known accretion events such as Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES) and Sagittarius (Sgr).

 - **Abstract**
 While the observation of the 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization is an instrumental challenge, the interpretation of a prospective detection is still open to questions regarding the modelling of the signal and the Bayesian inference techniques that bridge the gap between theory and observations. To address some of these questions, we present Loreli II, a database of nearly 10 000 simulations of the 21 cm signal run with the Licorice 3D radiative transfer code. With Loreli II, we explore a 5-dimensional astrophysical parameter space where star formation, X-ray emissions, and UV emissions are varied. We then use this database to train neural networks and perform Bayesian inference on 21 cm power spectra affected by thermal noise at the level of 100 hours of observation with the Square Kilometer Array. We study and compare three inference techniques : an emulator of the power spectrum, a Neural Density Estimator that fits the implicit likelihood of the model, and a Bayesian Neural Network that directly fits the posterior distribution. We measure the performances of each method by comparing them on a statistically representative set of inferences, notably using the principles of Simulation-Based Calibration. We report errors on the 1-D marginalized posteriors (biases and over/under confidence) below $15 \%$ of the standard deviation for the emulator and below $25 \%$ for the other methods. We conclude that at our noise level and our sampling density of the parameter space, an explicit Gaussian likelihood is sufficient. This may not be the case at lower noise level or if a denser sampling is used to reach higher accuracy. We then apply the emulator method to recent HERA upper limits and report weak constraints on the X-ray emissivity parameter of our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Evolved cool stars have three distinct evolutionary status: shell Hydrogen-burning (RGB), core Helium and shell Hydrogen burning (RC), and double shell burning (AGB). Asteroseismology can distinguish between the RC and the other status, but distinguishing RGB and AGB has been difficult seismically and spectroscopically. The precise boundaries of different status in the HR diagram have also been difficult to establish. In this article, we present a comprehensive catalog of asteroseismic evolutionary status, RGB and RC, for evolved red giants in the Kepler field. We carefully examine boundary cases to define the lower edge of the RC phase in radius and surface gravity. We also test different published asteroseisemic methods claiming to distinguish AGB and RGB stars against a sample where AGB candidates were selected using a spectrocopic identification method. We used six different seismic techniques to distinguish RC and RGB stars, and tested two proposed methods for distinguishing AGB and RGB stars. These status were compared with those inferred from spectroscopy. We present consensus evolutionary status for 18,784 stars out of the 30,337 red giants present in the Kepler data, including 11,516 stars with APOGEE spectra available. The agreement between seismic and spectroscopic classification is excellent for distinguishing RC stars, agreeing at the 94% level. Most disagreements can be traced to uncertainties in spectroscopic parameters, but some are caused by blends with background stars. We find a sharp lower boundary in surface gravity at log(g) = 2.99+/-0.01 for the RC and discuss the implications. We demonstrate that asteroseismic tools for distinguishing AGB and RGB stars are consistent with spectroscopic evolutionary status at near the RC but that the agreement between the different methods decreases rapidly as the star evolves.

 - **Abstract**
 The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.

 Solar and stellar externally occulted coronagraphs share similar concepts, but are actually very different because of geometric characteristics. Solar occulters were first developed with a simple geometric model of diffraction perpendicular to the occulter edges. We apply this mere approach to starshades, and introduce a simple shifted circular integral of the occulter which allows to illustrate the influence of the number of petals on the extent of the deep central dark zone. We illustrate the reasons for the presence of an internal coronagraph in the solar case and its absence in the exoplanet case.

 We present the first broadband near- to mid-infrared (3-12 microns) transmission spectrum of the highly-irradiated (T_eq = 981 K) M dwarf rocky planet L 168-9 b (TOI-134 b) observed with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments aboard JWST. We measure the near-infrared transit depths to a combined median precision of 20 ppm across the three visits in 54 spectroscopic channels with uniform widths of 60 pixels (~0.2 microns wide; R~100), and the mid-infrared transit depths to 61 ppm median precision in 48 wavelength bins (~0.15 microns wide; R~50). We compare the transmission spectrum of L 168-9 b to a grid of 1D thermochemical equilibrium forward models, and rule out atmospheric metallicities of less than 100x solar (mean molecular weights <4 g mol$^{-1}$) to 3-sigma confidence assuming high surface pressure (>1 bar), cloudless atmospheres. Based on photoevaporation models for L 168-9 b with initial atmospheric mass fractions ranging from 2-100%, we find that this planet could not have retained a primordial H/He atmosphere beyond the first 200 Myr of its lifetime. Follow-up MIRI eclipse observations at 15 microns could make it possible to confidently identify a CO2-dominated atmosphere on this planet if one exists.

 - **Abstract**
 A next-generation medium-energy (100 keV to 100 MeV) gamma-ray observatory will greatly enhance the identification and characterization of multimessenger sources in the coming decade. Coupling gamma-ray spectroscopy, imaging, and polarization to neutrino and gravitational wave detections will develop our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena including compact object mergers, supernovae remnants, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. An observatory operating in the MeV energy regime requires technologies that are capable of measuring Compton scattered photons and photons interacting via pair production. AstroPix is a monolithic high voltage CMOS active pixel sensor which enables future gamma-ray telescopes in this energy range. AstroPix's design is iterating towards low-power (~1.5 mW/cm$^{2}$), high spatial (500 microns pixel pitch) and spectral (<5 keV at 122 keV) tracking of photon and charged particle interactions. Stacking planar arrays of AstroPix sensors in three dimensions creates an instrument capable of reconstructing the trajectories and energies of incident gamma rays over large fields of view. A prototype multi-layered AstroPix instrument, called the AstroPix Sounding rocket Technology dEmonstration Payload (A-STEP), will test three layers of AstroPix quad chips in a suborbital rocket flight. These quad chips (2x2 joined AstroPix sensors) form the 4x4 cm$^{2}$ building block of future large area AstroPix instruments, such as ComPair-2 and AMEGO-X. This payload will be the first demonstration of AstroPix detectors operated in a space environment and will demonstrate the technology's readiness for future astrophysical and nuclear physics applications. In this work, we overview the design and state of development of the ASTEP payload.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel method for mapping spectral features of the Moon using machine learning-based clustering of hyperspectral data from the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) imaging spectrometer. The method uses a convolutional variational autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data and extract features of the spectra. Then, a k-means algorithm is applied to cluster the latent variables into five distinct groups, corresponding to dominant spectral features, which are related to the mineral composition of the Moon's surface. The resulting global spectral cluster map shows the distribution of the five clusters on the Moon, which consist of a mixture of, among others, plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and Fe-bearing minerals across the Moon's surface. The clusters are compared to the mineral maps from the Kaguya mission, which showed that the locations of the clusters overlap with the locations of high wt% of minerals such as plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of unbiased unsupervised learning for lunar mineral exploration and provides a comprehensive analysis of lunar mineralogy.

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionization is a landmark in structure formation and galaxy evolution. How it happened is still not clear, especially regarding which population of objects was responsible for contributing the bulk of ionizing photons toward this process. Doubly-peaked Lyman-Alpha profiles in this epoch are of particular interest since they hold information about the escape of ionizing radiation and the environment surrounding the source. We wish to understand the escape mechanisms of ionizing radiation in Lyman-Alpha emitters during this time and the origin of a doubly-peaked Lyman-alpha profile as well as estimating the size of a potential ionized bubble. Using radiative transfer models, we fit the line profile of a bright Lyman-Alpha emitter at $z\sim 6.9$ using various gas geometries. The line modeling reveals significant radiation escape from this system. While the studied source reveals significant escape ($f_{esc}$(LyA) $\sim0.8$ as predicted by the best fitting radiative transfer model) and appears to inhabit an ionized bubble of radius $R_{b}\approx 0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}\,pMpc\left(\frac{t_{\rm age}}{10^{8}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$.Radiative transfer modeling predicts the line to be completely redwards of the systemic redshift. We suggest the line morphology is produced by inflows, multiple components emitting Ly$\alpha$, or by an absorbing component in the red wing. We propose that CDFS-1's profile holds two red peaks produced by winds within the system. Its high $f_{esc}$(Lya) and the low-velocity offset from the systemic redshift suggest that the source is an active ionizing agent. Future observations will reveal whether a peak is present bluewards of the systemic redshift or if multiple components produce the profile.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity gradient noise in gravitational wave detectors originates from density fluctuations in the adjacency of the interferometer mirrors. At the Einstein Telescope, this noise source is expected to be dominant for low frequencies. Its impact is proposed to be reduced with the help of an array of seismometers that will be placed around the interferometer endpoints. We reformulate and implement the problem of finding the optimal seismometer positions in a differentiable way. We then explore the use of first-order gradient-based optimization for the design of the seismometer array for 1 Hz and 10 Hz and compare its performance and computational cost to two metaheuristic algorithms. For 1 Hz, we introduce a constraint term to prevent unphysical optimization results in the gradient-based method. In general, we find that it is an efficient strategy to initialize the gradient-based optimizer with a fast metaheuristic algorithm. For a small number of seismometers, this strategy results in approximately the same noise reduction as with the metaheuristics. For larger numbers of seismometers, gradient-based optimization outperforms the two metaheuristics by a factor of 2.25 for the faster of the two and a factor of 1.4 for the other one, which is significantly outperformed by gradient-based optimization in terms of computational efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant challenge in the study of transient astrophysical phenomena is the identification of bogus events, with human-made Earth-orbiting satellites and debris remain a key contaminant. Existing pipelines effectively identify satellite trails but can miss more complex signatures, such as collections of dots known as satellite glints. In the Rubin Observatory era, the scale of the operations will increase tenfold with respect to its precursor, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), requiring crucial improvements in classification purity, data compression, pipeline speed and more. We explore the use of the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on difference images as a tool to improve satellite detection algorithms. Adopting the single-stamp classification model from the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker as a baseline, we adapt its architecture to receive a cutout of the FFT of the difference image, in addition to the three (science, reference, difference) ZTF image cutouts (hereafter stamps). We study different stamp sizes and resolutions for these four channels, aiming to assess the benefit of including the FFT image, especially in scenarios with data compression and processing speed requirements (e.g., for surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time). The inclusion of the FFT improved satellite detection accuracy, with the most notable increase observed in the model with the smallest field of view (16''), where accuracy rose from 66.9% to 79.7% (a statistically significant improvement of ~13% with a 95% confidence interval of 7.8% to 17.8%). This result demonstrates the effectiveness of FFT in compressing relevant information and extracting features that characterize satellite signatures in larger difference images. We show how FFTs can be leveraged to cull satellite and space debris signatures from alert streams.

 - **Abstract**
 Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and, despite its proximity, this binary system still imposes intriguing questions about its current characteristics and past evolution. Bond et. al. (arXiv:1703.10625) published decades of astrometric measurements of the Sirius system, determining the dynamical masses for Sirius A and B, and the orbital period. We have used these determinations, combined with photometric determinations for luminosity and spectroscopic determinations of effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and metallicity, to model the evolution of the Sirius system using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). We have constructed a model grid calculated especially for this system and were able to obtain, for Sirius B, a progenitor mass of $6.0 \pm 0.6 M_{\odot}$, yielding a white dwarf mass of $1.015 \pm 0.189 M_{\odot}$. Our best determination for age of the system is $203.6 \pm 45$ Myr with a metallicity of 0.0124. We have compared our best fit models with the ones computed using TYCHO, YREC, and PARSEC, establishing external uncertainties. Our results are consistent with the observations and support a non-interacting past.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, EXO 0748--676, recently returned to outburst after a $\sim$ 16 year-long quiescence. Since its return, there has been a global effort to capture the previously unseen rise of the source and to understand its somewhat early return to outburst, as it is typical for a source to spend longer in quiescence than in outburst. Here, we report on the simultaneous optical and X-ray detection of a type I X-ray burst, captured by XMM-Newton during a DDT observation on 30th June 2024. The data show 3 X-ray eclipses consistent with the known ephemeris and one type I X-ray burst at 60492.309 MJD. The X-ray burst is reprocessed into the optical band and captured by XMM-Newton's Optical Monitor during a 4399 s exposure with the B filter in image + fast mode. We determine that the optical peak lags the X-ray peak by 4.46 $\pm$ 1.71s. The optical and X-ray rise times are similar, but the optical decay timescale is shorter than the X-ray decay timescale. The reprocessing site is likely within a few light seconds of the X-ray emitting region, so the companion star, accretion disc and ablated material are all plausible.

          Optical evolution of AT 2024wpp: the high-velocity outflows in Cow-like transients are consistent with high spherical symmetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of optical data of a bright and extremely-rapidly evolving transient, AT2024wpp, whose properties are similar to the enigmatic AT2018cow (aka the Cow). AT2024wpp rose to a peak brightness of c=-21.9mag in 4.3d and remained above the half-maximum brightness for only 6.7d. The blackbody fits to the multi-band photometry show that the event remained persistently hot (T>20000K) with a rapidly receding photosphere (v~11500km/s) until the end of the photometric dataset at +16.1d post-discovery. This behaviour mimics that of AT2018cow, albeit with a several times larger photosphere. The spectra are consistent with blackbody emission throughout our spectral sequence ending at +21.9d, showing a tentative, very broad emission feature at 5500Å -- implying that the optical photosphere is likely within a near-relativistic outflow. Furthermore, reports of strong X-ray and radio emission cement the nature of AT2024wpp as a likely Cow-like transient. AT2024wpp is only the second event of the class with optical polarimetry. Our BVRI observations obtained from +6.1 to +14.4d show a low polarisation of P<0.5% across all bands, similar to AT2018cow that was consistent with P~0% during the same outflow-driven phase. In the absence of evidence for a preferential viewing angle, it is unlikely that both events would have shown low polarisation in the case that their photospheres were aspherical. As such, we conclude that the near-relativistic outflows launched in these events are likely highly spherical, but polarimetric observations of further events are crucial to constrain their ejecta geometry and stratification in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 This work reviews the current state of the antideuteron ($\bar{d}$) production cross-sections in cosmic ray interactions and its uncertainties, considering the coalescence model and measurements in accelerator experiments. These cross-sections have been included in a simulation of cosmic rays propagation in the Galaxy using GALPROP v.57, with updated parameters of the diffusive reacceleration model. An estimation of the expected antideuteron flux at Earth is presented.
