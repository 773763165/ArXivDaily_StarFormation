 - **Abstract**
 Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 A revised catalogue of 310 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is presented, along with some statistics of their properties. 21 SNRs have been added to the catalogue since the previous published version from 2019, and 5 entries have been removed, as they have been identified as HII regions. Also discussed are some basics statistics of the remnants in the catalogue, the selection effects that apply to the identification of Galactic SNRs and their consequences.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.

 - **Abstract**
 We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- a streamlined efficient tool for line-by-line calculation of atmospheric absorption signatures in the form of PT lookup tables, which may be used in radiative transfer codes. The tool is intended for computations in the IR and visible spectral regions. Core line-by-line scheme features nine-grid interpolation technique, which strikes good balance between speed and accuracy for calculations in the scenario of unknown continuum function and large lines cut-offs. The model features high flexibility, allowing fast recalculations with different line shapes, $\chi$-factors, line cut-offs conditions, and other parameters, making it valuable for planetary studies where atmospheric and spectroscopic data are sparse or uncertain. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web interface for onboarding and immediate usage, and as open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.

          COZMIC. II. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Fractional non-CDM Initial Conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We present $24$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog with initial conditions appropriate for scenarios where non-cold DM is a fraction of the total DM abundance (f-NCDM models), as the second installment of the COZMIC suite. We initialize our simulations using transfer functions, $T_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)\equiv\sqrt{P_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)/P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)}$ (where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum), with an initial suppression similar to thermal-relic warm DM (WDM) followed by a constant-amplitude plateau. We simulate suppression wave numbers $[22.8,~ 32.1,~ 41.8,~ 52.0,~ 57.1,~ 95.3]~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to thermal-relic WDM masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,~ 4,~ 5,~ 6,~ 6.5,~ 10]~\mathrm{keV}$, and plateau amplitudes $\delta\in [0.2,~ 0.4,~ 0.6,~ 0.8]$. We model the subhalo mass function in terms of the suppression wave number and $\delta$. Integrating these models into a forward model of the MW satellite galaxy population yields new limits on f-NCDM scenarios, with suppression wave numbers greater than $46$ and $ 40~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\delta=0.2$, $0.4$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain $\delta>0.4$. We map these limits to scenarios where a fraction $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ of DM behaves as a thermal relic, which yields the following bounds on cosmologies with a mixture of WDM and CDM: $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}>3.6,~ 4.1,~ 4.6,~ 4.9,~ 5.4~\mathrm{keV}$ for $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}=0.5,~ 0.6,~ 0.7,~ 0.8,~ 0.9$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain WDM fractions $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}<0.5$. Our results affirm that low-mass halo abundances are sensitive to partial suppression in $P(k)$, indicating the possibility of using galactic substructure to reconstruct $P(k)$ on small scales.

          A 3D Simulation of a Type II-P Supernova: from Core Bounce to Beyond Shock Breakout

 - **Abstract**
 In order to better connect core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) theory with its observational signatures, we have developed a simulation pipeline from the onset of core collapse to beyond shock breakout. Using this framework, we present a three-dimensional simulation study following the evolution from five seconds to over five days of a 17-M$_{\odot}$ progenitor that explodes with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg of energy and $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni ejecta. The early explosion is highly asymmetric, expanding most prominently along the southern hemisphere. This early asymmetry is preserved to shock breakout, $\sim$1 day later. Breakout itself evinces strong angle-dependence, with as much a day delay in shock breakout by direction. The nickel ejecta closely tails the forward shock, with velocities at breakout as high as $\sim$7000 km s$^{-1}$. A delayed reverse shock forming at the H/He interface on hour timescales leads to the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, fast-moving nickel bullets, and almost complete mixing of the metal core into the hydrogen envelope. For the first time, we illustrate the angle-dependent emergent broadband and bolometric light curves from simulations evolved in three-dimensions in entirety, continuing through hydrodynamic shock breakout a CCSN model of a massive stellar progenitor evolved with detailed, late-time neutrino microphysics and transport. Our case study of a single progenitor suggests that 3D simulations initiated with detailed neutrino heating can begin to generically produce the cornucopia of suggested asymmetries and features in CCSNe observations, while establishing the methodology to study this problem in breadth.

          Primordial black holes as supermassive black holes seeds

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^{6-10}~M_{\odot}$) in the first cosmic Gyr ($z\gtrsim 6$) challenges current models of BH formation and evolution. We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume a non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models; these scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially formed in the high-$\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out of which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH accretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction. PBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense core, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading to the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\sim 20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\sim 10^7\ M_\odot$ corresponding to $\sim 5-7\sigma$ fluctuations), and provides massive ($\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\odot}$) seeds by $z\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that provides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\rm seed}(z)=3.1\times 10^{5}\ { M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\times 10^{9}\ {M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding mechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs, namely $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\sim 6-7$ quasars can be explained with $6\times 10^4 M_{\rm \odot}$ seeds planted at $z\sim 32$, and growing at sub-Eddington rates, $\langle\lambda_{\rm E}\rangle\sim 0.55$. The same scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1 ($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\sim 20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\rm \odot}$) seeds.

          Formation of Terrestrial Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the process of terrestrial planet formation has grown markedly over the past 20 years, yet key questions remain. This review begins by first addressing the critical, earliest stage of dust coagulation and concentration. While classic studies revealed how objects that grow to $\sim$meter sizes are rapidly removed from protoplanetary disks via orbital decay (seemingly precluding growth to larger sizes), this chapter addresses how this is resolved in contemporary, streaming instability models that favor rapid planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse of solids in over-dense regions. Once formed, planetesimals grow into Mars-Earth-sized planetary embryos by a combination of pebble- and planetesimal accretion within the lifetime of the nebular disk. After the disk dissipates, these embryos typically experience a series of late giant impacts en route to attaining their final architectures. This review also highlights three different inner Solar System formation models that can match a number of empirical constraints, and also reviews ways that one or more might be ruled out in favor of another in the near future. These include (1) the Grand Tack, (2) the Early Instability and (3) Planet Formation from Rings. Additionally, this chapter discusses formation models for the closest known analogs to our own terrestrial planets: super-Earths and terrestrial exoplanets in systems also hosting gas giants. Finally, this review lays out a chain of events that may explain why the Solar System looks different than more than 99% of exoplanet systems.

          Host-star and exoplanet composition: Polluted white dwarf reveals depletion of moderately refractory elements in planetary material

 - **Abstract**
 Planets form from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust as their host stars. Confirming if planetary bodies acquire the same refractory element composition as their natal disc during formation, and how efficiently volatile elements are incorporated into growing planets, is key to linking the poorly constrained interior composition of rocky exoplanets to the observationally-constrained composition of their host star. Such comparisons also afford insight into the planet formation process. This work compares planetary composition with host-star composition using observations of a white dwarf that has accreted planetary material and its F-type star wide binary companion as a reference for the composition of the natal molecular gas and dust. Spectroscopic analysis reveals abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti in both stars. We use the white dwarf measurements to estimate the composition of the exoplanetary material and the F-type companion to constrain the composition of the material the planet formed from. Comparing planetary material to the composition of its natal cloud, our results reveal that the planetary material is depleted in moderate refractories (Mg, Si, Fe) relative to the refractory material (Ca, Ti). Grouping elements based on their condensation temperatures is key to linking stellar and planetary compositions. Fractionation during formation or subsequent planetary evolution leads to the depletion of moderate refractories from the planetary material accreted by the white dwarf. This signature, as seen for bulk Earth, will likely be present in the composition of many exoplanets relative to their host-stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting exoplanets and other faint sources of emitted and reflected light near a bright star requires deeply suppressing the starlight while efficiently transmitting the dim light from its surroundings. This suppression can be carried out by coronagraphs, nulling interferometers, and starshades. This chapter provides a brief overview of these technologies, emphasizing coronagraphs.

 - **Abstract**
 Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l>100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.

          A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability

 - **Abstract**
 A high resolution fourth-order Padé scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers with small vortices with all three components are active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations than in a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at mid-radius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the upper layers of the disk.

          Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: the Mid-Infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres which include disequilibrium chemistry and have a non-adiabatic pressure-temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from lambda = 4.5 um to lambda = 10 um is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated WISE W2 - W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 um flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 um flux to the 10 - 15 um flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2 - W3 colors which are likely to be very low gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2 - W3 and we find that the 4 to 18 um JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold very low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) framework to model the Galactic CR distributions and associated non-thermal diffuse emissions up to PeV energies. We consider ensembles of discrete, finite lifetime CR sources, e.g.\ supernova remnants (SNRs), for a range of creation rates and lifetimes. We find that global properties of the CR sources are likely not directly recoverable from the current `snapshot' of the historic injection and propagation of CRs within the Galaxy that are provided by the data. We show that models for the diffuse $\gamma$ rays based on the discrete/time-dependent scenarios we consider are able to explain LHAASO very-/ultra-high energy (VHE/UHE) $\gamma$-ray data with up to 50\% contribution by unresolved leptonic sources at the highest energies. Over the models that we consider, variations in the diffuse VHE emissions can be $\sim$25\%, which is comparable to those for steady-state models that we investigated in earlier work. Such variations due to the discrete/finite nature of the CR sources are an important factor that are necessary to construct accurate physical models of the diffuse emissions from the Galaxy at VHE/UHEs.

          Evolutionary states and triplicity of four massive semi-detached binaries with long-term decreasing orbital periods in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 The massive semi-detached binary with a long-term decreasing orbital period may involve a rapid mass-transfer phase in Case A, and thus they are good astrophysical laboratories for investigating the evolution of massive binary stars. In this work, by using the long-term observational light curves from the OGLE project and other data in the low-metallicity LMC, four semi-detached massive binaries with long-term decreases in the orbital periods are detected from 165 EB-type close binaries. It is found that the more massive component in S07798 is filling its Roche lobe where the period decrease is caused by mass transfer from the primary to the secondary. However, the other three (S03065, S12631, S16873) are semi-detached binaries with a lobe-filling secondary where the mass transfer between the components should cause the period to increase if the angular momentum is conservative. The long-term period decreases in these three systems may be caused by the angular momentum loss. Additionally, the orbital periods of three systems (S03065, S07798, S16873) are detected to show cyclic variation with periods shorter than 11 years, which can be plausibly explained by the presence of close-in third bodies in these massive binaries. Based on all of these results, it is suggested that the detected four semi-detached binaries almost have multiplicity. The companion stars are crucial for the origin and evolution of these massive close binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology is entering a very exciting time in its history, when a wealth of cutting-edge experiments are all starting to collect data, or about to. These experiments aim at addressing some of the most intriguing questions in fundamental physics, such as what is the nature of dark matter, is dark energy a cosmological constant or a varying field, what are the masses of the neutrinos, and more. While Lambda-CDM has emerged as a simple model that is consistent with most of the current data sets, we are starting to see some interesting deviations that deserve further exploration. This contribution provides an overview of upcoming projects and the science opportunities they will allow. In particular, we recall and comment the DESI year-1 BAO constraints and their implications for dark energy. We put some of the most recent results and outstanding questions in the perspective of the forthcoming observational program.

          Deciphering the Evolution of Thermodynamic Properties and their Connection to the Global Kinematics of High-Speed Coronal Mass Ejections Using FRIS Model

 - **Abstract**
 Most earlier studies have been limited to estimating the kinematic evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and only limited efforts have been made to investigate their thermodynamic evolution. We focus on the interplay of the thermal properties of CMEs with their observed global kinematics. We implement the Flux rope Internal State (FRIS) model to estimate variations in the polytropic index, heating rate per unit mass, temperature, pressure, and various internal forces. The model incorporates inputs of 3D kinematics obtained from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. In our study, we chose nine fast-speed CMEs from 2010 to 2012. Our investigation elucidates that the selected fast-speed CMEs show a heat-release phase at the beginning, followed by a heat-absorption phase with a near-isothermal state in their later propagation phase. The thermal state transition, from heat release to heat absorption, occurs at around 3($\pm$0.3) to 7($\pm$0.7) $R_\odot$ for different CMEs. We found that the CMEs with higher expansion speeds experience a less pronounced sharp temperature decrease before gaining a near-isothermal state. The differential emission measurement (DEM) analysis findings, using multi-wavelength observation from SDO/AIA, also show a heat release state of CMEs at lower coronal heights. We also find the dominant internal forces influencing CME radial expansion at varying distances from the Sun. Our study shows the need to characterize the internal thermodynamic properties of CMEs better in both observational and modeling studies, offering insights for refining assumptions of a constant value of the polytropic index during the evolution of CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The NEO Coordination Centre (NEOCC) of the European Space Agency is an operational centre that, among other activities, computes the orbits of near-Earth objects and their probabilities of impact with the Earth. The NEOCC started providing information about near-Earth objects in 2012 on a dedicated web portal, accessible at this https URL. Since the beginning of the operational phase, many developments and improvements have been implemented regarding the software, the data provided, and the portal. One of the most important upgrades is that the NEOCC is now independently providing data through a newly developed Orbit Determination and Impact Monitoring system, named Aegis. All the data computed by Aegis is publicly available on the NEOCC web portal, and Aegis is also used to maintain all the major services offered. The most important services comprise an orbital catalogue of all known asteroids, a list of possible future impacts with the Earth (also called Risk List), a list of forthcoming close approaches, a set of graphical toolkits, and an on-demand ephemerides service. Many of the services are also available through dedicated APIs, which can be used to automatically retrieve data. Here we give an overview of the algorithms implemented in the Aegis software, and provide a summary of the services offered by the NEOCC that are supported by Aegis.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model has been highly successful in predicting cosmic structure and evolution, yet recent precision measurements have highlighted discrepancies, especially in the Hubble constant inferred from local and early-Universe data. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising alternative for cosmological measurements, capable of reaching higher redshifts than traditional distance indicators. This work leverages GRBs to refine cosmological parameters independently of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using the Platinum compilation of long GRBs, we calibrate the Dainotti relations-empirical correlations among GRB luminosity properties-as standard candles through artificial neural networks (ANNs). We analyze both the 2D and 3D Dainotti calibration relations, leveraging an ANN-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to minimize scatter in the calibration parameters, thereby achieving a stable Hubble diagram. This ANN-based calibration approach offers advantages over Gaussian processes, avoiding issues such as kernel function dependence and overfitting. Our results emphasize the need for model-independent calibration approaches to address systematic challenges in GRB luminosity variability, ultimately extending the cosmic distance ladder in a robust way. By addressing redshift evolution and reducing systematic uncertainties, GRBs can serve as reliable high-redshift distance indicators, offering critical insights into current cosmological tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 As a well-known open cluster, NGC 2323 (also called M50) has been widely investigated for over a hundred years and has always been considered a classical single cluster. In this work, with the help of Gaia DR3, we study the binary structure nature of this cluster. Although indistinguishable in the spatial space, the small but undeniable difference in the proper motion indicates that they may be two individual clusters. After investigating the properties of the two clusters, it is found that they have very close positions (three-dimensional $\Delta$pos = 12.3 pc, $\sigma_{\Delta \mathrm{pos}} = 3.4$ pc) and similar tangential velocities (two-dimensional $\Delta$V = 2.2 km s$^{-1}$, $\sigma_{\Delta \mathrm{V}} = 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$), indicating the existence of their physical association. Moreover, the best isochrone fitting ages of the two clusters are the same (158 Myr), further proving their possibly common origin. To comprehensively understand the formation and evolution of this binary cluster, we employ the PETAR $N$-body code to trace back their birthplace and deduce their dynamical evolutionary fate. With observational mean cluster properties, the simulations suggest that they may form together, and then orbit each other as a binary cluster for over 200 Myr. After that, because of their gradual mass loss, the two clusters will eventually separate and evolve into two independent clusters. Meanwhile, the numerical $N$-body simulation suggests that the less massive cluster is unlikely to be the cluster tidal tails created by the differential rotation of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present interferometric observations at 1 and 3\,mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of the free-free continuum and mm-wavelength recombination line (mRRL) emission of the ionized core (within $\lsim$130\,au) of the young Planetary Nebula (PN) candidate M\,this http URL inner regions are concealed in the vast majority of similar objects. A spectral index for the mm-to-cm continuum of $\sim$0.9 indicates predominantly free-free emission from an ionized wind, with a minor contribution from warm dust. The mm-continuum emission in M\,2-9 reveals an elongated structure along the main symmetry axis of the large-scale bipolar nebula with a C-shaped curvature surrounded by a broad-waisted component. This structure is consistent with an ionized bent jet and a perpendicular compact dusty disk. The presence of a compact equatorial disk (of radius $\sim$50\,au) is also supported by red-shifted CO and \trecem\ absorption profiles observed from the base of the receding north lobe against the compact background continuum. The redshift observed in the CO absorption profiles likely signifies gas infall movements from the disk toward a central source. The mRRLs exhibit velocity gradients along the axis, implying systematic expansion in the C-shaped bipolar outflow. The highest expansion velocities ($\sim$80\,\kms) are found in two diagonally opposed compact regions along the axis, referred to as the high-velocity spots/shells (HVS), indicating either rapid wind acceleration or shocks at radial distances of $\sim$0\farc02-0\farc04 ($\sim$15-25\,au) from the center. A subtle velocity gradient perpendicular to the lobes is also found, suggestive of rotation. Our ALMA observations detect increased brightness and broadness in the mRRLs... (abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with ALMA in Band 6 (220.7$-$274.9 GHz). We identified about 3,700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the iterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.

          Planck-PR4 anisotropy spectra show (better) consistency with General Relativity

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from a series of analyses on two parametric tests of gravity that modify the growth of linear, sub-horizon matter perturbations in the $\Lambda$CDM model. The first test, known as the $(\mu,\Sigma)$ framework, modifies the Poisson and lensing equations from General Relativity (GR). The second test introduces the growth index $\gamma$, which directly affects the time evolution of matter density perturbations. Our study is motivated by results from the analysis of the Planck-PR3 2018 spectra, which indicate a preference for $\Sigma_0 \neq 0$ and $\gamma_0 > 0.55$, both of which deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at a significance level of $\sim 2.5\sigma$. To clarify the nature of these anomalous results and understand how the lensing anomaly fits into the picture, we analyze the most recent Planck-PR4 spectra extracted from the updated \texttt{NPIPE} maps. Overall, the Planck-PR4 data show better consistency with GR. The updated likelihood \texttt{Camspec} provides constraints on $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ that are consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively. The updated likelihoods \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} show even closer agreement, with all parameter values consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within $1\sigma$. This enhanced consistency is closely correlated with the lensing anomaly. Across the different likelihoods, the tendency of $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ to drift towards non-standard values matches the observed preference for $A_L > 1$, both of which are significantly reduced or disappear within the Planck-PR4 data.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of Type I X-ray bursts is attributed to those seen by the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite (ANS) in September 1975 from the globular cluster NGC6624 containing the X-ray source 4U1820-303. I revisit these X-ray bursts, by re-analysing data from the Soft X-ray Experiment (SXX) onboard ANS, which were stored on microfiche. Earlier accounts of X-ray bursts had been reported; the first Type I X-ray burst recorded is the one observed by Vela 5B from Cen X-4 in July 1969.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether Neural Networks (NN) can accurately differentiate between growth-rate data of the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, simulated via two models: a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model and a tomographic Coupled Dark Energy (CDE) model. We build an NN classifier and test its accuracy in distinguishing between cosmological models. For our dataset, we generate f{\sigma_8}(z) growth-rate observables simulating a realistic Stage IV galaxy survey-like setup, for both {\Lambda}CDM and a tomographic CDE model, for various values of the model parameters. We then optimise and train our NN with Optuna, aiming to avoid overfitting and maximising the accuracy of the trained model. We conduct our analysis for both a binary classification, comparing between {\Lambda}CDM and a CDE model where only one tomographic coupling bin is activated, and a multiclass classification scenario where all the models are combined. For the case of binary classification, we find that our NN can confidently (with > 86% accuracy) detect non-zero values of the tomographic coupling regardless of the redshift range at which coupling is activated, and at a 100% confidence level, detect the {\Lambda}CDM model. For the multiclass classification task, we find that the NN performs adequately well at distinguishing between {\Lambda}CDM, a CDE model with low redshift coupling, and a model with high redshift coupling, with 99%, 79% and 84% accuracy respectively. By leveraging the power of machine learning, our pipeline can be a useful tool to analyse growth-rate data and maximise the potential of current surveys to probe for deviations from General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 PDS 70 is a unique system as it hosts a protoplanetary disk with two confirmed forming planets, making it an ideal target for characterizing dust in such disks. We present new high-contrast polarimetric differential imaging of PDS 70 using the $N\_R$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL, combined with archival VLT/SPHERE data across five wavelengths ($N\_R$, $VBB$, $J$, $H$, and $Ks$) spanning seven epochs over eight years. For each epoch, we corrected smearing effects from instrument resolution, analyzed azimuthal brightness profiles, and derived intrinsic disk-integrated polarized reflectivity and brightness contrasts. Our analysis reveals significant temporal variability in both integrated polarized reflectivity and azimuthal brightness profiles, suggesting variable shadowing on the outer disk from unresolved inner disk structures. Nonetheless, we observe a systematic wavelength-dependent contrast between the near and far sides of the inclined disk, highlighting the need to consider shadowing from the inner disk and surface geometry of the reflecting disk in data interpretation.

 Interacting supernovae provide key insights into the mass-loss processes of massive stars and their circumstellar environments. By analyzing their photometric and spectroscopic properties, we can study the complex interactions between ejected material and circumstellar material (CSM). This paper highlights the diversity of interacting SNe, including Types IIn, Ibn, and Icn, and explores the challenges in understanding progenitor systems, CSM structures, and late-time evolution. Advances in high-cadence observations and modeling are crucial for improving our knowledge of these stellar explosions.
