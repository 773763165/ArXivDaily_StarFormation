 - **Abstract**
 Context. Most ground-based planet search direct imaging campaigns use angular differential imaging, which distorts the signal from extended sources like protoplanetary disks. In the case PDS 70, a young system with two planets found within the cavity of a protoplanetary disk, obtaining a reliable image of both planets and disk is essential to understanding planet-disk interactions. Aims. Our goals are to reveal the true intensity of the planets and disk without self-subtraction effects for the first time, search for new giant planets beyond separations of 0.1" and to study the morphology of the disk shaped by two massive planets. Methods. We present YJHK-band imaging, polarimetry, and spatially resolved spectroscopy of PDS 70 using near-simultaneous reference star differential imaging, also known as star-hopping. We created a radiative transfer model of the system to match the near-infrared imaging and polarimetric data, along with sub-millimeter imaging from ALMA. Furthermore, we extracted the spectra of the planets and the disk and compared them. Results. We find that the disk is quite flared with a scale height of ~15% at the outer edge of the disk at ~90 au, similar to some disks in the literature. The gap inside of ~50 au is estimated to have ~1% of the dust density of the outer disk. The Northeast outer disk arc seen in previous observations is likely the outer lip of the flared disk. Abundance ratios of grains estimated by the modeling indicate a shallow grain-size index > -2.7, instead of the canonical -3.5. There is both vertical and radial segregation of grains. Planet c is well separated from the disk and has a spectrum similar to planet b, clearly redder than the disk spectra. Planet c is possibly associated with the sudden flaring of the disk starting at ~50 au. No new planets > 5 Mj were found.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is discovering a large population of $z>4$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are overmassive with respect to the stellar content of their hosts. A previous study developed a physical model to interpret this overmassive population as the result of quasar feedback acting on a compact host galaxy. In this Note, we apply this model to JADES GN 1146115, a dormant supermassive black hole at $z=6.7$ whose mass is $\sim40\%$ of the host's mass in stars and accreting at $\sim2\%$ of the Eddington limit. The host has been forming stars at the low rate of $\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ for the past $\sim 100$ Myr. Our model suggests that this galactic system is on the verge of a resurgence of global star formation activity. This transition comes after a period of domination by the effect of its overmassive black hole, whose duration is comparable to typical quasar lifetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 As the hunt for an Earth-like exoplanets has intensified in recent years, so has the effort to characterise and model the stellar signals that can hide or mimic small planetary signals. Stellar variability arises from a number of sources, including granulation, supergranulation, oscillations and activity, all of which result in quasi-periodic or stochastic behaviour in photometric and/or radial velocity observations. Traditionally, the characterisation of these signals has mostly been done in the frequency domain. However, the recent development of scalable Gaussian process regression methods makes direct time-domain modelling of stochastic processes a feasible and arguably preferable alternative, obviating the need to estimate the power spectral density of the data before modelling it. In this paper, we compare the two approaches using a series of experiments on simulated data. We show that frequency domain modelling can lead to inaccurate results, especially when the time sampling is irregular. By contrast, Gaussian process regression results are often more precise, and systematically more accurate, in both the regular and irregular time sampling regimes. While this work was motivated by the analysis of radial velocity and photometry observations of main sequence stars in the context of planet searches, we note that our results may also have applications for the study of other types of astrophysical variability such as quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid formation of supermassive black holes occurs in dense nuclear star clusters that are initially gas-dominated. Stellar-mass black hole remnants of the most massive cluster sink into the core, where a massive runaway black hole forms as a consequence of combined effects of repeated mergers and Eddington-limited gas accretion. The associated gravitational-wave signals of high-redshift extreme mass-ratio inspirals are a unique signature of the nuclear star cluster scenario.
#### Probing the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization using  21-cm signal power spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The redshifted 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR) directly probes the ionization and thermal states of the intergalactic medium during that period. In particular, the distribution of the ionized regions around the radiating sources during EoR introduces scale-dependent features in the spherically-averaged EoR 21-cm signal power spectrum. The goal is to study these scale-dependent features at different stages of reionization using numerical simulations and build a source model-independent framework to probe the properties of the intergalactic medium using EoR 21-cm signal power spectrum measurements. Under the assumption of high spin temperature, we modelled the redshift evolution of the ratio of EoR 21-cm brightness temperature power spectrum and the corresponding density power spectrum using an ansatz consisting of a set of redshift and scale-independent parameters. This set of eight parameters probes the redshift evolution of the average ionization fraction and the quantities related to the morphology of the ionized regions. We have tested this ansatz on different reionization scenarios generated using different simulation algorithms and found that it is able to recover the redshift evolution of the average neutral fraction within an absolute deviation $\lesssim 0.1$. Our framework allows us to interpret 21-cm signal power spectra in terms of parameters related to the state of the IGM. This source model-independent framework can efficiently constrain reionization scenarios using multi-redshift power spectrum measurements with ongoing and future radio telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA. This will add independent information regarding the EoR IGM properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of an abundant population of low frequency photons at high redshifts (such as a radio background) can source leading order effects on the evolution of the matter and spin temperatures through rapid free-free absorptions. This effect, known as soft photon heating, can have a dramatic impact on the differential brightness temperature, $\Delta T_{\rm b}$, a central observable in $21$cm cosmology. Here, we introduce a semi-analytic framework to describe the dynamics of soft photon heating, providing a simplified set of evolution equations and a useful numerical scheme which can be used to study this generic effect. We also perform quasi-instantaneous and continuous soft photon injections to elucidate the different regimes in which soft photon heating is expected to impart a significant contribution to the global $21$cm signal and its fluctuations. We find that soft photon backgrounds produced after recombination with spectral index $\gamma > 3.0$ undergo significant free-free absorption, and therefore this heating effect cannot be neglected. The effect becomes stronger with steeper spectral index, and in some cases the injection of a synchrotron-like spectrum ($\gamma = 3.6$) can suppress the amplitude of $\Delta T_{\rm b}$ relative to the standard model prediction, making the global $21$cm signal even more difficult to detect in these scenarios.
#### Kinematic and metallicity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XVIII

 - **Abstract**
 Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate ``backsplash galaxy'' that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and $\alpha$-enhancements ([$\alpha$/Fe]) for 56 probable members. We estimated Andromeda XVIII's mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using maximum likelihood coupled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC). There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though sub-populations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is -337.2 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is -36 km s$^{-1}$ (approaching), which is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors ($\delta [Fe/H] < 0.3$) compared to a total of 56 probable members, parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models due to a sharp metal-rich cut-off. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. One possible cause for this quenching may be rapid gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 in the past. We also consider a past major merger as another possible cause.
#### Laser Irradiation of Carbonaceous Chondrite Simulants: Space Weathering  Implications for C-complex Asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 Surfaces of carbonaceous asteroids (C-complex) have shown diverse contrasting spectral variations, which may be related to space weathering. We performed laser irradiation experiments on CI and CM simulant material under vacuum to mimic the spectral alteration induced by micrometeorite impacts. We used in situ ultraviolet-visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy to analyze spectral alterations in response to pulsed laser irradiation, as well as scanning electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to search for microstructural and compositional changes. Laser irradiation causes an increase in spectral slope (reddening) and a decrease in the albedo (darkening), and these changes are stronger in the ultraviolet-visible region. These spectral changes are likely driven by the excess iron found in the altered surface region, although other factors, such as the observed structural changes, may also contribute. Additionally, while the 0.27~${\mu}m$ band appears relatively stable under laser irradiation, a broad feature at 0.6~${\mu}m$ rapidly disappears with laser irradiation, suggesting that space weathering may inhibit the detection of any feature in this spectral region, including the 0.7~${\mu}m$ band, which has typically been used an indicator of hydration. Comparing our laboratory results with optical spectrophotometry observations of C-complex asteroids, we find that the majority of objects are spectrally red and possess colors that are similar to our irradiated material rather than our fresh samples. Furthermore, we also find that ``younger'' and ``older'' C-complex families have similar colors, suggesting that the space weathering process is near-equal or faster than the time it takes to refresh the surfaces of these airless bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Principal regular satellites of gas giants are thought to be formed by the accumulation of solid materials in circumplanetary disks (CPDs). While there has been significant progress in the study of satellite formation in CPDs, details of the supply of satellite building blocks to CPDs remain unclear. We performed orbital integration of solid particles in the protoplanetary disk (PPD) approaching a planet, considering the gas drag force using the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a local region around the planet. We investigated planetary-mass dependence of the capture positions and capture rates of dust particles accreting onto the CPD. We also examined the degree of dust retention in accreting gas onto the CPD, which is important for determining the ratio of dust-to-gas inflow rates, a key parameter in satellite formation. We found that the degree of dust retention increases with increasing planetary mass for a given dust scale height in the PPD. In the case of a small planet ($M_{\rm p}=0.2M_{\rm Jup}$), most particles with insufficient initial altitudes in the PPD are isolated from the gas in the accreting region. On the other hand, in the case of a massive planet ($M_{\rm p}=1M_{\rm Jup}$), dust particles can be coupled to the vertically accreting gas, even when the dust scale height is about $10-30$\% of the gas scale height. The results of this study can be used for models of dust delivery and satellite formation in the CPDs of gas giants of various masses, including exoplanets.
#### Dark supernova remnant buried in the Galactic-Centre "Brick"  G0.253+0.016 revealed by an expanding CO-line bubble

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a $^{12}$CO- and $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$)-line study of the "Brick" (G0.253+0.016) in the Galactic Centre (GC) by analyzing the archival data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We present kinematics and molecular gas distributions in the longitude-velocity diagrams, and suggest that the Brick is located along the GC Arm I in the central molecular zone (CMZ) in front of the GC, which yields a distance of 8 kpc and GC radius 0.2 kpc. The major and minor-axis diameters of the Brick are $D_x\times D_y=8.4 \ {\rm pc} \times 4.1 \ {\rm pc}$, and the scale radius is $r_{\rm bri}=\sqrt{D_x D_y}=2.96$ pc. The molecular mass inferred from the CO-line integrated intensity is $M_{\rm brixco} \sim 5.1\times 10^4 M_\odot$ for a conversion factor $X_{\rm gc}=1.0\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$, while the Virial mass for the velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=10.0 $ km s $^{-1}$ is calculated to be $M_{\rm brivir}\sim 6.8 \times 10^4 \ M_\odot$, which yields a new conversion factor of $X_{\rm bri} =1.3\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$. No thermal radio emission indicative of HII region and star formation is found in radio-continuum archive. The Brick's center has a cavity surrounded by a spherical molecular bubble of radius $r_{\rm bub}=1.85$ pc and mass $\sim 1.7\times 10^4 M_\odot$ expanding at $v_{\rm exp}=10$ km s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energy of $E_0\sim 1.7\times 10^{49}$ erg. If the bubble is approximated by an adiabatic spherical shock wave, its age is $t\sim 2/5 r_{\rm bub}/v_{\rm exp}\sim 7.2\times 10^4$ y. We suggest that the bubble will be a dark supernova remnant buried in the dense molecular cloud. The Brick, therefore, experienced massive-star formation followed by a supernova explosion more than $\sim 10^5$ y ago.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to measure the mass accretion rate, the accretion luminosity, and more generally the physical conditions of the warm emitting gas in the inner disk of the very low-mass star 2MASS-J16053215-1933159. We investigate the source mid-infrared spectrum for atomic and molecular hydrogen line emission. We present the full James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) spectrum of the protoplanetary disk around the very low-mass star 2MASS-J16053215-1933159 from the MINDS GTO program, previously shown to be abundant in hydrocarbon molecules. We analyzed the atomic and molecular hydrogen lines in this source by fitting one or multiple Gaussian profiles. We then built a rotational diagram for the H2 lines to constrain the rotational temperature and column density of the gas. Finally, we compared the observed atomic line fluxes to predictions from two standard emission models. We identify five molecular hydrogen pure rotational lines and 16 atomic hydrogen recombination lines. The spectrum indicates optically thin emission for both species. We use the molecular hydrogen lines to constrain the mass and temperature of the warm emitting gas. The HI (7-6) recombination line is used to measure the mass accretion rate and luminosity onto the central source. HI recombination lines can also be used to derive the physical properties of the gas using atomic recombination models. The JWST-MIRI MRS observations for the very low-mass star 2MASS-J16053215-1933159 reveal a large number of emission lines, many originating from atomic and molecular hydrogen because we are able to look into the disk warm molecular layer. Their analysis constrains the physical properties of the emitting gas and showcases the potential of JWST to deepen our understanding of the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks
#### The Fireball of November 24, 1970, as the Most Probable Source of the  Ischgl Meteorite

 - **Abstract**
 In June 1976, a pristine meteorite stone weighing approximately 1 kg, fully covered with a fresh black fusion crust, was collected on a mountain road in the high-altitude Alpine environment. The recovery took place while clearing the remnants of a snow avalanche, 2 km northwest of Ischgl in Austria. Subsequent to its retrieval, the specimen remained in the finder's private residence without undergoing any scientific examination or identification until 2008, when it was brought to the University of Innsbruck. The sample was classified as a well-preserved LL6 chondrite, with a W0 weathering grade, implying a relatively short time between the meteorite fall and its retrieval. To investigate the potential connection between the Ischgl meteorite and a recorded fireball event, we have reviewed all documented fireballs ever photographed by German fireball camera stations. This examination led us to identify the fireball EN241170 observed in Germany by ten different European Network stations on the night of November 23/24, 1970, as the most likely candidate. We employed state-of-the-art techniques to reconstruct the fireball's trajectory, and to reproduce both its luminous and dark flight phases in detail. We find that the determined strewn field and the generated heat map closely align with the recovery location of the Ischgl meteorite. Furthermore, the measured radionuclide data reported here indicate that the pre-atmospheric size of the Ischgl meteoroid is consistent with the mass estimate inferred from our deceleration analysis along the trajectory. Our findings strongly support the conclusion that the Ischgl meteorite originated from the EN241170 fireball, effectively establishing it as a confirmed meteorite fall. This discovery enables to determine, along with the physical properties, also the heliocentric orbit and cosmic history of the Ischgl meteorite.
#### Comparing the three-dimensional morphological asymmetries in the ejecta  of Kepler and Tycho in X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent simulations have shown that asymmetries in the ejecta distribution of supernova remnants (SNRs) may be a reflection of asymmetries left over from the initial supernova explosion. Thus, SNR studies provide a vital means for testing and constraining model predictions in relation to the distribution of heavy elements, which are key to improving our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in Type Ia supernovae. The use of a novel blind source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the historic Kepler and Tycho supernova remnants has revealed maps of the ejecta distribution. These maps are endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clear separations from the continuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional (3D) view of the ejecta by individually disentangling red- and blueshifted spectral components associated with images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe emission. This approach provides insights into the morphology of the ejecta distribution in those two remnants. Those mappings have allowed us to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the intermediate-mass elements and Fe distribution in two Type Ia supernova remnants. We also compared the results with the core-collapse Cassiopeia A remnant, which we had studied previously. The images obtained confirm, as expected for Type Ia SNRs, that the Fe distribution is mostly closer to the core than that of intermediate-mass elements. They also highlight peculiar features in the ejecta distribution, such as the Fe-rich southeastern knot in Tycho.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method for a non-linear asteroseismic inversion suitable for gravity-mode pulsators and apply it to slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) stars. Our inversion method is based on the iterative improvement of a parameterised static stellar structure model, which in turn is based on constraints from the observed oscillation periods. We present tests to demonstrate that the method is successful in recovering the properties of artificial targets both inside and outside the parameter space. We also present a test of our method on the well-studied SPB star KIC 7760680. We believe that this method is promising for carrying out detailed analyses of observations of SPB and $\gamma$ Dor stars and will provide complementary information to evolutionary models.
#### Does dark energy really revive using DESI 2024 data?

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data on dark energy scenarios. We thus analyze three typologies of models, the first in which the cosmic speed up is related to thermodynamics, the second associated with Taylor expansions of the barotropic factor, whereas the third based on \emph{ad hoc} dark energy parameterizations. In this respect, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, adopting the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, of 12 models. To do so, we first work at the background, inferring \emph{a posteriori} kinematic quantities associated with each model. Afterwards, we obtain early time predictions, computing departures on the growth evolution with respect to the model that better fits DESI data. We find that the best model to fit data \emph{is not} the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, but rather a more complicated log-corrected dark energy contribution. To check the goodness of our findings, we further directly fit the product, $r_d h_0$, concluding that $r_d h_0$ is anticorrelated with the mass. This treatment is worked out by removing a precise data point placed at $z=0.51$. Surprisingly, in this case the results again align with the $\Lambda$CDM model, \emph{indicating that the possible tension between the concordance paradigm and the CPL model can be severely alleviated}. We conclude that future data points will be essential to clarify whether dynamical dark energy is really in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 $f(R)$ gravity is one of the serious alternatives of general relativity having large range of astronomical consequences. In this work, we study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in $f(R)$ gravity theory. We consider modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes in the radiation era which introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass $(2.2-3.5) \times 10^4$ eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by $3-4$ times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range helium abundance is within observed bound. However, deuterium abundance is found to be increased by $3-6$ times the observed primordial abundance which calls for high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for destruction of the same. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to estimate that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to primordial black holes of sub-planetary mass ($\sim 10^{19}$ g) serving as one of the potential non-baryonic dark matter candidates. We infer Big Bang equivalence of power law $f(R)$ gravity with primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the whole 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 with Insight-HXMT data. We focus our study on the temporal evolution of the parameters of the source. We employ two different models to fit the thermal spectrum of the disk: the Newtonian model DISKBB and the relativistic model NKBB. These two models provide different pictures of the source in the soft state. With DISKBB, we find that the inner edge of the disk is close to the innermost stable circular orbit of a fast-rotating black hole and the corona changes geometry from the hard to the soft state, probably becoming compact and close to the black hole. With NKBB, we find that the disk is truncated in the soft state and that the coronal geometry does not change significantly during the whole outburst. However, we find that the model with NKBB can predict an untruncated disk around a fast-rotating black hole if we assume that the inclination angle of the disk is around 30 degrees (instead of 60 degrees, which is the inclination angle of the jet and is usually adopted as the inclination angle of the disk in the literature) and we employ a high-density reflection model. In such a case, we measure a high value of the black hole spin parameter with observations in the soft state, in agreement with the high spin value found from the analysis of the reflection features and in disagreement with the low spin value found by previous continuum-fitting method measurements with the inclination angle of the disk set to the value of the inclination angle of the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Amino acids are essential for the synthesis of protein. Amino acids contain both amine (R$-$NH$_{2}$) and carboxylic acid (R$-$COOH) functional groups, which help to understand the possible formation mechanism of life in the universe. Among the 20 types of amino acids, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH) is known as the simplest non-essential amino acid. In the last 40 years, all surveys of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium, especially in the star-formation regions, have failed at the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We aimed to identify the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH, because it is highly challenging to identify NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium. Many laboratory experiments have suggested that methylenimine (CH$_{2}$NH) plays a key role as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the star-formation regions via the Strecker synthesis reaction. After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we successfully identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{2}$NH towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column density of CH$_{2}$NH towards G10.47+0.03 is (3.40$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a rotational temperature of 218.70$\pm$20 K, which is estimated from the rotational diagram. The fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$NH with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 is 2.61$\times$10$^{-8}$. We found that the derived abundance of CH$_{2}$NH agree fairly well with the existing two-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance value of CH$_{2}$NH. We discuss the possible formation pathways of CH$_{2}$NH within the context of hot molecular cores, and we find that CH$_{2}$NH is likely mainly formed via neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions of CH$_{3}$ and NH radicals towards G10.47+0.03.

 - **Abstract**
 A near-infrared spectrum of nova V1716 Scorpii (PNV J17224490-4137160), a recent bright (V_max = 7.3 mag), Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray source, was modeled using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Abundances were estimated for He, C, N, O, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Ne, S, Ca, and P. Notably, P (a factor of 120) and N (a factor of 248) are highly overabundant. It was necessary to assume the ejecta consist of two components (with a cylindrical geometry): a dense component from which the bulk of the H, He, and neutral O~I and N emission arises and a more diffuse component from which most of the coronal lines arise. Some of the coronal lines are found to originate from both the dense and diffuse components. The mass of the ejecta, including neutral and ionized gas, is ~ 4.19e-4 solar masses. Our analysis indicates that in the case of V1716 Sco (which has a carbon-oxygen white dwarf), a fraction of 25% white dwarf matter rather than 50% is favored for the mixing between white dwarf and the accreted envelope before the outburst. This mixing ratio is like that found for Oxygen-Neon novae where a 25% mixing fraction is also indicated. Helium hydride -- the first molecule to form after the Big Bang -- may have formed in the ejecta of V1716 Sco based on photoionization modeling. This prediction suggests that novae may be potential formation sites of this important molecular ion.
#### The formation of transiting circumplanetary debris discs from the  disruption of satellite systems during planet-planet scattering

 - **Abstract**
 Several stars show deep transits consistent with discs of roughly 1 Solar radius seen at moderate inclinations, likely surrounding planets on eccentric orbits. We show that this configuration arises naturally as a result of planet-planet scattering when the planets possess satellite systems. Planet-planet scattering explains the orbital eccentricities of the discs' host bodies, while the close encounters during scattering lead to the exchange of satellites between planets and/or their destabilisation. This leads to collisions between satellites and their tidal disruption close to the planet. Both of these events lead to large quantities of debris being produced, which in time will settle into a disc such as those observed. The mass of debris required is comparable to a Ceres-sized satellite. Through N-body simulations of planets with clones of the Galilean satellite system undergoing scattering, we show that 90 percent of planets undergoing scattering will possess debris from satellite destruction. Extrapolating to smaller numbers of satellites suggests that tens of percent of such planets should still possess circumplanetary debris discs. The debris trails arising from these events are often tilted at tens of degrees to the planetary orbit, consistent with the inclinations of the observed discs. Disruption of satellite systems during scattering thus simultaneously explains the existence of debris, the tilt of the discs, and the eccentricity of the planets they orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQSOs) displaying distinct blue-shifted broad absorption lines. These serve as invaluable probes for unraveling the intricate structure and evolution of quasars, shedding light on the profound influence exerted by supermassive black holes on galaxy formation. The proliferation of large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST, SDSS, and DESI has exponentially expanded the repository of quasar spectra at our disposal. In this study, we present an innovative approach to streamline the identification of BALQSOs, leveraging the power of dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms. Our dataset is curated from the SDSS DR16, amalgamating quasar spectra with classification labels sourced from the DR16Q quasar catalog. We employ a diverse array of dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), to distill the essence of the original spectral data. The resultant low-dimensional representations serve as inputs for a suite of machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost and Random Forest models. Through experimentation, we unveil PCA as the most effective dimensionality reduction methodology, adeptly navigating the intricate balance between dimensionality reduction and preservation of vital spectral information. Notably, the synergistic fusion of PCA with the XGBoost classifier emerges as the pinnacle of efficacy in the BALQSO classification endeavor, boasting impressive accuracy rates of 97.60% by 10-cross validation and 96.92% on the outer test sample. This study not only introduces a novel machine learning-based paradigm for quasar classification but also offers invaluable insights transferrable to a myriad of spectral classification challenges pervasive in the realm of astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 This first VELOCE data release comprises 18,225 high-precision RV measurements of 258 bona fide classical Cepheids on both hemispheres collected mainly between 2010 and 2022, alongside 1161 additional observations of 164 other stars. The median per-observation RV uncertainty is 0.037 km/s, and some reach 0.002 km/s. Non-variable standard stars characterize RV zero-point stability and provide a base for future cross-calibrations. We determined zero-point differences between VELOCE and 31 literature data sets using template fitting and measured linear period changes of 146 Cepheids. Seventy six spectroscopic binary Cepheids and 14 candidates are identified using VELOCE data alone and are investigated in detail in a companion paper (VELOCE II). Several new insights into Cepheid pulsations were obtained, including: a) the most detailed description of the Hertzsprung progression by RVs; b) the identification of double-peaked bumps in the RV curve; c) clear evidence that virtually all Cepheids feature spectroscopic variability signals that lead to modulated RV variability. We identified 36 such stars, of which 4 also exhibit orbital motion. Linear radius variations depend strongly on pulsation period and a steep increase in slope of the $\Delta$R/p versus logP-relation is found near 10d, challenging the existence of a tight relation between Baade-Wesselink projection factors and pulsation periods. We investigated the accuracy of RV time series measurements, v$_\gamma$, and RV amplitudes published in Gaia's DR3 and determined an average offset of 0.65 \pm 0.11 km/s relative to VELOCE. We recommend adopting a single set of template correlation parameters for distinct classes of large-amplitude variable stars to avoid systematic offsets in v$_\gamma$ among stars belonging to the same class. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of Gaia RVs exhibit significant (16%) dispersion compared to VELOCE. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multiwavelength investigation into flares and activity in nearby M~dwarf stars. We leverage the most extensive contemporaneous dataset obtained through the Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey (TESS), Kepler/K2, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (\textit{Swift}), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), spanning the optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) regimes. In total, we observed 213 NUV flares on 24 nearby M dwarfs, with $\sim$27\% of them having detected optical counterparts, and found that all optical flares had NUV counterparts. We explore NUV/optical energy fractionation in M dwarf flares. Our findings reveal a slight decrease in the ratio of optical to NUV energies with increasing NUV energies, a trend in agreement with prior investigations on G-K stars' flares at higher energies. Our analysis yields an average NUV fraction of flaring time for M0-M3 dwarfs of 2.1\%, while for M4-M6 dwarfs, it is 5\%. We present an empirical relationship between NUV and optical flare energies and compare to predictions from radiative-hydrodynamic and blackbody models. We conducted a comparison of the flare frequency distribution (FFDs) of NUV and optical flares, revealing the FFDs of both NUV and optical flares exhibit comparable slopes across all spectral subtypes. NUV flares on stars affect the atmospheric chemistry, the radiation environment, and the overall potential to sustain life on any exoplanets they host. We find that early and mid-M dwarfs (M0-M5) have the potential to generate NUV flares capable of initiating abiogenesis.
#### On the roles of stellar rotation and binarity in NGC 2423's  main-sequence turnoff region

 - **Abstract**
 Research has shown that many young and intermediate-age clusters (younger than $\sim$2 Gyr) have extended main sequences and main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs), which cannot be adequately described by a single isochrone. The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone thorough rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 ($\sim$1 Gyrs old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system. This further suggests the validity of our numerical simulation results.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical spectral properties of 65 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph-Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS). These properties are compared with those of 195 non-BAL quasars from GNIRS-DQS in order to identify the drivers for the appearance of BALs in quasar spectra. In particular, we compare equivalent widths and velocity widths, as well as velocity offsets from systemic redshifts, of principal emission lines. In spite of the differences between their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra, we find that luminous BAL quasars are generally indistinguishable from their non-BAL counterparts in the rest-frame optical band at redshifts $1.55 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.50$. We do not find any correlation between BAL trough properties and the H$\beta$-based supermassive black hole masses and normalized accretion rates in our sample. Considering the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar sample, which includes the GNIRS-DQS sample, we find that a monochromatic luminosity at rest-frame 2500 A of $\gtrsim 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is a necessary condition for launching BAL outflows in quasars. We compare our findings with other BAL quasar samples and discuss the roles that accretion rate and orientation play in the appearance of BAL troughs in quasar spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Year 1 results of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide tighter constraints on small-scale cosmology, beyond the validity of linear perturbation theory. This heightens the demand for a computationally affordable prescription that can accurately capture nonlinearities in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models. The COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method, a cost-effective \textit{N}-body technique, has been proposed as a viable alternative to high-resolution \textit{N}-body simulations for training emulators of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. In this study, we evaluate this approach by employing COLA emulators to conduct a cosmic shear analysis with LSST-Y1 simulated data across three different nonlinear scale cuts. We use the $w$CDM model, for which the \textsc{EuclidEmulator2} (\textsc{ee2}) exists as a benchmark, having been trained with high-resolution \textit{N}-body simulations. We primarily utilize COLA simulations with mass resolution $M_{\rm part}\approx 8 \times 10^{10} ~h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and force resolution $\ell_{\rm force}=0.5 ~h^{-1}$Mpc, though we also test refined settings with $M_{\rm part}\approx 1 \times 10^{10} ~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ and force resolution $\ell_{\rm force}=0.17 ~h^{-1}$Mpc. We find the performance of the COLA emulators is sensitive to the placement of high-resolution \textit{N}-body reference samples inside the prior, which only ensure agreement in their local vicinity. However, the COLA emulators pass stringent criteria in goodness-of-fit and parameter bias throughout the prior, when $\Lambda$CDM predictions of \textsc{ee2} are computed alongside every COLA emulator prediction, suggesting a promising approach for extended models.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the luminosity distance of propagating gravitational waves can provide invaluable information on the geometry and content of our Universe. Due to the clustering of cosmic structures, in realistic situations we need to average the luminosity distance of events coming from patches inside a volume. In this work we evaluate, in a gauge-invariant and fully-relativistic treatment, the impact of cosmological perturbations on such averaging process. We find that clustering, lensing and peculiar velocity effects impact estimates for future detectors such as Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO. The signal-to-noise ratio of the angular power spectrum of the average luminosity distance over all the redshift bins is 17 in the case of binary black holes detected by Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We also provide fitting formulas for the corrections to the average luminosity distance due to general relativistic effects.
#### CRIRES$^+$ transmission spectroscopy of WASP-127b. Detection of the  resolved signatures of a supersonic equatorial jet and cool poles in a hot  planet

 - **Abstract**
 General circulation models of gas giant exoplanets predict equatorial jets that drive inhomogeneities across the planetary atmosphere. We studied the transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b during one transit in the K band with CRIRES+. Telluric and stellar signals were removed from the data using SYSREM and the planetary signal was investigated using the cross-correlation (CCF) technique. After detecting a spectral signal indicative of atmospheric inhomogeneities, we employed a Bayesian retrieval framework with a 2D modelling approach tailored to address this scenario. We detected strong signals of H$_2$O and CO, which exhibited not one but two distinct CCF peaks. The double peaked signal can be explained by a supersonic equatorial jet and muted signals at the poles, with the two peaks representing the signals from the planet's morning and evening terminators, respectively. We calculated an equatorial jet velocity of $7.7\pm0.2$km/s from our retrieved overall equatorial velocity and the planet's tidally locked rotation, and derive distinct atmospheric properties for the two terminators as well as the polar region. The evening terminator is found to be hotter than the morning terminator by $175^{+116}_{-133}$K and the muted signals from the poles can be explained by significantly lower temperatures or a high cloud deck. Our retrieval yields a solar C/O ratio and metallicity and challenges previous studies of WASP-127b's atmosphere. The presence of a double peaked signal highlights the importance of accounting for planetary 3D structure during interpretation of atmospheric signals. The measured supersonic jet velocity and the lack of signal from the polar regions, representing a detection of latitudinal inhomogeneity in a spatially unresolved target, showcases the power of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for the characterization of global circulation in exoplanets.
