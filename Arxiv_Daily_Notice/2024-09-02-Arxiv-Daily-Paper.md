#### Title:
          Separating Super-Puffs vs. Hot Jupiters Among Young Puffy Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Discoveries of close-in young puffy (R$_p \gtrsim$ 6 R$_\oplus$) planets raise the question of whether they are bona fide hot Jupiters or puffed-up Neptunes, potentially placing constraints on the formation location and timescale of hot Jupiters. Obtaining mass measurements for these planets is challenging due to stellar activity and noisy spectra. Therefore, we aim to provide independent theoretical constraints on the masses of these young planets based on their radii, incident fluxes, and ages, benchmarking to the planets of age $<$1 Gyr detected by Kepler, K2 and TESS. Through a combination of interior structure models, considerations of photoevaporative mass loss, and empirical mass-metallicity trends, we present the range of possible masses for 24 planets of age $\sim$10-900 Myr and radii $\sim$6-16 R$_\oplus$. We generally find that our mass estimates are in agreement with the measured masses and upper limits where applicable. There exist some outliers including super-puffs Kepler-51 b, c and V1298 Tau d, b, e, for which we outline their likely formation conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that most of the youngest planets ($\lesssim$ 100 Myr) tend to be puffed-up, Neptune-mass planets, while the true hot Jupiters are typically found around stars aged at least a few hundred Myr, suggesting the dominant origin of hot Jupiters to be late-stage high eccentricity migration.

 - **Abstract**
 Transiting planets around young stars are hard to find due to the enhanced stellar activity. Only a few transiting planets have been detected around stars younger than 100 Myr. We initially detected a transit-like signal in the K2 light curve of a very cool M dwarf star (EPIC 211101996) in the Pleiades open cluster, with an estimated age of about 100 Myr. Our detailed analysis of the per-pixel light curves, detrending with the Wōtan software and transit search with the Transit Least Squares algorithm showed that the source of the signal is a contaminant source (Gaia DR3 66767847894609792) 20" west of the target. The V-like shape of its phase-folded light curve and eclipse depth of ~15% suggest that it is a grazing eclipsing binary. The contaminant has hitherto been listed as a single star, which we now identify as an eclipsing stellar binary with a period of about 6 days.

          The MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White Dwarfs (MEOW) Survey: Mid-Infrared Excess Reveals a Giant Planet Candidate around a Nearby White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 The MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey is a cycle 2 JWST program to search for exoplanets around dozens of nearby white dwarfs via infrared excess and direct imaging. In this paper, we present the detection of mid-infrared excess at 18 and 21 microns towards the bright (V = 11.4) metal-polluted white dwarf WD 0310-688. The source of the IR excess is almost certainly within the system; the probability of background contamination is $<0.1\%$. While the IR excess could be due to an unprecedentedly small and cold debris disk, it is best explained by a $3.0^{+5.5}_{-1.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ cold (248$^{+84}_{-61}$ K) giant planet orbiting the white dwarf within the forbidden zone (the region where planets are expected to be destroyed during the star's red giant phase). We constrain the source of the IR excess to an orbital separation of 0.1-2 AU, marking the first discovery of a white dwarf planet candidate within this range of separations. WD 0310-688 is a young remnant of an A or late B-type star, and at just 10.4 pc it is now the closest white dwarf with a known planet candidate. Future JWST observations could distinguish the two scenarios by either detecting or ruling out spectral features indicative of a planet atmosphere.
#### Title:
          Deep learning approach for identification of HII regions during reionization in 21-cm observations -- III. image recovery

 - **Abstract**
 The low-frequency component of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKA-Low) will be sensitive enough to construct 3D tomographic images of the 21-cm signal distribution during reionization. However, foreground contamination poses challenges for detecting this signal, and image recovery will heavily rely on effective mitigation methods. We introduce \texttt{SERENEt}, a deep-learning framework designed to recover the 21-cm signal from SKA-Low's foreground-contaminated observations, enabling the detection of ionized (HII) and neutral (HI) regions during reionization. \texttt{SERENEt} can recover the signal distribution with an average accuracy of 75 per cent at the early stages ($\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}\simeq0.9$) and up to 90 per cent at the late stages of reionization ($\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}\simeq0.1$). Conversely, HI region detection starts at 92 per cent accuracy, decreasing to 73 per cent as reionization progresses. Beyond improving image recovery, \texttt{SERENEt} provides cylindrical power spectra with an average accuracy exceeding 93 per cent throughout the reionization period. We tested \texttt{SERENEt} on a 10-degree field-of-view simulation, consistently achieving better and more stable results when prior maps were provided. Notably, including prior information about HII region locations improved 21-cm signal recovery by approximately 10 per cent. This capability was demonstrated by supplying \texttt{SERENEt} with ionizing source distribution measurements, showing that high-redshift galaxy surveys of similar observation fields can optimize foreground mitigation and enhance 21-cm image construction.

          Deciphering the Milky Way disc formation time encrypted in the chrono-kinematics of the bar

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method to constrain the formation time of the Milky Way disc using the chrono-kinematic signatures of the inner Galaxy. We construct an O-rich Mira variable sample from the Gaia Long-period Variable catalogue to study the kinematic behaviour of stars with different ages in the inner Galaxy. From the Auriga suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, we find that the age of the oldest stellar population with imprints of the bar in density and kinematics matches the disc spin-up epoch. This is because stars born before the spin-up show insufficient rotation and are not kinematically cold enough to be efficiently trapped by the bar. We find that the bar kinematic signature disappears for Mira variables with a period shorter than 190 days. Using the period-age relation of Mira variables, we constrain the spin-up epoch of the Milky Way to be younger than $\sim11-12$~Gyr (redshift $\sim3$). We also discuss and compare our method and result to other evidence of the Milky Way spin-up epoch under the context of a realistic age uncertainty. Age uncertainty leads to an overestimation of the disc formation time when performing backward modelling. Our constrain of the spin-up epoch is independent from previous studies because it relies on the kinematics of the inner Galaxy instead of the solar vicinity.

          HighSpec: A High-Resolution Spectrograph for the MAST Telescope Array

 - **Abstract**
 We present the updated design of HighSpec, a high-resolution $\mathcal{R} \sim 20,000$ spectrograph designed for the Multi Aperture Spectroscopic Telescope (MAST). HighSpec offers three observing modes centered at the Ca II H&K, Mg b triplet, and H$\alpha$ lines. Each mode is supported by a highly optimized ion-etched grating, contributing to an exceptional instrument peak efficiency of $\gtrsim85\%$ for the two latter bands ($\gtrsim55\%$ for the Ca II H&K band). Optimizing throughput over wavelength coverage ($\Delta \lambda=10-17$ nm), HighSpec enables the precise measurement of spectral lines from faint targets. This approach is especially relevant for stellar object studies, specifically of WDs, which are intrinsically faint and have few spectroscopic lines. Each observing mode was tailored to target spectral features essential for WD research. Its integration with MAST, an array of 20 custom-designed telescopes that can function as a single large telescope (equivalent to a $2.7$ m telescope in collecting area) or multiplexing over the entire sky, provides unique adaptability for extensive and effective spectroscopic campaigns. Currently in its final assembly and testing stages, HighSpec's on-sky commissioning is scheduled for 2025.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterization of search selection effects comprises a core element of gravitational-wave data analysis. Knowledge of selection effects is needed to predict observational prospects for future surveys and is essential in the statistical inference of astrophysical source populations from observed catalogs of compact binary mergers. Although gravitational-wave selection functions can be directly measured via injection campaigns -- the insertion and attempted recovery of simulated signals added to real instrumental data -- such efforts are computationally expensive. Moreover, the inability to interpolate between discrete injections limits the ability to which we can study narrow or discontinuous features in the compact binary population. For this reason, there is a growing need for alternative representations of gravitational-wave selection functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate and can be computed across a continuous range of compact binary parameters. In this paper, we describe one such representation. Using pipeline injections performed during Advanced LIGO & Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3), we train a neural network emulator for $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$, the probability that given a compact binary with parameters is successfully detected, averaged over the course of O3. The emulator captures the dependence of $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$ on binary masses, spins, distance, sky position, and orbital orientation, and it is valid for compact binaries with components masses between $1$--$100\,M_\odot$. We test the emulator's ability to produce accurate distributions of detectable events, and demonstrate its use in hierarchical inference of the binary black hole population.

          gaspery: Optimized Scheduling of Radial Velocity Follow-Up Observations for Active Host Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Radial velocity (RV) follow-up is a critical complement of transiting exoplanet surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ), both for validating discoveries of exoplanets and measuring their masses. Stellar activity introduces challenges to interpreting these measurements because the noise from the host star, which is often correlated in time, can result in high RV uncertainty. A robust understanding of stellar activity and how its timescales interact with the observing cadence can optimize limited RV resources. For this reason, in the era of over-subscribed, high-precision RV measurements, folding stellar activity timescales into the scheduling of observation campaigns is ideal. We present gaspery, an open-source code implementation to enable the optimization of RV observing strategies. Gaspery employs a generalized formulation of the Fisher Information for RV time series that also incorporates information about stellar correlated noise. We show that the information contained in an observing strategy can be significantly affected by beat frequencies between the orbital period of the planet, the stellar rotation period, and the observation epochs. We investigate how the follow-up observing strategy will affect the resulting radial velocity uncertainty, as a function of stellar properties such as the spot decay timescale and rotation period. We then describe two example use cases for gaspery: 1) calculating the minimum number of observations to reach an uncertainty tolerance in a correlated noise regime and 2) finding an optimal strategy given a fixed observing budget. Finally, we outline a prescription for selecting an observing strategy that is generalizable to different targets.

          Composition, Structure and Origin of the Moon

 - **Abstract**
 Here we critically examine the geophysical and geochemical properties of the Moon in order to identify the extent to which dynamical scenarios satisfy these observations. New joint inversions of existing lunar geophysical data (mean mass, moment of inertia, and tidal response) assuming a laterally- and vertically homogeneous lunar mantle show that, in all cases, a core with a radius of 300$\pm$20 km ($\sim$0.8 to 1.5 % the mass of the Moon) is required. However, an Earth-like Mg# (0.89) in the lunar mantle results in core densities (7800$\pm$100 kg/m$^3$) consistent with that of Fe-Ni alloy, whereas FeO-rich compositions (Mg# = 0.80--0.84) require lower densities (6100$\pm$800 kg/m$^3$). Geochemically, we use new data on mare basalts to reassess the bulk composition of the Moon for 70 elements, and show that the lunar core likely formed near 5 GPa, 2100 K and $\sim$1 log unit below the iron-wüstite buffer. Moreover, the Moon is depleted relative to the Earth's mantle in elements with volatilities higher than that of Li, with this volatile loss likely having occurred at low temperatures (1400$\pm$100 K), consistent with mass-dependent stable isotope fractionation of moderately volatile elements (e.g., Zn, K, Rb). The identical nucleosynthetic (O, Cr, Ti) and radiogenic (W) isotope compositions of the lunar and terrestrial mantles, strongly suggest the two bodies were made from the same material, rather than from an Earth-like impactor. Rb-Sr in FANs and Lu-Hf and Pb-Pb zircon ages point Moon formation close to $\sim$4500 Ma. Taken together, there is no unambiguous geochemical or isotopic evidence for the role of an impactor in the formation of the Moon, implying perfect equilibration between the proto-Earth and Moon-forming material or alternative scenarios for its genesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared imaging of exoplanets and disks is now possible with the coronagraphs of the MIRI on the JWST. This wavelength range unveils new features of young directly imaged systems and allows us to obtain new constraints for characterizing the atmosphere of young giant exoplanets and associated disks. These observations aim to characterize the atmosphere of the planet HD 95086 b by adding mid-infrared information so that the various hypotheses about its atmospheric parameters values can be unraveled. Improved images of circumstellar disks are provided. We present the MIRI coronagraphic imaging of the system HD 95086 obtained with the F1065C, F1140, and F2300C filters at central wavelengths of 10.575, 11.3, and 23 microns, respectively. We explored the method for subtracting the stellar diffraction pattern in the particular case when bright dust emitting at short separation is present. Furthermore, we compared different methods for extracting the photometry of the planet. Using the atmospheric models Exo-REM and ATMO, we measured the atmospheric parameters of HD 95086 b. The planet HD 95086 b and the contribution from the inner disk are detected at the two shortest MIRI wavelengths F1065C and F1140C. The outer colder belt is imaged at 23 microns. The mid-infrared photometry provides better constraints on the atmospheric parameters. We evaluate a temperature of 850-1020 K, consistent with one previous hypothesis that only used NIR data. The radius measurement of 1.0-1.13 RJup is better aligned with evolutionary models, but still smaller than predicted. These observations allow us to refute the hypothesis of a warm circumplanetary disk. HD 95086 is one of the first exoplanetary systems to be revealed at mid-infrared wavelengths. This highlights the interests and challenges of observations at these wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main obstacles for the signal extraction of the three point correlation function using photometric surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will be the prohibitive computation time required for dealing with a vast quantity of sources. Brute force algorithms, which naively scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ with the number of objects, can be further improved with tree methods but not enough to deal with large scale correlations of Rubin's data. However, a harmonic basis decomposition of these higher order statistics reduces the time dramatically, to scale as a two-point correlation function with the number of objects, so that the signal can be extracted in a reasonable amount of time. In this work, we aim to develop the framework to use these expansions within the Limber approximation for scalar (or spin-0) fields, such as galaxy counts, weak lensing convergence or aperture masses. We develop an estimator to extract the signal from catalogs and different phenomenological and theoretical models for its description. The latter includes halo model and standard perturbation theory, to which we add a simple effective field theory prescription based on the short range of non-locality of cosmic fields, significantly improving the agreement with simulated data. In parallel to the modeling of the signal, we develop a code that can efficiently calculate three points correlations of more than 200 million data points (a full sky simulation with Nside=4096) in $\sim$40 minutes on a single high-performance computing node, enabling a feasible analysis for the upcoming LSST data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the cold gas phase in a low metallicity starburst generated in a high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger as part of the GRIFFIN project. The simulations resolve (4 M$_\odot$ gas phase mass resolution, $\sim$ 0.1 pc spatial resolution) the multi-phase interstellar medium with a non-equilibrium chemical heating/cooling network at temperatures below $10^4$ K. Massive stars are sampled individually and interact with the ISM through the formation of HII regions and supernova explosions. In the extended starburst phase, the ISM is dominated by cold ($T_\mathrm{gas} < 300$ K) filamentary clouds with self-similar internal structures. The clouds have masses of $10^{2.6}$ - $10^{5.6}$ M$_\odot$ with a power law mass function, $dN/dM \propto M^\alpha$ with $\alpha = -1.78 (\pm 0.08)$. They also follow the Larson relations, in good agreement with observations. We trace the lifecycle of the cold clouds and find that they follow an exponential lifetime distribution and an e-folding time of $\sim$ 3.5 Myr. Clouds with peak masses below $10^4$ M$_\odot$ follow a power law relation with their average lifetime $\tau_\mathrm{life} \propto M^{0.3}_\mathrm{max}$ which flattens out for higher cloud masses at $ < 10$ Myr. A similar relation exists between cloud size at peak mass and lifetime. This simulation of the evolution of a realistic galactic cold cloud population supports the rapid formation and disruption of star-forming clouds by stellar radiation and supernovae on a timescale less than 10 Myr.

          From de Sitter to de Sitter: A Thermal Approach to Running Vacuum Cosmology and the Non-Canonical Scalar Field Description

 - **Abstract**
 The entire classical cosmological history between two extreme de Sitter vacuum solutions is discussed based on Einstein's equations and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The initial non-singular de Sitter state is characterised by a very high energy scale which is equal or smaller than the reduced Planck mass. It is structurally unstable and all the continuous created matter, energy and entropy of the material component comes from the irreversible flow powered by the primeval vacuum energy density. The analytical expression describing the running vacuum is obtained from the thermal approach. It opens a new perspective to solve the old puzzles and current observational challenges plaguing the cosmic concordance model driven by a rigid vacuum. Such a scenario is also modelled through a non-canonical scalar field. It is demonstrated that the resulting scalar field model is shown to be step by step a faithful analytical representation of the thermal running vacuum cosmology.

          New theoretical instability regions and pulsational masses for blue large-amplitude pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered group of hot pulsating stars whose evolutionary status remains uncertain. We study the pulsation characteristics of BLAPs for the two main mass scenarios, $ 0.3 - 0.4 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ and $ 0.7 - 1.1 \: \rm M_{\odot} $, and compare them with observations to find evidence for either scenario. We compute about a half million linear BLAP models using MESA-RSP and compare the linear pulsation periods with the observed ranges of BLAP stars. For the low-mass scenario, BLAPs are in a region of the HR diagram where the growth rates are positive for the fundamental mode, and the model periods correspond well to the observed ones, assuming the reported luminosities of $ \sim 200 \: \rm L_{\odot} $. For the high-mass scenario, pulsations in the first overtone dominate. Assuming a larger range of luminosities, high-mass models could also explain all BLAPs, including the high-gravity BLAPs. Furthermore, we provide the first seismically constrained mass estimate for the first double-mode BLAP star, OGLE-BLAP-030. We find that a linear model with a mass of $ 0.62 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ matches the reported parameters of this star exactly, placing it in between the two mass scenarios. We also derive new period relations based on our models and all available observed BLAPs, and we find that the derived relations also support the low-mass scenario.

          On the Cosmic Variance of the Merger Rate Density of Binary Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic variance on the star formation history may lead to bias to the merger rate density estimation of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers by the compact binary population synthesis. In this paper, we take the advantage of the large boxsize of the Millennium Simulation combined with the semi-analytic galaxy formation model GABE, and the parameterized population binary star evolution (BSE) model to examine how much effect will the cosmic variance introduce on the estimation of merger rate density of BNS mergers. We find that for sub-box size of $100\rm Mpc$ and $200\rm Mpc$, the variance of merger rate density $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ at different redshift is about $23\%-35\%$ and $13\%-20\%$ respectively. On one hand, as for the variance of the detection rate on BNS mergers with current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, this value is very small $\lesssim 10\%$, which indicates ignoring the cosmic variance is reasonable for estimating the merger rate density from current LVK observation. On the other hand, with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, it is possible to localize BNS mergers within sub-boxes possessing length of $\rm 40 Mpc$ for source redshift $z_{s}<0.2$. In such a small box, the cosmic variance of the merger rate density is significant, i.e., the value of $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ is about $\sim 55\%$. This hints that estimating the merger rate density of BNS in different sky areas may provide useful information on the cosmic variance.

          Millimetre observations of the S-type AGB star $\chi$ Cygni: variability of the emission of the inner envelope

 - **Abstract**
 New observations are presented of millimetre line emissions of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of AGB star $\chi$ Cygni using the recently upgraded NOEMA array. $\chi$ Cygni is an S-type Mira variable, at the border between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, that has been observed for over 40 years to display features giving evidence for the strong role played by pulsation-associated shock waves in the generation of its wind. The new observations give evidence for a bright H$^{12}$CN(3-2) line emission confined to the very close neighbourhood of the star, however significantly more extended in 2024 than in 2023. Interpretation of such variability in terms of maser emission is considered but found to raise significant unanswered questions. Moreover, other unexpected features are observed in the very close neighbourhood of the star, including low Si$^{16}$O(6-5)/Si$^{17}$O(6-5), $^{28}$SiO(5-4)/$^{29}$SiO(5-4) and $^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1) line emission ratios. Possibly confirming the important role played by shocks, we discuss a measurement of the SiO(5-4)/SiO(6-5) emission ratio, evidence for a recent mass ejection particularly enhanced in the north-western red-shifted octant of the circumstellar envelope, leaving a depression of emission in its wake, and patterns of enhanced CO(2-1) line-emission suggesting an interpretation in terms of episodic outflows enhanced over solid angles associated with the surface of convective cells and on a time scale of a few decades. Unravelling the mechanisms underlying such newly observed features is very challenging and confirmation of the reported observations with improved sensitivity and angular resolution would be highly welcome. Observation of SiO maser emission in the ($\nu$=1,$J$=6-5) transition is reported for the first time.

 How and where the first generation of inner solar system planetesimals formed remains poorly understood. Potential formation regions are the silicate condensation line and water-snowline of the solar protoplanetary disk. Whether the chemical compositions of these planetesimals align with accretion at the silicate condensation line (water-free and reduced) or water-snowline (water-bearing and oxidized) is, however, unknown. Here we use Fe/Ni and Fe/Co ratios of magmatic iron meteorites to quantify the oxidation states of the earliest planetesimals associated with non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) reservoirs, representing the inner and outer solar system, respectively. Our results show that the earliest NC planetesimals contained substantial amounts of oxidized Fe in their mantles (3-19 wt% FeO). In turn, we argue that this required the accretion of water-bearing materials into these NC planetesimals. The presence of substantial quantities of moderately and highly volatile elements in their parent cores is also inconsistent with their accretion at the silicate condensation line and favors instead their formation at or beyond the water-snowline. Similar oxidation states in the early-formed parent bodies of NC iron meteorites and those of NC achondrites and chondrites with diverse accretion ages suggests that the formation of oxidized planetesimals from water-bearing materials was widespread in the early history of the inner solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of bicoherence analysis for Swift J1727.8-1613 during its 2023 outburst, using data from Insight-HXMT. Our analysis focused on observations with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of frequencies greater than 1 Hz, revealing that all of them belong to type C QPOs. We found a strong correlation between the QPO frequency and the hardness ratio, as well as a linear relationship between the QPO RMS and the hardness ratio. The bicoherence analysis revealed a transition from a "web" pattern to a "hypotenuse" pattern in the LE and HE energy bands. In the bicoherence patterns, there are correlations between horizontal and vertical bicoherence at $f_1=f_2=f_{\rm QPO}$ with count rates. The diagonal structure at $f_1+f_2=f_{\rm QPO}$ becomes more prominent with increasing energy. Additionally, we discovered a new bicoherence pattern in the medium energy band from 10 -- 20 keV, the diagonal structure at $f_1+f_2=f_{\rm har}$ is prominent only in this energy band, which we refer to as the "parallel" pattern. The bicoherence analysis indicates that the source is likely a low-inclination source.

 - **Abstract**
 As lensing of coherent astrophysical sources e.g. pulsars, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves becomes observationally relevant, the mathematical framework of Picard-Lefschetz theory has recently been introduced to fully account for wave optics effects. Accordingly, the concept of lensing images has been generalized to include complex solutions of the lens equation referred to as "imaginary images", and more radically, to the Lefschetz thimbles which are a sum of steepest descent contours connecting the real and imaginary images in the complex domain. In this wave-optics-based theoretical framework of lensing, we study the "Stokes phenomena" as the change of the topology of the Lefschetz thimbles. Similar to the well-known caustics at which the number of geometric images changes abruptly, the corresponding Stokes lines are the boundaries in the parameter space where the number of effective imaginary images changes. We map the Stokes lines for a few lens models. The resulting Stokes line-caustics network represents a unique feature of the lens models. The observable signature of the Stokes phenomena is the change of interference behavior, in particular the onset of frequency oscillation for some Stokes lines. We also demonstrate high-order Stokes phenomena where the system has a continuous number of effective images but with an abrupt change in the way they are connected to each other by the Lefschetz thimbles. Their full characterization calls for an analogy of the catastrophe theory for caustics.

 - **Abstract**
 Most exoplanets with a few Earth radii are more inflated than bare-rock planets with the same mass, indicating a substantial volatile amount. Neither the origin of the volatiles nor the planet's bulk composition can be constrained from the mass-radius relation alone, and the spectral characterization of their atmospheres is needed to solve this degeneracy. Previous studies showed that chemical interaction between accreted volatile and possible molten rocky surface (i.e., magma ocean) can greatly affects the atmospheric composition. However, a variety in the atmospheric compositions of such planets with different properties remains elusive. In this work, we examine the dependence of atmospheric H, O, and C on planetary parameters (atmospheric thickness, planetary mass, equilibrium temperature, and magma properties such as redox state) assuming nebula gas accretion on an Earth-like core, using an atmosphere-magma chemical equilibrium model. Consistent with previous work, we show that atmospheric $\rm H_{2}O$ fraction on a fully molten rocky interior with an Earth-like redox state is on the order of $10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$ regardless of other planetary parameters. Despite the solubility difference between H- and C-bearing species, C/H increases only a few times above the nebula value except for atmospheric pressure $\lesssim$1000 bar and $\rm H_{2}O$ fraction $\gtrsim$10\%. This results in a negative O/H-C/O trend and depleted C/O below one-tenth of the nebula gas value under an oxidized atmosphere, which could provide a piece of evidence of rocky interior and endogenic water. We also highlight the importance of constraints on the high-pressure material properties for interpreting the magma-atmospheric interaction of inflated planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted the first light curve study of the binary star EL Tuc within the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project framework. The photometric observations were made using standard multiband BVRI filters at an observatory in Argentina. We presented a new ephemeris for EL Tuc and a linear fit to the O-C diagram, utilizing our extracted times of minima and additional literature. We employed the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for the system's light curve analysis. The target system's light curve solution required a cold starspot on the hotter component. We conclude that EL Tuc is a total contact binary system with a low mass ratio of q=0.172+_0.002, an orbital inclination of i=83.74+_0.40 degree, and a fillout factor of f=53.7+_1.6%. We used the P-a relationship and the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) parallax method to determine the absolute parameters of EL Tuc to compare the precision of our results. This system was classified as W-type based on the mass and effective temperature of the companion stars. The positions of the systems were depicted on the M-L, M-R, T-M, and q-L_ratio diagrams. The relationship between the spectroscopic and photometric mass ratios of binaries was discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Python pipeline that was developed to simulate the high contrast mode images of the MICADO instrument. This mode will comprise three classical Lyot coronagraphs with different occulting spot sizes, one vector apodized phase plate, and two sparse aperture masks. One critical aspect of these modes lies in their sensitivity to aberrations, requiring careful integration of non common path aberrations, as well as turbulent adaptive optics (AO) residuals. Besides, they will be operated following a specific observing strategy based on pupil tracking mode. For these reasons, we have developed the MICADO SimulaTor for HIgh Contrast (MISTHIC) pipeline to simulate realistic image cubes and derive the expected performance of these modes. Several sources of aberrations can be included: turbulent AO residuals, but also static or rotating aberrations, amplitude aberrations, simple Zernike screens... Including MICADO's specific features, such as the absence of atmospheric dispersion prior to the coronagraphic focal plane mask, our intent is to make this pipeline available to the community. This tool can be used to prepare scientific observations with the high contrast mode of MICADO, by predicting the performance to be expected within the most realistic assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in the central molecular zone (CMZ) is suppressed with respect to that of the Galactic disk, and this is likely related to its high turbulent environment. This turbulence impedes the potential detection of prestellar cores. We present the temperature, density, and spatial structure of the CMZ molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, which has been proposed to host a prestellar cluster in the Sgr B2 region. We analysed multiple HC$_{3}$N rotational transitions that were observed with the IRAM 30m, APEX, Yebes 40m, and GBT radio telescopes, together with SMA+APEX spatially resolved maps. The spectral shape of HC$_{3}$N lines shows three velocity components: a broad component with a line width of 23 km s$^{-1}$ (C1), and two narrow components with line widths of 7.2 and 8.8 km s$^{-1}$ (C2 and C3). This suggests that a fraction of the molecular gas in this cloud is undergoing turbulence dissipation. From a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis we have found H$_{2}$ densities of 2$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, 5$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 4$\times$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperatures of 140 K, 30 K, and 80 K for C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The spatially resolved maps confirm that the colder and high-density condensations C2 and C3, which peak in the 70-85 km s$^{-1}$ velocity range, are embedded in a more diffuse and warmer gas (C1). The larger-scale structure of the Sgr B2 region shows a hole at 40-50 km s$^{-1}$ that is likely due to a small cloud that shocked the Sgr B2 region and is spatially related with a massive cloud at 60-80 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the impacting small cloud sequentially triggered the formation of Sgr B2(M), (N), and (S) and the condensations in G+0.693-0.027 during its passage. Based on the analysis of the masses of the two condensations and on the virial parameters, C2 might expand, while C3 might further fragment or collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 MICADO, the European Extremely Large Telescope first light imager will feature a dedicated high contrast imaging mode specifically designed for observing and characterizing exoplanets and circumstellar disks. Two sparse aperture masks (SAM) will be included, consisting of opaque masks with a set of holes arranged in a non-redundant configuration. Pupil masking transforms a monolithic telescope into an interferometer, with the aim of recovering spatial information down to the diffraction limit of the telescope and below, even in the presence of residual aberrations, such as turbulent AO residuals, and non common path aberrations. On the ELT, SAM will enable the detection of features down to 3.3mas in the J band, 12mas in the K band. Two designs have been chosen and will be reviewed, with complementarity in terms of sensitivity and spatial frequency coverage for image reconstruction. In this contribution, the technical choices will be detailed, such as the hole diameter and arrangement, given the technical constraints such as spectral filter bandwidths, detector dimensions, sampling, read-out-noise and frame rate. We will also report on simulations performed to assess the expected capabilities of this mode, with application examples of close companion detection and contrast curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a transiting sub-Saturn exoplanet TOI-6651b using PARAS-2 spectroscopic observations. The host, TOI-6651 ($m_{V}\approx 10.2$), is a sub-giant, metal-rich G-type star with $[{\rm Fe/H}] = 0.225^{+0.044}_{-0.045}$, $T_{\rm eff} = 5940\pm110\ \mathrm{K}$, and $\log{g} = 4.087^{+0.035}_{-0.032}$. Joint fitting of the radial velocities from PARAS-2 spectrograph and transit photometric data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveals a planetary mass of $61.0^{+7.6}_{-7.9}\ M_\oplus$ and radius of $5.09^{+0.27}_{-0.26}\ R_\oplus$, in a $5.056973^{+0.000016}_{-0.000018}$ day orbit with an eccentricity of $0.091^{+0.096}_{-0.062}$. TOI-6651b has a bulk density of $2.52^{+0.52}_{-0.44}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$, positioning it among the select few known dense sub-Saturns and making it notably the densest detected with TESS. TOI-6651b is consistent with the positive correlation between planet mass and the host star's metallicity. We find that a considerable portion $\approx$ 87% of the planet's mass consists of dense materials such as rock and iron in the core, while the remaining mass comprises a low-density envelope of H/He. TOI-6651b lies at the edge of the Neptunian desert, which will be crucial for understanding the factors shaping the desert boundaries. The existence of TOI-6651b challenges conventional planet formation theories and could be a result of merging events or significant atmospheric mass loss through tidal heating, highlighting the complex interplay of dynamical processes and atmospheric evolution in the formation of massive dense sub-Saturns.

          Impact of ice growth on the physical and chemical properties of dense cloud cores

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the effect of time-dependent ice growth on dust grains on the opacity and hence on the dust temperature in a collapsing molecular cloud core, with the aim of quantifying the effect of the dust temperature variations on ice abundances as well as the evolution of the collapse. We employed a one-dimensional collapse model that self-consistently and time-dependently combines hydrodynamics with chemical and radiative transfer simulations. The dust opacity was updated on-the-fly based on the ice growth as a function of location in the core. The results of the fully dynamical model were compared against simulations assuming fixed ice thickness. We found that the ice thickness increases fast and reaches a saturation value of approximately 90 monolayers in the central core (volume density $\sim$$10^4\,\rm cm^{-3}$), and several tens of monolayers at a volume density of $\sim$$10^3\,\rm cm^{-3}$, after only a few $10^5\,\rm yr$ of evolution. The results thus exclude the adoption of thin ($\sim$10 monolayer) ices in molecular cloud simulations except at very short timescales. The differences in abundances and dust temperature between the fully dynamic simulation and those with fixed dust opacity are small; abundances change between the solutions generally within a factor of two. The assumptions on the dust opacity do have an effect on the collapse dynamics through the influence of the photoelectric effect on the gas temperature, and the simulations take a different time to reach a common central density. In conclusion, carrying out chemical simulations using a dust temperature corresponding to a fixed opacity seems to be a good approximation. Still, although at least in the present case its effect on the overall results is limited - as long as the grains are monodisperse - ice growth should be considered to obtain the most accurate representation of the collapse dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale cosmic-ray detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) are pushing the boundaries of our ability to identify air shower events. Existing trigger schemes rely solely on the timing of signals detected by individual antennas, which brings many challenges in distinguishing true air shower signals from background. This work explores novel event-level radio trigger methods specifically designed for GRAND, but also applicable to other systems, such as the Radio Detector (RD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. In addition to an upgraded plane wave front reconstruction technique, we introduce orthogonal and complementary approaches that analyze the radio-emission footprint, the spatial distribution of signal strength across triggered antennas, to refine event selection. We test our methods on mock data sets constructed with simulated showers and real background noise measured with the GRAND prototype, to assess the performance potential in terms of sensitivity and background rejection in GRAND. Our preliminary results are a first step to identifying the most discriminating radio signal features at event-level, and optimizing the techniques for future implementation on experimental data.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: In the context of Galactic archaeology, the outer halo remains relatively unexplored with respect to its metallicity distribution, merger debris, and the abundance of known very/extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.5) stars. Aim: We utilize the Pristine survey's publicly available, Pristine data release 1 (PDR1) and Pristine-Gaia synthetic (PGS) catalogues of photometric metallicities, to select Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars in the outer halo. Methods: The RGB selection pipeline selects giants based on the absence of a well-measured parallax in the brightness range where dwarfs have reasonable parallax estimate from Gaia DR3 data. The photometric distances are calculated using a BaSTI-isochrone fitting code and the photometric metallicities. Results: Photometric distances derived from PDR1- and PGS-giants show typical uncertainties of 12% and a scatter of up to 20% and 40% respectively, when validated against inverted-parallax and Starhorse-code distances. The PDR1-giants catalogue provides a low-to-no bias view of the metallicity structure versus distance compared to the PGS-giants catalogue (with a distance-metallicity selection bias), while the PGS-giants catalogue provides an all-sky view of the outer halo, especially in the VMP end. The PDR1-giants catalogue is used to study the metallicity distribution function of the halo out to ~100 kpc, using Gaussian Mixture Model decomposition. Additionally, we use the PDR1-giants with radial velocities from spectroscopic surveys to map the metallicity view of the integrals-of-motion space where accreted dwarf galaxy debris conserve their orbital parameters for a long time. Using the PGS-giants catalogue, we associate 41 stars tentatively to the stellar counterpart of the Magellanic stream in the VMP end, out to 70 kpc. Conclusions: We publish two RGB catalogues between -4.0<[Fe/H]<+0.1 with reliable photometric distances and metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant barrier to achieving the radial velocity (RV) measurement accuracy and precision required to characterize terrestrial mass exoplanets is the existence of time-variable features in the measured spectra, from both telluric absorption and stellar variability, which affect measured line shapes and can cause apparent RV shifts. Reaching the desired accuracy using traditional techniques often requires avoiding lines contaminated by stellar variability and/or changing tellurics, and thus discarding a large fraction of the spectrum, lowering precision. New data-driven methods can help achieve extremely precise and accurate RVs by enabling the use of a larger fraction of the available data. While there exist methods for modeling telluric features or the stellar variability individually, there is a need for additional tools that are capable of modeling them simultaneously at the spectral level. Here we present StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl (SSOF), a Julia package for measuring Doppler shifts and creating data-driven models (with fast, physically-motivated Gaussian Process regularization) for the time-variable spectral features for both the telluric transmission and stellar spectrum, while accounting for the wavelength-dependent instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate SSOF's state-of-the-art performance on data from the NEID RV spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope for multiple stars. We show SSOF's, ability to accurately identify and characterize spectral variability and provide $\sim$2-6x smaller photon-limited errors over the NEID CCF-based pipeline and match the performance of SERVAL, a leading template-based pipeline, using only observed EPRV spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $20^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.

 - **Abstract**
 New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination from singly ionized iron emission is one of the greatest obstacles to determining the intensity of emission lines in the UV and optical wavelength ranges. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the FeII emission in the bright quasar RM 102, based on the most recent version of the CLOUDY software, with the goal of simultaneously reproducing UV and optical FeII emission. We employ a constant pressure model for the emitting clouds, instead of the customary constant density assumption. The allowed parameter range is broad, with metallicity up to 50 times the solar value and turbulent velocity up to 100 km s$^{-1}$ for a subset of models. We also consider geometrical effects that could enhance the visibility of the non-illuminated faces of the clouds, as well as additional mechanical heating. Our investigation reveals that the broad line region of RM 102 is characterized by highly metallic gas. The observed FeII features provide strong evidence for an inflow pattern geometry that favours the dark sides of clouds over isotropic emission. This study confirms the presence of chemically enriched gas in the broad line region of bright quasars, represented by RM 102, which is necessary to explain the strong FeII emission and its characteristic features. Additionally, we report that CLOUDY currently still lacks certain transitions in its atomic databases which prevents it from fully reproducing some observed FeII features in quasar spectra.

 The GAia Map of the Brightness Of the Natural Sky (GAMBONS) is a model to map the natural night brightness of the sky in cloudless and moonless nights. It computes the star radiance from the photometric data in Gaia and Hipparcos catalogues, adding the contributions of the diffuse galactic and extragalactic light, zodiacal light and airglow, and taking into account the effects of atmospheric attenuation and scattering. The model allows computing the natural sky brightness in any given photometric band for a ground-based observer, if appropriate transformations from the Gaia bands are available. In this work we present the most recent improvements of the model, including the use of Gaia EDR3 data, the inclusion of a wide set of photometric bands and the derivation of additional sky brightness indicators, as the horizontal irradiance and the average hemispheric radiance

We study the evolution of abundance gradients in the Milky Way by taking advantage of a large sample of open clusters, which are among the best tracers for this purpose. In particular, we use data from the last release of the Gaia-ESO survey. Methods. We perform careful selection of open cluster stars excluding those that may be affected by biases in spectral analysis. The cleaned open clusters sample is compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, using well tested stellar yields and prescription for radial migration. Different scenarios of Galaxy evolution are tested to explain the data, i.e. the two-infall and the three-infall frameworks, suggesting that the chemical thin disk is formed by one or two subsequent gas accretion episodes, respectively. Results. With the performed selection in cluster stars, we still find a metallicity decrease between intermediate age (1<Age/Gyr<3) and young (Age<1Gyr) open clusters. This decrease cannot be explained in the context of the two-infall scenario, even by accounting for the effect of migration and yield prescriptions. The three-infall model, with its late gas accretion in the last 3 Gyr, can explain the low metallic content in young clusters. However, we invoke a milder metal dilution relative to previous findings. Conclusions. To explain the observed low metallic content in young clusters, we propose that a late gas accretion episode triggering metal dilution should have taken place, extending the framework of the three-infall model for the first time to the entire Galactic disk.

 Over the past three decades, multiple reverberation mapping (RM) campaigns conducted for the quasar PG 2130+099 have exhibited inconsistent findings with time delays ranging from $\sim$10 to $\sim$200 days. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR) in PG 2130+099, we continued an ongoing high-cadence RM monitoring campaign using the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m optical telescope for an extra four years from 2019 to 2022. We measured the time lags of several broad emission lines (including He II, He I, H$\beta$, and Fe II) with respect to the 5100 Å continuum, and their time lags continuously vary through the years. Especially, the H$\beta$ time lags exhibited approximately a factor of two increase in the last two years. Additionally, the velocity-resolved time delays of the broad H$\beta$ emission line reveal a back-and-forth change between signs of virial motion and inflow in the BLR. The combination of negligible ($\sim$10%) continuum change and substantial time-lag variation (over two times) results in significant scatter in the intrinsic $R_{\rm H\beta}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relationship for PG 2130+099. Taking into account the consistent changes in the continuum variability time scale and the size of the BLR, we tentatively propose that the changes in the measurement of the BLR size may be affected by 'geometric dilution'.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce picasso, a model designed to predict thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium based on the properties of halos in gravity-only simulations. The predictions result from the combination of an analytical gas model, mapping gas properties to the gravitational potential, and of a machine learning model to predict the model parameters for individual halos based on their scalar properties, such as mass and concentration. Once trained, the model can be applied to make predictions for arbitrary potential distributions, allowing its use with flexible inputs such as N-body particle distributions or radial profiles. We present the model, and train it using pairs of gravity-only and hydrodynamic simulations. We show that when trained on non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations, picasso can make remarkably accurate and precise predictions of intracluster gas thermodynamics. Training the model on full-physics simulations yields robust predictions as well, albeit with slightly degraded performance. We further show that the model can be trained to make accurate predictions from very minimal information, at the cost of modestly reduced precision. picasso is made publicly available as a Python package, which includes trained models that can be used to make predictions easily and efficiently, in a fully auto-differentiable and hardware-accelerated framework.
