 - **Abstract**
 We show evidence of particle acceleration at GEV energies associated directly with protons from the prompt emission of a long-duration M6-class solar flare on July 17, 2023, rather than from protons acceleration by shocks from its associated Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), which erupted with a speed of 1342 km/s. Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) accelerated by the blast have reached Earth, up to an almost S3 (strong) category of a radiation storm on the NOAA scale. Also, we show a temporal correlation between the fast rising of GOES-16 proton and muon excess at ground level in the count rate of the New-Tupi muon detector at the central SAA region. A Monte Carlo spectral analysis based on muon excess at New-Tupi is consistent with the acceleration of electrons and protons (ions) up to relativistic energies (GeV energy range) in the impulsive phase of the flare. In addition, we present another two marginal particle excesses (with low confidence) at ground-level detectors in correlation with the solar flare prompt emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.
#### Assessing your Observatory's Impact: Best Practices in Establishing and  Maintaining Observatory Bibliographies

 - **Abstract**
 Observatories need to measure and evaluate the scientific output and overall impact of their facilities. An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory's data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00105
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we elaborate on correctly predicting \'Echelle spectrograms by employing the fully three-dimensional representation of Snell's law to model the effects of prisms as cross-dispersers in \'Echelle spectrographs. We find that it is not sufficient to simply apply the frequently used trigonometric prism dispersion equation to describe recorded spectra. This vector equation approach is not limited to a single dispersive element when modeling multi-prism cross-disperser configurations. Our results help to understand the main levers in an \'Echelle spectrograph as well as contribute to auto-calibration algorithms for minimizing calibration efforts in daily operation.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-type stars are the most abundant in the galactic stellar population. These stars, with a similar internal structure to the Sun, are expected to have solar-like atmospheres. Investigating the stellar parameters and chemical abundances on late-type stars is essential to provide valuable constraints about stellar age, chemical evolution, and atmosphere of exoplanets. In this work, we present the study of the Near-UV and optical spectroscopic observation of three late-type stars: HR 8038, AC Her, and HD 76446, as obtained from the 36-inch MIRA/Oliver Observing Station. We derived surface temperature, gravity, metallicity, and the chemical abundances of light element Carbon in the stellar atmosphere. The elemental abundance of the Carbon for HR 8038, AC Her, and HD 76446 are derived to be 95%, 97%, and 108%, respectively, of the solar value.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an X-ray and UV investigation of five X-ray flares detected on two active systems, CC Eri and AB Dor, using the AstroSat observatory. The peak X-ray luminosities of the flares in the 0.3$-$7.0 keV band are found to be within 10$^{31-33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Preliminary spectral analysis indicates the presence of three and four-temperature corona for CC Eri and AB Dor, respectively, where the highest temperature is found to vary with flare. The flare temperatures peaked at 51$-$59 MK for CC Eri and 29$-$44 MK for AB Dor. The peak emission measures of the flaring loops are estimated to be $\sim$10$^{54}$ for CC Eri and $\sim$10$^{55}$ cm$^{-3}$ for AB Dor. Global metallic abundances were also found to increase during flares.

 - **Abstract**
 The FIR distribution at high Galactic latitudes, observed with Planck, is filamentary with coherent structures in polarization. These structures are also closely related to HI filaments with coherent velocity structures. There is a long-standing debate about the physical nature of these structures. They are considered either as velocity caustics, fluctuations engraved by the turbulent velocity field or as cold three-dimensional density structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). We discuss different approaches to data analysis and interpretation in order to work out the differences. We considered mathematical preliminaries for the derivation of caustics that characterize filamentary structures in the ISM. Using the Hessian operator, we traced individual FIR filamentary structures in HI from channel maps as observed and alternatively from data that are provided by the velocity decomposition algorithm (VDA). VDA is claimed to separate velocity caustics from density effects. Based on the strict mathematical definition, the so-called velocity caustics are not actually caustics. These VDA data products may contain caustics in the same way as the original HI observations. Caustics derived by a Hessian analysis of both databases are nearly identical with a correlation coefficient of 98%. However, the VDA algorithm leads to a 30% increase in the alignment uncertainties when fitting FIR/HI orientation angles. We used HI absorption data to constrain the physical nature of FIR/HI filaments and determine spin temperatures and volume densities of FIR/HI filaments. HI filaments exist as CNM structures; outside the filaments no CNM absorption is detectable. The CNM in the diffuse ISM is exclusively located in filaments with FIR counterparts. These filaments at high Galactic latitudes exist as cold density structures; velocity crowding effects are negligible.
#### Survivability of Amorphous Ice in Comets Depends on the Latent Heat of  Crystallization of Impure Water Ice

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00231
 - **Abstract**
 Comets would have amorphous ice rather than crystalline one at the epoch of their accretion. Cometary ice contains some impurities that govern the latent heat of ice crystallization, $L_{\rm cry}$. However, it is still controversial whether the crystallization process is exothermic or endothermic. In this study, we perform one-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution of km-sized comets and investigate the effect of the latent heat. We find that the depth where amorphous ice can survive significantly depends on the latent heat of ice crystallization. Assuming the cometary radius of 2 km, the depth of the amorphous ice mantle is approximately 100 m when the latent heat is positive (i.e., the exothermic case with $L_{\rm cry} = + 9 \times 10^{4}$ J/kg). In contrast, when we consider the impure ice representing the endothermic case with $L_{\rm cry} = - 9 \times 10^{4}$ J/kg, the depth of the amorphous ice mantle could exceed 1 km. Although our numerical results indicate that these depths depend on the size and the accretion age of comets, the depth in a comet with the negative latent heat is a few to several times larger than the positive case for a given comet size. This work suggests that the spatial distribution of the ice crystallinity in a comet nucleus depends on the latent heat, which can be different from the previous estimates assuming pure water ice.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most prominent scientific drivers of the next generation of ground-based telescopes. Typically, Earth-like exoplanets are located at small angular separations from their host stars, making their detection difficult. Consequently, the adaptive optics (AO) system's control algorithm must be carefully designed to distinguish the exoplanet from the residual light produced by the host star. A new promising avenue of research to improve AO control builds on data-driven control methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is an active branch of the machine learning research field, where control of a system is learned through interaction with the environment. Thus, RL can be seen as an automated approach to AO control, where its usage is entirely a turnkey operation. In particular, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to cope with both temporal and misregistration errors. Similarly, it has been demonstrated to adapt to non-linear wavefront sensing while being efficient in training and execution. In this work, we implement and adapt an RL method called Policy Optimization for AO (PO4AO) to the GHOST test bench at ESO headquarters, where we demonstrate a strong performance of the method in a laboratory environment. Our implementation allows the training to be performed parallel to inference, which is crucial for on-sky operation. In particular, we study the predictive and self-calibrating aspects of the method. The new implementation on GHOST running PyTorch introduces only around 700 microseconds in addition to hardware, pipeline, and Python interface latency. We open-source well-documented code for the implementation and specify the requirements for the RTC pipeline. We also discuss the important hyperparameters of the method, the source of the latency, and the possible paths for a lower latency implementation.

 - **Abstract**
 Synthetic data sets are used in cosmology to test analysis procedures, to verify that systematic errors are well understood and to demonstrate that measurements are unbiased. In this work we describe the methods used to generate synthetic datasets of Lyman-$\alpha$ quasar spectra aimed for studies with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In particular, we focus on demonstrating that our simulations reproduces important features of real samples, making them suitable to test the analysis methods to be used in DESI and to place limits on systematic effects on measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We present a set of mocks that reproduce the statistical properties of the DESI early data set with good agreement. Additionally, we use full survey synthetic data to forecast the BAO scale constraining power with DESI.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been more than 30 years since the enigmatic 21 {\mu}m emission feature was first discovered in protoplanetary nebulae (PPNs). Although dozens of different dust carrier candidates have been proposed, there is as yet no widely accepted one. We present the results of molecular observations toward 21{\mu}m objects using the 10m Submillimeter Telescope of Arizona Radio Observatory at the 1.3 mm band and the 13.7 m telescope of Purple Mountain Observatory at the 3mm band, aiming to investigate whether the gas-phase environments of these unusual sources have some peculiarities compared to normal PPNs. We detect 31 emission lines belonging to seven different molecular species, most of which are the first detection in 21 {\mu}m PPNs. The observations provide clues on the identification of the 21 {\mu}m feature. We report a correlation study between the fractional abundance of gas-phase molecules and the strengths of the 21 {\mu}m emission. Our study shows that given the small sample size, the 21 {\mu}m feature has weak or no correlations with the gas-phase molecules. Future radio observations of high spatial and spectral resolution toward a large sample are desirable to elucidate the 21 {\mu}m emission phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted 4-night multiwavelength observations of an active M-dwarf star EV Lac on 2022 October 24$-$27 with simultaneous coverage of soft X-rays (NICER; 0.2$-$12 $\mathrm{keV}$, Swift XRT; 0.2$-$10 $\mathrm{keV}$), near-ultraviolet (Swift UVOT/UVW2; 1600$-$3500 \r{A}), optical photometry (TESS; 6000$-$10000 \r{A}), and optical spectroscopy (Nayuta/MALLS; 6350$-$6800 \r{A}). During the campaign, we detected a flare starting at 12:28 UTC on October 25 with its white-light bolometric energy of $3.4 \times 10^{32}$ erg. At about 1 hour after this flare peak, our $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ spectrum showed a blue-shifted excess component at its corresponding velocity of $\sim 100 \: \mathrm{km \: s^{-1}}$. This may indicate that the prominence erupted with a 1-hour delay of the flare peak. Furthermore, the simultaneous 20-second cadence near-ultraviolet and white-light curves show gradual and rapid brightening behaviors during the rising phase at this flare. The ratio of flux in NUV to white light at the gradual brightening was $\sim 0.49$, which may suggest that the temperature of the blackbody is low ($< 9000 \: \mathrm{K}$) or the maximum energy flux of a nonthermal electron beam is less than $5\times10^{11} \: \mathrm{erg \: cm^{-2} \: s^{-1}}$. Our simultaneous observations of NUV and white-light flare raise the issue of a simple estimation of UV flux from optical continuum data by using a blackbody model.
#### CMB lensing from early-formed dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 Some theoretical models for the early universe predict a spike-type enhancement in the primordial power spectrum on a small scale, which would result in forming early-formed dark matter halos (EFHs). In this work, we study the CMB lensing effect, considering the existence of EFHs, and investigate the potential to probe the EFHs and the primordial perturbations on scales smaller than $1\mathrm{Mpc}$. We numerically calculate the angular power spectrum of the lensing potential and the lensed CMB anisotropy of temperature, E-mode, and B-mode polarization, including the nonlinear effects of EFHs. We find the possibility that the lensed CMB temperature anisotropy is significantly enhanced on small scales, $\ell>1000$, and could be tested by component decomposition of observed signals through multi-frequency observations. Through the calculation with different models of the spiky-type power spectrum, we demonstrate that the accurate measurements of the CMB lensing effect would provide insight into the abundance of EFHs within the limited mass range around $10^{12}M_\odot$ and the primordial power spectrum on the limited scales around $k\sim 1\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In particular, we find that the existence of such EFHs can amplify the lensed anisotropy of CMB B-mode polarization even on large scales, $\ell <100$, as the overall enhancement by $\sim 10 \%$ level compared to the standard structure formation model without EFHs. Therefore, future CMB measurements such as the LiteBIRD satellite can probe the existence of the EFHs and the spike-type primordial power spectrum through the precise measurement of the large-scale CMB B-mode polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the physical properties of stars, and putting these properties into the context of stellar evolution, is a core challenge in astronomical research. A key visualization in studying stellar evolution is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), organizing data about stellar luminosity and colour into a form that is informative about stellar structure and evolution. However, connecting the HRD with other sources of information, including stellar time series, is an outstanding challenge. Here we present a new method to turn stellar time series into sound. This method encodes physically meaningful features such that auditory comparisons between sonifications of different stars preserve astrophysical differences between them. We present an interactive multimedia version of the HRD that combines both visual and auditory components and that allows exploration of different types of stars both on and off the main sequence through both visual and auditory media.
#### Production of s-process elements in AGB stars as revealed by Gaia  GSP-spec abundances

 - **Abstract**
 The recent parameterisation by the GSP-spec module of Gaia/RVS spectra has produced an homogeneous catalogue of about 174,000 AGB stars. Among the 13 chemical elements presented in this catalogue, the abundance of 2 of them (Ce and Nd) have been estimated in most of these AGBs. These 2 species formed by slow n-captures in the interior of low- and intermediate-mass stars, belong to the family of 2nd-peak s-process elements. We defined a working sample of 19,544 AGB stars with high-quality Ce and/or Nd abundances, selected by applying a specific combination of the GSP-spec quality flags. We compared these abundances with the yield production predicted by AGB stars evolutionary models. We found a good correlation between the Ce and Nd abundances, confirming the high quality of the derived abundances and that these species indeed belong to the same s-process family. We also found higher Ce and Nd abundances for more evolved AGB stars of similar metallicity, illustrating the successive mixing episodes enriching the AGB star surface. We then compared the observed Ce and Nd abundances with the FRUITY and Monash AGB yields and found that the higher Ce and Nd abundances cannot be explained by AGB stars of masses higher than 5Msun. In contrast, the yields predicted by both models for AGB stars with an initial mass between ~1.5 and ~2.5Mssun and metallicities between ~-0.5 and ~0.0dex are fully compatible with the observed GSP-spec abundances. This work based on the largest catalogue of high-quality second-peak s-element abundances in O-rich AGB stars allows evolutionary models to be constrained and confirms the fundamental role played by low- and intermediate-mass stars in the enrichment of the Universe in these chemical species.
#### The structure of the stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy explored with  the NB515 for Subaru/HSC. I.: New Insights on the stellar halo up to 120 kpc

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the M31 halo and its substructure within a projected radius of 120 kpc using a combination of Subaru/HSC NB515 and CFHT/MegaCam g- & i-bands. We succeed in separating M31's halo stars from foreground contamination with $\sim$ 90 \% accuracy by using the surface gravity sensitive NB515 filter. Based on the selected M31 halo stars, we discover three new substructures, which associate with the Giant Southern Stream (GSS) based on their photometric metallicity estimates. We also produce the distance and photometric metallicity estimates for the known substructures. While these quantities for the GSS are reproduced in our study, we find that the North-Western stream shows a steeper distance gradient than found in an earlier study, suggesting that it is likely to have formed in an orbit closer to the Milky Way. For two streams in the eastern halo (Stream C and D), we identify distance gradients that had not been resolved. Finally, we investigate the global halo photometric metallicity distribution and surface brightness profile using the NB515-selected halo stars. We find that the surface brightness of the metal-poor and metal-rich halo populations, and the all population can be fitted to a power-law profile with an index of $\alpha = -1.65 \pm 0.02$, $-2.82\pm0.01$, and $-2.44\pm0.01$, respectively. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo profile, its photometric metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with nonmonotonic trends with radius, suggesting that the halo population had insufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical compositions of stars encode the history of the universe and are thus fundamental for advancing our knowledge of astrophysics and cosmology. However, measurements of elemental abundances ratios, and our interpretations of them, strongly depend on the physical assumptions that dictate the generation of synthetic stellar spectra. Three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (3D RHD) ``box-in-a-star'' simulations of stellar atmospheres offer a more realistic representation of surface convection occurring in late-type stars compared to traditional one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic models. As evident from a multitude of observational tests, the coupling of 3D RHD models with line-formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) today provides a solid foundation for abundance analysis for many elements. This review describes the ongoing and transformational work to advance the state-of-the-art and replace 1D LTE spectrum synthesis with its 3D non-LTE counterpart. In summary: 1) 3D and non-LTE effects are intricately coupled and consistent modelling thereof is necessary for high-precision abundances, which is currently feasible for individual elements in large surveys. Mean 3D (<3D>) models are not adequate as substitutes. 2) The solar abundance debate is presently dominated by choices and systematic uncertainties that are not specific to 3D non-LTE modelling. 3) 3D non-LTE abundance corrections have a profound impact on our understanding of FGK-type stars, exoplanets, and the nucleosynthetic origins of the elements.

 - **Abstract**
 For decades, the spectral variations of Beta Pictoris have been modelled as the result of the evaporation of exocomets close to the star, termed falling evaporating bodies (FEBs). Resonant perturbations by a giant planet have been proposed to explain the dynamical origin of these stargrazers. The disk is now known to harbour two giant planets, Beta Pic b and c, orbiting the star at 9.9 au and 2.7 au. While the former almost matches the planet formerly suspected, the discovery of the latter complicates the picture. We first question the stability of the two-planet system. Then we investigate the dynamics of a disk of planetesimals orbiting the star with both planets to check the validity of the FEB generation mechanism. Symplectic N-body simulations are used to determine which regions of the planetesimal disk are dynamically stable. Then we focus on regions where disk particles are able to reach high eccentricities thanks to resonant mechanisms. The first result is that the system is dynamically stable. Both planets may temporarily fall in 7:1 mean motion resonance (MMR). Then, simulations reveal that the whole region extending between ~1.5 au and ~25 au is unstable to planetary perturbations. However, a disk below 1.5 au survives, which appears to constitute an active source of FEBs via high-order MMRs with Beta Pic c. Beta Pic b acts as a distant perturber that helps sustain the whole process. These simulations rule out the preceding FEB generation mechanism model, which placed their origin at around 4-5 au. Conversely, FEBs are likely to originate from a region much further in and related to MMRs with Beta Pic c. That mechanism also appears to last longer, as new planetesimals are able to continuously enter the MMRs and evolve towards the FEB state. Subsequently, the physical nature of the FEBs may differ from that previously thought, and presumably may not be icy.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of He-core remnants of the primary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their H/He envelopes due to the mass exchange. They are expected to be observed as (1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and WR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy, but none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive predictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their companions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations, to enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations, and to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the previously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars and applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the code MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass He-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar ones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass loss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of common envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than expected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7) solar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of He-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified neither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a significant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several hundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 We have used data from the Outer Galaxy High-Resolution Survey (OGHReS) to refine the velocities, distances, and physical properties of a large sample of 3584 clumps detected in far infrared/submillimetre emission in the HiGAL survey located in the $\ell = 250^\circ-280^\circ$ region of the Galactic plane. Using $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO spectra, we have determined reliable velocities to 3412 clumps (95% of the sample). In comparison to the velocities from the HiGAL catalogue, we find good agreement for 80% of the sample (within 5 km/s). Using the higher resolution and sensitivity of OGHReS has allowed us to correct the velocity for 632 clumps and provide velocities for 687 clumps for which no velocity had been previously allocated. The velocities are used with a rotation curve to refine the distances to the clumps and to calculate the clumps' properties using a distance-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. We have determined reliable physical parameters for 3200 outer Galaxy dense clumps (~90% of the HiGAL sources in the region). We find a trend of decreasing luminosity-to-mass ratio with increasing Galactocentric distance, suggesting the star formation efficiency is lower in the outer Galaxy or that it is resulting in more lower mass stars than in the inner Galaxy. We also find a similar surface density for protostellar clumps located in the inner and outer Galaxy, revealing that the surface density requirements for star formation are the same across the Galactic disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is tasked with the detection and characterization of gravitational waves from various sources in the universe. This endeavor is challenged by transient displacement and acceleration noise artifacts, commonly called glitches. Uncalibrated glitches impact the interferometric measurements and decrease the signal quality of LISA's time-delay interferometry (TDI) data used for astrophysical data analysis. The paper introduces a novel calibration pipeline that employs a neural network ensemble to detect, characterize, and mitigate transient glitches of diverse morphologies. A convolutional neural network is designed for anomaly detection, accurately identifying and temporally pinpointing anomalies within the TDI time series. Then, a hybrid neural network is developed to differentiate between gravitational wave bursts and glitches, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) network architecture is deployed for glitch estimation. The LSTM network acts as a TDI inverter by processing noisy TDI data to obtain the underlying glitch dynamics. Finally, the inferred noise transient is subtracted from the interferometric measurements, enhancing data integrity and reducing biases in the parameter estimation of astronomical targets. We propose a low-latency solution featuring generalized LSTM networks primed for rapid response data processing and alert service in high-demand scenarios like predicting binary black hole mergers. The research highlights the critical role of machine learning in advancing methodologies for data calibration and astrophysical analysis in LISA.
