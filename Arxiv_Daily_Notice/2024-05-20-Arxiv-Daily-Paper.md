 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental constants at recombination can differ from their present-day values due to degeneracies in cosmological parameters, raising the possibility of yet-undiscovered physics coupled directly to the Standard Model. We study the cosmology of theories in which a new, hyperlight scalar field modulates the electron mass and fine-structure constant at early times. We find new degeneracies in cosmologies that pair early recombination with a new contribution to the matter density arising at late times, whose predictions can be simultaneously consistent with CMB and low-redshift distance measurements. Such "late dark matter" already exists in the Standard Model in the form of massive neutrinos, but is necessarily realized by the scalar responsible for shifting the early-time fundamental constants. After detailing the physical effects of varying constants and hyperlight scalar fields on cosmology, we find that variations of the electron mass and fine structure constant are constrained at the percent and permille level, respectively, and a hyperlight scalar in the mass range $10^{-32}~\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\mathrm{eV}$ can impact what variations are allowed while composing up to a percent of the present dark matter density. We comment on the potential for models with a varying electron mass to reconcile determinations of the Hubble constant from cosmological observations and distance-ladder methods, and we show that parameter inference varies significantly between recent baryon acoustic oscillation and type Ia supernova datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing celestial objects and advancing our scientific knowledge about them involves tedious planning, scheduling, data collection and data post-processing. Many of these operational aspects of astronomy are guided and executed by expert astronomers. Reinforcement learning is a mechanism where we (as humans and astronomers) can teach agents of artificial intelligence to perform some of these tedious tasks. In this paper, we will present a state of the art overview of reinforcement learning and how it can benefit astronomy.

          Wide Binary Orbits are Preferentially Aligned with the Orbits of Small Planets, but Probably Not Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the relative orientations of the orbits of exoplanets and wide-orbiting binary companions (semimajor axis greater than 100 AU) can shed light on how planets form and evolve in binary systems. Previous observations by multiple groups discovered a possible alignment between the orbits of visual binaries and the exoplanets that reside in them. In this study, using data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and TESS, we confirm the existence of an alignment between the orbits of small planets $(R<6 R_\oplus)$ and binary systems with semimajor axes below 700 AU ($p=10^{-6}$). However, we find no statistical evidence for alignment between planet and binary orbits for binary semimajor axes greater than 700 AU, and no evidence for alignment of large, closely-orbiting planets (mostly hot Jupiters) and binaries at any separation. The lack of orbital alignment between our large planet sample and their binary companions appears significantly different from our small planet sample, even taking into account selection effects. Therefore, we conclude that any alignment between wide-binaries and our sample of large planets (predominantly hot Jupiters) is probably not as strong as what we observe for small planets in binaries with semimajor axes less than 700 AU. The difference in the alignment distribution of hot Jupiters and smaller planets may be attributed to the unique evolutionary mechanisms occuring in systems that form hot Jupiters, including potentially destabilizing secular resonances that onset as the protoplanetary disk dissipates and high-eccentricity migration occurring after the disk is gone.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to the recent space-borne mission Gaia, there is a nearly complete sample of white dwarfs up to about 100 parsecs from the Sun, which may have very diverse origins. We aim to compute the Galactic orbits for white dwarfs observed in our Solar neighborhood, in order to analyze the most probable regions of the Galaxy where they could have formed, the distribution of their orbital parameters, as well as the observational biases introduced when constructing the local sample. We used a detailed Galactic orbit integration package, in conjunction with a detailed population synthesis code specifically designed to replicate the different Galactic components of the white dwarf population. Synthetic stars are generated based on the current observational sample, and subsequently, their orbital integration allows for the reconstruction of the population past history. Our kinematic analysis reveals that the majority of thin disk, thick disk, and halo white dwarfs will have left our 100 pc neighborhood in approximately 3.30, 1.05, and 0.6 Myr, respectively. The spatial distribution of the integrated thin disk orbits suggests that 68 percent of these stars were formed at less than 1 kpc from the Sun, while most of thick disk members suffered from radial disk migration. The local halo white dwarfs typically belong to the "inner halo", being their orbits mostly planar and not extending beyond R = 20-25 kpc. Despite the observational bias, the distribution of orbital parameters is well represented by the observed sample. The Solar neighborhood is a transitory concept, which must be taken into account when analyzing the overall properties of such a population, such as its age distribution, metallicities or formation history. Even so, the kinematic properties observed by recent missions such as Gaia are representative of the total population up to a distance of approximately 500 pc [abridged].

          Uncovering Stealth Bias in LISA observations of Double White Dwarf Binaries due to Tidal Coupling

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarfs are important gravitational wave sources for LISA, as they are some of the most numerous compact systems in our universe. Here we consider finite-sized effects due to tidal interactions, as they are expected to have a measurable impact on these systems. Previous studies suggested that tidal effects would allow the individual masses to be measured, but there was a subtle error in those analyses. Using a fully Bayesian analysis we find that while tidal effects do not allow us to constrain the individual masses, they do yield informative lower bounds on the total mass of the system. Including tidal effects is crucial to the accuracy of our estimation of the chirp and total mass. Neglecting tidal effects leads to significant biases towards higher chirp masses, and we see that the lower bound of the total masses is biased towards a higher value as well. For many systems observed by LISA, tidal effects can lead to a "stealth" bias, since only the first derivative of the frequency can be measured. To separate tidal effects from the usual point particle decay we need to be able to measure the change in the second derivative of the frequency cause by the tides. This can only be done for high frequency systems observed with high signal-to-noise. The bias, if not accounted for, can have significant astrophysical implications; for example, it could lead to an incorrect estimation of the population of potential Type IA supernovae progenitors.

          Early Results from the HUMDRUM Survey: A Small, Earth-mass Planet Orbits TOI-1450A

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarf stars provide us with an ideal opportunity to study nearby small planets. The HUMDRUM (HUnting for M Dwarf Rocky planets Using MAROON-X) survey uses the MAROON-X spectrograph, which is ideally suited to studying these stars, to measure precise masses of a volume-limited ($<\,30$ pc) sample of transiting M dwarf planets. TOI-1450 is a nearby (22.5 pc) binary system containing a M3 dwarf with a roughly 3000 K companion. Its primary star, TOI-1450A, was identified by $TESS$ to have a 2.04d transit signal, and is included in the HUMDRUM sample. In this paper, we present MAROON-X radial velocities which confirm the planetary nature of this signal and measure its mass at a nearly 10% precision. The 2.04d planet, TOI-1450Ab, has $R_b\,=\,1.13\,\pm\,0.04\,R_\oplus$ and $M_b\,=\,1.26\,\pm\,0.13\,M_\oplus$. It is the second-lowest-mass transiting planet with a high-precision RV mass measurement. With this mass and radius, the planet's mean density is compatible with an Earth-like composition. Given its short orbital period and slightly sub-Earth density, it may be amenable to $JWST$ follow-up to test whether the planet has retained an atmosphere despite extreme heating from the nearby star. We also discover a non-transiting planet in the system with a period of 5.07 days and a $M\mathrm{sin}i_c\,=\,1.53\,\pm\,0.18\,M_\oplus$. We also find a 2.01d signal present in the systems's $TESS$ photometry that likely corresponds to the rotation period of TOI-1450A's binary companion, TOI-1450B. TOI-1450A, meanwhile, appears to have a rotation period of approximately 40 days, which is in-line with our expectations for a mid-M dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Las Cumbres Observatory (LCOGT) operates a global network of robotic 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0-meter telescopes to facilitate scientific research and education in time-domain astronomy. LCOGT's flagship educational program, Global Sky Partners (GSP), awards up to 1500 hours per year of telescope time to individuals and organizations that run their own, fully supported, educational programs. The GSP has a presence in 40 countries and 45% of the Partners target under-served, under-represented, and developing world audiences. The degradation and obsolescence of the original 0.4-meter telescope network prompted LCOGT to update the fleet of 10 telescopes to a new system consisting of predominantly off-the-shelf products. New PlaneWave DeltaRho 350 telescopes with Gemini Focuser/Rotators, LCOGT filter wheels, and QHY600 CMOS cameras, complement the original, custom-built mount. The deployment of all ten telescopes was completed in March 2024. We describe the design and performance of this new system and its components. We comment on modifications made to the QHY600 cameras, as well as on the treatment of random telegraph noise of its CMOS detectors within our data processing system BANZAI. The new telescope network supports the GSP program as well as multiple key science projects, including follow-up observations for the TESS satellite mission.

          $k$-e$\mu$lator: emulating clustering effects of the $k$-essence dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 We build an emulator based on the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) technique to efficiently model the non-linear effects associated with the clustering of the $k$-essence dark energy in the effective field theory (EFT) framework. These effects can be described through a modification of Poisson's equation, denoted by the function $\mu(k,z)$, which in general depends on wavenumber $k$ and redshift $z$. To emulate this function, we perform $200$ high-resolution $N$-body simulations sampled from a seven-dimensional parameter space with the Latin hypercube method. These simulations are executed using the $\texttt{k-evolution}$ code on a fixed mesh, containing $1200^3$ dark matter particles within a box size of $400~\text{Mpc}/ h$. The emulation process has been carried out within $\texttt{UQLab}$, a $\texttt{MATLAB}$-based software specifically dedicated to emulation and uncertainty quantification tasks. Apart from its role in emulation, the PCE method also facilitates the measurement of Sobol indices, enabling us to assess the relative impact of each cosmological parameter on the $\mu$ function. Our results show that the PCE-based emulator efficiently and accurately reflects the behavior of the $k$-essence dark energy for the cosmological parameter space defined by $w_0 c_s^2 \text{CDM} +\sum m_{\nu}$. Compared against actual simulations, the emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy up to the wavenumber $k \approx 9.4 ~h \text{Mpc}^{-1} $ for redshifts $z \leq 3$. Our emulator provides an efficient and reliable tool for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, and its capability to closely mimic the properties of the $k$-essence dark energy makes it a crucial component in Bayesian parameter estimations.

          The accretion burst of the massive young stellar object G323.46 -0.08

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion bursts from low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are known for many decades. In recent years, the first accretion bursts of massive YSOs (MYSOs) were observed. These phases of intense protostellar growth are of particular importance for studying massive star formation. Bursts of MYSOs are accompanied by flares of Class II methanol masers (hereafter masers), caused by an increase in exciting mid-infrared (MIR) emission. The G323.46$-$0.08 (hereafter G323) event extends the small sample of known MYSO bursts. Maser observations of the MYSO G323 show evidence of a flare, which was presumed to be caused by an accretion burst. This should be verified with IR data. We used time-dependent radiative transfer (TDRT) to characterize the heating and cooling timescales for eruptive MYSOs and to infer the main burst parameters. The G323 accretion burst is confirmed. It reached its peak in late 2013/early 2014 with a Ks-band increase of 2.5mag. TDRT indicates that the duration of the thermal afterglow in the far-infrared (FIR) can exceed the burst duration by years. The latter was proved by SOFIA observations, which indicate a flux increase of $(14.2\pm4.6)$% at $70\, \rm \mu m$ and $(8.5\pm6.1)$% at $160\, \mu$m in 2022 (2 years after the burst end). A one-sided light echo emerged that was propagating into the interstellar medium. The G323 burst is probably the most energetic MYSO burst observed so far. Within $8.4 \rm \, yrs$, an energy of $(0.9\pm_{0.8}^{2.5}) \times 10^{47}\,\rm erg$ was released. The short timescale points to the accretion of a compact body, while the burst energy corresponds to an accumulated mass of at least $(7\pm_{6}^{20})\,M_{Jup}$ and possibly even more if the protostar is bloated. In this case, the accretion event might have triggered protostellar pulsations, which give rise to the observed maser periodicity.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.

          The long-period spectroscopic orbit and dust creation in the Wolf-Rayet binary system WR 125

 - **Abstract**
 Several long-period binaries with a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star and an O star produce dust in their wind collisions. In eccentric binaries, this is seen most strongly near periastron passage. The exact conditions leading to dust creation require orbital properties to be determined, which is difficult owing to their long periods. Recently, the binary system WR 125 (WC7+O9III) began a dust creation episode seen through an infrared outburst first detected by NEOWISE-R, which was the first outburst detected since 1991. We present new near- and mid-infrared photometry, which we use to show consistency between the two outbursts and derive an orbital period of 28.12$^{+0.10}_{-0.05}$ yr. We use a long time-series of optical spectra to place the first constraints on its orbital elements, on the assumption that this system will produce dust near periastron. The orbit has a mild eccentricity of 0.29$\pm$0.12 and is only derived for the Wolf-Rayet component, as the O star's radial velocities have noise that is likely larger than the expected semi-amplitude of the orbit. We also present SOFIA/FORCAST grism spectroscopy to examine the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of the dust during this outburst, comparing its properties to other WCd binaries, deriving a dust temperature of 580 K in 2021. This collection of observations will allow us to plan future observations of this system and place the system in the context of dust-creating Wolf-Rayet binaries.

          Rotation of the Globular Cluster Population of the Dark Matter Deficient Galaxy NGC 1052-DF4: Implication for the Total Mass

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the globular cluster population of NGC 1052-DF4, a dark matter deficient galaxy, using Bayesian inference to search for the presence of rotation. The existence of such a rotating component is relevant to the estimation of the mass of the galaxy, and therefore the question of whether NGC 1052-DF4 is truly deficient of dark matter, similar to NGC 1052-DF2 another galaxy in the same group. The rotational characteristics of seven globular clusters in NGC 1052-DF4 were investigated, finding that a non-rotating kinematic model has a higher Bayesian evidence than a rotating model, by a factor of approximately 2.5. In addition, we find that under the assumption of rotation, its amplitude must be small. This distinct lack of rotation strengthens the case that, based on its intrinsic velocity dispersion, NGC 1052-DF4 is a truly dark matter deficient galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We have discovered analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of photons that are multiply scattered in relativistic flows, under the assumption of isotropic and inelastic scattering. These expressions characterize the collective dynamics of these photons, ranging from free-streaming to diffusion regions. The PDF, defined within the light cone to ensure the preservation of causality, is expressed in a three-dimensional space at a constant time surface. This expression is achieved by summing the PDFs of photons that have been scattered $n$ times within four-dimensional spacetime. We have confirmed that this formulation accurately reproduces the results of relativistic Monte Carlo simulations.We found that the PDF in three-dimensional space at a constant time surface can be represented in a separable variable form. We demonstrate the behavior of the PDF in the laboratory frame across a wide range of Lorentz factors for the relativistic flow. When the Lorentz factor of the fluid is low, the behavior of scattered photons evolves sequentially from free propagation to diffusion, and then to dynamic diffusion, where the mean effective velocity of the photons equates to that of the fluid. On the other hand, when the Lorentz factor is large, the behavior evolves from anisotropic ballistic motion, characterized by a mean effective velocity approaching the speed of light, to dynamic diffusion.

 - **Abstract**
 It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.

 - **Abstract**
 The surfaces of icy moons are primarily composed of water ice that can be mixed with other compounds, such as carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide (CO$_2)$ stretching fundamental band observed on Europa and Ganymede appears to be a combination of several bands that are shifting location from one moon to another. We investigate the cause of the observed shift in the CO$_2$ stretching absorption band experimentally. We also explore the spectral behaviour of CO$_2$ ice by varying the temperature and concentration.} %H$_2$O:CO$_2$ deposition ratios. We analyzed pure CO$_2$ ice and ice mixtures deposited at 10 K under ultra-high vacuum conditions using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Laboratory ice spectra were compared to JWST observation of Europa's and Ganymede's leading hemispheres. The simulated IR spectra were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) methods, exploring the effect of porosity in CO$_2$ ice. Pure CO$_2$ and CO$_2$-water ice show distinct spectral changes and desorption behaviours at different temperatures, revealing intricate CO$_2$ and H$_2$O interactions. The number of discernible peaks increases from two in pure CO$_2$ to three in CO$_2$-water mixtures.

 - **Abstract**
 Low mass ratio systems (LMR) are a very interesting class of contact eclipsing binaries challenging the theoretical models of stability. These systems are also considered possible progenitors of the rare low-mass optical transients called red novae. In this study, we present the identification of 7 new totally eclipsing LMR systems from Catalina Sky Surveys (CSS) and 77 LMR candidates from the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS$-$3). Using the available CSS light curves and new multiband observations for CSS$\_$J210228.3$-$031048 and CSS$\_$J231513.$+$345335 with the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory, we estimate their physical and absolute parameters and investigate their stability and their progenitors. The light curves are analyzed by performing a 2$-$dimension scan on the mass ratio $-$ inclination plane with Phoebe$-$0.31 scripter while the errors are estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations and heuristic scanning of the parameter space. Our analysis revealed that all 9 CSS systems have extreme mass ratios from 0.09 to 0.16. Our statistical analysis of well$-$studied LMR contact binaries shows that LMR systems tend to have warmer and more massive primaries. The investigation of the progenitors of both low and higher-mass ratio systems reveals a trend for the former to originate from higher-mass ancestors. Finally, we investigate the stability condition by calculating the ratio of spin angular momentum to orbital angular momentum and other stability indicators in the context of the reliability of the solutions.

 Following the high activity of the gamma-ray Fermi source 4FGL J0449.1+1121 (PKS 0446+112), possibly associated with a IceCube neutrino event IC-240105A, we obtained optical spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the counterpart. We detect a clear emission line at 3830 Ang identified as Ly$\alpha$ that confirms the redshift of source at z=2.153. Comparing with previous spectroscopy, we find an increase of the continuum by a factor $\sim$10, and a significant decrease of the CIV 1550 emission line flux by a factor $\sim$5. This produces a dramatic drop of the Equivalent Width from $\sim$20 Ang to 0.8 Ang, which is suggestive of a very high jet activity. The Full Width Half Maximum of the emission lines are midway (1000 - 2000 km/s) between those typical of the broad and narrow regions of quasars. Based on this, the source classification is intermediate between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar and BL Lac object.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 With the plentiful information available in the Gaia BP/RP spectra, there is significant scope for applying discriminative models to extract stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances. We describe an approach to leverage an `Uncertain Neural Network' model trained on APOGEE data to provide high-quality predictions with robust estimates for per-prediction uncertainty. We report median formal uncertainties of 0.068 dex, 69.1K, 0.14 dex, 0.031 dex, 0.040 dex, and 0.029 dex for [Fe/H], $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [$\alpha$/M] respectively. We validate these predictions against our APOGEE training data, LAMOST, and Gaia GSP-Phot stellar parameters, and see a strong correlation between our predicted parameters and those derived from these surveys. We investigate the information content of the spectra by considering the `attention' our model pays to different spectral features compared to expectations from synthetic spectra calculations. Our model's predictions are applied to the Gaia dataset, and we produce a publicly available catalogue of our model's predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse profile modelling (PPM) is a comprehensive relativistic ray-tracing technique employed to determine the properties of neutron stars. In this study, we apply this technique to the Type I X-ray burster and accretion-powered millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338, extracting its fundamental properties using PPM of its thermonuclear burst oscillations. Using data from its 2003 outburst, and a single uniform temperature hot spot model, we infer XTE J1814-338 to be located at a distance of $7.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ kpc, with a mass of $1.21^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ M$_\odot$ and an equatorial radius of $7.0^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km. Our results also offer insight into the time evolution of the hot spot but point to some potential shortcomings of the single uniform temperature hot spot model. We explore the implications of this result, including what we can learn about thermonuclear burst oscillation mechanisms and the importance of modelling the accretion contribution to the emission during the burst.

          Supermassive black holes are growing slowly by $z\sim5$

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the black hole mass function at $z\sim5$ using XQz5, our recent sample of the most luminous quasars between the redshifts $4.5 < z < 5.3$. We include 72 quasars with black hole masses estimated from velocity-broadened emission-line measurements and single-epoch virial prescriptions in the footprint of a highly complete parent survey. The sample mean Eddington ratio and standard deviation is $\log\lambda \approx -0.20\pm0.24$. The completeness-corrected mass function is modelled as a double power-law, and we constrain its evolution across redshift assuming accretion-dominated mass growth. We estimate the evolution of the mass function from $z=5-4$, presenting joint constraints on accretion properties through a measured dimensionless e-folding parameter, $k_{\rm{ef}} \equiv \langle\lambda\rangle U (1-\epsilon)/\epsilon = 1.79\pm0.06$, where $\langle\lambda\rangle$ is the mean Eddington ratio, $U$ is the duty cycle, and $\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency. If these supermassive black holes were to form from seeds smaller than $10^8\,M_{\odot}$, the growth rate must have been considerably faster at $z\gg5$ than observed from $z=5-4$. A growth rate exceeding $3\times$ the observed rate would reduce the initial heavy seed mass to $10^{5-6}\,M_{\odot}$, aligning with supermassive star and/or direct collapse seed masses. Stellar mass ($10^2\,M_{\odot}$) black hole seeds would require $\gtrsim4.5\times$ the observed growth rate at $z\gg5$ to reproduce the measured active black hole mass function. A possible pathway to produce the most extreme quasars is radiatively inefficient accretion flow, suggesting black holes with low angular momentum or photon trapping in supercritically accreting thick discs.

          Passage of a Gamma-Ray Burst Through a Molecular Cloud: Cloud Ionization Structure

 - **Abstract**
 The model is constructed of the propagation of gamma-ray burst radiation through a dense molecular cloud. The main processes of the interaction of the radiation with the interstellar gas are taken into account in the simulations: the ionization of H and He atoms, the ionization of metal ions and the emission of Auger electrons, the photoionization and the photodissociation of H$_2$ molecules, the absorption of ultraviolet radiation via Lyman and Werner band transitions of H$_2$, the thermal sublimation of dust grains. The ionization of metal ions by X-ray radiation determines the gas ionization fraction in the cloud region, where the gas is predominantly neutral. The ionization of inner electron shells of ions is accompanied by the emission of Auger electrons, giving rise to metal ions in a high ionization state. In particular, the column densities of Mg, Si, Fe in the ionization states I$-$IV are much lower than the column densities of these ions in the ionization state V and higher. The photoionization of metal ions by ultraviolet radiation takes place at distances smaller than the dust-destruction radius and only for neutral atoms with an ionization threshold below 13.6 eV. The simulations have confirmed the previously made suggestion that the ionization of He atoms plays an important role in the absorption of radiation in the X-ray wavelength range. For a low metallicity, $\rm [M/H] \leq -1$, the role of He atoms is dominant.

 - **Abstract**
 The charged dust on the surface of airless celestial bodies, such as the moon and asteroids, is a threat to space missions. Further research on the charged dust will contribute to the success of space missions. In this paper, we study the charging and dynamics of dust particles with different work functions. By integrating the photoelectron energy distribution function over four illuminated areas with different work functions, we evaluated the photoelectron concentration in these four areas. At each area, using the photoelectron concentration, we solve the dust charging and dynamics equations with two different gravitational acceleration values. The results reveal that the dust with a larger work function can reach higher equilibrium states. These states include dominant photoelectron-related charging currents, charge numbers, and levitation heights. We suggest that the equilibrium states all hold a clear inverse relationship with the work functions of dust particles when the solar zenith angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees, displaying consistent trends under different gravitational accelerations. We also find that dust particles seem unable to stably levitate at a critical solar zenith angle. The value of this critical SZA follows the same rule subjected to the work function.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.

          Experimental investigations of diacetylene ice photochemistry in Titan's atmospheric conditions

 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of the organic species produced photochemically in the atmosphere of Titan can condense to form ice particles in the stratosphere and in the troposphere. According to various studies, diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$) condenses below 100 km where it can be exposed to ultraviolet radiation. We studied experimentally the photochemistry of diacetylene ice (C$_4$H$_2$) to evaluate its potential role in the lower altitude photochemistry of Titan's atmospheric ices. Methods. C$_4$H$_2$ ice films were irradiated with near-ultraviolet (near-UV) photons ( {\lambda} > 300 nm) with different UV sources to assess the impact of the wavelengths of photons on the photochemistry of C$_4$H$_2$. The evolution of the ice's composition was monitored using spectroscopic techniques. Our results reveal that diacetylene ice is reactive through singlet-triplet absorption, similar to the photochemistry of other organic ices of Titan (such as dicyanoacetylene C$_4$N$_2$ ice) that we investigated previously. Several chemical processes occurred during the photolysis: the hydrogenation of C$_4$H$_2$ to form other C$_4$ hydrocarbons (vinylacetylene C$_4$H$_4$ to butane C$_4$H$_{10}$); the formation of larger and highly polymerizable hydrocarbons, such as triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$); and the formation of an organic polymer that is stable at room temperature. The nondetection of diacetylene ice in Titan's atmosphere or surface could be rationalized based on our experimental results that C$_4$H$_2$ is photochemically highly reactive in the solid phase when exposed to near-UV radiation that reaches Titan's lower altitudes and surface. C$_4$H$_2$ may be one of the key molecules promoting the chemistry in the ices and aerosols of Titan's haze layers, especially in the case of co-condensation with other organic volatiles, with which it could initiate more complex solid-phase chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; with energy $\gtrsim 10^{18} {\rm~eV}$). In this work, we propose a novel model generating MeV emission lines in GRB, which can constrain the properties of heavy nuclei that potentially exist in GRB jets. Specifically, we find that relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions originating from the $\beta$ decay of unstable nuclei and/or the recombination entrained in the GRB jet can generate narrow MeV emission lines through the de-excitation of excited-electrons. This model can successfully explain the MeV emission line observed in the most luminous GRB ever recorded, GRB~221009A, with suitable parameters including a Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 820-1700$ and a total mass of heavy nuclei $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^{23} - 10^{26}$~g. Especially, the emission line broadening can be reasonably attributed to both the expansion of the jet shell and the thermal motion of nuclei, naturally resulting in a narrow width ($\sigma_{\rm line} / E_{\rm line} \lesssim 0.2$) consistent with the observation. Furthermore, we predict that different GRBs can exhibit lines in different bands with various evolving behaviors, which might be confirmed with further observations. Finally, our model provides indirect evidence that GRBs may be one of the sources of UHECRs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image billions of astronomical objects in the wide-fast-deep primary survey and in a set of minisurveys including intensive observations of a group of deep drilling fields (DDFs). The DDFs are a critical piece of three key aspects of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) cosmological measurements: they provide a required calibration for photometric redshifts and weak gravitational lensing measurements and they directly contribute to cosmological constraints from the most distant type Ia supernovae. We present a set of cohesive DDF strategies fulfilling science requirements relevant to DESC and following the guidelines of the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee. We propose a method to estimate the observing strategy parameters and we perform simulations of the corresponding surveys. We define a set of metrics for each of the science case to assess the performance of the proposed observing strategies. We show that the most promising results are achieved with deep rolling surveys characterized by two sets of fields: ultradeep fields (z<1.1) observed at a high cadence with a large number of visits over a limited number of seasons; deep fields (z<0.7), observed with a cadence of ~3 nights for ten years. These encouraging results should be confirmed with realistic simulations using the LSST scheduler. A DDF budget of ~8.5% is required to design observing strategies satisfying all the cosmological requirements. A lower DDF budget lead to surveys that either do not fulfill photo-z/WL requirements or are not optimal for SNe Ia cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that the distinct formation and evolution of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may affect the chemical and isotopic content of their atmospheres. Recent work has indeed shown differences in the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratio, provisionally attributed to the top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of super-Jupiters. The ESO SupJup Survey aims to disentangle the formation pathways of isolated brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions using chemical and isotopic tracers. The survey uses high-resolution spectroscopy with the recently upgraded VLT/CRIRES$^+$ spectrograph, covering a total of 49 targets. Here, we present the first results: an atmospheric characterisation of DENIS J0255-4700, an isolated brown dwarf near the L-T transition. We analyse its K-band spectrum using a retrieval framework where the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS is coupled to PyMultiNest. Gaussian Processes are employed to model inter-pixel correlations and we adopt an updated parameterisation of the PT-profile. Abundances of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, and NH$_3$ are retrieved for this fast-rotating L-dwarf. The ExoMol H$_2$O line list provides a significantly better fit than that of HITEMP. A free-chemistry retrieval is strongly favoured over equilibrium chemistry, caused by an under-abundance of CH$_4$. The free-chemistry retrieval constrains a super-solar C/O-ratio of $\sim0.68$ and a solar metallicity. We find tentative evidence ($\sim3\sigma$) for the presence of $^{13}$CO, with a constraint on the isotope ratio of $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}=184^{+61}_{-40}$ and a lower limit of $\gtrsim97$, suggesting a depletion of $^{13}$C compared to the interstellar medium ($\sim68$). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise K-band spectra provide an excellent means to constrain the chemistry and isotopic content of sub-stellar objects, as is the main objective of the ESO SupJup Survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simulation-based cosmological analysis using a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics of the weak lensing mass (convergence) maps from the first three years (Y3) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We implement: 1) second and third moments; 2) wavelet phase harmonics; 3) the scattering transform. Our analysis is fully based on simulations, spans a space of seven $\nu w$CDM cosmological parameters, and forward models the most relevant sources of systematics inherent in the data: masks, noise variations, clustering of the sources, intrinsic alignments, and shear and redshift calibration. We implement a neural network compression of the summary statistics, and we estimate the parameter posteriors using a simulation-based inference approach. Including and combining different non-Gaussian statistics is a powerful tool that strongly improves constraints over Gaussian statistics (in our case, the second moments); in particular, the Figure of Merit $\textrm{FoM}(S_8, \Omega_{\textrm{m}})$ is improved by 70 percent ($\Lambda$CDM) and 90 percent ($w$CDM). When all the summary statistics are combined, we achieve a 2 percent constraint on the amplitude of fluctuations parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\textrm{m}}/0.3)^{0.5}$, obtaining $S_8 = 0.794 \pm 0.017$ ($\Lambda$CDM) and $S_8 = 0.817 \pm 0.021$ ($w$CDM). The constraints from different statistics are shown to be internally consistent (with a $p$-value>0.1 for all combinations of statistics examined). We compare our results to other weak lensing results from the DES Y3 data, finding good consistency; we also compare with results from external datasets, such as \planck{} constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background, finding statistical agreement, with discrepancies no greater than $<2.2\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 The exponential growth of astronomical datasets provides an unprecedented opportunity for humans to gain insight into the Universe. However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The unluckiest star orbits a supermassive black hole elliptically. Every time it reaches the pericenter, it shallowly enters the tidal radius and gets partially tidal disrupted, producing a series of flares. Confirmation of a repeated partial tidal disruption event (pTDE) requires not only evidence to rule out other types of transients, but also proof that only one star is involved, as TDEs from multiple stars can also produce similar flares. In this letter, we report the discovery of a repeated pTDE, AT 2022dbl. In a quiescent galaxy at z=0.0284, two separate optical/UV flares have been observed in 2022 and 2024, with no bright X-ray, radio or mid-infrared counterparts. Compared to the first flare, the second flare has a similar blackbody temperature of ~26,000 K, slightly lower peak luminosity, and slower rise and fall phases. Compared to the ZTF TDEs, their blackbody parameters, bolometric energies and light curve shapes are all similar. The spectra taken during the second flare show a steeper continuum than the late-time spectra of the previous flare, consistent with a newly risen flare. More importantly, the possibility of two independent TDEs can be largely ruled out because the optical spectra taken around the peak of the two flares exhibit highly similar broad Balmer, N III and possible He II emission lines, especially the extreme ~4100Å emission lines. This represents the first robust spectroscopic evidence for a repeated pTDE, which can soon be verified by observing the third flare, given its short orbital period.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.
