 - **Abstract**
 The most massive stars known to date are R 136 a1, a2, a3, and c within the central cluster R 136a of the Tarantula nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with reported masses in excess of 150-200$M_\odot$. However, the mass estimation of these stars relies on the assumption that they are single. We collected three epochs of spectroscopy for R 136 a1, a2, a3, and c with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the years 2020-2021 to probe potential radial-velocity (RV) variations. We combine these epochs with an additional HST/STIS observation taken in 2012. We use cross-correlation to quantify the RVs, and establish constraints on possible companions to these stars up to periods of ~10 yr. Objects are classified as binaries when the peak-to-peak RV shifts exceed 50 km/s, and when the RV shift is significant with respect to errors. R 136 a1, a2, and a3 do not satisfy the binary criteria and are thus classified as putatively single, although formal peak-to-peak RV variability on the level 40 km/s is noted for a3. Only R 136 c is classified as binary, in agreement with literature. We can generally rule out massive companions (M2 > ~50 Msun) to R 136 a1, a2, and a3 out to orbital periods of < 1 yr (separations < 5 au) at 95% confidence, or out to tens of years (separations < ~100 au) at 50% confidence. Highly eccentric binaries (e > ~0.9) or twin companions with similar spectra could evade detection down to shorter periods (> ~10 d), though their presence is not supported by the relative X-ray faintness of R 136 a1, a2, and a3. We derive a preliminary orbital solution with a 17.2 d period for the X-ray bright binary R 136 c, though more data are needed to conclusively derive its orbit. Our study supports a lower bound of 150-200 $M_\odot$ on the upper-mass limit at LMC metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves (GWs) in pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. We perform a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power law model to characterize GW signals in realistic datasets. We use, as the baseline dataset, synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA (EPTA) second data release (DR2). Thus, we include in the dataset uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. We then inject timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We find that current search models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identify via probability-probability (P-P) plots and quantify using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA DR2 and corroborate its consistency with an SMBHB origin.
#### A novel approach to identify blazar emission states using clustering  algorithms

 - **Abstract**
 Even after decades of multi-wavelength (MWL) observations, blazars still remain mysterious objects. Their extreme variability and variety of emission characteristics observed during different time periods make it hard to understand the fundamental processes behind their emission. Thus, a robust identification and characterization of the different emission states among blazars is vital to investigate the underlying processes causing the observed emission. In this contribution, we present a novel technique to determine emission states across MWL lightcurves (LCs) of blazars using a clustering algorithm. Using the Extreme Deconvolution algorithm, we apply a Gaussian Mixture model to the 12-year long-term LC of one of our archetypal blazars, Mrk 501. The two main advantages of the method are that, compared to more conventional methods, such as the Bayesian block algorithm, it considers multiple wavebands simultaneously and it is not dependent on the order in time of the data points. This allows to assign data points to the same emission state even though they are separated by other states in time. The well sampled gamma-ray, X-ray and radio LCs used as input allow to identify six clusters. The clustering is mainly driven by the X-ray flux, showing different levels of quiescent, intermediate and high flux states. However, the radio flux reveals a more complicated pattern, dividing some of the X-ray flux levels in low and high-radio flux states. This suggests that multiple emission regions maybe responsible for the radio to gamma-ray flux.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been argued that heavy binaries composed of neutron stars (NSs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) can end up in the outskirts of star clusters via an interaction with a massive black hole (BH) binary expelling them from the core. We argue here, however, that this mechanism will rarely account for such observed objects. Only for primary masses $\lesssim$ 100 M$_{\odot}$ and a narrow range of orbital separations should a BH-BH binary be both dynamically hard and produce a sufficiently low recoil velocity to retain the NS binary in the cluster. Hence, BH binaries are in general likely to eject NSs from clusters. We explore several alternative mechanisms that would cause NS/MSP binaries to be observed in the outskirts of their host clusters after a Hubble time. The most likely mechanism is a three-body interaction involving the NS/MSP binary and a normal star. We compare to Monte Carlo simulations of cluster evolution for the globular clusters NGC 6752 and 47 Tuc, and show that the models not only confirm that normal three-body interactions involving all stellar-mass objects are the dominant mechanism for putting NS/MSP binaries into the cluster outskirts, they also reproduce the observed NS/MSP binary radial distributions without needing to invoke the presence of a massive BH binary. Higher central densities and an episode of core-collapse can broaden the radial distributions of NSs/MSPs and NS/MSP binaries due to three-body interactions, making these clusters more likely to host NSs in the cluster outskirts.
#### Probing the physics in the core boundary layers of the double-lined  B-type binary KIC4930889 from its gravito-inertial modes

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution models of B-type stars are still uncertain in terms of internal mixing properties, notably in the area between the convective core and the radiative envelope. This impacts age determination of such stars in addition to the computation of chemical yields produced at the end of their life. We investigated the thermal and chemical structure and rotation rate in the near-core boundary layer of the double-lined B-type binary KIC4930889 from its four-year Kepler light curve, ground-based spectroscopy, and Gaia astrometry. We computed grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for different mixing profiles and prescriptions of the temperature gradient in the near-core region. We examined the preferred prescription and the near-core rotation rate using 22 prograde dipole modes detected by Kepler photometry. We employed a Mahalanobis distance merit function and considered various nested stellar model grids, rewarding goodness of fit but penalising model complexity. Furthermore, we found a preference for either an exponentially decaying mixing profile in the near-core region or absence of additional near-core mixing, but found no preference for the temperature gradient in this region. The frequency (co)variances of our theoretical predictions are much larger than the errors on the observed frequencies. This forms the main limitation on further constraining the individual parameters of our models. Additionally, non-adiabatic pulsation computations of our best models indicate a need for opacity enhancements to accurately reproduce the observed mode excitation. The eccentric close binary system KIC4930889 proves to be a promising target to investigate additional physics in close binaries by developing new modelling methods with the capacity to include the effect of tidal interactions for full exploitation of all detected oscillation modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Probing small main-belt asteroids provides insight into their formation and evolution through multiple dynamical and collisional processes. These asteroids also overlap in size with the potentially hazardous near-earth object population and supply the majority of these objects. The Lucy mission will provide an opportunity for study of a small main-belt asteroid, (152830) Dinkinesh. The spacecraft will perform a flyby of this object on November 1, 2023, in preparation for its mission to the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. We employed aperture photometry on stacked frames of Dinkinesh obtained by the Wide-field-Infrared Survey Explorer and performed thermal modeling on a detection at 12 $\mu$m to compute diameter and albedo values. Through this method, we determined Dinkinesh has an effective spherical diameter of $0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.21}$ km and a visual geometric albedo of $0.27^{+0.25}_{-0.06}$ at the 16th and 84th percentiles. This albedo is consistent with typical stony (S-type) asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) three-dimensional correlation functions have been widely used to perform cosmological inference using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. While the traditional inference approach employs a data vector with several thousand data points, we apply near-maximal score compression down to tens of compressed data elements. We show that carefully constructed additional data beyond those linked to each inferred model parameter are required to preserve meaningful goodness-of-fit tests that guard against unknown systematics, and to avoid information loss due to non-linear parameter dependencies. We demonstrate, on suites of realistic mocks and DR16 data from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, that our compression framework is lossless and unbiased, yielding a posterior that is indistinguishable from that of the traditional analysis. As a showcase, we investigate the impact of a covariance matrix estimated from a limited number of mocks, which is only well-conditioned in compressed space.
#### A Chandra X-ray study of millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster  Omega Centauri: a correlation between spider pulsar companion mass and X-ray  luminosity

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are faint X-ray sources commonly observed in Galactic globular clusters (GCs). In this work, we investigate 18 MSPs newly found in the GC Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) and search for their X-ray counterparts using Chandra observations with a total exposure time of 290.9 ks. We identify confident X-ray counterparts for 11 of the MSPs, with 9 of them newly identified in this work based on their positions, spectral properties, and X-ray colours. The X-ray spectra of 9 MSPs are well described by a neutron star hydrogen atmosphere model, while 2 MSPs are well fitted by a power-law model. The identified MSPs have X-ray luminosities ranging from $1.0\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $1.4\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Additionally, for population comparison purposes, we study the X-ray counterpart to MSP E in the GC M71, and find its X-ray spectrum is well described by blackbody-like models with a luminosity of $1.9\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We investigate the empirical correlations between X-ray luminosities and minimum companion masses, as well as mass functions, of spider pulsars. Clear correlations are observed, with best-fit functions of $\log_{10}{L_X} = (1.0\pm0.1) \log_{10}{M_{c, min}} + (32.5\pm0.2)$ and $\log_{10}{L_X} = (0.35\pm0.04) \log_{10}{\rm MF} + (32.71\pm0.20)$, respectively, with an intrinsic scatter of $\log_{10}{L_X}$ of $\sim$0.3, where $L_X$ is the 0.5$-$10 keV X-ray luminosity, $M_{c, min}$ is the minimum companion mass, and MF represents the mass function, in solar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 To better understand the impact of the avalanche gain applied in the detector technology and apply this technology in our in-house astrophotonic projects, we have characterized a C-RED One camera and produced a stable and reliable method for calculating the system gain at any desired avalanche gain setting. We observed that depending on how the system gain is obtained, multiplying the system gain times the avalanche gain may not accurately produce a conversion factor from electrons to ADUs. Since the acquisition of a photon transfer curve (PTC) was possible at different avalanche gain levels, several PTCs at low avalanche gain levels were acquired. Consequently, a linear fit was produced from the acquired system gain as a function of the avalanche gain setting. Through the linear fit, the effective system gain was calculated at any desired avalanche level. The effective system gain makes possible to accurately calculate the initial system gain without the ambiguity introduced by the non-linearity of the system. Besides, the impact of the avalanche gain on the dynamic range was also analyzed and showed a stable behaviour through the measured avalanche range.

 - **Abstract**
 The mysterious nature of the dark sector of the $\Lambda$CDM model is one of the main motivators behind the study of alternative cosmological models. A central quantity of interest for these models is the matter power spectrum, which quantifies structure formation on various scales and can be cross-validated through theory, simulations, and observations. We present a tool that can be used to create emulators for the non-linear matter power spectrum, and similar global clustering statistics, for models beyond $\Lambda$CDM with very little computation effort and without the need for supercomputers. We use fast approximate N-body simulations to emulate the boost, $B(k,z)=P_{\text{beyond}-\Lambda \rm CDM}(k,z) / P_{\Lambda \rm CDM}(k, z)$, and then rely on existing high-quality emulators made for $\Lambda$CDM to isolate $P_{\text{beyond}-\Lambda \rm CDM}(k,z)$. Since both the $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models are simulated in our approach, some of the lack of power on small scales is factored out, allowing us to extend the emulator to $k \sim 3-5\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and still maintain good accuracy. In addition, errors from the simulation and emulation process can be estimated and factored into the covariance when using the emulator on data. As an example of using the pipeline, we create an emulator for the well-studied $f(R)$ model with massive neutrinos, using approximately 3000 CPU hours of computation time, as opposed to millions of CPU hours for many existing $\Lambda$CDM emulators. Provided with the paper is a fully functioning pipeline that generates parameter samples, runs a Boltzmann solver to produce initial conditions, runs the simulations, and then gathers all the data and runs it through a machine learning module to develop the emulator. This tool, named Sesame, can be used by anyone to generate a power spectrum emulator for the cosmological model of their choice.
#### New insights in the bubble wall of NGC 3324: intertwined sub-structures  and a bipolar morphology uncovered by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of intertwined/entangled sub-structures towards the bubble wall of NGC 3324 below a physical scale of 4500 AU, which is the sharp edge/ionization front/elongated structure traced at the interface between the HII region and the molecular cloud. The sharp edge appears wavy in the Spitzer 3.6-8.0 $\mu$m images (resolution $\sim$2$''$). Star formation signatures have mostly been traced on one side of the ionization front, which lies on the molecular cloud's boundary. The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) near- and mid-infrared images (resolution $\sim$0.07$''$-0.7$''$) are employed to resolve the sharp edge, which has a curvature facing the exciting O-type stars. The elongated structures are associated with the 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, the 4.05 $\mu$m ionized emission, and the 4.693 $\mu$m H$_{2}$ emission. However, the PAH-emitting structures are depicted between the other two. The H$_{2}$ emission reveals numerous intertwined sub-structures which are not prominently traced in the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission. The separation between two sub-structures in the H$_{2}$ emission is $\sim$1.1$''$ or 2420 AU. The intertwined sub-structures are traced in the spatial areas associated with the neutral to H$_{2}$ transition zone, suggesting the origin of these structures by ``thin-shell'' instability. Furthermore, an arc-like feature traced in the Spitzer 3.6-8.0 $\mu$m images is investigated as a bipolar HII region (extent $\sim$0.35 pc) at T$_\mathrm{d}$ $\sim$25-28~K using the JWST images. A massive star candidate VPHAS-OB1 #03518 seems to be responsible for the bipolar HII region.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the potential of gamma-ray pulsar time array (PTA) on gravitational waves background (GWB) using future gamma-ray detectors with larger effective areas. We consider both spaceborne detectors and ground-based imaging air Cherenkov telescope arrays (IACTs). We simulated the detected photons from pulsars using the response of hypothetical detectors taking into account the backgrounds and analyzed the sensitivities. Our results showed that thanks to the higher statistics of IACTs, the PTA using IACTs can improve significantly the performance compared with the PTA using Fermi-LAT data.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a rigorous reverberation-mapping analysis of the broad-line region (BLR) in a highly accreting ($L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}=0.74-3.4$) active galactic nucleus, Markarian 142 (Mrk 142), for the first time using concurrent observations of the inner accretion disk and the BLR to determine a time lag for the $H\beta$ $\mathrm{\lambda}$4861 emission relative to the ultraviolet (UV) continuum variations. We used continuum data taken with the Niel Gehrels Swift Observatory in the UVW2 band, and the Las Cumbres Observatory, Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory, and Liverpool Telescope in the g band, as part of the broader Mrk 142 multi-wavelength monitoring campaign in 2019. We obtained new spectroscopic observations covering the $H\beta$ broad emission line in the optical from the Gemini North Telescope and the Lijiang 2.4-meter Telescope for a total of 102 epochs (over a period of eight months) contemporaneous to the continuum data. Our primary result states a UV-to-$H\beta$ time lag of $8.68_{-0.72}^{+0.75}$ days in Mrk 142 obtained from light-curve analysis with a Python-based Running Optimal Average algorithm. We placed our new measurements for Mrk 142 on the optical and UV radius-luminosity relations for NGC 5548 to understand the nature of the continuum driver. The positions of Mrk 142 on the scaling relations suggest that UV is closer to the "true" driving continuum than the optical. Furthermore, we obtain $\log(M_{\bullet}/M_{\odot}) = 6.32\pm0.29$ assuming UV as the primary driving continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon is an essential element for life on Earth, and the relative abundances of major carbon species (CO2, CO, and CH4) in the atmosphere exert fundamental controls on planetary climate and biogeochemistry. Here, we employed a theoretical model of atmospheric chemistry to investigate diversity in the atmospheric abundances of CO2, CO, and CH4 on Earth-like lifeless planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. We focused on the conditions for the formation of a CO-rich atmosphere, which would be favorable for the origin of life. Results demonstrated that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels trigger photochemical instability of the CO budget in the atmosphere (i.e., CO runaway) owing to enhanced CO2 photolysis relative to H2O photolysis. Higher volcanic outgassing fluxes of reduced C (CO and CH4) also tend to initiate CO runaway. Our systematic examinations revealed that anoxic atmospheres of Earth-like lifeless planets could be classified in the phase space of CH4/CO2 versus CO/CO2, where a distinct gap in atmospheric carbon chemistry is expected to be observed. Our findings indicate that the gap structure is a general feature of Earth-like lifeless planets with reducing atmospheres orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars.

 - **Abstract**
 By tracking trajectories of dark matter (DM) particles accreting onto halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations, we investigate the radial phase-space distribution of cold dark matter (CDM) halos, paying a special attention to their inner regions deep inside the halo boundary called the splashback radius, where the particles undergo multi-stream flows. Extending and improving previous work by Sugiura et al., we classify DM particles inside haloes by the number of apocenter passages, $p$, and succeed to count it up to $p=40$ for each halo over a wide mass range. Quantifying in particular the radial density profile for particles having the same value of $p$, we find that it generally exhibits a double-power law feature, whose indices of inner and outer slopes are well-described by $-1$ and $-8$, respectively. The characteristic density and scale of their double-power law profiles are given as a simple fitting function of $p$, with a weak halo mass dependence. Interestingly, summing up these double-power law functions beyond $p=40$ gives a converged result, which closely matches the total density profile of simulated haloes. The double-power law nature is shown to be persistent and generic not only in mass-selected haloes but also in haloes selected in different criteria. Our results are compared with a class of self-similar solutions that describes the stationary and spherical accretion of DM, and found that even introducing a non-zero angular momentum fails to reproduce the radial multi-stream structure. The analysis with particle trajectories tracing back to higher redshifts suggests that the double-power law nature have been established during an early accretion phase and remain stable.
#### Determining cosmological-model-independent $H_0$ and post-Newtonian  parameter with time-delay lenses and supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing provides a natural opportunity to test General Relativity (GR). We propose a model-independent method for simultaneous constraining on Hubble constant ($H_0$) and post-Newtonian parameter (${\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}}$) using strong lensing systems and observational SNe Ia. The time-delay measurements from strong lesning can directly determine the Hubble constant, and the lens distance inferred from the spectroscopic measurement of the stellar kinematics of the deflector galaxy can help us to constrain the post-Newtonian parameter. We seek the Pantheon dataset and reconstruct unanchored distances using Gaussian process regression to achieve the cosmological model-independent GR testing instead of assuming a specific model, which can reduce possible bias on GR testing and measurement of Hubble constant. Combining the reconstructed unanchored distances and the four H0LiCOW lenses datasets, our results are $H_0=72.9^{+2.0}_{-2.3} {\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ and ${\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}}=0.89^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$. All the lenses show that there is no obvious evidence to support GR deviation within observational uncertainties. In the subsequent analysis, we consider a ratio of distance ${D_{\Delta t}}/{D^{'}_{d}}$ method to further avoid the influence of $H_0$ on GR testing. The results show that, except J1206 within the $\sim1.2\sigma$ observational uncertainty, the remaining 3 lenses support GR holds within the $1\sigma$ observational uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain astronomy is progressing rapidly with the ongoing and upcoming large-scale photometric sky surveys led by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory project (LSST). Billions of variable sources call for better automatic classification algorithms for light curves. Among them, periodic variable stars are frequently studied. Different categories of periodic variable stars have a high degree of class imbalance and pose a challenge to algorithms including deep learning methods. We design two kinds of architectures of neural networks for the classification of periodic variable stars in the Catalina Survey's Data Release 2: a multi-input recurrent neural network (RNN) and a compound network combing the RNN and the convolutional neural network (CNN). To deal with class imbalance, we apply Gaussian Process to generate synthetic light curves with artificial uncertainties for data augmentation. For better performance, we organize the augmentation and training process in a "bagging-like" ensemble learning scheme. The experimental results show that the better approach is the compound network combing RNN and CNN, which reaches the best result of 86.2% on the overall balanced accuracy and 0.75 on the macro F1 score. We develop the ensemble augmentation method to solve the data imbalance when classifying variable stars and prove the effectiveness of combining different representations of light curves in a single model. The proposed methods would help build better classification algorithms of periodic time series data for future sky surveys (e.g., LSST).

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a faint radio filament near PSR J0538+2813 in the NVSS, CGPS, and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey data. This pulsar is plausibly associated with the supernova that gave rise to the Spaghetti Nebula (Simeis 147). The structure is one-sided and appears to be almost aligned (within 17 degrees) with the direction of the pulsar's proper motion, but in contrast to the known cases of pulsar radio tails, it is located ahead of the pulsar. At the same time, this direction is also approximately (within 5 degrees) perpendicular to the axis of the extended non-thermal X-ray emission around the pulsar. No X-ray or optical emission is detected from the filament region, although the end point of the radio filament appears to be adjacent to a filament of H$_\alpha$ emission. We speculate that this structure might represent a filament connecting pulsar wind nebula with the ambient interstellar medium filled with relativistic electrons escaping the pulsar nebula, i.e. a radio analogue of X-ray filaments of Guitar and Lighthouse PWNs and filaments of non-thermal radio emission in the Galactic Center.

 - **Abstract**
 By studying the distribution of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) that are embedded within meteorites, we can learn about the dynamical history of the protoplanetary disk from which our Solar System formed. A long-standing problem concerning CAIs is the CAI storage problem. CAIs are thought to have formed at high temperatures near the Sun, but they are primarily found in carbonaceous chondrites, which formed much further out, beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Additionally, radial drift of CAI particles should have removed them from the solar protoplanetary disk several million years before the parent bodies of meteorites in which they are encountered would have accreted. We revisit a previously suggested solution to the CAI storage problem by Desch, Kalyaan, and Alexander which proposed that CAIs were mixed radially outward through the disk and subsequently got trapped in a pressure maximum created by Jupiter's growing core opening a planet gap. Our aim is to investigate whether their solution still works when we take into account the infall phase during which the disk builds up from the collapse of a molecular cloud core. We build a 1D numerical code in Python using the DISKLAB package to simulate the evolution of the solar protoplanetary disk, starting with a collapsing molecular cloud. We find that outward transport of CAIs during the infall phase is very efficient, possibly mixing them all the way into the far outer disk. Subsequent inward radial drift collects CAIs in the pressure maximum beyond Jupiter's orbit while draining the inner disk, roughly reproducing parts of the result by Desch et al. By introducing CAI formation so early, abundances out to 100 AU remain significant, possibly not consistent with some meteoritic data. It is possible to create a disk that does not expand as far out and also does not push CAIs as far out by using a very slowly rotating cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of pulsar scintillation are among the few astrophysical probes of very small-scale ($\lesssim$ au) phenomena in the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, characterization of scintillation arcs, including their curvature and intensity distributions, can be related to interstellar turbulence and potentially over-pressurized plasma in local ISM inhomogeneities, such as supernova remnants, HII regions, and bow shocks. Here we present a survey of eight pulsars conducted at the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), revealing a diverse range of scintillation arc characteristics at high sensitivity. These observations reveal more arcs than measured previously for our sample. At least nine arcs are observed toward B1929$+$10 at screen distances spanning $\sim 90\%$ of the pulsar's $361$ pc path-length to the observer. Four arcs are observed toward B0355$+$54, with one arc yielding a screen distance as close as $\sim10^5$ au ($<1$ pc) from either the pulsar or the observer. Several pulsars show highly truncated, low-curvature arcs that may be attributable to scattering near the pulsar. The scattering screen constraints are synthesized with continuum maps of the local ISM and other well-characterized pulsar scintillation arcs, yielding a three-dimensional view of the scattering media in context.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerocapture is an orbit insertion technique which uses atmospheric drag from a single pass to decelerate a spacecraft. Compared to conventional propulsive insertion, aerocapture can impart large velocity changes to the spacecraft with almost no propellant. At the far reaches of the outer Solar System, the ice giants remain the last class of planets to be explored using orbiters. Their enormous heliocentric distance presents significant mission design challenges, particularly the large $\Delta$V required for orbit insertion. This makes aerocapture an attractive method of orbit insertion, but also challenging due to the comparatively large navigation and atmospheric uncertainties. The present study performs a comparison of the lift and drag modulation control and their implications for future missions. Lift modulation provides nearly twice the entry corridor width as drag modulation, and can thus accommodate larger uncertainties. Lift modulation offers continuous control throughout the flight enabling it to adjust the trajectory in response to the actual density profile encountered. Drag modulation offers much more benign aero-thermal conditions compared to lift modulation. With drag modulation, there is no control authority after the drag skirt jettison making the vehicle more susceptible to exit state errors from density variations encountered after the jettison event.
#### Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark  matter with momentum and energy transfers

 - **Abstract**
 We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges. The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.417^{+1.592}_{-0.307}$ and $Q =-0.036^{+0.036}_{-0.010}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q<0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have shown that there exists downward propagation of alternating westward/eastward jets in Jupiter's equatorial stratosphere, with a quasi-period between four and six years. This phenomenon is generally called the quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO). Here, we simulate the QQO by injecting isotropic small-scale thermal disturbances into a three-dimensional general circulation model of Jupiter. It is found that the internal thermal disturbance is able to excite a wealth of waves that generate the equatorial QQO and multiple jet streams at middle and high latitudes of both hemispheres. The dominant wave mode in generating the QQO-like oscillation is that with a zonal wavenumber of 10. Inhomogeneous evolution of potential vorticity favors the emergence of the off-equatorial zonal jets. The off-equatorial jets migrate to the equator, strengthen the deep equatorial jets, and result in the prolonging of the QQO-like oscillations.
#### Numerical studies on the link between radioisotopic signatures on Earth  and the formation of the Local Bubble. II. Advanced modeling of interstellar  26Al, 53Mn, 60Fe, and 244Pu influxes as traces of past supernovae in the  solar neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of long-lived radioisotopes provide a means, completely independent of other observational channels, to draw conclusions about near-Earth supernovae (SNe) and thus the origin of the Local Bubble (LB). First and foremost in this context is 60Fe, which has already been detected across the Earth and on the Moon. Using Gaia EDR3, we identified 14 SN explosions, with 13 occurring in UCL/LCC, and one in V1062 Sco, all being subgroups of the Sco-Cen OB association. The timing of these explosions was obtained by us through interpolation of rotating stellar evolution tracks via the initial masses of the already exploded massive stars. We further developed a new Monte Carlo-type approach for deriving the trajectories of the SN progenitors. We then performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations based on these initial conditions to explore the evolution of the LB in an inhomogeneous local interstellar medium and the transport of radioisotopes to Earth. The simulations include the stellar winds from the SN progenitors and additional radioisotopes (26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu) besides 60Fe. We find that (i) our simulations are consistent with measurements of 60Fe, in particular, a peak 2-3 Myr before present, as well as 26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu data, (ii) stellar winds contribute to the distribution of radioisotopes and also to the dynamics of the LB, (iii) the solar system (SS) entered the LB about 4.6 Myr ago, and (iv) the measured recent influx of 60Fe can be naturally explained by turbulent radioisotopic transport. Our simulations not only support the recent hypothesis that the LB triggered star formation in the solar vicinity through its expansion, but also suggest that the second, separate 60Fe peak measured at 6-9 Myr ago was generated by the passage of the SS through a neighboring superbubble (SB), possibly the Orion-Eridanus SB, prior to its current residence in the LB.

 In the frequency band of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), extensive research has been conducted on the impact of foreground confusion noise generated by galactic binaries within the Milky Way galaxy. Additionally, the recent evidence for a stochastic signal, announced by the NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, CPTA and InPTA, indicates that the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) can contribute a strong background noise within in LISA band. Given the presence of such strong noise, it is expected to have a considerable impacts on LISA's scientific missions. In this work, we investigate the impacts of the SGWB generated by SMBHBs on the detection of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), verified galactic binaries (VGBs) and extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the context of LISA, and find it crucial to resolve and eliminate the exceed noise from the SGWB to ensure the success of LISA's missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to our vantage point in the disk of the Galaxy, its 3D structure is not directly accessible. However, knowing the spatial distribution, e.g. of atomic and molecular hydrogen gas is of great importance for interpreting and modelling cosmic ray data and diffuse emission. Using novel Bayesian inference techniques, we reconstruct the 3D densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen in the Galaxy together with (part of) the galactic velocity field. In order to regularise the infinite number of degrees of freedom and obtain information in regions with missing or insufficient data, we incorporate the correlation structure of the gas fields into our prior. Basis for these reconstructions are the data-sets from the HI4PI-survey on the 21-cm emission line and the CO-survey compilation by Dame et al. (2001) on the ($1\rightarrow0$) rotational transition together with a variable gas flow model. We present the preliminary estimated mean surface mass densities and corrections to the prior assumption of the galactic velocity field. In the future, we plan to relax assumptions on the optical thickness and include additional data to further constrain either the galactic velocity field or the gas densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the limited field of view (FoV) of Cherenkov telescopes, the time needed to achieve target sensitivity for surveys of the extragalactic and Galactic sky is large. To optimize the time spent to perform such surveys, a so-called "divergent mode" of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) was proposed as an alternative observation strategy to the traditional parallel pointing. In the divergent mode, each telescope points to a position in the sky that is slightly offset, in the outward direction, from the original center of the field of view. This bring the advantage of increasing the total instantaneous arrays' FoV. From an enlarged field of view also benefits the search for very-high-energy transient sources, making it possible to cover large sky regions in follow-up observations, or to quickly cover the probability sky map in case of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB), Gravitational Waves (GW), and other transient events. In this contribution, we present the proposed implementation of the divergent pointing mode and its first preliminary performance estimation for the southern CTAO array.
#### Photometric follow-up of the 20 Myr-old multi-planet host star V1298~Tau  with CHEOPS and ground-based telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 V1298 Tau hosts at least four planets. Since its discovery, this system has been a target of intensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring. The characterisation of its architecture and planets' fundamental properties turned out to be very challenging so far. The determination of the orbital ephemeris of the outermost planet V1298 Tau $e$ remains an open question. Only two transits have been detected so far by $Kepler/K2$ and TESS, allowing for a grid of reference periods to be tested with new observations, without excluding the possibility of transit timing variations. Observing a third transit would allow to better constrain the orbital period, and would also help determining an accurate radius of V1298 Tau $e$ because the former transits showed different depths. We observed V1298 Tau with the CHEOPS space telescope to search for a third transit of planet $e$ within observing windows that have been selected in order to test three of the shortest predicted orbital periods. We also collected ground-based observations to verify the result found with CHEOPS. We reanalysed $Kepler/K2$ and TESS light curves to test how the results derived from these data are affected by alternative photometric extraction and detrending methods. We report the detection with CHEOPS of a transit that could be attributed to V1298 Tau $e$. If so, that result implies that the orbital period calculated from fitting a linear ephemeris to the three available transits is close to $\sim45$ days. Results from the ground-based follow-up marginally support this possibility. We found that $\textit{i}$) the transit observed by CHEOPS has a longer duration compared to that of the transits observed by $Kepler/K2$ and TESS; $\textit{ii}$) the transit observed by TESS is $>30\%$ deeper than that of $Kepler/K2$ and CHEOPS, and deeper than the measurement previously reported in the literature, according to our reanalysis.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray photons from energetic sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be scattered on dust clouds in the Milky Way, creating a time-evolving halo around the GRB position. X-ray observations of such halos allow the measurement of dust clouds distances in the Galaxy on which the scattering occurs. We present the first systematic comparison of the distances to scattering regions derived from GRB halos with the 3D dust distribution derived from recently published optical-to-near infrared extinction maps. GRB halos were observed around 7 sources by the Swift XRT and the XMM-Newton EPIC instruments, namely GRB 031203, GRB 050713A, GRB 050724, GRB 061019, GRB 070129, GRB 160623A and GRB 221009A. We used four 3D extinction maps that exploit photometric data from different surveys and apply diverse algorithms for the 3D mapping of extinction, and compared the X-ray halo-derived distances with the local maxima in the 3D extinction density distribution. We found that in all GRBs we can find at least one local maximum in the 3D dust extinction map that is in agreement with the dust distance measured from X-ray rings. For GRBs with multiple X-ray rings, the dust distance measurements coincide with at least 3 maxima in the extinction map for GRB 160623A, and 5 maxima for GRB 221009A. The agreement of these independent distance measurements shows that the methods used to create dust extinction maps may potentially be optimized by the X-ray halo observations from GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric characteristics for all models of Starlink satellites launched to date are quantified. The Original design that lacked brightness mitigation is the most luminous. SpaceX installed a sunshade on the VisorSat model which reduced its luminosity by a factor of 3. The visor was omitted on Post-VisorSat spacecraft with laser communication which followed, but the company added a reflective layer which resulted in an intermediate brightness between Original and VisorSat. SpaceX is applying advanced brightness mitigation techniques to their Generation 2 Starlink satellites which are larger. The first of these, called Minis, are dimmer than Gen 1 Starlinks despite their greater size. Photometric observations verify that brightness mitigation efforts employed by SpaceX reduce spacecraft luminosity substantially. However, the satellites still have some negative impact on astronomical observations and the very large satellites planned for later in Gen 2 may interfere more seriously.

 - **Abstract**
 M87 was discovered in the very-high-energy band (VHE, E > 100 GeV) with HEGRA in 2003, long before its emission was detected in the high-energy band (HE, E > 100 MeV) with Fermi-LAT in 2009, opening the window to a new family of extragalactic sources with tilted jets. After a series of major VHE flares in 2005, 2008, and 2010, which were detected in multiple bands, the source has been found in a low activity state, interrupted only by comparatively smaller-scale flares. MAGIC and VERITAS, two stereoscopic Cherenkov telescope arrays located at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (Canary Islands, Spain) and the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (Arizona, US), have monitored M87 continuously and in coordination for more than 10 years. In this work, we present the data for 4 years of MAGIC and VERITAS observations corresponding to 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The resulting light curves are shown in daily and monthly scales where no significant variability is observed. In addition, we show the first joint analysis using combined event data from the two VHE instruments and Fermi-LAT to compute the spectral energy distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star-forming regions are thought to be the most common birth environments in the Galaxy and the only birth places of very massive stars. Their presence in the stellar cluster alters the conditions within the cluster impacting at the same time the evolution of other cluster members. In principle, copious amounts of ultraviolet radiation produced by massive stars can remove material from outer parts of the protoplanetary disks around low- and intermediate-mass stars in the process of external photoevaporation, effectively reducing the planet-formation capabilities of those disks. Here, we present deep VLT/MUSE observations of low-mass stars in Trumpler 14, one of the most massive, young, and compact clusters in the Carina Nebula Complex. We provide spectral and stellar properties of 717 sources and based on the distribution of stellar ages derive the cluster age of $\sim$1~Myr. The majority of the stars in our sample have masses $\leqslant$1~$M_\odot$, what makes our spectroscopic catalogue the most deep to date in term of masses, and proves that detailed investigations of low-mass stars are possible in the massive but distant regions. Spectroscopic studies of low-mass members of the whole Carina Nebula Complex are missing. Our work provides an important step forward towards filling this gap and set the stage for follow-up investigation of accretion properties in Trumpler 14.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our second catalog of quadruple star candidates, containing 101 systems discovered in TESS Full-Frame Image data. The targets were initially detected as eclipsing binary stars with the help of supervised machine learning methods applied to sectors Sectors 1 through 54. A dedicated team of citizen scientists subsequently identified through visual inspection two sets of eclipses following two different periods. All 101 systems presented here pass comprehensive photocenter motion tests confirming that both sets of eclipses originate from the target star. Some of the systems exhibit prominent eclipse time variations suggesting dynamical interactions between the two component binary stars. One target is an eclipsing quintuple candidate with a (2+1)+2 hierarchical configuration, such that the (2+1) subsystem produces eclipses on the triple orbit as well. Another has recently been confirmed as the second shortest period quadruple reported to date. This catalog provides ephemerides, eclipse depths and durations, sample statistics, and highlights potentially interesting targets for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Xenon scintillation has been widely used in rare event detection experiments, such as in neutrinoless double beta decay, double electron capture and dark matter searches. Nonetheless, experimental values for primary scintillation yield in gaseous xenon (GXe) remain scarce and dispersed. The mean energy required to produce a scintillation photon, w_sc in GXe in the absence of recombination has been measured to be in the range of 34-111 eV. Lower w_sc-values are often reported for alpha-particles when compared to electrons produced by gamma- or x-rays, being this difference not understood. We carried out a systematic study on the absolute primary scintillation yield in GXe under reduced electric fields in the 70-300 V/cm/bar range and near atmospheric pressure, 1.2 bar, supported by a robust geometrical efficiency simulation model. Neglecting the 3rd continuum emission, a mean w_sc-value of 38.7 [+- 0.6 (sta.)] [(- 7.2) (+ 7.7) (sys.)] eV was obtained for x/gamma-rays in the 5.9-60 keV energy range and alpha-particles in the 1.5-2.5 MeV range, no significant dependency neither on radiation type nor on energy has been observed. If the Xe 3rd continuum emission is to be considered, the average energy to produce a 2nd and a 3rd continuum photon was calculated as w_2nd = 43.5 [+- 0.7 (sta.)][(- 8.1)(+ 8.7) (sys.)] eV and w_3rd = 483 [+- 7 (sta.)][(- 105)(+ 110) (sys.)] eV, respectively, while the energy to produce either a 3rd or a 2nd continuum photon is w_(2nd + 3rd) = 39.9 [+- 0.6 (sta.)] [(- 7.4) (+ 8.0) (sys.)] eV. Our experimental w_sc-values agree with both state-of-art simulations and literature data obtained for alpha-particles. The discrepancy between our results and the experimental values found in the literature for x/gamma-rays is discussed and attributed to undressed large systematic errors in previous studies.

 Detecting Earth-like exoplanets in direct images of nearby Sun-like systems brings a unique set of challenges that must be addressed in the early phases of designing a space-based direct imaging mission. In particular, these systems may contain exozodiacal dust, which is expected to be the dominant source of astrophysical noise. Previous work has shown that it may be feasible to subtract smooth, symmetric dust from observations; however, we do not expect exozodiacal dust to be perfectly smooth. Exozodiacal dust can be trapped into mean motion resonances with planetary bodies, producing large-scale structures that orbit in lock with the planet. This dust can obscure the planet, complicate noise estimation, or be mistaken for a planetary body. Our ability to subtract these structures from high-contrast images of Earth-like exoplanets is not well understood. In this work, we investigate exozodi mitigation for Earth--Sun-like systems with significant mean motion resonant disk structures. We find that applying a simple high-pass filter allows us to remove structured exozodi to the Poisson noise limit for systems with inclinations $< 60^\circ$ and up to 100 zodis. However, subtracting exozodiacal disk structures from edge-on systems may be challenging, except for cases with densities $<5$ zodis. For systems with three times the dust of the Solar System, which is the median of the best fit to survey data in the habitable zones of nearby Sun-like stars, this method shows promising results for mitigating exozodiacal dust in future HWO observations, even if the dust exhibits significant mean-motion resonance structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique to improve the resolution of ground-based telescopes by correcting, in real-time, optical aberrations due to atmospheric turbulence and the telescope itself. With the rise of Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMT), AO is needed more than ever to reach the full potential of these future observatories. One of the main performance drivers of an AO system is the wavefront sensing operation, consisting of measuring the shape of the above mentioned optical aberrations. Aims. The non-modulated pyramid wavefront sensor (nPWFS) is a wavefront sensor with high sensitivity, allowing the limits of AO systems to be pushed. The high sensitivity comes at the expense of its dynamic range, which makes it a highly non-linear sensor. We propose here a novel way to invert nPWFS signals by using the principle of reciprocity of light propagation and the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm. We test the performance of this reconstructor in two steps: the technique is first implemented in simulations, where some of its basic properties are studied. Then, the GS reconstructor is tested on the Santa Cruz Extreme Adaptive optics Laboratory (SEAL) testbed located at the University of California Santa Cruz. This new way to invert the nPWFS measurements allows us to drastically increase the dynamic range of the reconstruction for the nPWFS, pushing the dynamics close to a modulated PWFS. The reconstructor is an iterative algorithm requiring heavy computational burden, which could be an issue for real-time purposes in its current implementation. However, this new reconstructor could still be helpful in the case of many wavefront control operations. This reconstruction technique has also been successfully tested on the Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory (SEAL) bench where it is now used as the standard way to invert nPWFS signal.

 - **Abstract**
 We present AspGap, a new approach to infer stellar labels from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, including precise [$\alpha$/M] estimates for the first time. AspGap is a neural-network based regression model trained on APOGEE spectra. In the training step, AspGap learns to use XP spectra not only to predict stellar labels but also the high-resolution APOGEE spectra that lead to the same stellar labels. The inclusion of this last model component -- dubbed the hallucinator -- creates a more physically motivated mapping and significantly improves the prediction of stellar labels in the validation, particularly of [$\alpha$/M]. For giant stars, we find cross-validated rms accuracies for Teff, log g, [M/H], [$\alpha$/M] of ~1%, 0.12 dex, 0.07 dex, 0.03 dex, respectively. We also validate our labels through comparison with external datasets and through a range of astrophysical tests that demonstrate that we are indeed determining [$\alpha$/M] from the XP spectra, rather than just inferring it indirectly from correlations with other labels. We publicly release the AspGap codebase, along with our stellar parameter catalog for all giants observed by Gaia XP. AspGap enables new insights into the formation and chemo-dynamics of our Galaxy by providing precise [$\alpha$/M] estimates for 23 million giant stars, including 12 million with radial velocities from Gaia.

 - **Abstract**
 This report presents the results of optical polarimetric observations carried out with 6-m and 1-m telescopes at SAO RAS. The study of the blazar S5 0716+714 radiation showed the presence of a period of the variability of brightness and polarization vector variations on scales of $\sim$1.5 hours, constant on a long time scale; multi-colour monitoring of BL Lac polarization before, during and after the flare demonstrates the difference in the patterns of polarization vector variability depending on the wavelength. Several geometrical models and physical descriptions are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are classified into repeaters and non-repeaters, with only a few percent of the observed FRB population from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) confirmed as repeaters. However, this figure represents only a lower limit due to the observational biases, and the true fraction of repeaters remains unknown. Correcting for these biases uncovers a notable decline in apparently non-repeating FRB detection rate as the CHIME operational time increases. This finding suggests that a significant portion of apparently non-repeating FRBs could in fact exhibit repetition when observed over more extended periods. A simple population model infers that the true repeater fraction likely exceeds 50% with 99% confidence, a figure substantially larger than the observed face value, even consistent with 100%. This greater prevalence of repeaters had previously gone unnoticed due to their very low repetition rates ($\sim$10$^{-3.5}$ hr$^{-1}$ on average). Hence, theoretical FRB models must incorporate these low-rate repeaters. Furthermore, our results indicate a significantly higher repeater volume number density, potentially exceeding observed values by up to 10$^4$ times, which in turn impacts comparisons with potential FRB progenitors.
