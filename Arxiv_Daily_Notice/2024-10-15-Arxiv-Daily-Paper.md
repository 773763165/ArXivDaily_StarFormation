          Nonlinear perturbations and weak shock waves in isentropic atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Acoustic perturbations to stellar envelopes can lead to the formation of weak shock waves via nonlinear wave-steepening. Close to the stellar surface, the weak shock wave increases in strength and can potentially lead to the expulsion of part of the stellar envelope. While accurate analytic solutions to the fluid equations exist in the limits of low amplitude waves or strong shocks, connecting these phases generally requires simulations. We address this problem using the fact that the plane parallel Euler equations, in the presence of a constant gravitational field, admit exact Riemann invariants when the flow is isentropic. We obtain exact solutions for acoustic perturbations and show that after they steepen into shock waves, Whitham's approximation can be used to solve for the shock's dynamics in the weak to moderately strong regimes, using a simple ordinary differential equation. Numerical simulations show that our analytic shock approximation is accurate up to moderate ($\sim$ few--15) Mach numbers, where the accuracy increases with the adiabatic index.

 In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. We explain the former with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models, i.e. unbiased likelihoods for both individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, and ultimately for an accurate interpretation of the LISA data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has highlighted the potentially detectable gravitational-lensing effect of neutrino halos on cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) fluctuations with upcoming instruments like SO, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD. Accurate modeling of neutrino-halo density profiles are essential for making theory predictions of their cosmological effects. Yet, they are computationally intensive, particularly in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we present an efficient numerical framework for computing neutrino profiles based on N-1-body simulations within a flat FRW Universe. Our approach enables highly parallelized, rapid calculations of neutrino trajectories near spherically symmetric dark-matter halos, delivering results within seconds. In addition to neutrinos, we demonstrate an application to model the clustering of other non-cold relics, such as a freeze-in dark-matter component. The framework is flexible in its definitions of cosmological and dark-matter-halo parameters, which can be particularly valuable for rapid-scanning tasks. It can also seamlessly incorporate new physics, as we demonstrate with examples of a time-varying gravitational constant and nonstandard neutrino phase-space distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the physical nature of a star requires precise knowledge of its stellar atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. This study presents a new atomic line list covering a broad spectral range (1-2.5 $\mu$m; $YJHK$-bands) for iron (Fe) and $\alpha$-elements (Ca, Mg, Ti, Si) to improve stellar parameter determination using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. We highlight the limitations of existing line lists, stemming primarily from inconsistencies in oscillator strengths for ionized iron lines within the APOGEE DR17. The line list was validated using the high-resolution and high-quality disc-center NIR spectra of the Sun and its solar analog HD 76151. As a result of the spectroscopic analyses, the effective temperature of HD 76151 was calculated as 5790$\pm$170 K, surface gravity as 4.35$\pm$0.18 cgs, metal abundance as 0.24$\pm$0.09 dex, and microturbulence velocity of 0.30$^{\rm +0.5}_{\rm -0.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ by combining the optical and NIR line lists. A comparison of the model atmospheric parameters calculated for HD 76151 with the PARSEC isochrones resulted in a stellar mass of $1.053_{-0.068}^{+0.056} M_{\odot}$, radius $1.125_{-0.011}^{+0.035} R_{\odot}$, and an age of 5.5$^{\rm +2.5}_{\rm -2.1}$ Gyr. For the first time, kinematic and dynamical orbital analyses of HD 76151 using a combination of Gaia astrometric and spectroscopic data showed that the star was born in a metal-rich region within the Solar circle and is a member of the thin disc population. Thus, the slightly metal-rich nature of the star, as reflected in its spectroscopic analysis, was confirmed by dynamical orbital analysis.

          Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.

          On a model of variable curvature that mimics the observed Universe acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new model based on General Relativity in where a subtle change of curvature at late times is able to produce the observed Universe acceleration and an oscillating behavior in the effective equation of state, similar to what has been claimed by recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations. This model is reassembled in the gap between traditional FLRW homogeneous and isotropic models and those Stephani models providing inhomogeneity functions in the time derivatives to explore other forms of varying curvature functions. Remarkably, in addition to an accelerated phase close to the usual $\Lambda$CDM equivalent transition from decelerated to accelerated Universe at $z \sim 0.6$, we also predict a slight decelerated behavior at $z=0$ in agreement with diverse Dark Energy parameterizations. To test our model, we considered the corresponding curvature transition to be sufficiently small (i.e., having $\dot{\kappa}\approx0$ preserved) and defined by a smooth step-like function with a slight change between two curvature values. We implemented a MCMC Likelihood analysis using cosmic chronometers and Type Ia supernovae (local Universe observations) data in order to constraint the free parameters of the model and reconstruct $H(z)$, $q(z)$, $w_{eff}(z)$ and its comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, our model provides an alternative to understand the Universe acceleration without the need of a cosmological constant, obtaining the same fraction of matter density as in the traditional standard model. The behavior of the proposed model points towards a new and intriguing way to test slight violations to the cosmological principle, in particular the case of inhomogenities during low phase transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2018 the Large Sized Telescope (LST-1) prototype, designed to be the lowest energy detector for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, was inaugurated at the Observatorio de Roque de Los Muchachos in La Palma, Canary Island and today three more are under construction, LST2-4. The LST camera, with 1855 photomultipliers (PMTs), requires precise and regular calibration. The camera calibration system (hereafter CaliBox), installed at the center of the telescope mirror dish, is equipped with a Q-switching 355 nm UV laser corresponding to the wavelength at which the maximum camera PMT quantum efficiency is achieved, a set of filters to guarantee a large dynamic range of photons on each camera pixel, and a Ulbricht sphere to spread uniformly the laser light over the camera plane 28 m away. The system is managed by an ODROID-C1+ single board computer that communicates through an Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPCUA) protocol to the camera. The CaliBox is designed to fulfill the requirements needed for the calibration of the camera including the monitor of the photon flux to guarantee the quality of the CaliBox system of laser stability, uniform illumination and intensity range. In this paper, we present in detail the optical system, the monitor of the photon flux, the relevant electronic to monitor the device. The performance of the device, photon flux monitor, evaluation of the photon flux sent to the camera obtained during tests performed in Laboratory are shown.

          Thousands of planetesimals: Simulating the streaming Instability in very large computational domains

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability is a mechanism whereby pebble-sized particles in protoplanetary discs spontaneously come together in dense filaments, which collapse gravitationally to form planetesimals upon reaching the Roche density. The extent of the filaments along the orbital direction is nevertheless poorly characterised, due to a focus in the literature on small simulation domains where the behaviour of the streaming instability on large scales cannot be determined. We present here computer simulations of the streaming instability in boxes with side lengths up to 6.4 scale heights in the plane. This is 32 times larger than typically considered simulation domains and nearly a factor 1,000 times the volume. We show that the azimuthal extent of filaments in the non-linear state of the streaming instability is limited to approximately one gas scale height. The streaming instability will therefore not transform the pebble density field into axisymmetric rings; rather the non-linear state of the streaming instability appears as a complex structure of loosely connected filaments. Including the self-gravity of the pebbles, our simulations form up to 4,000 planetesimals. This allows us to probe the high-mass end of the initial mass function of planetesimals with much higher statistical confidence than previously. We find that this end is well-described by a steep exponential tapering. Since the resolution of our simulations is moderate -- a necessary trade-off given the large domains -- the mass distribution is incomplete at the low-mass end. When putting comparatively less weight on the numbers at low masses, at intermediate masses we nevertheless reproduce the power-law shape of the distribution established in previous studies.

          Estimating Cosmological Parameters and Reconstructing Hubble Constant with Artificial Neural Networks: A Test with Reconstructed $H(z)$

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a new approach to constrain the cosmological parameters and estimate Hubble constant. We reconstructed a function from observational Hubble data using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The training data we used are covariance matrix and mock $H(z)$. With the reconstructed $H(z)$, we can get the Hubble constant, and thus do the comparison with the CMB-based measurements. Furthermore, in order to constrain the cosmological parameters, we sampled data points from the reconstructed data and estimated the posterior distribution. The constraining result behaved well comparing to the ones from the mock observational Hubble data. We propose that the $H(z)$ reconstructed by our artificial neural network can represent the actual distribution of real observational data, and therefore can be used in further cosmological research.

          Assessing Core-Powered Mass Loss in the Context of Early Boil-Off: Minimal Long-Lived Mass Loss for the Sub-Neptune Population

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We develop a python-based state-of-the-art sub-Neptune evolution model that incorporates both the post-formation boil-off at young ages $\leq$ 1 Myr and long-lived core-powered mass loss ($\sim$ Gyrs) from interior cooling. We investigate the roles of initial H/He entropy, core luminosity, energy advection, radiative atmospheric structure, and the transition to an XUV-driven mass-loss phase, with an eye on relevant timescales for planetary mass loss and thermal evolution. With particular attention to the re-equilibration process of the H/He envelope, including the energy sources that fuel the hydrodynamic wind, and energy transport timescales, we find boil-off and core-powered escape are primarily driven by stellar bolometric radiation. We further find that both boil-off and core-powered escape are decoupled from the thermal evolution. We show that, with a boil-off phase that accounts for the initial H/He mass fraction and initial entropy, post-boil-off core-powered escape has an insignificant influence on the demographics of small planets, as it is only able to remove at most 0.1% of the H/He mass fraction. Our numerical results are directly compared to previous work on analytical core-powered mass loss modeling for individual evolutionary trajectories and populations of small planets. We examine a number of assumptions made in previous studies that cause significant differences compared to our findings. We find that boil-off, though able to completely strip the gaseous envelope from a highly irradiated ($F \geq 100 F_\oplus$) planet that has a low-mass core ($M_c \leq 4M_\oplus$), cannot by itself form a pronounced radius gap as is seen in the observed population.

          The cosmic distance duality relation in light of the time-delayed strong gravitational lensing

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic distance duality relation (DDR), which links the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance, is a cornerstone in modern cosmology. Any deviation from DDR may indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this paper, we use four high-precision time-delayed strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems provided by the H0LiCOW to test the validity of DDR. To this end, we directly compare the angular diameter distances from these SGL systems and the luminosity distances from the latest Pantheon+ compilation of SNe Ia. In order to reduce the statistical errors arising from redshift matching, the Gaussian process method is applied to reconstruct the distance-redshift relation from the Pantheon+ dataset. We parameterize the possible violation of DDR in three different models. It is found that all results confirm the validity of DDR at 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations based on the future LSST survey indicate that the precision of DDR could reach $10^{-2}$ level with 100 SGL systems.

          Is the Gum Nebula an Important Interstellar Scattering Disk of Background Pulsars?

 - **Abstract**
 The Gum Nebula is a faint supernova remnant extending about 40 degrees across the southern sky, potentially affecting tens of background pulsars. Though the view that the Gum Nebula acts as a potential scattering screen for background pulsars has been recurrently mentioned over the past five decades, it has not been directly confirmed. We chose the strong background pulsar PSR~B0740$-$28 as a probe and monitored its diffractive interstellar scintillation (DISS) at 2.25~$\&$~8.60~GHz simultaneously for about two years using the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT). DISS was detected at both frequencies and quantified by two-dimensional autocorrelation analysis. We calculated their scattering spectral index $\alpha$ and found that 9/21 of the observations followed the theoretical predictions, while 4/21 of them clearly showed $\alpha < 4$. This finding provides strong support for anomalous scattering along the pulsar line of sight, due to the large frequency lever arm and the simultaneous features of our dual-frequency observations. In comparison to the 2.25~GHz observations, scintillation arcs were observed in 10/21 of the secondary spectrum plots for 8.60~GHz observations. Consequently, the highest frequency record for pulsar scintillation arc detection was updated to 8.60~GHz. Our fitting results were the most direct evidence for the view that the Gum Nebula acts as the scattering screen for background pulsars, because both the distance ($245^{+69}_{-72}$~pc) and transverse speed ($22.4^{+4.1}_{-4.2}$~km/s) of the scintillation screen are comparable with related parameters of the Gum Nebula. Our findings indicated that anisotropic scattering provides a superior explanation for the annual modulation of scintillation arcs than isotropic scattering. Additionally, the orientation of its long axis was also fitted.

 GD1400AB was one of the first known white dwarf$+$brown dwarf binaries, and is the only one of these systems where the white dwarf is a ZZ Ceti pulsator. Here we present both radial velocity measurements and time series photometry, analysing both the white dwarf pulsations and the effects of irradiation on the brown dwarf. We find the brightness temperatures of 1760$/pm$10 K for the night side and 1860$/pm$10 K for the day side indicate the brown dwarf is hotter than spectra have previously suggested, although brightness temperatures calculated using a larger radius for the brown dwarf are consistent with previously determined spectral types. We also discuss the likely evolutionary pathway of this binary, and put its common envelope phase into context with the other known systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Technological progress related to astronomical observatories such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows searching for signs of life beyond our Solar System, namely in the form of unambiguous biosignature gases in exoplanetary atmospheres. The tentative assignment of a $1-2.4\sigma$ spectral feature observed with JWST in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b to the biosignature gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS; sum formula C$_2$H$_6$S) raised hopes that, although controversial, a second genesis had been found. Terrestrial atmospheric DMS is exclusively stemming from marine biological activity and no natural abiotic source has been identified - neither on Earth nor in space. Therefore, DMS is considered a robust biosignature. Since comets possess a pristine inventory of complex organic molecules of abiotic origin, we have searched high-resolution mass spectra collected at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, target of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, for the signatures of DMS. Previous work reported the presence of a C2H6S signal when the comet was near its equinox but distinction of DMS from its structural isomer ethanethiol remained elusive. Here we reassess these and evaluate additional data. Based on differences in the electron ionization induced fragmentation pattern of the two isomers, we show that DMS is significantly better compatible with the observations. Deviations between expected and observed signal intensities for DMS are $<1\sigma$, while for ethanethiol they are $2-4\sigma$. The local abundance of DMS relative to methanol deduced from these data is (0.13$\pm$0.04)%. Our results provide the first evidence for the existence of an abiotic synthetic pathway to DMS in pristine cometary matter and hence motivate more detailed studies of the sulfur chemistry in such matter and its analogs.

          The variability of Betelgeuse explained by surface convection

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant (RSG) that is known to vary semi-regularly on both short and long timescales. The origin of the short period of Betelgeuse has often been associated to radial pulsations but could also be due to the convection motions present at the surface of RSGs. Aims. We investigate the link between surface activity and the variability of the star. Methods. Linear polarization in Betelgeuse is a proxy of convection which is unrelated to pulsations. Using 10 years of spectropolarimetric data of Betelgeuse, we seek for periodicities in the least-squares deconvolution profiles of Stokes I, Q, U and the total linear polarization using Lomb-Scargle periodograms. Results. We find similar periods in linear polarization signals than in photometric variability. The 400 d period is too close to a peak of the window function of our data. But the two periods of 330 d and 200 d are present in the periodogram of Stokes Q and U, showing that the variability of Betelgeuse can be interpreted as due to surface convection. Conclusions. Since linear polarization in the spectrum of Betelgeuse is not known to vary with pulsations, but is linked to surface convection, and since similar periods are found in time series of photometric measurements and spectropolarimetry, we conclude that the photometric variability is due to the surface convective structures, and not to any pulsation phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 In inverse problems, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to obtain error bars with coverage guarantees that are independent of any prior assumptions about the data distribution. In the context of mass mapping, uncertainties could lead to errors that affects our understanding of the underlying mass distribution, or could propagate to cosmological parameter estimation, thereby impacting the precision and reliability of cosmological models. Current surveys, such as Euclid or Rubin, will provide new weak lensing datasets of very high quality. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in mass maps is therefore critical to perform reliable cosmological parameter inference. In this paper, we extend the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm, initially proposed for scalar regression, to inverse problems. We compare our approach with another distribution-free approach based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS). Both methods are based on a calibration dataset, and offer finite-sample coverage guarantees that are independent of the data distribution. Furthermore, they are applicable to any mass mapping method, including blackbox predictors. In our experiments, we apply UQ on three mass-mapping method: the Kaiser-Squires inversion, iterative Wiener filtering, and the MCALens algorithm. Our experiments reveal that RCPS tends to produce overconservative confidence bounds with small calibration sets, whereas CQR is designed to avoid this issue. Although the expected miscoverage rate is guaranteed to stay below a user-prescribed threshold regardless of the mass mapping method, selecting an appropriate reconstruction algorithm remains crucial for obtaining accurate estimates, especially around peak-like structures, which are particularly important for inferring cosmological parameters. Additionally, the choice of mass mapping method influences the size of the error bars.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift protoclusters consisting of dusty starbursts are thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution. Their dusty nature makes them bright in the FIR/submm but difficult to find in optical/NIR surveys. Radio observations are an excellent way to study these dusty starbursts, as dust is transparent in the radio and there is a tight correlation between the FIR and radio emission of a galaxy. Here, we present MeerKAT 1.28 GHz radio imaging of 3 Herschel candidate protoclusters, with a synthesised beam size of ~$7.5'' \times 6.6''$ and a central thermal noise down to $4.35~\mu$Jy/beam. Our source counts are consistent with other radio counts with no evidence of overdensities. Around 95% of the Herschel sources have 1.28 GHz IDs. Using the Herschel 250 micron primary beam size as the searching radius, we find 54.2% Herschel sources have multiple 1.28 GHz IDs. Our average FIR-radio correlation coefficient $q_{250\mu m}$ is $2.33\pm 0.26$. Adding $q_{250\mu m}$ as a new constraint, the probability of finding chance-aligned sources is reduced by a factor of ~6, but with the risk of discarding true identifications of radio-loud/quiet sources. With accurate MeerKAT positions, we cross-match our Herschel sources to optical/NIR data followed by photometric redshift estimations. By removing $z<1$ sources, the density contrasts of two of the candidate protoclusters increase, suggestive of them being real protoclusters at $z>1$. There is also potentially a $0.9<z<1.2$ overdensity associated with one candidate protocluster. In summary, photometric redshifts from radio-optical cross-identifications have provided some tentative evidence of overdensities aligning with two of the candidate protoclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to forming a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables. Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present high-resolution (R~100,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N~800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44 493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances re-determined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44 493 is a low-mass (0.83Msun) old (12.1-13.2Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5Msun Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44 493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation - MAD=16m/s), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44 493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as msin(i)=2MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.

          Wolf-Rayet -- compact object binaries as progenitors of binary compact objects

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries with a Wolf-Rayet star and a compact object (WR-COs), either a black hole (BH) or a neutron star (NS), have been proposed as possible progenitors for the binary compact object mergers (BCOs) observed with the gravitational wave (GW) detectors. In this work, we use the open-source population synthesis code SEVN to investigate the role of WR-COs as BCO progenitors. We consider an initial population of $5 \times 10^6$ binaries and we evolve it across 96 combinations of metallicities, common envelope efficiencies, core-collapse supernova models and natal kick distributions. We find that WR-COs are the progenitors of most BCOs, especially at high and intermediate metallicity. At $Z=0.02,\,{}0.014,$ and $0.0014$, more than $\gtrsim 99 \%$ of all the BCOs in our simulations evolved as WR-COs. At $Z = 0.00014$, inefficient binary-stripping lowers the fraction of BCOs with WR-CO progenitors to $\approx 83-95 \%$. Despite their key role in BCO production, only $\approx 5-30 \%$ of WR-COs end their life as BCOs. We find that Cyg X-3, the only WR-CO candidate observed in the Milky Way, is a promising BCO progenitor, especially if it hosts a BH. In our simulations, about $\approx 70-100 \%$ of the Cyg X-3 - like systems in the WR-BH configuration (BH mass $ \leq 10 \rm ~ M_\odot$) are BCO progenitors, in agreement with the literature. Future observations of WR-COs similar to Cyg X-3 may be the Rosetta stone to interpret the formation of BCOs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present revised point-spread functions (PSFs) for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). These PSFs provide a robust estimate of the light diffracted by the meshes holding the entrance and focal plane filters and the light that is diffusely scattered over medium- to long-distance by the micro-roughness of the mirrors. We first calibrate the diffracted light using flare images. Our modeling of the diffracted light provides reliable determinations of the mesh parameters and finds that about 24 to 33% of the collected light is diffracted, depending on the AIA channel. Then, we fit for the diffuse scattered light using partially lunar occulted images. We find that the diffuse scattered light can be modeled as a superposition of two power law functions that scatter light over the entire length of the detector. The amount of diffuse scattered light ranges from 10 to 35 %, depending on the AIA channel. In total, AIA diffracts and scatters about 40 to 60 % of the collected light over medium to long distances. When correcting for this, bright image regions increase in intensity by about 30 %, dark image regions decrease in intensity by up to 90 %, and the associated differential emission measure analysis of solar features are affected accordingly. Finally, we compare the image reconstructions using our new PSFs to those using the AIA team PSFs and the PSFs of Poduval et al. (2013). We find that our PSFs outperform the others; our PSFs correct well for the flare diffraction pattern and predict accurately the long-distance scattered light in lunar occultations.

          Gravitational waves in ultra-slow-roll and their anisotropy at two loops

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the non-Gaussian corrections to the energy density and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced after an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation by using a diagrammatic approach, and present the corresponding Feynman rules. Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spatially-resolved (~3 pc pix$^{-1}$) analysis of the distribution, kinematics, and excitation of warm H2 gas in the nuclear starburst region of M83. Our JWST/MIRI IFU spectroscopy reveals a clumpy reservoir of warm H2 (> 200 K) with a mass of ~2.3 x 10$^{5}$ Msun in the area covered by all four MRS channels. We additionally use the [Ne II] 12.8 ${\mu}$m and [Ne III] 15.5 ${\mu}$m lines as tracers of the star formation rate, ionizing radiation hardness, and kinematics of the ionized ISM, finding tantalizing connections to the H2 properties and to the ages of the underlying stellar populations. Finally, qualitative comparisons to the trove of public, high-spatial-resolution multiwavelength data available on M83 shows that our MRS spectroscopy potentially traces all stages of the process of creating massive star clusters, from the embedded proto-cluster phase through the dispersion of ISM from stellar feedback.

          Hidden under a warm blanket: If planets existed in protostellar disks, they would hardly produce observable substructures

 - **Abstract**
 The onset of planet formation is actively under debate. Recent mass measurements of disks around protostars suggest an early start of planet formation in the Class 0/I disks. However, dust substructures, one possible signature of forming planets, are rarely observed in the young Class 0/I disks, while they are ubiquitous in the mature Class II disks. It is not clear whether the lack of dust substructures in the Class 0/I disks indicates absence of planets or whether it is due to other physical effects such as temperature and dust opacity. Here we consider the effect of temperature on the ability of planets to produce dust substructures. We prescribe the evolution of the disk and the protostar from Class 0 to Class II phase and calculate the disk temperature using radiative transfer models at various stages of the evolution. We use the mid-plane temperature to calculate the disk scale height and the minimum planet mass needed to open observable dust gaps using the thermal criterion. We find that this minimum planet mass decreases as a function of time. Particularly, we find that if a planet up to ${\sim}5$ M$_{\oplus}$ in the inner ${\sim}5$ au or up to ${\sim}10-50$ M$_{\oplus}$ at radii ${\gtrsim}5$ au was already formed in the early protostellar phase ($t< 2\times 10^5$ yr) it would barely produce any dust substructures. We conclude that a major contribution to the observed lack of substructures (if produced by planets) in the early protostellar phase - lowering their frequency by ${\sim}50\%$ - could be elevated temperatures rather than the absence of planets.
