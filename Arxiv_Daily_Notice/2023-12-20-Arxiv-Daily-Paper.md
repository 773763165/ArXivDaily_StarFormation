 - **Abstract**
 We explore large-scale cosmic structure using the spatial distribution of 542 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) having accurately measured positions and spectroscopic redshifts. Prominent cosmological clusters are identified in both the northern and southern galactic hemispheres (avoiding extinction effects in the plane of the Milky Way) using the Bootstrap Point-Radius method. The Northern Galactic hemisphere contains a significant group of four GRBs in the redshift range 0.59 < z < 0.62 (with a Bootstrap probability of p = 0.012) along with the previously-identified Hercules-Corona Borealis GreatWall (in the revised redshift range 0.9 < z < 2.1, p = 0.017). The Southern Galactic hemisphere contains the previously-identified Giant GRB Ring (p = 0.022) along with another possible cluster of 7 - 9 GRBs at 1.179 < z < 1.444 (p = 0.031). Additionally, both the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall and the Giant GRB Ring have become more prominent as the GRB sample size has grown. The approach used here underscores the potential value of GRB clustering as a probe of large-scale cosmic structure, complementary to galaxy and quasar clustering. Because of the vast scale on which GRB clustering provides valuable insights, it is important that optical GRB monitoring continue so that additional spectroscopic redshift measurements should be obtained.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and multi-wavelength characterisation of VVV J1438-6158 AB, a new field wide-binary system consisting of a 4.6(+5.5-2.4) Gyr and Teff = 9500+/-125 K DA white dwarf (WD) and a Teff = 2400+/-50 K M8 ultracool dwarf (UCD). The projected separation of the system is a = 1236.73 au (~13.8"), and although along the line-of-sight towards the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) stellar association, VVV J1438-6158 AB is likely to be a field star, from a kinematic 6D probabilistic analysis. We estimated the physical, and dynamical parameters of both components via interpolations with theoretical models and evolutionary tracks, which allowed us to retrieve a mass of 0.62+/-0.18 MSun for the WD, and a mass of 98.5+/-6.2 MJup (~0.094+/-0.006 MSun) for the UCD. The radii of the two components were also estimated at 0.01309+/-0.0003 RSun and 1.22+/-0.05 RJup, respectively. VVV J1438-6158 AB stands out as a benchmark system for comprehending the evolution of WDs and low-mass companions given its status as one of the most widely separated WD+UCD systems known to date, which likely indicates that both components may have evolved independently of each other, and also being characterised by a large mass-ratio (q = 0.15+/-0.04), which likely indicates a formation pathway similar to that of stellar binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are observed to emit bright and spatially extended emission at multi-TeV energies. Although such "TeV halos" appear to be an approximately universal feature of middle-aged pulsars, there remains much to be understood about these systems. In this paper, we project the ability of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to measure the properties of TeV halos, focusing on the case of the nearby Geminga pulsar. We conclude that CTA will be able to provide important information about this source, allowing us to discriminate between a range of different models that are currently consistent with all existing data. In particular, such observations will help us to measure the normalization, energy dependence, and spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the region that surrounds Geminga, as well as the spectrum of the electrons that are injected from this source.

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed archival spectra of the hot UV-bright star ZNG 1 in the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). From these data, we derive an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 43{,}000 \pm 1400$ K, a surface gravity $\log g = 4.47 \pm 0.08$, a rotational velocity $v \sin i = 157 \pm 12$ km s$^{-1}$, and a mass $M = 0.92 \pm 0.17 \, M_{\odot}$. The atmosphere is helium-rich ($Y = 0.99$) and enhanced in CNO (relative to the cluster). The spectrum exhibits wind features with a terminal velocity near 1500 km s$^{-1}$ and strong discrete absorption components (DACs). The high helium abundance, stellar mass, and rotational velocity suggest that the star is a merger remnant, and its parameters are consistent with models of a pair of merging He-core white dwarfs.
#### Soft X-ray and FUV observations of Nova Her 2021 (V1674~Her) with  AstroSat

 - **Abstract**
 Nova Her 2021 or V1674 Her was one of the fastest novae to be observed so far. We report here the results from our timing and spectral studies of the source observed at multiple epochs with AstroSat. We report the detection of a periodicity in the source in soft X-rays at a period of 501.4--501.5 s which was detected with high significance after the peak of the super-soft phase, but was not detected in the far ultraviolet (FUV) band of AstroSat. The shape of the phase-folded X-ray light curves has varied significantly as the nova evolved. The phase-resolved spectral studies reveal the likely presence of various absorption features in the soft X-ray band of 0.5--2 keV, and suggest that the optical depth of these absorption features may be marginally dependent on the pulse phase. Strong emission lines from Si, N and O are detected in the FUV, and their strength declined continuously as the nova evolved and went through a bright X-ray state.

 - **Abstract**
 Modified gravity models with scale-dependent linear growth typically exhibit an enhancement in the power spectrum beyond a certain scale. The conventional methods for extracting cosmological information usually involve inferring modified gravity effects via Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), particularly through the time evolution of $f\sigma_8$. However, classical galaxy RSD clustering analyses encounter difficulties in accurately capturing the spectrum's enhanced power, which is better obtained from the broad-band power spectrum. In this sense, full-shape analyses aim to consider survey data using comprehensive and precise models of the whole power spectrum. Yet, a major challenge in this approach is the slow computation of non-linear loop integrals for scale-dependent modified gravity, precluding the estimation of cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Based on recent studies, in this work we develop a perturbation theory tailored for Modified Gravity, or analogous scenarios introducing additional scales, such as in the presence of massive neutrinos. Our approach only needs the calculation of the scale-dependent growth rate $f(k,t)$ and the limit of the perturbative kernels at large scales. We called this approximate technique as fk-Perturbation Theory and implemented it into the code fkpt, capable of computing the redshift space galaxy power spectrum in a fraction of a second. We validate our modeling and code with the $f(R)$ theory MG-GLAM and General Relativity NSeries sets of simulations. The code is available at https://github.com/alejandroaviles/fkpt

 - **Abstract**
 The acquisition of high-quality deep images of planetary nebulae (PNe) has allowed the detection of a wealth of small-scale features, which highlight the complexity of the formation history and physical processes shaping PNe. Here we present the discovery of three groups of clumps embedded within the nebular shell of the evolved PN NGC3587, the Owl Nebula, that had escaped previous detections. The analysis of multi-wavelength GEMINI GMOS, NOT ALFOSC, Aristarchos Andor optical, CFHT WIRCam and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS infrared (IR) images indicates that these clumps are formed by material denser and colder than the surrounding nebula, with a notable content of molecular H2, but negligible or null amounts of dust. The presence of H2-rich pockets embedded within the ionized shell of this evolved PN is suggestive of the survival of high-density condensations of material created at the onset of the PN stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Light pollution is recognized as a global issue that, like other forms of anthropogenic pollution, has significant impact on ecosystems and adverse effects on living organisms. Multiple evidence suggests that it has been increasing at an unprecedented rate at all spatial scales. Chile, which thanks to its unique environmental conditions has become one of the most prominent astronomical hubs of the world, seems to be no exception. In this paper we present the results of the first observing campaign aimed at quantifying the effects of artificial lights at night (ALAN) on the brightness and colors of Chilean sky. Through the analysis of photometrically calibrated all-sky images captured at four representative sites with an increasing degree of anthropization, and the comparison with state-of-the-art numerical models, we show that significant levels of light pollution have already altered the appearance of the natural sky even in remote areas. Our observations reveal that the light pollution level recorded in a small town of the Coquimbo Region is comparable with that of Flagstaff, a ten times larger Dark Sky city, and that a mid-size urban area door to the Atacama Desert displays photometric indicators of night sky quality that are typical of the most densely populated regions of Europe. Our results suggest that there is still much to be done in Chile to keep the light pollution phenomenon under control and thus preserve the darkness of its night sky - a natural and cultural heritage that is our responsibility to protect.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's atmosphere comprises several dynamical regimes: the equatorial eastward flows and surrounding retrograde jets; the midlatitudes, with the eddy-driven, alternating jet-streams and meridional circulation cells; and the jet-free turbulent polar region. Despite intensive research conducted on each of these dynamical regimes over the past decades, they remain only partially understood. Saturn's atmosphere also encompasses similar distinguishable regimes, but observational evidence for midlatitude deep meridional cells is lacking. Models offer a variety of explanations for each of these regions, but only a few are capable of simulating more than one of the regimes at once. This study presents new numerical simulations using a 3D deep anelastic model that can reproduce the equatorial flows as well as the midlatitudinal pattern of the mostly barotropic, alternating eddy-driven jets and the meridional circulation cells accompanying them. These simulations are consistent with recent Juno mission gravity and microwave data. We find that the vertical eddy momentum fluxes are as important as the meridional eddy momentum fluxes, which drive the midlatitudinal circulation on Earth. In addition, we discuss the parameters controlling the number of midlatitudinal jets/cells, their extent, strength, and location. We identify the strong relationship between meridional circulation and the zonal jets in a deep convection setup, and analyze the mechanism responsible for their generation and maintenance. The analysis presented here provides another step in the ongoing pursuit of understanding the deep atmospheres of gas giants.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first broadband study of Mrk421 from radio to TeV gamma rays with simultaneous measurements of the X-ray polarization from IXPE. The data were collected within an extensive multiwavelength campaign organized between May and June 2022 using MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Swift, and several optical and radio telescopes to complement IXPE. During the IXPE exposures, the measured 0.2-1 TeV flux is close to the quiescent state and ranges from 25% to 50% of the Crab Nebula without intra-night variability. Throughout the campaign, the VHE and X-ray emission are positively correlated at a $4\sigma$ significance level. The IXPE measurements unveil a X-ray polarization degree that is a factor of 2-5 higher than in the optical/radio bands; that implies an energy-stratified jet in which the VHE photons are emitted co-spatially with the X-rays, in the vicinity of a shock front. The June 2022 observations exhibit a rotation of the X-ray polarization angle. Despite no simultaneous VHE coverage being available during a large fraction of the swing, the Swift-XRT monitoring unveils an X-ray flux increase with a clear spectral hardening. It suggests that flares in high synchrotron peaked blazars can be accompanied by a polarization angle rotation, as observed in some flat spectrum radio quasars. Finally, during the polarization angle rotation, NuSTAR data reveal two contiguous spectral hysteresis loops in opposite directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise), implying important changes in the particle acceleration efficiency on $\sim$hour timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an intriguing candidate alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM). The FDM model predicts that dark halos have characteristic core structure generated by the effect of quantum pressure, which is different from the structure of CDM halos. We devise a semi-analytic model of a FDM halo density profile by assuming that the density distribution results from the redistribution of mass in a halo with the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We calculate the mass redistribution radius by considering dynamical relaxation within the FDM halo. We adopt a concentration-halo mass relation with lower concentration compared to that in the CDM model below the half mode mass, which originates from the suppressed matter density fluctuations at small length scales. Our model reproduces the core-halo mass relation (CHMR) found in the numerical simulation of \citet{2014NatPh..10..496S} at $z<1$. We show that the CHMR is well described by a double power law, unlike previous studies that approximate it by a single power law. Our model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of the largest FDM simulation of \citet{2021MNRAS.506.2603M} at $z=3$. We argue that the scatter of the CHMR might originate from the scatter of the concentration-halo mass relation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a promising candidate for dark matter, characterized by its ultra-light mass, which gives rise to wave effects at astrophysical scales. These effects offer potential solutions to the small-scale issues encountered within the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this paper, we investigate the large-scale structure of the cosmic web using FDM simulations, comparing them to CDM-only simulations and a simulation incorporating baryonic effects. Our study employs the nearest neighbor (NN) analysis as a new statistical tool for examining the structure and statistics of the cosmic web in an FDM universe. This analysis could capture the information absent in the two-point correlation functions. In particular, we analyze data related to the spherical contact, nearest neighbor distances, and the angle between the first and second nearest neighbors of halos. Specifically, we utilize probability distribution functions, statistical moments, and fitting parameters, as well as G(x), F(x), and J(x) functions to analyze the above data. Remarkably, the results from the FDM simulations differ significantly from the others across these analyses, while no noticeable distinction is observed between the baryonic and CDM-only simulations. Moreover, the lower FDM mass leads to more significant deviations from the CDM simulations. These compelling results highlight the efficiency of the NN analysis - mainly through the use of the J(x) function, $s_3$, $l_{3}$ and $a_4$ parameters - as a prominent new tool for investigating FDM on large scales and making observational predictions.
#### Jupiter Mass Binaries and Cosmic Ray Viscosity

 - **Abstract**
 The wide binary fraction of planetary mass objects in the Trapezium cluster is much greater than implied by extrapolation to lower masses of the wide binary fraction of stars. Wide binaries may be produced by gravitational collapse of a medium with fluid vorticity. In a uniform medium with uniform vorticity the criterion for collapse is independent of the size and mass of the collapsing region, which would imply a wide binary fraction independent of mass, in contradiction to observation. The excess of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects in the Trapezium cluster may be attributed to cosmic ray viscosity that transports angular momentum to surrounding material. Viscosity is more effective in smaller and less massive collapsing regions, preferentially producing planetary mass wide binaries.
#### Bayesian Analysis of a Generalized Starobinsky Model with Reheating  Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 We study a generalization of the the Starobinsky model adding a term of the form $R^{2p}$ to the Einstien-Hilbert action. We take the power $p$ as a parameter of the model and explore the constraints from CMB plus BAO data through a Bayesian analysis, thus exploring a range of values for the exponent parameter. We incorporate a reheating phase to the model through the background matter content (equation of state) and the duration of this period (number of $e$-foldings of reheating). We find that incorporating information from reheating imposes constraints on cosmological quantities, more stringent than the case of no reheating when tested with the Planck+BAO data. The inferred value of the exponent parameter is statistically consistent with $p=1$, favoring the original Starobinsky potential. Moreover, we report tighter constraints on $p$ and the number of $e$-folds in comparison with previous works. The obtained values for other inflationary observational parameters, such as the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the scalar amplitude of perturbations $A_s$, are consistent with prior measurements. Finally we present the alternative use of consistency relations in order to simplify the parameter space and test the generalized Starobinsky potential even more efficiently.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of radio-loud stars has to date been studied primarily through either targeted observations of a small number of highly active stars or widefield, single-epoch surveys that cannot easily distinguish stellar emission from background extra-Galactic sources. As a result it has been difficult to constrain population statistics such as the surface density and fraction of the population producing radio emission in a particular variable or spectral class. In this paper we present a sample of 36 radio stars detected in a circular polarisation search of the multi-epoch Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) pilot survey with ASKAP at 887.5~MHz. Through repeat sampling of the VAST pilot survey footprint we find an upper limit to the duty cycle of M-dwarf radio bursts of 8.5 per cent, and that at least $10 \pm 3$ per cent of the population should produce radio bursts more luminous than $10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We infer a lower limit on the long-term surface density of such bursts in a shallow 1.25 mJy PSF$^{-1}$ sensitivity survey of $9^{+11}_{-7} \times 10^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$ and an instantaneous radio star surface density of $1.7 \pm 0.2 \times 10^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$ on 12 min timescales. Based on these rates we anticipate ${\sim}200 \pm 50$ new radio star detections per year over the full VAST survey and ${\sim}41\,000^{+10\,000}_{-9\,000}$ in next-generation all-sky surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.

 - **Abstract**
 In the latest Gaia third data release one can find extremely small proper motion components for the star HD 7977. This, together with the radial velocity measurement lead to the conclusion that this star passed very close to the Sun in the recent past. Such a very close approach of a one solar mass star must result in noticeable changes in the motion of all Solar System bodies, especially those on less tight orbits, namely long-period comets (LPCs) and Kuiper belt objects. We estimate and present these effects. Our current knowledge on the stellar surroundings of the Sun found in the latest Gaia catalogues allowed us to perform numerical integrations and prepare a list of potential stellar perturbers of LPCs. We use this list, made available in the StePPeD database. To study the past motion of LPCs under the simultaneous action of the Galactic potential and passing stars, we use precise original cometary orbits taken from the current CODE catalogue. We examine the reliability of the extremely small proper motion of HD 7977 concluding that this star can be an unresolved binary but according to the astrometry covering more than a century, the current Gaia results cannot be ruled out. We present the parameters of a very close passage of this star near the Sun. We also show examples of the strong influence of this passage on the past motion of some LPCs. We also discuss the possible influence of this perturber on other Solar System bodies. It is possible that 2.47 Myr ago the one solar mass star HD 7977 passed as close as one thousand au from the Sun. Such an event constitutes a kind of dynamical horizon for all studies of the past Solar System bodies' dynamics.
#### Atmospheres as a Window to Rocky Exoplanet Surfaces

 - **Abstract**
 As the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres proceeds, providing insights into atmospheric chemistry and composition, a key question is how much deeper into the planet we might be able to see from its atmospheric properties alone. For small planets with modest atmospheres and equilibrium temperatures, the first layer below the atmosphere will be their rocky surface. For such warm rocky planets, broadly Venus-like planets, the high temperatures and moderate pressures at the base of their atmospheres may enable thermochemical equilibrium between rock and gas. This links the composition of the surface to that of the observable atmosphere. Using an equilibrium chemistry code, we find a boundary in surface pressure-temperature space which simultaneously separates distinct mineralogical regimes and atmospheric regimes, potentially enabling inference of surface mineralogy from spectroscopic observations of the atmosphere. Weak constraints on the surface pressure and temperature also emerge. This regime boundary corresponds to conditions under which SO2 is oxidized and absorbed by calcium-bearing minerals in the crust, thus the two regimes reflect the sulphidation of the crust. The existence of these atmospheric regimes for Venus-like planets is robust to plausible changes in the elemental composition. Our results pave the way to the prospect of characterizing exoplanetary surfaces as new data for short period rocky planet atmospheres emerge.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of energy-dependent morphology for the GeV gamma-ray emission from HESS J1857+026 with more than 13 years of {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. The GeV gamma-ray emission from this region is composed of two extended components. The hard component with an index of $1.74 \pm 0.07$ in the energy range of 0.5-500 GeV is spatially coincident with HESS J1857+026, and its 68\% containment radius varies from $\sim 0.44^\circ$ below 40 GeV to $\sim 0.30^\circ$ above 140 GeV. The hard GeV gamma-ray spectrum and the energy-dependent morphology of HESS J1857+026 make it favor a PWN origin, which is associated with the energetic pulsar, PSR J1856+0245. The soft component with an index of $2.70 \pm 0.16$ and another extended gamma-ray source detected in this region, 4FGL J1857.9+0313e with an index of $2.55 \pm 0.07$, are spatially coincidence with two molecular clumps in the northeast and southwest of HESS J1857+026, which favors the hadronic process, and the protons could be accelerated by the hypothetical SNR associated with PSR J1856+0245.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) internal kinematics have been studied in unprecedented depth thanks to the excellent quality of the Gaia mission data, revealing the disc's non-axisymmetric structure. Aims: We want to constrain the LMC bar pattern speed using the astrometric and spectroscopic data from the Gaia mission. Methods: We apply three methods to evaluate the bar pattern speed: it is measured through the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method, the Dehnen method and a bisymmetric velocity (BV) model. The methods provide additional information on the bar properties such as the corotation radius and the bar length and strength. The validity of the methods is tested with numerical simulations. Results: A wide range of pattern speeds are inferred by the TW method, owing to a strong dependency on the orientation of the galaxy frame and the viewing angle of the bar perturbation. The simulated bar pattern speeds (corotation radii, respectively) are well recovered by the Dehnen method (BV model). Applied to the LMC data, the Dehnen method finds a pattern speed Omega_p = -1.0 +/- 0.5 km s-1 kpc-1, thus corresponding to a bar which barely rotates, slightly counter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc. The BV method finds a LMC bar corotation radius of Rc = 4.20 +/- 0.25 kpc, corresponding to a pattern speed Omega_p = 18.5^{+1.2}_{-1.1} km s-1 kpc-1. Conclusions: It is not possible to decide which global value best represents an LMC bar pattern speed with the TW method, due to the strong variation with the orientation of the reference frame. The non-rotating bar from the Dehnen method would be at odds with the structure and kinematics of the LMC disc. The BV method result is consistent with previous estimates and gives a bar corotation-to-length ratio of 1.8 +/- 0.1, which makes the LMC hosting a slow bar.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are weak and broad interstellar absorption features in astronomical spectra originating from unknown molecules. To measure DIBs in spectra of late-type stars more accurately and more efficiently, we developed a Random Forest model to isolate the DIB features from the stellar components and applied this method to 780 thousand spectra collected by the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) that were published in the third data release (DR3). After subtracting the stellar components, we modeled the DIBs $\lambda$8621 and $\lambda$8648. After quality control, we selected 7619 reliable measurements. The rest-frame wavelength of DIB $\lambda$8621 was updated as $\lambda_0\,{=}\,8623.141\,{\pm}\,0.030$ AA in vacuum, corresponding to 8620.766 AA in air, which was determined by 77 DIB measurements toward the Galactic anti-center. With the peak finding method and a coarse analysis, DIB $\lambda$8621 was found to correlate better with the neutral hydrogen than the molecular hydrogen (represented by $^{12}$CO $J\,{=}\,(1{-}0)$ emission). We also obtained 179 reliable measurements of DIB $\lambda$8648 in the RVS spectra of individual stars for the first time, further confirming this very broad DIB feature. A rough estimation of $\lambda_0$ for DIB $\lambda$8648 was 8646.31 AA in vacuum, corresponding to 8643.93 AA in air, assuming that the carriers of $\lambda$8621 and $\lambda$8648 are co-moving. We confirmed the impact of stellar residuals on the DIB measurements in Gaia DR3, which led to a distortion of the DIB profile and a shift of the center ($\lesssim0.5$ AA), but the EW was consistent with our new measurements. With our measurements and analyses, we propose that the machine-learning-based approach can be widely applied to measure DIBs in numerous spectra from spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric time series gathered by space telescopes such as CoRoT and Kepler allow to detect solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars and to measure their global seismic constraints, which can be used to infer global stellar properties (e.g. masses, radii, evolutionary states). Combining such precise constraints with photospheric abundances provides a means of testing mixing processes that occur inside red-giant stars. In this work, we conduct a detailed spectroscopic and seismic analysis of nine nearby (d < 200 pc) red-giant stars observed by Kepler. Both seismic constraints and grid-based modelling approaches are used to determine precise fundamental parameters for those evolved stars. We compare distances and radii derived from Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes with those inferred by a combination of seismic, spectroscopic and photometric constraints. We find no deviations within errorsbars, however the small sample size and the associated uncertainties are a limiting factor for such comparison. We use the period spacing of mixed modes to distinguish between ascending red-giants and red-clump stars. Based on the evolutionary status, we apply corrections to the values of $\Delta\nu$ for some stars, resulting in a slight improvement to the agreement between seismic and photometric distances. Finally, we couple constraints on detailed chemical abundances with the inferred masses, radii and evolutionary states. Our results corroborate previous studies that show that observed abundances of lithium and carbon isotopic ratio are in contrast with predictions from standard models, giving robust evidence for the occurrence of additional mixing during the red-giant phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel technique within the Nested Sampling framework to enhance efficiency of the computation of Bayesian evidence, a critical component in scientific data analysis. In higher dimensions, Nested Sampling relies on Markov Chain-based likelihood-constrained prior samplers, which generate numerous 'phantom points' during parameter space exploration. These points are too auto-correlated to be used in the standard Nested Sampling scheme and so are conventionally discarded, leading to waste. Our approach discovers a way to integrate these phantom points into the evidence calculation, thereby improving the efficiency of Nested Sampling without sacrificing accuracy. This is achieved by ensuring the points within the live set remain asymptotically i.i.d. uniformly distributed, allowing these points to contribute meaningfully to the final evidence estimation. We apply our method on several models, demonstrating substantial enhancements in sampling efficiency, that scales well in high-dimension. Our findings suggest that this approach can reduce the number of required likelihood evaluations by at least a factor of 5. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving the robustness and speed of statistical analyses over a wide range of fields, from astrophysics and cosmology to climate modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of low-mass stars have frequently shown a disagreement between observed stellar radii and radii predicted by theoretical stellar structure models. This ``radius inflation'' problem could have an impact on both stellar and exoplanetary science. We present the final results of our observation programme with the CHEOPS satellite to obtain high-precision light curves of eclipsing binaries with low mass stellar companions (EBLMs). Combined with the spectroscopic orbits of the solar-type companion, we can derive the masses, radii and effective temperatures of 23 M-dwarf stars. We use the PYCHEOPS data analysis software to analyse their primary and secondary occultations. For all but one target, we also perform analyses with TESS light curves for comparison. We have assessed the impact of starspot-induced variation on our derived parameters and account for this in our radius and effective temperature uncertainties using simulated light curves. We observe trends for inflation with both metallicity and orbital separation. We also observe a strong trend in the difference between theoretical and observational effective temperatures with metallicity. There is no such trend with orbital separation. These results are not consistent with the idea that observed inflation in stellar radius combines with lower effective temperature to preserve the luminosity predicted by low-mass stellar models. Our EBLM systems are high-quality and homogeneous measurements that can be used in further studies into radius inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 The primary goal of this paper is to derive precise Fourier parameters of the radial velocity (RV) curves for fundamental and first-overtone Galactic Cepheids. For each star, we carefully selected RV measurements available in the literature which yield the highest precision of Fourier parameters. We performed a Fourier decomposition of the RV curves. We subtracted RV modulations caused by binary motion and have removed other residual trends. Finally, we have displayed and analyzed qualitatively the progressions found for Fourier parameters. We applied a standard identification of their pulsation mode based on their Fourier phase $\phi_{21}$. Our final sample includes 178 fundamental-mode and 33 first overtone pulsators, as well as 7 additional Cepheids whose pulsation mode is uncertain or undetermined according to our criteria. For the fundamental-mode Cepheids, we improved the precision of Fourier parameters in comparison of previous results from the literature. We are able to firmly identify V495 Cyg as a new first-overtone Cepheid. We confirm first-overtone nature of several other stars. We also show that $\alpha$ UMi should be definitely classified as a first-overtone pulsator. In 3 objects (VY Per, AQ Pup and QZ Nor) we found significant $\gamma$-velocity variations that we attribute to spectroscopic binarity. Finally, the analysis of the F-mode Fourier parameters up to 7th order reveals tight progression of Fourier phases. For $P<10\,$day we find a well defined upper limit for the Fourier amplitude $A_1$. The pulsation period coverage and the precision obtained, in particular for Fourier phase $\phi_{21}$, will be useful for studying the dynamics of Cepheid pulsations with the help of hydrodynamical models. Further radial velocity measurements from modern high-resolution spectroscopic instruments will be important to improve these results.
#### One size fits all: Insights on Extrinsic Thermal Absorption from  Similarity of Supernova Remnant Radio Continuum Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Typically, integrated radio frequency continuum spectra of supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit a power-law form due to their synchrotron emission. In numerous cases, these spectra show an exponential turnover, long assumed due to thermal free-free absorption in the interstellar medium. We use a compilation of Galactic radio continuum SNR spectra, with and without turnovers, to constrain the distribution of the absorbing ionized gas. We introduce a novel parameterization of SNR spectra in terms of a characteristic frequency v_*, which depends both on the absorption turnover frequency and the power-law slope. Normalizing to v_* and to the corresponding flux density, S_*, we demonstrate that the stacked spectra of our sample reveal a similarity in behavior with low scatter (r.m.s. ~15%), and a unique exponential drop-off fully consistent with the predictions of a free-free absorption process. Observed SNRs, whether exhibiting spectral turnovers or not, appear to be spatially well mixed in the Galaxy without any evident segregation between them. Moreover, their Galactic distribution does not show a correlation with general properties such as heliocentric distance or Galactic longitude, as might have been expected if the absorption were due to a continuous distribution of ionized gas. However, it naturally arises if the absorbers are discretely distributed, as suggested by early low-frequency observations. Modeling based on HII regions tracking Galactic spiral arms successfully reproduces the patchy absorption observed to date. While more extensive statistical datasets should yield more precise spatial models of the absorbing gas distribution, our present conclusion regarding its inhomogeneity will remain robust.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we extend the standard cosmological model within the quadratic energy-momentum squared gravity (qEMSG) framework, introducing a nonminimal interaction between the usual material field ($T_{\mu\nu}$) and its accompanying quadratic energy-momentum squared field (qEMSF, $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm qEMSF}$), defined by $f(\mathbf{T}^2) = \alpha \mathbf{T}^2$ with $\mathbf{T^2}=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. Focusing on high energy scales relevant to big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), we employ $^4$He abundance to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. Our analysis selects the radiation-dominated universe solution compatible with the standard cosmological model limit as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ and reveals that qEMSF interaction model can modify the radiation energy density's evolution, potentially altering neutron-proton interconversion rates and consequently affecting $^4$He abundance in various ways. We establish the most stringent cosmological bounds on $\alpha$: $(-8.81 \leq \alpha \leq 8.14) \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{eV}^{-4}$ (68\% CL) from Aver \textit{et al.}'s primordial $^4$He abundance measurements, aligning with $\alpha=0$. Additionally, $(3.48 \leq\alpha \leq 4.43)\,\times 10^{-27} \rm{eV}^{-4}$ (68\% CL) from Fields \textit{et al.}'s estimates, utilizing the Planck-CMB estimated baryon density within the standard cosmological model framework, diverges from $\alpha=0$, thereby lending support to the qEMSF interaction model. The study also highlights the bidirectional nature of energy-momentum/entropy transfer in qEMSF interaction model, depending on the sign of $\alpha$. The implications of qEMSF in the presence of additional relativistic relics are also explored, showcasing the model's potential to accommodate deviations from standard cosmology and the Standard Model of particle physics.
