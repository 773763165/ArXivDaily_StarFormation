 - **Abstract**
 CIZA J2242.8+5301, or the Sausage cluster, is well studied over a range of frequencies. Since its first discovery, a lot of interesting features and unique characteristics have been uncovered. In this work, we report some more new morphological features using the uGMRT band-3 and band-4 data. In the north relic, we observe variation in spectral index profiles across the relic width from the east to west, which may indicate a decrease in downstream cooling rate in that direction. We re-confirm the presence of an additional ~ 930 kpc relic in the north. We classify the filamentary source in the downstream region to be a narrow angle tail (NAT) radio galaxy. The bright arc in the east relic shows sub-structure in the spectral index profile, which may indicate the presence of finer filaments. We further report the presence of a double-strand structure in the east relic similar to the 'Toothbrush' relic. We categorize the bright 'L' shaped structure in the southern relic to be a NAT radio galaxy, as well as trace the actual ~ 1.1 Mpc relic component. We re-confirm the existence of the faint southern extent, measuring the relic length to be ~ 1.8 Mpc. Furthermore, we suggest the southern relic to be a union of individual component relics rather than a single giant filamentary relic. Lastly, based on the morphological symmetry between northern and southern relics, we suggest a schematic shock structure associated with the merger event in an attempt to explain their formation scenario.

          The inflated, eccentric warm Jupiter TOI-4914 b orbiting a metal-poor star, and the hot Jupiters TOI-2714 b and TOI-2981 b

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of giant planets have revealed unexpected bulk densities. Hot Jupiters, in particular, appear larger than expected for their masses compared to planetary evolution models, while warm Jupiters seem denser than expected. These differences are often attributed to the influence of the stellar incident flux, but could they also result from different planet formation processes? Is there a trend linking the planetary density to the chemical composition of the host star? In this work we present the confirmation of three giant planets in orbit around solar analogue stars. TOI-2714 b ($P \simeq 2.5$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.22 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 0.72 M_{\rm J}$) and TOI-2981 b ($P \simeq 3.6$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.2 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 2 M_{\rm J}$) are hot Jupiters on nearly circular orbits, while TOI-4914 b ($P \simeq 10.6$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.15 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 0.72 M_{\rm J}$) is a warm Jupiter with a significant eccentricity ($e = 0.41 \pm 0.02$) that orbits a star more metal-poor ([Fe/H]$~= -0.13$) than most of the stars known to host giant planets. Our radial velocity (RV) follow-up with the HARPS spectrograph allows us to detect their Keplerian signals at high significance (7, 30, and 23$\sigma$, respectively) and to place a strong constraint on the eccentricity of TOI-4914 b (18$\sigma$). TOI-4914 b, with its large radius and low insolation flux ($F_\star < 2 \times 10^8~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$), appears to be more inflated than what is supported by current theoretical models for giant planets. Moreover, it does not conform to the previously noted trend that warm giant planets orbiting metal-poor stars have low eccentricities. This study thus provides insights into the diverse orbital characteristics and formation processes of giant exoplanets, in particular the role of stellar metallicity in the evolution of planetary systems.

          Using Neural Network Models to Estimate Stellar Ages from Lithium Equivalent Widths: An EAGLES Expansion

 - **Abstract**
 We present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model of photospheric lithium depletion in cool stars (3000 < Teff / K < 6500), producing estimates and probability distributions of age from Li I 6708A equivalent width (LiEW) and effective temperature data inputs. The model is trained on the same sample of 6200 stars from 52 open clusters, observed in the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, and used to calibrate the previously published analytical EAGLES model, with ages 2 - 6000 Myr and -0.3 < [Fe/H] < 0.2. The additional flexibility of the ANN provides some improvements, including better modelling of the "lithium dip" at ages < 50 Myr and Teff ~ 3500K, and of the intrinsic dispersion in LiEW at all ages. Poor age discrimination is still an issue at ages > 1 Gyr, confirming that additional modelling flexibility is not sufficient to fully represent the LiEW - age - Teff relationship, and suggesting the involvement of further astrophysical parameters. Expansion to include such parameters - rotation, accretion, and surface gravity - is discussed, and the use of an ANN means these can be more easily included in future iterations, alongside more flexible functional forms for the LiEW dispersion. Our methods and ANN model are provided in an updated version 2.0 of the EAGLES software.

          A survey of extremely metal-poor gas at cosmic noon: evidence of elevated [O/Fe]

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the high-precision chemical abundances of metal-poor gas clouds at cosmic noon (2<z<4) and investigate the associated enrichment histories. We analyse the abundances of four newly discovered metal-poor gas clouds utilising observations conducted with Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES. These systems are classified as very metal-poor (VMP), with [Fe/H]<-2.57, and one system qualifies as an extremely metal-poor (EMP) Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system with [Fe/H]=-3.13+/-0.06. In combination with new high-resolution data of two previously known EMP DLAs and 2 systems reported in the literature, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of eight of the most metal-poor gas clouds currently known. We focus on high-precision abundance measurements using the elements: C, N, O, Al, Si, and Fe. Our findings indicate increasing evidence of elevated [O/Fe] abundances when [Fe/H]<-3. EMP DLAs are well-modelled with a mean value of [O/Fe]=+0.50 +/- 0.04 and an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{int,[O/Fe]}=0.13^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$. While VMP DLAs are well-modelled with [O/Fe]=+0.40 +/- 0.02 and $\sigma_{int,[O/Fe]}$=0.06 +/- 0.02. We further find tentative evidence of a redshift evolution of [C/O] across these most metal-poor DLAs with lower redshift systems showing elevated [C/O] ratios. Using the measured abundances, combined with a stochastic chemical enrichment model, we investigate the properties of the stellar population responsible for enriching EMP gas at cosmic noon. We find that the chemistry of these systems is best explained via the enrichment of just two massive progenitors, N_*=2+/-1, that ended their lives as core collapse SNe with a typical explosion energy E_exp=(1.6 +/- 0.6)x10$^{51}$ erg. These progenitors formed obeying a Salpeter-like power-law IMF, where all stars of mass greater than M_max=32$^{+10}_{-4}$ M_sun collapse directly to black holes and do not contribute to the metal enrichment.

          On the dynamical evolution of Cepheid multiplicity in star clusters and its implications for B-star multiplicity at birth

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheid variable stars provide a unique probe to binary evolution in intermediate-mass stars over the course of several tens to hundreds of Myr. We studied the binary and multiple properties of Cepheids, assuming that all mid-B stars form in binaries inside star clusters. The binaries were subjected both to stellar evolution and dynamical encounters with other stars in the cluster. The dynamical cluster environment results in a higher binary fraction among the Cepheids that remain in star clusters ($\approx 60$%) than among the Cepheids which have escaped to the field ($\approx 35$%). In clusters, the binary, triple, and multiple fraction decreases with increasing cluster mass. More massive clusters have binaries of shorter orbital periods than lower mass clusters and field Cepheids. Mergers are very common with $\approx 30$% of mid-B stars not evolving to Cepheids because of the interaction with their companion. Approximately $40$ % of Cepheids have merged with their companion, and the merger event impacts stellar evolution; the age of Cepheids expected from their mass can differ from the age of their host cluster. Our models predict that one in five Cepheids is the result of a merger between stars with mass below the lower mass limit for Cepheids; in clusters, these objects occur substantially later than expected from their mass. Approximately $3$ to $5$ % of all Cepheids have a compact companion ($\approx 0.15$ % of all Cepheids are accompanied by a black hole). The binary fraction derived from our simulations (42%) underestimates the observed binary Cepheid fraction by approximately a factor of 2. This suggests that the true multiplicity fraction of B-stars at birth could be substantially larger than unity and, thus, that mid-B stars may typically form in triple and higher order systems.

          Nightside Clouds on Tidally-locked Terrestrial Planets Mimic Atmosphere-Free Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of nightside cloud formation on the observable night-day contrast of tidally-locked terrestrial planet atmospheres. We demonstrate that, in the case where the planetary dayside is only 10s of Kelvin hotter than the planetary nightside, the presence of optically thick nightside clouds can lead to observations that mimic a planet without an atmosphere, despite the planet actually hosting a significant (10 bar) atmosphere. The scenario presented in this work requires a level of intrinsic atmospheric day/night temperature contrast such that the nightside can form clouds while the dayside is too hot for cloud formation to occur. This scenario is most likely for hotter terrestrials and terrestrials with low volatile inventories. We thus note that a substantial dayside/nightside temperature difference alone does not robustly indicate that a planet does not host an atmosphere and additional observations and modeling are essential for characterization. We further discuss several avenues for future study to improve our understanding of the terrestrial planets and how best to characterize them with JWST.

          Confirming the Tidal Tails of the Young Open Cluster Blanco 1 with TESS Rotation Periods

 - **Abstract**
 Blanco 1 is an $\approx 130\,\mathrm{Myr}$ open cluster located 240 pc from the Sun below the Galactic plane. Recent studies have reported the existence of diffuse tidal tails extending 50-60 pc from the cluster center based on the positions and velocities measured by Gaia. To independently assess the reality and extent of this structure, we used light curves generated from TESS full-frame images to search for photometric rotation periods of stars in and around Blanco 1. We detected rotation periods down to a stellar effective temperature of $\approx 3100\,\mathrm{K}$ in 347 of the 603 cluster member candidates for which we have light curves. For cluster members in the core and candidate members in the tidal tails, both within a temperature range of 4400 to 6200 K, 74% and 72% of the rotation periods are consistent with the single-star gyrochronological sequence, respectively. In contrast, a comparison sample of field stars yielded gyrochrone-consistent rotation periods for only 8.5% of stars. The tidal tail candidates' overall conformance to the core members' gyrochrone sequence implies that their contamination ratio is consistent with zero and < 0.33 at the $2\sigma$ level. This result confirms the existence of Blanco 1 tidal tails and doubles the number of Blanco 1 members for which there are both spatio-kinematic and rotation-based cluster membership verification. Extending the strategy of using TESS light curves for gyrochronology to other nearby young open clusters and stellar associations may provide a viable strategy for mapping out their dissolution and broadening the search for young exoplanets.

          JWST COMPASS: The 3-5 Micron Transmission Spectrum of the Super-Earth L 98-59 c

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum of the super-Earth exoplanet L 98-59 c. This small (R$_p=1.385\pm0.085$R$_\oplus$, M$_p=2.22\pm0.26$R$_\oplus$), warm (T$_\textrm{eq}=553$K) planet resides in a multi-planet system around a nearby, bright (J = 7.933) M3V star. We find that the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c is featureless at the precision of our data. We achieve precisions of 22ppm in NIRSpec G395H's NRS1 detector and 36ppm in the NRS2 detector at a resolution R$\sim$200 (30 pixel wide bins). At this level of precision, we are able rule out primordial H$_2$-He atmospheres across a range of cloud pressure levels up to at least $\sim$0.1mbar. By comparison to atmospheric forward models, we also rule out atmospheric metallicities below $\sim$300$\times$ solar at 3$\sigma$ (or equivalently, atmospheric mean molecular weights below $\sim$10~g/mol). We also rule out pure methane atmospheres. The remaining scenarios that are compatible with our data include a planet with no atmosphere at all, or higher mean-molecular weight atmospheres, such as CO$_2$- or H$_2$O-rich atmospheres. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that planets $\lesssim1.5$R$_\oplus$ lack extended atmospheres.

          How external photoevaporation changes the inner disc's chemical composition

 - **Abstract**
 Stars mostly form in clusters where neighboring stars can influence proto-planetary disc evolution. Besides gravitational interactions, external photoevaporation can shape these discs. Depending on the strength of photoevaporation, discs can be destroyed within 1-2 Myrs or more gradually. We use the chemcomp code, incorporating a viscous disc evolution model with pebble drift and evaporation, to calculate the chemical composition of protoplanetary discs. This code is extended to include external photoevaporation based on the FRIED grid. Initially, the disc evolves purely viscously, with the inner disc's C/O ratio decreasing due to inward drifting and evaporating water ice pebbles. Over time, the C/O ratio increases as water vapor accretes onto the star and carbon-rich gas migrates inward. Once external photoevaporation starts, the outer disc disperses, but the inner disc's chemical evolution follows that of a purely viscous disc, as most pebbles have already drifted inward within 1 Myr. At low viscosity, the inner disc's C/O ratio remains sub-solar until dispersion by photoevaporation. At high viscosity, the C/O ratio can reach super-solar values, due to faster accretion of water vapor and inward migration of carbon-rich gas, provided the disc survives a few Myrs. In both cases, there is no significant difference in the inner disc's chemical composition compared to a purely viscous model due to the rapid inward drift of pebbles. Our model predicts that inner disc chemistry should be similar for discs subject to external photoevaporation and isolated discs, consistent with JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment aims to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos (>10 PeV) using radio detection techniques. To enhance ARA's capabilities, a new RFSoC-based DAQ, ARA-Next, is in the early stages of development. This advanced system will facilitate the creation of sophisticated triggers, including a novel multi-trigger approach, similar to those used in collider experiments. Our approach involves crafting and implementing innovative triggers for ARA's new DAQ, such as identifying double pulses from potential in-ice neutrino interactions, utilizing templates for atmospheric cosmic ray signals, optimizing triggers for astrophysical neutrino sources, correlating special events between ARA and IceCube, and discerning anthropogenic events using directional information. These trigger designs aim to lower thresholds and enhance ARA's detector sensitivity. Overall, this upgrade will not only enhance ARA's capabilities but also contribute to the technological advancements necessary for future experiments of this nature.

          Generalized inflation in the context of $\kappa$-deformed theories

 - **Abstract**
 A new inflationary scenario driven by a slowly-rolling homogeneous scalar field whose potential $V\left(\varphi\right)$ is given by a generalized exponential function is investigated. Within the {\it slow-roll} approximation we obtain the main predictions of the model and compare them with current data from cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations. We show that this single scalar field model admits a wider set of solutions than usual exponential scenarios and predicts acceptable values of the spectral index, running of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio for the remaining number of {\it e}-folds lying in the interval $N = 55 \pm 5$ and an energy scale on which $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$; in particular, we observe that the value of the model parameter $\kappa$ depends on the analysis. Finally, the primordial local non-Gaussianity is briefly discussed where we conclude that $k\gtrsim 0.02$ for $f_\text{NL}^\text{local} \ll 1$.

          The early radio afterglow of short GRB 230217A

 - **Abstract**
 We present the radio afterglow of short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 230217A, which was detected less than 1 day after the gamma-ray prompt emission with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The ATCA rapid-response system automatically triggered an observation of GRB 230217A following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and began observing the event just 32 minutes post-burst at 5.5 and 9 GHz for 7 hours. Dividing the 7-hour observation into three time-binned images allowed us to obtain radio detections with logarithmic central times of 1, 2.8 and 5.2 hours post-burst, the first of which represents the earliest radio detection of any GRB to date. The decline of the light curve is consistent with reverse shock emission if the observing bands are below the spectral peak and not affected by synchrotron self-absorption. This makes GRB 230217A the fifth short GRB with radio detections attributed to a reverse shock at early times ($<1$ day post-burst). Following brightness temperature arguments, we have used our early radio detections to place the highest minimum Lorentz factor (${\Gamma}_{min} > 50$ at $\sim1$ hour) constraints on a GRB in the radio band. Our results demonstrate the importance of rapid radio follow-up observations with long integrations and good sensitivity for detecting the fast-evolving radio emission from short GRBs and probing their reverse shocks.

          An Integral-Based Technique (IBT) to Accelerate the Monte-Carlo Radiative Transfer Computation for Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present an integral-based technique (IBT) algorithm to accelerate supernova (SN) radiative transfer calculations. The algorithm utilizes ``integral packets'', which are calculated by the path integral of the Monte-Carlo energy packets, to synthesize the observed spectropolarimetric signal at a given viewing direction in a 3-D time-dependent radiative transfer program. Compared to the event-based technique (EBT) proposed by (Bulla et al. 2015), our algorithm significantly reduces the computation time and increases the Monte-Carlo signal-to-noise ratio. Using a 1-D spherical symmetric type Ia supernova (SN Ia) ejecta model DDC10 and its derived 3-D model, the IBT algorithm has successfully passed the verification of: (1) spherical symmetry; (2) mirror symmetry; (3) cross comparison on a 3-D SN model with direct-counting technique (DCT) and EBT. Notably, with our algorithm implemented in the 3-D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SEDONA, the computation time is faster than EBT by a factor of $10-30$, and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is better by a factor of $5-10$, with the same number of Monte-Carlo quanta.

          The secondary classification of unequilibrated chondrites

 - **Abstract**
 The multiplication of decimal petrologic schemes for different or the same chondrite groups evinces a lack of unified guiding principle in the secondary classification of type 1-3 chondrites. We show that the current OC, R and CO classifications can be a posteriori unified, with only minor reclassifications, if the decimal part of the subtype is defined as the ratio $m=Fa_I/Fa_{II}$ of the mean fayalite contents of type I and type II chondrules rounded to the nearest tenth (with adaptations from Cr systematics for the lowest subtypes). This parameter is more efficiently evaluable than the oft-used relative standard deviations of fayalite contents and defines a general metamorphic scale from M0.0 to M1 (where the suffixed number is the rounded $m$). Type 3 chondrites thus span the range M0.0-M0.9 and M1 designates type 4. Corresponding applications are then proposed for other chondrite groups. Known type 1 and 2 chondrites are at M0.0 (i.e. the metamorphic grade of type 3.0 chondrites). Independently, we define an aqueous alteration scale from A0.0 to A1.0, where the suffixed number is the (rounded) phyllosilicate fraction (PSF). For CM and CR chondrites, the subtypes can be characterized in terms of the thin-section-based criteria of previous schemes which are thus incorporated in the present framework. The rounding of the PSF to the (in principle) nearest tenth makes the proposed taxonomy somewhat coarser than those schemes, but hereby more robust and more likely to be generalized in future meteorite declarations. We propose the corresponding petrologic subtype to be 3-PSF, rounded to the nearest tenth (so that type 1 would correspond to subtypes 2.0 and 2.1). At the level of precision chosen, nonzero alteration and metamorphic degrees remain mutually exclusive, so that a single petrologic subtype $\approx$ 3+$m$-PSF indeed remains a good descriptor of secondary processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters should initially form at considerable distances from host stars and subsequently migrate towards inner regions, supported directly by transit timing variation (TTV). We report the TTV of K2-237b, using reproduced timings fitted from \textit{Kepler} K2 and \textit{TESS} data. The timings span from 2016 to 2021, leading to an observational baseline of 5 years. The timing evolution presents a significant bias to a constant period scenario. The model evidence is evaluated utilizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which favours the scenario of period decay with a $\Delta$BIC of 14.1. The detected TTV induces a period decay rate ($\dot{P}$) of -1.14$\pm$0.28$\times$10$^{-8}$ days per day ($-$0.36 s/year). Fitting the spectral energy distribution, we find infrared excess at the significance level of 1.5 $\sigma$ for WISE W1 and W2 bands, and 2 $\sigma$ level for W3 and W4 bands. This potentially reveals the existence of a stellar disk, consisting of hot dust at 800$\pm$300 K, showing a $L_{dust}/L_{\ast}$ of 5$\pm$3$\times$10$^{-3}$. We obtain a stellar age of 1.0$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$$\times$10$^{9}$ yr from isochrone fitting. The properties of K2-237b potentially serve as a direct observational support to the planet disk migration though more observation are needed.

 - **Abstract**
 Intense bombardment of solar system planets in the immediate aftermath of protoplanetary disk dissipation has played a key role in their atmospheric evolution. During this epoch, energetic collisions will have removed significant masses of gas from rocky planet atmospheres. Noble gases are powerful tracers of this early atmospheric history, xenon in particular, which on Mars and Earth shows significant depletions and isotopic fractionations relative to the lighter noble gasses. To evaluate the effect of impacts on the loss and fractionation of xenon, we measure its ionization and recombination efficiency by laser shock and apply these constraints to model impact-driven atmospheric escape on Mars. We demonstrate that impact bombardment within the first $200$ to $300\,\text{Myr}$ of solar system history generates the observed Xe depletion and isotope fractionation of the modern martian atmosphere. This process may also explain the Xe depletion recorded in Earth's deep mantle and provides a latest date for the timing of giant planet instability.

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical shear instability (VSI) is widely believed to be effective in driving turbulence in protoplanetary disks. Prior studies on VSI exclusively exploit the reflecting boundary conditions (BCs) at the disk surfaces. VSI depends critically on the boundary behaviors of waves at the disk surfaces. We extend earlier studies by performing a comprehensive numerical analysis of VSI with partially reflecting BCs for both the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric unstable VSI modes. We find that the growth rates of the unstable modes diminish when the outgoing component of the flow is greater than the incoming one for high-order body modes. When the outgoing wave component dominates, the growth of VSI is notably suppressed. We find that the non-axisymmetric modes are unstable and they grow at a rate that decreases with the azimuthal wavenumber. The different BCs at the lower and upper disk surfaces naturally lead to non-symmetric modes relative to the disk midplane. The potential implications of our studies for further understanding planetary formation and evolution in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are also briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytical model of $\Sigma-D$ relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a clumpy medium. The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume-filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of $\Sigma-D$ relation for Galactic SNRs at $D\approx14-50$ pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their $\Sigma-D$ curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on $\Sigma-D$ plane, within a span of different densities and distances to clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed $\Sigma-D$ flattening and scatter originates in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of $\approx14$ pc, up to $\sim70$ pc, with the average density jump at clumpy medium of $\sim2-20$ times, roughly depending on the low density of circumstellar region. However, additional analysis considering the selection effects is needed, as well as the improvement of the model, considering radiation losses and thermal conduction.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse profile modelling (PPM) is a technique for inferring mass, radius and hotspot properties of millisecond pulsars. PPM is now regularly used for analysis of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars (RMPs) with data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). Extending PPM to accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs) is attractive, because they are a different source class featuring bright X-ray radiation from hotspots powered by accretion. In this paper, we present a modification of one of the PPM codes, X-PSI, so that it can be used for AMPs. In particular, we implement a model of an accretion disc and atmosphere model appropriate for the hotspots of AMPs, and improve the overall computational efficiency. We then test parameter recovery with synthetic NICER data in two scenarios with reasonable parameters for AMPs. We find in the first scenario, where the hotspot is large, that we are able to tightly and accurately constrain all parameters including mass and radius. In the second scenario, which is a high inclination system with a smaller hotspot, we find degeneracy between a subset of model parameters and a slight bias in the inferred mass and radius. This analysis of synthetic data lays the ground work for future analysis of AMPs with NICER data. Such an analysis could be complemented by future (joint) analysis of polarization data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).

 - **Abstract**
 In the summer of 2023, the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) announced a compelling evidence for the existence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Despite this breakthrough, however, several critical questions remain unanswered: What is the source of the signal? How can cosmic variance be accounted for? To what extent can we constrain nanohertz gravity? When will individual supermassive black hole binaries become observable? And how can we achieve a stronger detection? These open questions have spurred significant interests in PTA science, making this an opportune moment to revisit the astronomical and theoretical foundations of the field, as well as the data analysis techniques employed. In this review, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the SGWB as detected by PTAs. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the expected signal and its correlation, presented in a pedagogical manner, while also addressing current constraints. Looking ahead, we explore future milestones in the field, with detailed discussions on emerging theoretical considerations such as cosmic variance, the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions, subluminal gravitational waves, and the anisotropy and polarization of the SGWB.

 - **Abstract**
 As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infers the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we place an upper limit on the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance to be $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}\simeq0.3$ for PBHs with masses $\sim10^{-24}M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-19}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of third-order statistics in large-scale structure analyses has been hampered by the increased complexity of bispectrum estimators (compared to power spectra), the large dimensionality of the data vector, and the difficulty in estimating its covariance matrix. In this paper we present the filtered-squared bispectrum (FSB), an estimator of the projected bispectrum effectively consisting of the cross-correlation between the square of a field filtered on a range of scales and the original field. Within this formalism, we are able to recycle much of the infrastructure built around power spectrum measurement to construct an estimator that is both fast and robust against mode-coupling effects caused by incomplete sky observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing techniques for the estimation of analytical power spectrum covariances can be used within this formalism to calculate the bispectrum covariance at very high accuracy, naturally accounting for the most relevant Gaussian and non-Gaussian contributions in a model-independent manner.

 - **Abstract**
 Global expansion of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) will see the strategic addition of antennas at new geographical locations, transforming the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of the $\lambda \sim 1\,$mm EHT array. A possible South African EHT station would leverage a strong geographical advantage, local infrastructure, and radio astronomy expertise, and have strong synergies with the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia. We assessed three South African candidate millimetre sites using climatological simulations and found at least two promising sites. These sites are comparable to some existing EHT stations during the typical April EHT observing window and outperform them during most of the year, especially the southern hemisphere winter. Interferometric simulations of Africa-enhanced EHT arrays under the simulated atmospheric conditions demonstrate the improved array performance. In typical weather, the number of reliable visibility detections increased considerably, especially at $(u, v)$-distances corresponding to the angular sizes of the Sagittarius A$^*$ and Messier 87$^*$ black hole shadow diameters ($\sim40\,\mathrm{\mu}$as to $50\,\mathrm{\mu}$as). The simulation results underscore the sizable, positive impact of a strategically placed South African EHT station on ngEHT objectives and the resulting black hole science.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarized synchrotron emission is a fundamental process in high-energy astrophysics, particularly in the environments around black holes and pulsars. Accurate modeling of this emission requires precise computation of the emission, absorption, rotation, and conversion coefficients, which are critical for radiative transfer simulations. Traditionally, these coefficients are derived using fit functions based on precomputed ground truth values. However, these fit functions often lack accuracy, particularly in specific plasma conditions not well represented in the datasets used to generate them. In this work, we introduce ${\tt MLody}$, a deep neural network designed to compute polarized synchrotron coefficients with high accuracy across a wide range of plasma parameters. We demonstrate ${\tt MLody}$'s capabilities by integrating it with a radiative transfer code to generate synthetic polarized synchrotron images for an accreting black hole simulation. Our results reveal significant differences, up to a factor of two, in both linear and circular polarization compared to traditional methods. These differences could have important implications for parameter estimation in Event Horizon Telescope observations, suggesting that ${\tt MLody}$ could enhance the accuracy of future astrophysical analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 RISTRETTO is the evolution of the original idea of coupling the VLT instruments SPHERE and ESPRESSO \cite{lovis_2016a}, aiming at High Dispersion Coronagraphy. RISTRETTO is a visitor instrument that should enable the characterization of the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets in reflected light, by using the technique of high-contrast, high-resolution spectroscopy. Its goal is to observe Prox Cen b and other planets placed at about 35mas from their star, i.e. $2\lambda/D$ at $\lambda$=750nm. The instrument is composed of an extreme adaptive optics, a coronagraphic Integral Field Unit, and a diffraction-limited spectrograph (R=140.000, $\lambda =$620-840 nm). We present the RISTRETTO XAO architecture that reach the specification, providing contrasts down to $5\times10^{-5}$ at 2$\lambda/D$ from the star in the visible, in the presence of atmosphere and low wind effect. This performance is allowed by a new two-sensors-one-dm architecture, some variations to the already known concepts of unmodulated pyWFS and zWFS, and exploiting to the maximum of their capabilities the state-of-the-art high speed, low noise cameras \& fast DM. We present the result of end-to-end simulations, that demonstrate stable closed loop operation of an unmodulated pyramid and a zernike WFS (together), and in presence of low wind effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets on long period orbits around the nearest stars are among the easiest to directly image. Unfortunately these planets are difficult to fully constrain by indirect methods, e.g., transit and radial velocity (RV). In this study, we present the discovery of a super-Jupiter, HD 222237 b, orbiting a star located $11.445\pm0.002$ pc away. By combining RV data, Hipparcos and multi-epoch Gaia astrometry, we estimate the planetary mass to be ${5.19}_{-0.58}^{+0.58}\,M_{\rm Jup}$, with an eccentricity of ${0.56}_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ and a period of ${40.8}_{-4.5}^{+5.8}$ yr, making HD 222237 b a promising target for imaging using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. A comparative analysis suggests that our method can break the inclination degeneracy and thus differentiate between prograde and retrograde orbits of a companion. We further find that the inferred contrast ratio between the planet and the host star in the F1550C filter ($15.50\,\mu \rm m$) is approximately $1.9\times10^{-4}$, which is comparable with the measured limit of the MIRI coronagraphs. The relatively low metallicity of the host star ($\rm-0.32\,dex$) combined with the unique orbital architecture of this system presents an excellent opportunity to probe the planet-metallicity correlation and the formation scenarios of giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation is strongly influenced by the composition and distribution of volatiles within protoplanetary disks. With JWST, it is now possible to obtain direct observational constraints on disk ices, as recently demonstrated by the detection of ice absorption features towards the edge-on HH 48 NE disk as part of the Ice Age Early Release Science program. Here, we introduce a new radiative transfer modeling framework designed to retrieve the composition and mixing status of disk ices using their band profiles, and apply it to interpret the H2O, CO2, and CO ice bands observed towards the HH 48 NE disk. We show that the ices are largely present as mixtures, with strong evidence for CO trapping in both H2O and CO2 ice. The HH 48 NE disk ice composition (pure vs. polar vs. apolar fractions) is markedly different from earlier protostellar stages, implying thermal and/or chemical reprocessing during the formation or evolution of the disk. We infer low ice-phase C/O ratios around 0.1 throughout the disk, and also demonstrate that the mixing and entrapment of disk ices can dramatically affect the radial dependence of the C/O ratio. It is therefore imperative that realistic disk ice compositions are considered when comparing planetary compositions with potential formation scenarios, which will fortunately be possible for an increasing number of disks with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 12P/Pons-Brook exhibited multiple large and minor outbursts in 2023 on its way to its 2024 perihelion, as it has done during its previous apparitions. We obtained long-slit optical spectra of the comet in 2023 August and 2023 November with the INT-IDS, and in 2023 December with NOT-ALFOSC. Using a standard Haser model in a 10000km-radius aperture and commonly used empirical parent and daughter scale-lengths, our calculated abundance ratios show a constant "typical" composition throughout the period with a C$_2$/CN ratio of about 90 per cent. Molecular density profiles of different species along the slit show asymmetries between opposite sides of the coma and that C$_2$ seems to behave differently than CN and C$_3$. Comparing the coma profiles to a standard Haser model shows that this model cannot accurately reproduce the shape of the coma, and therefore that the calculated production rates cannot be deemed as accurate. We show that an outburst Haser model is a {slightly} better match to the C$_3$ and CN profile shapes, but the model still does not explain the shape of the C$_2$ profiles and requires equal parent and daughter scale-lengths. Our results suggest that the coma morphology could be better explained by extended sources, and that the nature of 12P's activity introduces bias in the determination of its composition.

          The Retrieved Atmospheric Properties of the Sub-stellar Object VHS 1256 b from Analyzing HST, VLT and JWST Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the observed ~30% variations in flux from the L7 dwarf VHS 1256 b, we subjected its time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 spectra (measured in two epochs in 2018 and 2020), as well as medium-resolution Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-shooter and Early Release Science James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra to a suite of both standard Bayesian (nested sampling) and machine-learning (random forest) retrievals. We find that both HST and VLT data require vertically varying abundance profiles of water in order to model the spectra accurately. Despite the large flux variations observed in the HST data, the temporal variability cannot be attributed to a single varying atmospheric property. The retrieved atmospheric quantities are consistent with being invariant across time. However, we find that model grids provide generally poor fits to the measured HST spectra and are unsuitable for quantifying the temporal variability of atmospheric properties. Additionally, our analysis of JWST spectra using model grids indicates consistency in retrieved properties across different wavelength channels. Despite the temporal variability in flux, the retrieved properties between HST and VLT, as well as between HST and JWST, are consistent within the respective posterior uncertainties. Such an outcome bodes well for future retrieval analyses of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are expected to exhibit weaker flux variations.
