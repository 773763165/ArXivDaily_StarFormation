#### Title:
          Computing the Instantaneous Collision Probability between Satellites using Characteristic Function Inversion

 - **Abstract**
 The probability that two satellites overlap in space at a specified instant of time is called their instantaneous collision probability. Assuming Gaussian uncertainties and spherical satellites, this probability is the integral of a Gaussian distribution over a sphere. This paper shows how to compute the probability using an established numerical procedure called characteristic function inversion. The collision probability in the short-term encounter scenario is also evaluated with this approach, where the instant at which the probability is computed is the time of closest approach between the objects. Python and R code is provided to evaluate the probability in practice. Overall, the approach has been established for over fifty years, is implemented in existing software, does not rely on analytical approximations, and can be used to evaluate two and three dimensional collision probabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.

          Revisiting the Tertiary-induced Binary Black Hole Mergers: the Role of Superthermal Wide Tertiary Eccentricity Distributions

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries (semimajor axis $\gtrsim10^3\;\mathrm{AU}$) observed by \emph{Gaia} tends to favor large eccentricities more strongly than the canonical thermal distribution ($P(e) \propto e$) -- such distributions are termed ``superthermal''. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the formation channel of black hole (BH) binary mergers in triple stellar systems and study the impact of superthermal eccentricity distributions in the outer binaries. We explore the persistence of the highly eccentric outer orbits after each component in a stellar triple has undergone mass loss due to supernova explosions. We find that the outer eccentricity distribution can remain significantly superthermal for modestly hierarchical BH triples satisfying $a_{\rm in}/a_{\rm out}\gtrsim 0.005$ (where $a_{\rm in}$ and $a_{\rm out}$ are the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits), and are otherwise shaped by mass-loss induced kicks and dynamical instability. We then study the impact of these different outer eccentricity distributions of the remaining BH triples on mergers via the tertiary-induced channel. Of interest, we find that mergers can sometimes be produced even when the initial stellar orbits are near alignment (not subject to the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect; ZLK effect) as long as the system is sufficiently hierarchical. On the other hand, although the impact of the octupole-order ZLK effect is much greater when the outer binary is more eccentric, we find that the merger fraction only changes modestly for extreme outer eccentricity distributions, as the largest eccentricities tend to lead to dynamical instability.

          Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterisation and high-cadence variability monitoring

 - **Abstract**
 The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360° vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.

          Damping wings in the Lyman-{\alpha} forest: a model-independent measurement of the neutral fraction at 5.4<z<6.1

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have positioned the endpoint of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) at redshift $z \sim 5.3$. However, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest have not yet been able to discern whether reionisation occurred slowly and late, with substantial neutral hydrogen persisting at redshift $\sim 6$, or rapidly and earlier, with the apparent late end driven by the fluctuating UV background. Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs are solid indicators that reionisation is not complete until $z=5.3$, but whether they contain significantly neutral gas has not yet been proven. We aim to answer this question by directly measuring, for the first time, the neutral hydrogen fraction ($x_\mathrm{HI}$) at the end of the EoR ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) in high-redshift quasars spectra. For high neutral fractions $x_\mathrm{HI}\gtrsim0.1$, GP troughs exhibit damping wing (DW) absorption extending over $1000$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond the troughs. While conclusively detected in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission lines of quasars at $z\geq7$, DWs are challenging to observe in the general Lyman-$\alpha$ forest due to absorption complexities and small-scale stochastic transmission features. We report the first successful identification of the stochastic DW signal adjacent to GP troughs at redshifts $z=5.6$ through careful stacking of the dark gaps in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We use the signal to present a measurement of the corresponding global $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.19\pm0.07$ $(_{-0.16}^{+0.11})$ at $1\sigma$ $(2\sigma)$ at $z=5.6$ and a limit $x_\mathrm{HI}<0.44$ at $z=5.9$. The detection of this signal demonstrates the existence of substantially neutral islands near the conclusion of the EoR, unequivocally signaling a late-and-slow reionization scenario.

          A Model for Eruptive Mass Loss in Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well-understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a locally super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with masses $10-100~M_\odot$ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to $\sim10^{-2}~M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the HR diagram between $3.5 \lesssim \log(T_\mathrm{eff}/\mathrm{K}) \lesssim 4.0$. This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses $\gtrsim20~M_\odot$ from evolving to become red supergiants, with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and therefore offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of red supergiants in that mass regime.

          Damping Wing-Like Features in the Stacked Ly$\alpha$ Forest: Potential Neutral Hydrogen Islands at $z<6$

 - **Abstract**
 Recent quasar absorption line observations suggest that reionization may end as late as $z \approx 5.3$. As a means to search for large neutral hydrogen islands at $z<6$, we revisit long dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest in VLT/X-Shooter and Keck/ESI quasar spectra. We stack the Ly$\alpha$ forest corresponding to the edges of these Ly$\beta$ dark gaps and identify a damping wing-like extended absorption profile. The average redshift of the stacked forest is $z=5.8$. By comparing these observations with reionization simulations, we infer that such a damping wing-like feature can be naturally explained if these gaps are at least partially created by neutral islands. Conversely, simulated dark gaps lacking neutral hydrogen struggle to replicate the observed damping wing features. Furthermore, this damping wing-like profile implies that the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction must be $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \geq 6.1 \pm 3.9\%$ at $z = 5.8$. Our results offer robust evidence that reionization extends below $z=6$.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based observations of `Barbarian' L-type asteroids at 1 to 2.5-$\mu$m indicate that their near-infrared spectra are dominated by the mineral spinel, which has been attributed to a high abundance of calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) -- the first solids to condense out of the protoplanetary disk during the formation of the Solar System. However, the spectral properties of these asteroids from 2.5 to 5-$\mu$m, a wavelength region that covers signatures of hydrated minerals, water, and organics, have not yet been explored. Here, we present 2 to 5-$\mu$m reflectance spectra of five spinel-rich asteroids obtained with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. All five targets exhibit a $\sim$ 2.85-$\mu$m absorption feature with a band depth of 3-6$\%$ that appears correlated in strength with that of the 2-$\mu$m spinel absorption feature. The shape and position of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature are not a good match to the 2.7-$\mu$m feature commonly seen in carbonaceous CM meteorites or C-type asteroids. The closest spectral matches are to the Moon and Vesta, suggesting commonalities in aqueous alteration across silicate bodies, infall of hydrated material, and/or space weathering by solar wind H implantation. Lab spectra of CO/CV chondrites, CAIs, as well as the minerals cronstedtite and spinel, also show a similar feature, providing clues into the origin of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. The binary supernova scenario (BSS) suggests that a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. The dynamical ejection scenario suggests that a star is ejected through a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the sub-cluster ejection scenario (SCES), where an infalling sub-cluster of stars is ejected out of the cluster by a slingshot interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of a young massive cluster forming from a $10^6\rm~M_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of sub-cluster mergers, determined by the initial turbulent, spherical initial conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming sub-clusters fall into the central potential, where they are ejected on a slingshot trajectory, forming groups of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed by the same SCES share similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling sub-clusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent BSS, which is a promising avenue for producing hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. The SCES occurs when sub-cluster formation is resolved. We expect non-spherical initial gas distributions to increase runaway star numbers. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via SCES thus reveals the assembly history of their natal clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Astro2020 Decadal Survey recognizes time-domain astronomy as a key science area over the next decade and beyond. With over 30 years of HST data and the potential for 20 years of JWST operations, these flagship observatories offer an unparalleled prospect for a half-century of space-based observations in the time domain. To take best advantage of this opportunity, STScI charged a working group to solicit community input and formulate strategies to maximize the science return in time-domain astronomy from these two platforms. Here, the HST/JWST Long-Term Monitoring Working Group reports on the input we received and presents our recommendations to enhance the scientific return for time-domain astronomy from HST and JWST. We suggest changes in policies to enable and prioritize long-term science programs of high scientific value. As charged, we also develop recommendations based on community input for a JWST Director's Discretionary Time program to observe high-redshift transients.

          The Significance of Void Shape: Neutrino Mass from Voronoi Void-Halos?

 - **Abstract**
 Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of cosmic structure on nonlinear scales, motivating the use of information beyond the power spectrum to tighten constraints on the neutrino mass, for example by considering cosmic voids. It was recently proposed that constraints on neutrino mass from the halo mass function (HMF) can be improved by considering only the halos that reside within voids -- the void-halo mass function (VHMF). We extend this analysis, which made spherical assumptions about the shape of voids, to take into account the non-spherical nature of voids as defined by the Voronoi-tessellation-based void finder, VIDE. In turn, after accounting for one spurious non-spherical void, we find no evidence that the VHMF contains information beyond the HMF. Given this finding, we then introduce a novel summary statistic by splitting halos according to the emptiness of their individual environments, defined by the Voronoi cell volume each halo resides in, and combining the mass functions from each split. We name the corresponding statistic the VorHMF and find that it could provide information regarding neutrino mass beyond the HMF. Our work thus motivates the importance of accounting for the full shape of voids in future analyses, both in terms of removing outliers to achieve robust results and as an additional source of cosmological information.

          Verification of astrometrically accelerating stars from Hipparcos and Gaia: I. Methodology and application to HIP 44842

 - **Abstract**
 A large number of candidate binary stars with apparent acceleration on the sky has emerged from analysis of astrometric data collected by the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and Gaia space missions. Although the apparent acceleration can serve as a relatively reliable indicator of binarity, it provides scarce information about the orbital and physical parameters of the components. With an emphasis on the search for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars hidden in binary systems, we start a broader effort to characterize the most promising candidates using follow-up ground-based observations. Accurate quantification of orbital and physical parameters of systems with dim or invisible companions requires combination of Hipparcos, Gaia, and precision spectroscopic measurements. In this paper, we review the necessary steps in this implementation and describe the improved Hipparcos-Gaia sample of long-term astrometric accelerations which includes correction of sky-correlated systematic errors using the vector spherical decomposition method. As an example, we study one Hipparcos star with a large acceleration, HIP 44842, where the companion is revealed to be a normal main sequence star.

          Robust 1-norm periodograms for analysis of noisy non-Gaussian time series with irregular cadences: Application to VLBI astrometry of quasars

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical time series often have non-uniform sampling in time, or irregular cadences, with long gaps separating clusters of observations. Some of these data sets are also explicitly non-Gaussian with respect to the expected model fit, or the simple mean. The standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram is based on the least squares solution for a set of test periods and, therefore, is easily corrupted by a subset of statistical outliers or an intrinsically non-Gaussian population. It can produce completely misleading results for heavy-tailed distribution of residuals. We propose a robust 1-norm periodogram technique, which is based on the principles of robust statistical estimation. This technique can be implemented in weighted or unweighted options. The method is described in detail and compared with the classical least squares periodogram on a set of astrometric VLBI measurements of the ICRF quasar IERS B0642+449. It is uniformly applied to a collection of 259 ICRF3 quasars each with more than 200 epoch VLBI measurements, resulting in a list of 49 objects with quasi-periodic position changes above the $3\sigma$ level, which warrant further investigation.

          Swift J1727.8-1613 has the Largest Resolved Continuous Jet Ever Seen in an X-ray Binary

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength polarimetry and radio observations of Swift J1727.8-1613 at the beginning of its recent 2023 outburst suggested the presence of a bright compact jet aligned in the north-south direction, which could not be confirmed without high angular resolution images. Using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Long Baseline Array, we imaged Swift J1727.8-1613, during the hard/hard-intermediate state, revealing a bright core and a large, two-sided, asymmetrical, resolved jet. The jet extends in the north-south direction, at a position angle of $-0.60\pm0.07°$ East of North. At 8.4 GHz, the entire resolved jet structure is $\sim110 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU long, with the southern approaching jet extending $\sim80 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU from the core, where $d$ is the distance to the source and $i$ is the inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight. These images reveal the most resolved continuous X-ray binary jet, and possibly the most physically extended continuous X-ray binary jet ever observed. Based on the brightness ratio of the approaching and receding jets, we put a lower limit on the intrinsic jet speed of $\beta\geq0.27$ and an upper limit on the jet inclination of $i\leq74°$. In our first observation we also detected a rapidly fading discrete jet knot $66.89\pm0.04$ mas south of the core, with a proper motion of $0.66\pm0.05$ mas hour$^{-1}$, which we interpret as the result of a downstream internal shock or a jet-ISM interaction, as opposed to a transient relativistic jet launched at the beginning of the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the space observatory architecture and mission design of the SALTUS mission, a NASA Astrophysics Probe Explorer concept. SALTUS will address key far-infrared science using a 14-m diameter <45 K primary reflector (M1) and will provide unprecedented levels of spectral sensitivity for planet, solar system, and galactic evolution studies, and cosmic origins. Drawing from Northrop Grumman's extensive NASA mission heritage, the observatory flight system is based on the LEOStar-3 spacecraft platform to carry the SALTUS Payload. The Payload is comprised of the inflation control system (ICS), Sunshield Module (SM), Cold Corrector Module (CCM), Warm Instrument Electronics Module, and Primary Reflector Module (PRM). The 14-m M1 is an off-axis inflatable membrane radiatively cooled by a two-layer sunshield (~1,000 m2 per layer). The CCM corrects for residual aberration from M1 and delivers a focused beam to two instruments - High Resolution Receiver (HiRX) and SAFARI-Lite. The CCM and PRM reside atop a truss-based composite deck which also provides a platform for the attitude control system. The 5-year mission lifetime is driven by a two-consumable architecture: the propellant system and the ICS. The Core Interface Module (CIM), a multi-faceted composite truss structure, provides a load path with high stiffness, mechanical attachment, and thermal separation between the Payload and spacecraft. The SM attaches outside the CIM with its aft end integrating directly to the bus. The spacecraft maintains an attitude off M1's boresight with respect to the Sun line to facilitate the <45 K thermal environment. SALTUS will reside in a Sun-Earth halo L2 orbit with a maximum Earth slant range of 1.8 million km thereby reducing orbit transfer delta-v. The instantaneous field of regard provides two continuous 20-deg viewing zones around the ecliptic poles resulting in full sky coverage in six months.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems in mean motion resonances hold a special place among the planetary population. They allow us to study planet formation in great detail as dissipative processes are thought to have played an important role in their existence. Additionally, planetary masses in bright resonant systems may be independently measured both by radial velocities (RVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs). In principle, they also allow us to quickly determine the inclination of all planets in the system, as for the system to be stable, they are likely all in coplanar orbits. To describe the full dynamical state of the system, we also need the stellar obliquity that provides the orbital alignment of a planet with respect to the spin of their host star and can be measured thanks to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It was recently discovered that HD 110067 harbours a system of six sub-Neptunes in resonant chain orbits. We here analyze an ESPRESSO high-resolution spectroscopic time series of HD 110067 during the transit of planet c. We find the orbit of HD 110067 c to be well aligned with sky projected obliquity $\lambda =6^{+24}_{-26}$ deg. This result is indicative that the current architecture of the system has been reached through convergent migration without any major disruptive events. Finally, we report transit-timing variation in this system as we find a significant offset of 19 $\pm$ 4 minutes in the center of the transit compared to the published ephemeris.

 - **Abstract**
 H$\alpha$ emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of {CBe} stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying H$\alpha$ emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptative Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC330 using multi-band BVRI+H$\alpha$ imaging. We identified H$\alpha$ emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations ($V\lesssim22$), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral sub-classes. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower-mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated towards the cluster center (showing a dispersion of $\sigma=4.26\pm0.20$ pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii ($\sigma=10.83\pm0.65$ pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC330. The total fraction of emitters is $4.4\pm0.5\%$, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters is observed among higher-mass stars ($32.8\pm3.4\%$) than within lower-mass ($4.4\pm0.9\%$). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC330.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet discoveries have revealed a dramatic diversity of planet sizes across a vast array of orbital architectures. Sub-Neptunes are of particular interest; due to their absence in our own solar system, we rely on demographics of exoplanets to better understand their bulk composition and formation scenarios. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of TOI-1437 b, a sub-Neptune with a 18.84 day orbit around a near-Solar analog (Mstar = 1.10 +/- 0.10 Msun, Rstar = 1.17 +/- 0.12 Rsun). The planet was detected using photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and radial velocity follow-up observations were carried out as a part of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS) using both the HIRES instrument at Keck Observatory and the Levy Spectrograph on the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope. A combined analysis of these data reveal a planet radius of Rp = 2.24 +/- 0.23 Rearth and a mass measurement of Mp = 9.6 +/- 3.9 Mearth). TOI-1437 b is one of few (~50) known transiting sub-Neptunes orbiting a solar-mass star that has a radial velocity mass measurement. As the formation pathway of these worlds remains an unanswered question, the precise mass characterization of TOI-1437 b may provide further insight into this class of planet.

 - **Abstract**
 With great advance of ground-based extensive air shower array, such as LHAASO and HAWC, many very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources have been discovered and are been monitored regardless of the day and the night. Hence, the Sun and Moon would have some compact on the observation of gamma-ray sources, which have not been taken into account in previous analysis. In this paper, the influence of the Sun and Moon on the observation of very high energy gamma-ray sources when they are near the line of sight of the Sun or Moon is estimated. The tracks of all the known VHE sources are scanned and several VHE sources are found to be very close to the line of sight of the Sun or Moon during some period. The absorption of very high energy gamma-ray by sunlight is estimated with detailed method and some usefully conclusions are achieved. The main influence is the block of the Sun and Moon on gamma-ray and their shadow on the cosmic ray background. The influence is investigated considering the detector angular resolution and some strategy on data analysis are proposed to avoid the underestimation of the gamma-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The sound horizon is a key theoretical prediction of the cosmological model that depends on the speed of sound and the rate of expansion in the early universe, before matter and radiation decoupled. The standard ruler for low redshift calibration of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) is a direct measurement that would exist even if the standard cosmological model and the standard assumptions of early physics did not. We propose a new model-independent method to calibrate sound horizon $r^h_s$ (relative standard ruler) by using the latest observations of SNe Ia and transversal BAO measurements. The final result reports $r_s^{h}=107.10^{+1.36}_{-1.32}$ $Mpc/h$ in the framework of the Pantheon dataset. This result changes to $r_s^{h}=105.63^{+1.33}_{-1.31}$ $Mpc/h$ when uses Pantheon+ dataset. Note that even without an estimate of dimensionless Hubble constant $h$, the combination of BAO and SNe Ia datasets already constrain the low-redshift standard ruler scale $r_s^{h}$ at the $\sim1.26\%$ level. More importantly, it is interesting to find that most of the $r_s^{h}$ obtained at high redshifts have a larger value (9 out of 15 results are larger than the result obtained by combining all BAOs). This finding may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the data sets or Hubble tension or reveal new physics beyond the standard model.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presented the first light curve analysis of the OP Boo and V0511 Cam binary stars, which was conducted in the frame of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. Photometric ground-based observations were conducted with standard filters at two observatories in the Czech Republic. We computed a new ephemeris for each of the systems using our extracted times of minima, TESS data, and additional literature. Linear fits for O-C diagrams of both systems were considered using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The light curves were analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary code combined with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The light curve solutions of both target systems required a cold starspot. The absolute parameters of the systems were calculated by using a P-M parameter relationship. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR), P-L, logMtot-logJ0, and T-M diagrams. The second component in both systems is determined to be a more massive and hotter star. Therefore, it can be concluded that both systems are W-type contact binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Galactic bulge features a multi-peak shape, with a metal-poor peak at [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex and a metal-rich peak at [Fe/H]=+0.3 dex. This bimodality is also seen in [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, indicating different stellar populations in the bulge. We aim to replicate the observed MDF by proposing a scenario where the metal-poor bulge stars formed in situ during an intense star formation burst, while the metal-rich stars formed during a second burst and/or were accreted from the inner Galactic disk due to a growing bar. We used a chemical evolution model that tracks various chemical species with detailed nucleosynthesis, focusing on Fe production from both Type Ia supernovae and massive stars, including rotating massive stars with varying velocities. Our model also accounts for gas infall, outflow, and the effect of stellar migration. Results are compared to 13,000 stars from the SDSS/APOGEE survey within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. Our model successfully reproduces the double-peak shape of the bulge MDF and the alpha-element abundance trends relative to Fe by assuming (i) a multi-burst star formation history with a 250 Myr quenching of the first burst and (ii) stellar migration from the inner disk due to a growing bar. We estimate that about 40% of the bulge-bar's stellar mass originates from the inner disk. Nucleosynthesis models that assume either no rotation for massive stars or a rotational velocity distribution favoring slow rotation at high metallicities best match the observed MDF and [alpha/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 V892 Tau is a young binary star surrounded by a circumbinary disc which show hints of interaction with the low-mass nearby star V892 Tau NE. The goal of this paper is to constrain the orbit of V892 Tau NE and to determine the resulting circumbinary disc dynamics. We present new ALMA observations of the V892 Tau circumbinary disc at a twice higher angular and spectral resolution. We model the data with V892 Tau as a triple system and perform a grid of hydrodynamical simulations testing several orbits of the companion. The simulation outputs are then post-processed to build synthetic maps that we compare to the observations. The 12CO emission of the disc shows clear non-Keplerian features such as spiral arms. When comparing the data with our synthetic observations, we interpret these features as ongoing interactions with the companion. Our simulations indicate that an eccentricity of 0.5 of the companion is needed to reproduce the observed disc extent and that a mutual inclination of approximately 60° with the inner binary reproduces the measured disc tilt. In order to explain most of the features of the circumbinary disc, we propose that V892 Tau NE follows a misaligned eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity between 0.2 and 0.5 and a mutual inclination between 30° and 60°. Such a misaligned companion suggests the disc is oscillating and precessing with time, stabilising in an intermediate plane with a non-zero mutual inclination with the inner binary. Given that orbital configuration, we show that the stability of future planets is compromised in the second half of the disc once the gas has dissipated.

 - **Abstract**
 We report high-frequency pulsations in WR135 from short cadence optical photometric and spectroscopic time series surveys. The harmonics up to $6^{th}$ order are detected from the integrated photometric flux variation while the comparatively weaker $8^{th}$ harmonic is detected from the varying strengths of the least blended emission lines. We investigate the atmospheric stratification of the stellar winds of WR135 using a radiative transfer modeling code, CMFGEN, and find the physical conditions that can support the propagation of such pulsations. From our study, we find that the sub-sonic layers of the atmosphere are close to the Eddington limit and are launched by the Fe-opacity. While the outer optically thin super-sonic winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.1-0.01) are driven by the He II and C IV opacities. The stratified winds above the sonic point undergo velocity perturbation that can lead to clumps. We find that the optically thin supersonic winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.1-0.01) contain dense smaller clumps (f=0.2-0.3) that oscillate under the higher-order harmonics of the pulsation. These clumps grow larger (f=0.1), dominate the outer stellar winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.01-0.001), and oscillate under the lower-order harmonics.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic very small dust grains (VSGs) contain 100 to 10,000 atoms, making it a mesoscopic system with specific thermal and optical characteristics due to the finite number of atoms within each grain. This paper focuses on graphite VSGs which contain free electrons. The energy level statistics devised by Kubo (1962, J.Phys.Soc.Jpn., 17, 975-986) were used for the first time to understand the thermal properties of free electrons in graphite VSGs. We showed that the shape irregularity of the grains allows graphite VSGs to absorb or emit photons at sub-millimeter wavelengths or longer; otherwise, the frequency is limited to above a few THz. Additionally, we considered the decrease in Debye temperature due to the surface effect. VSGs have an extremely small volume, resulting in limited thermal energy storage, especially at low temperatures. Since a VSG is able to emit a photon with energy smaller than its internal energy, this determines the maximum frequency of the emitted photon. We developed a Monte-Carlo simulation code to track the thermal history of a dust grain, considering the stochastic heating from the absorption of ambient photons and radiative cooling. This approach was applied to the interstellar environment to compute the spectral energy distributions from the interstellar graphite dust grains. The results showed that graphite VSGs emit not only the mid-infrared excess emission, but also a surplus emission from sub-millimeter to millimeter wavelengths.

 Sub-Neptunes with $2-3R_\oplus$ are intermediate in size between rocky planets and Neptune-sized planets. The orbital properties and bulk compositions of transiting sub-Neptunes provide clues to the formation and evolution of close-in small planets. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up of four sub-Neptunes orbiting M dwarfs (TOI-782, TOI-1448, TOI-2120, and TOI-2406), three of which were newly validated by ground-based follow-up observations and statistical analyses. TOI-782 b, TOI-1448 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b have radii of $R_\mathrm{p} = 2.740^{+0.082}_{-0.079}\,R_\oplus$, $2.769^{+0.073}_{-0.068}\,R_\oplus$, $2.120\pm0.067\,R_\oplus$, and $2.830^{+0.068}_{-0.066}\,R_\oplus$ and orbital periods of $P = 8.02$, $8.11$, $5.80$, and $3.08$\,days, respectively. Doppler monitoring with Subaru/InfraRed Doppler instrument led to 2$\sigma$ upper limits on the masses of $<19.1\ M_\oplus$, $<19.5\ M_\oplus$, $<6.8\ M_\oplus$, and $<15.6\ M_\oplus$ for TOI-782 b, TOI-1448 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b, respectively. The mass-radius relationship of these four sub-Neptunes testifies to the existence of volatile material in their interiors. These four sub-Neptunes, which are located above the so-called ``radius valley'', are likely to retain a significant atmosphere and/or an icy mantle on the core, such as a water world. We find that at least three of the four sub-Neptunes (TOI-782 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b) orbiting M dwarfs older than 1 Gyr, are likely to have eccentricities of $e \sim 0.2-0.3$. The fact that tidal circularization of their orbits is not achieved over 1 Gyr suggests inefficient tidal dissipation in their interiors.

 Context. As a new growing field, exocartography aims to map the surface features of exoplanets that are beyond the resolution of traditional observing techniques. While photometric approaches have been discussed extensively, polarimetry has received less attention despite its promising prospects. Aims. We demonstrate that the limb polarization of an exoplanetary atmosphere offers valuable insights into its cloud cover distribution. Specifically, we determine an upper limit for the polarimetric precision, which is required to extract information about the latitudinal cloud cover of temperate Jovian planets for scenarios of observations with and without host stars. Methods. To compute the scattered stellar radiation of an exoplanetary atmosphere and to study the polarization at various planetary phase angles, we used the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS. Results. When the planetary signal can be measured separately from the stellar radiation, information about the latitudinal cloud cover for polar cap models is accessible at polarimetric sensitivities of $0.1$ %. In contrast, a precision of about $10^{-3}$ ppm is required when the stellar flux is included to gain this information.

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of outflows in protobinary systems presents a challenging yet crucial endeavour, offering valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between protostars and their evolution. In this study, we examine the morphology and dynamics of jets and outflows within the IRAS\,4A protobinary system. This analysis is based on ALMA observations of SiO(5--4), H$_2$CO(3$_{0,3}$--2$_{0,3}$), and HDCO(4$_{1,4}$--3$_{1,3}$) with a spatial resolution of $\sim$150\,au. Leveraging an astrochemical approach involving the use of diverse tracers beyond traditional ones has enabled the identification of novel features and a comprehensive understanding of the broader outflow dynamics. Our analysis reveals the presence of two jets in the redshifted emission, emanating from IRAS\,4A1 and IRAS\,4A2, respectively. Furthermore, we identify four distinct outflows in the region for the first time, with each protostar, 4A1 and 4A2, contributing to two of them. We characterise the morphology and orientation of each outflow, challenging previous suggestions of bends in their trajectories. The outflow cavities of IRAS\,4A1 exhibit extensions of 10$''$ and 13$''$ with position angles (PA) of 0$^{\circ}$ and -12$^{\circ}$, respectively, while those of IRAS\,4A2 are more extended, spanning 18$''$ and 25$''$ with PAs of 29$^{\circ}$ and 26$^{\circ}$. We propose that the misalignment of the cavities is due to a jet precession in each protostar, a notion supported by the observation that the more extended cavities of the same source exhibit lower velocities, indicating they may stem from older ejection events.

 - **Abstract**
 The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the ``standard" model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own Solar System. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows a large variation in ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curves, ranging from Milky Way-like (MW) to significantly steeper curves with no detectable 2175 A bump. This result is based on a sample of only nine sightlines. From HST/STIS and IUE spectra of OB stars, we have measured UV extinction curves along 32 SMC sightlines where eight of these curves were published previously. We find 16 sightlines with steep extinction with no detectable 2175 A bump, four sightlines with MW-like extinction with a detectable 2175 A bump, two sightlines with fairly flat UV extinction and weak/absent 2175 A bumps, and 10 sightlines with unreliable curves due to low SMC dust columns. Our expanded sample shows that the sightlines with and without the 2175 A bump are located throughout the SMC and not limited to specific regions. The average extinction curve of the 16 bumpless sightlines is very similar to the previous average based on four sightlines. We find no correlation between dust column and the strength of the 2175 A bump. We test the hypothesis that the 2175 A bump is due to the same dust grains that are responsible for the mid-infrared carbonaceous (PAH) emission features and find they are correlated, confirming recent work in the MW. Overall, the slope of the UV extinction increases as the amplitudes of the 2175 A bump and far-UV curvature decrease. Finally, the UV slope is correlated with $N(HI)/A(V)$ and the 2175 A bump and nonlinear far-UV rise amplitudes are anti-correlated with $N(HI)/A(V)$.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive new constraints on the $E_G$ statistic as a test of gravity, combining the CMB lensing map estimated from Data Release 6 (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope with SDSS BOSS CMASS and LOWZ galaxy data. We develop an analysis pipeline to measure the cross-correlation between CMB lensing maps and galaxy data, following a blinding policy and testing the approach through null and consistency checks. By testing the equivalence of the spatial and temporal gravitational potentials, the $E_G$ statistic can distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from alternative models of gravity. We find $E_G= 0.31^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ for ACT and CMASS data at 68.28\% confidence level, and $E_G = 0.49^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ for ACT and LOWZ. Systematic errors are estimated to be 3\% and 4\% respectively. Including CMB lensing information from Planck PR4 results in $E_G = 0.34^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ with CMASS and $E_G= 0.43^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ with LOWZ. These are consistent with predictions for the $\Lambda$CDM model that best fits the Planck CMB anisotropy and SDSS BOSS BAO, where $E_G^{\rm GR} (z_{\rm eff} = 0.555) = 0.401\pm 0.005$ for CMB lensing combined with CMASS and $E_G^{\rm GR} (z_{\rm eff} = 0.316) = 0.452\pm0.005$ combined with LOWZ. We also find $E_G$ to be scale independent, with PTE $>5\%$, as predicted by general relativity. The methods developed in this work are also applicable to improved future analyses with upcoming spectroscopic galaxy samples and CMB lensing measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present one high-resolution and a time series of 561 low-resolution follow-up spectroscopic observations of SZ Lyn. It is a high-amplitude Delta Scuti-type pulsating star in a binary system. The photometric observations reveal the existence of radial and non-radial oscillation modes in SZ Lyn. In spectroscopy, the variation of equivalent width of the line profiles reflects the temperature variations. The equivalent widths of the Balmer lines, H-alpha, H-hbeta, and H-gamma were measured over the pulsation cycle of SZ Lyn using time sequence spectra. Hence, the temperature profile of SZ Lyn was derived using the curve of growth analysis. Furthermore, the stellar parameters were determined through the best fit analysis of observed and synthetic high-resolution spectral lines. The best fit determines a model of Teff=6750 K, log(g)=3.5 dex, and vrot=10 km/s for solar abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 The SALTUS Probe mission will provide a powerful far-infrared (far-IR) pointed space observatory to explore our cosmic origins and the possibility of life elsewhere. The observatory employs an innovative deployable 14-m aperture, with a sunshield that will radiatively cool the off-axis primary to <45K. This cooled primary reflector works in tandem with cryogenic coherent and incoherent instruments that span the 34 to 660 micron far-IR range at both high and moderate spectral resolutions.

          Thermally emitting isolated neutron star candidates from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey

 - **Abstract**
 The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) allows for the creation of a complete sample of X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs), which will significantly facilitate the study of their population properties, evolution, and connection to other families of isolated neutron stars (INSs). In this work, we conduct a systematic search for XDINSs on the western Galactic hemisphere and discuss the resulting candidate sample. Consistently with the properties of the known XDINSs, we selected all eRASS sources possessing a soft X-ray spectral distribution and that are unlikely to be associated with optical or infrared sources. Our selection criteria allowed us to recover all known XDINSs and previously proposed candidates. In addition, we put forward 33 new candidate members for dedicated follow-up identification campaigns. We found the resulting candidate sample to be about 30-50% complete, mainly due to source confusion and the stringent cross-matching criteria adopted. The candidates of the sample presented here can be divided into two groups: 13 soft and 20 somewhat hard X-ray emitters. Interestingly, the thermal nature, spatial distribution, lack of known counterparts, and absence of significant flux variability of the candidates in the first group agree well with the properties of other confirmed thermally emitting INSs. For the candidates in the second group, the current observational data do not allow one to discern between rotation-powered or recycled pulsars, cataclysmic variables, or quiescent neutron stars in binary systems or even to rule out an extragalactic nature. On the basis of population synthesis and the estimated source completeness of the search, we expect that between one and three new XDINSs are among the already singled-out list of XDINS candidates - a long-sought increase in the proposed number of members of this elusive class of X-ray emitters.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby associations of stars which are coeval are important benchmark laboratories because they provide robust measurements of stellar ages. The study of such coeval groups makes it possible to better understand star formation by studying the initial mass function, the binary fraction or the circumstellar disks of stars, to determine how the initially dense populations of young stars gradually disperse to form the field population, and to shed light on how the properties of stars, exoplanets and substellar objects evolve with distinct snapshots along their lifetime. The advent of large-scale missions such as Gaia is reshaping our understanding or stellar kinematics in the Solar neighborhood and beyond, and offers the opportunity to detect a large number of loose, coeval stellar associations for the first time, which evaded prior detection because of their low density or the faintness of their members. In parallel, advances in detection and characterization of exoplanets and substellar objects are starting to unveil the detailed properties of extrasolar atmospheres, as well as population-level distributions in fundamental exoplanet properties such as radii, masses, and orbital parameters. Accurate ages are still sparsely available to interpret the evolution of both exoplanets and substellar objects, and both fields are now ripe for detailed age investigations because we are starting to uncover ever-closer low-density associations that previously escaped detection, as well as exoplanets and ever lower-mass members of more distant open clusters and star-forming regions. In this paper, we review some recent advances in the identification and characterization of nearby associations, the methods by which stellar ages are measured, and some of the direct applications of the study of young associations such as the emergent field of isolated planetary-mass objects.

          Revisiting short-plateau SN 2018gj

 - **Abstract**
 We present an alternative model of unusual type-IIP SN 2018gj. Despite the short plateau and early gamma-rays escape seeming to favor low-mass ejecta, our hydrodynamic model requires a large ejected mass (about 23 Msun). The high ejecta velocity, we find from hydrogen lines in early spectra, is among crucial constraints on the hydrodynamic model. We recover the wind density that rules out a notable contribution of the circumstellar interaction to the bolometric luminosity. The early radioactive gamma-rays escape is found to be due to the high velocity of Ni-56, whereas the asymmetry of the H-alpha emission is attributed to the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta. The available sample of type-IIP supernovae studied hydrodynamically in a uniform way indicates that the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta is probably their intrinsic property. Hydrogen lines in the early spectra of SN 2018gi and SN 2020jfo are found to imply a clumpy structure of the outer ejecta. With two already known similar cases of SN 2008in and SN 2012A we speculate that the clumpiness of the outer ejecta is inherent to type-IIP supernovae related to the red supergiant explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that it is possible to observe the Hawking radiation emitted by small black holes assumed to form in catastrophic astrophysical events such as black hole mergers. Gamma ray bursts in the TeV range are unique footprints of these asteroid-mass black hole morsels ejected during the merger. The time delay of the gamma ray bursts from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels allowed by the unaccounted merger mass leads to a Hawking induced radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC.

 - **Abstract**
 CDG-1 is a tight grouping of four likely globular clusters in the Perseus cluster, and a candidate dark galaxy with little or no diffuse light. Here we provide new constraints on the luminosity of any underlying stellar emission, using HST/UVIS F200LP imaging. No diffuse emission is detected, with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of F200LP>28.1 mag/arcsec$^2$ on the 5'' scale of CDG-1. This surface brightness limit corresponds to a 2$\sigma$ lower limit of >0.5 for the fraction of the total luminosity that is in the form of globular clusters. The most likely alternative, although improbable, is that CDG-1 is a chance grouping of four globular clusters in the halo of the Perseus galaxy IC312.

 - **Abstract**
 The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library \texttt{pmwd}, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on \texttt{JAX}. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.

          Impact of inhomogeneous diffusion on secondary cosmic ray and antiproton local spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Recent $\gamma$-ray and neutrino observations seem to favor the consideration of non-uniform diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) throughout the Galaxy. In this study, we investigate the consequences of spatially-dependent inhomogeneous propagation of CRs on the fluxes of secondary CRs and antiprotons detected at Earth. A comparison is made among different scenarios in search of potential features that may guide us toward favoring one over another in the near future. We also examine both the influence of inhomogeneous propagation in the production of secondary CRs from interactions with the gas, and the effects of this scenario on the local fluxes of antiprotons and light antinuclei produced as final products of dark matter annihilation. Our results indicate that the consideration of an inhomogeneous diffusion model could improve the compatibility of the predicted local antiproton flux with that of B, Be and Li, assuming only secondary origin of these particles. In addition, our model predicts a slightly harder local antiproton spectrum, making it more compatible with the high energy measurements of AMS-02. Finally, no significant changes are expected in the predicted local flux of antiprotons and antinuclei produced from dark matter among the different considered propagation scenarios.

          The future of cosmological likelihood-based inference: accelerated high-dimensional parameter estimation and model comparison

 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply not feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Efficient algorithms are being developed to search for strong gravitational lens systems owing to increasing large imaging surveys. Neural networks have been successfully used to discover galaxy-scale lens systems in imaging surveys such as the Kilo Degree Survey, Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Survey and Dark Energy Survey over the last few years. Thus, it has become imperative to understand how some of these networks compare, their strengths and the role of the training datasets as most of the networks make use of supervised learning algorithms. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind systematic comparison and benchmarking of networks from four teams that have analysed the HSC Survey data. Each team has designed their training samples and developed neural networks independently but coordinated apriori in reserving specific datasets strictly for test purposes. The test sample consists of mock lenses, real (candidate) lenses and real non-lenses gathered from various sources to benchmark and characterise the performance of each of the network. While each team's network performed much better on their own constructed test samples compared to those from others, all networks performed comparable on the test sample with real (candidate) lenses and non-lenses. We also investigate the impact of swapping the training samples amongst the teams while retaining the same network architecture. We find that this resulted in improved performance for some networks. These results have direct implications on measures to be taken for lens searches with upcoming imaging surveys such as the Rubin-Legacy Survey of Space and Time, Roman and Euclid.
