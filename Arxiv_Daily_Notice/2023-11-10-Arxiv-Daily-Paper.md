#### Turbulently-Driven Detonation Initiation in Electron-Degenerate Matter  with Helium

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardizable cosmological candles which led to the discovery of the accelerating universe. However, the physics of how white dwarfs (WDs) explode and lead to SNe Ia is still poorly understood. The initiation of the detonation front which rapidly disrupts the WD is a crucial element of the puzzle, and global 3D simulations of SNe Ia cannot resolve the requisite length scales to capture detonation initiation. In this work, we elucidate a theoretical criterion for detonation initiation in the distributed burning regime. We test this criterion against local 3D driven turbulent hydrodynamical simulations within electron-degenerate WD matter consisting initially of pure helium. We demonstrate a novel pathway for detonation, in which strong turbulent dissipation rapidly heats the helium, and forms carbon nuclei sufficient to lead to a detonation through accelerated burning via $\alpha$ captures. Simulations of strongly-driven turbulent conditions lead to detonations at a mean density of $10^6$ g cm$^{-3}$ and mean temperature of $1.4 - 1.8 \times 10^9$ K, but fail to detonate at a lower density of $10^5$ g cm$^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Young exoplanets trace planetary evolution, particularly the atmospheric mass loss that is most dynamic in youth. However, the high activity level of young stars can mask or mimic the spectroscopic signals of atmospheric mass loss. This includes the activity-sensitive He 10830 \AA\ triplet, which is an increasingly important exospheric probe. To characterize the He-10830 triplet at young ages, we present time-series NIR spectra for young transiting planet hosts taken with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. The He-10830 absorption strength is similar across our sample, except at the fastest and slowest rotation, indicating that young chromospheres are dense and populate metastable helium via collisions. Photoionization and recombination by coronal radiation only dominates metastable helium population at the active and inactive extremes. Volatile stellar activity, such as flares and changing surface features, drives variability in the He-10830 triplet. Variability is largest at the youngest ages before decreasing to $\lesssim5-10$ m\AA\ (or 3%) at ages above 300 Myr, with 6 of 8 stars in this age range agreeing with no intrinsic variability. He-10830 triplet variability is smallest and age-independent at the shortest timescales. Intrinsic stellar variability should not preclude detection of young exospheres, except at the youngest ages. We recommend out-of-transit comparison observations taken directly surrounding transit and observation of multiple transits to minimize activity's effect. Regardless, caution is necessary when interpreting transit observations in the context of stellar activity, as many scenarios can lead to enhanced stellar variability even on timescales of an hour.
#### Exoplanet Science From {\it Kepler}

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler spacecraft, whose single instrument was a 0.95 m diameter wide-field telescope, operated in a heliocentric orbit for nearly a decade, returning a wealth of data that have revolutionized exoplanet science. Kepler data have been used to discover thousands of planets, including hundreds of multi-planet systems. Kepler discoveries have greatly expanded the diversity of known exoplanets and planetary system properties. Moreover, Kepler has provided the best estimates of exoplanet occurrence rates as functions of planetary sizes, orbital periods and stellar type, with precise values for planets with $P \lesssim 1$ yr. We provide herein an overview of the mission and its major findings regarding the occurrence rates of planets, the mass-radius relationship for exoplanets and the architectures of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 COSINE-100 is a dark matter direct detection experiment with 106 kg NaI(Tl) target material. 210Pb and daughter isotopes are a dominant background in the WIMP region of interest and detected via beta decay and alpha decay. Analysis of the alpha channel complements the background model as observed in the beta/gamma channel. We present the measurement of the quenching factors and Monte Carlo simulation results of the alpha decay components of the COSINE-100 NaI(Tl) crystals. The data strongly indicate that the alpha decays probabilistically undergo one of two possible quenching factors, but this phenomenon is not understood. The fitted results are consistent with independent measurements and improve the overall understanding of the COSINE-100 backgrounds.
#### Dynamical Masses for the Hyades Binary System vB 120

 - **Abstract**
 We report spectroscopic observations of vB 120 (HD 30712), a 5.7 yr astrometric-spectroscopic binary system in the Hyades cluster. We combine our radial velocities with others from the literature, and with existing speckle interferometry measurements, to derive an improved 3D orbit for the system. We infer component masses of M1 = 1.065 +/- 0.018 MSun and M2 = 1.008 +/- 0.016 MSun, and an orbital parallax of 21.86 +/- 0.15 mas, which we show to be more accurate than the parallax from Gaia DR3. This is the ninth binary or multiple system in the Hyades with dynamical mass determinations, and one of the examples with the highest precision. An analysis of the spectral energy distribution yields the absolute radii of the stars, R1 = 0.968 +/- 0.012 RSun and R2 = 0.878 +/- 0.013 RSun, and effective temperatures of 5656 +/- 56 K and 5489 +/- 60 K for the primary and secondary, respectively. A comparison of these properties with the predictions of current stellar evolution models for the known age and metallicity of the cluster shows only minor differences.
#### Small bodies global gravity inversion via the level-set method
 - **Authors:** Alfonso Caldiero, Sébastien Le Maistre

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05060
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05060
 - **Abstract**
 We propose an approach to infer large-scale heterogeneities within a small celestial body from measurements of its gravitational potential, provided for instance by spacecraft radio-tracking. The non-uniqueness of the gravity inversion is here mitigated by limiting the solutions to piecewise-constant density distributions, thus composed of multiple regions of uniform density (mass anomalies) dispersed in a background medium. The boundary of each anomaly is defined implicitly as the 0-level surface of a scalar field (called the level-set function), so that by modifying this field the shape and location of the anomaly are varied. The gravitational potential associated with a density distribution is here computed via a line-integral polyhedron method, yielding the coefficients of its spherical harmonics expansion. The density distribution is then adjusted via an iterative least-squares approach with Tikhonov regularization, estimating at every iteration corrections to the level-set function, the density contrast of each anomaly, and the background density, in order to minimize the residuals between the predicted gravity coefficients and those measured. Given the non-convexity of the problem and the lack of prior knowledge assumed (save for the shape of the body), the estimation process is repeated for several random initial distributions, and the resulting solutions are clustered based on global properties independent of the input measurements. This provides families of candidate interior models in agreement with the data, and the spread of the local density values across each family is used to assess the uncertainties associated with the estimated distributions.
#### XQz5: A New Ultraluminous z$\sim$5 Quasar Legacy Sample

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05098
 - **Abstract**
 Bright quasar samples at high redshift are useful for investigating active galactic nuclei evolution. In this study, we describe XQz5, a sample of 83 ultraluminous quasars in the redshift range $4.5 < z < 5.3$ with optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, with unprecendented completeness at the bright end of the quasar luminosity function. The sample is observed with the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope, the Very Large Telescope, and the ANU 2.3m Telescope, resulting in a high-quality, moderate-resolution spectral atlas of the brightest known quasars within the redshift range. We use established virial mass relations to derive the black hole masses by measuring the observed Mg\,\textsc{ii}$\lambda$2799\AA\ emission-line and we estimate the bolometric luminosity with bolometric corrections to the UV continuum. Comparisons to literature samples show that XQz5 bridges the redshift gap between other X-shooter quasar samples, XQ-100 and XQR-30, and is a brighter sample than both. Luminosity-matched lower-redshift samples host more massive black holes, which indicate that quasars at high redshift are more active than their counterparts at lower-redshift, in concordance with recent literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) measurements contend with internal noise (instrumental systematics) and external noise (intrinsic stellar variability) on the road to 10 cm/s "exo-Earth" sensitivity. Both of these noise sources are well-probed using "Sun-as-a-star" RVs and cross-instrument comparisons. We built the Solar Calibrator (SoCal), an autonomous system that feeds stable, disc-integrated sunlight to the recently commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. With SoCal, KPF acquires signal-to-noise ~1200, R = ~98,000 optical (445--870 nm) spectra of the Sun in 5~sec exposures at unprecedented cadence for an EPRV facility using KPF's fast readout mode (<16 sec between exposures). Daily autonomous operation is achieved by defining an operations loop using state machine logic. Data affected by clouds are automatically flagged using a reliable quality control metric derived from simultaneous irradiance measurements. Comparing solar data across the growing global network of EPRV spectrographs with solar feeds will allow EPRV teams to disentangle internal and external noise sources and benchmark spectrograph performance. To facilitate this, all SoCal data products are immediately available to the public on the Keck Observatory Archive. We compared SoCal RVs to contemporaneous RVs from NEID, the only other immediately public EPRV solar dataset. We find agreement at the 30-40 cm/s level on timescales of several hours, which is comparable to the combined photon-limited precision. Data from SoCal were also used to assess a detector problem and wavelength calibration inaccuracies associated with KPF during early operations. Long-term SoCal operations will collect upwards of 1,000 solar spectra per six-hour day using KPF's fast readout mode, enabling stellar activity studies at high signal-to-noise on our nearest solar-type star.
#### Discovery of Two Different Full Disk Evolutionary Patterns of M-type T  Tauri Stars with LAMOST DR8

 - **Abstract**
 The full disk, full of gas and dust, determines the upper limit of planet masses, and its lifetime is critical for planet formation, especially for giant planets. In this work, we studied the evolutionary timescales of the full disks of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and their relations to accretion. Combined with Gaia EDR3, 2MASS, and WISE data, 1077 disk-bearing TTS candidates were found in LAMOST DR8, and stellar parameters were obtained. Among them, 783 are newly classified by spectra as classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; 169) or weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Based on EW and FWHM of Ha, 157 TTSs in accretion were identified, with ~ 82% also having full disks. For TTSs with M<0.35 Mo, about 80% seem to already lose their full disks at ~ 0.1 Myr, which may explain their lower mass, while the remaining 20% with full disks evolve at similar rates of non-full disks within 5 Myr, possibly suffice to form giant planets. The fraction of accreting TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs is stable at ~10% and can last $\sim$ 5-10 Myr, suggesting that full disks and accretion evolve with similar rates as non-full disks. For TTSs with M>0.35Mo, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr and some even for 20 Myr, which implies planets are more likely to be formed in their disks than those of M<0.35 Mo, and thus M dwarfs with M>0.35Mo can have more planets. The fraction of full-disk TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs decreases with age following the relation $f\propto t^{-0.35}$, and similar relations existed in the fraction of accreting TTSs and the fraction of full-disk CTTSs, suggesting faster full disks and accretion evolution than non-full disks. For full disk stars, the ratio of accretion of lower-mass stars is systematically lower than that of higher-mass stars, confirming the dependence of accretion on stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution (HR) simulations in cosmology, in particular when including baryons, can take millions of CPU hours. On the other hand, low-resolution (LR) dark matter simulations of the same cosmological volume use minimal computing resources. We develop a denoising diffusion super-resolution emulator for large cosmological simulation volumes. Our approach is based on the image-to-image Palette diffusion model, which we modify to 3 dimensions. Our super-resolution emulator is trained to perform outpainting, and can thus upgrade very large cosmological volumes from LR to HR using an iterative outpainting procedure. As an application, we generate a simulation box with 8 times the volume of the Illustris TNG300 training data, constructed with over 9000 outpainting iterations, and quantify its accuracy using various summary statistics.
#### A new method for instrumental profile reconstruction of high resolution  spectrographs

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the spectrograph's instrumental profile (IP) provides important information needed for wavelength calibration and for the use in scientific analyses. This work develops new methods for IP reconstruction in high resolution spectrographs equipped with Laser Frequency Comb calibration (LFC) systems and assesses the impact that assumptions on IP shape have on achieving accurate spectroscopic measurements. Astronomical LFCs produce $\approx10000$ bright, unresolved emission lines with known wavelengths, making them excellent probes of the IP. New methods based on Gaussian Process regression were developed to extract detailed information on the IP shape from this data. Applying them to HARPS, an extremely stable spectrograph installed on the ESO 3.6m telescope, we reconstructed its IP at 512 locations of the detector, covering 60% of the total detector area. We found that the HARPS IP is asymmetric and that it varies smoothly across the detector. Empirical IP models provide wavelength accuracy better than 10 ms$^{-1}$ (5 ms$^{-1}$) with 92% (64%) probability. In comparison, reaching the same accuracy has a probability of only 29% (8%) when a Gaussian IP shape is assumed. Furthermore, the Gaussian assumption is associated with intra-order and inter-order distortions in the HARPS wavelength scale as large as 60ms$^{-1}$. The spatial distribution of these distortions suggests they may be related to spectrograph optics and therefore may generally appear in cross-dispersed echelle spectrographs when Gaussian IPs are used. Methods presented here can be applied to other instruments equipped with LFCs, such as ESPRESSO, but also ANDES and G-CLEF in the future. The empirical IPs will be crucial for obtaining objective and unbiased measurements of fundamental constants from high resolution spectra, as well as measurements of the redshift drift, isotopic abundances, and other science cases.
#### Nested spheroidal figures of equilibrium -- IV. On heterogeneous  configurations

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05260
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05260
 - **Abstract**
 The theory of Nested Figures of Equilibrium, expanded in Papers I and II, is investigated in the limit where the number of layers of the rotating body is infinite, enabling to reach full heterogeneity. In the asymptotic process, the discrete set of equations becomes a differential equation for the rotation rate. In the special case of rigid rotation (from center to surface), we are led to an Integro-Differential Equation (IDE) linking the ellipticity of isopycnic surfaces to the equatorial mass-density profile. In constrast with most studies, these equations are not restricted to small flattenings, but are valid for fast rotators as well. We use numerical solutions obtained from the SCF-method to validate this approach. At small ellipticities (slow rotation), we fully recover Clairaut's equation. Comparisons with Chandrasekhar's perturbative approach and with Roberts' work based on Virial equations are successful. We derive a criterion to characterize the transition from slow to fast rotators. The treatment of heterogeneous structures containing mass-density jumps is proposed through a modified IDE.
#### Hybrid model of condensate and particle Dark Matter: linear  perturbations in the hydrodynamic limit

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05280
 - **Abstract**
 We analyse perturbations of self-interacting, scalar field dark matter that contains modes both in a coherent condensate state and an incoherent particle-like state. Starting from the coupled equations for the condensate, the particles and their mutual gravitational potential, first derived from first principles in earlier work by the authors, we derive a hydrodynamic limit of two coupled fluids and study their linearized density perturbations in an expanding universe. We find that away from the condensate-only or particle-only limits, and for certain ranges of the parameters, such self-interacting mixtures can significantly enhance the density power spectrum above the standard linear $\Lambda$CDM value at localised wavenumbers, even pushing structure formation into the non-linear regime earlier than expected in $\Lambda$CDM for these scales. We also note that such mixtures can lead to degeneracies between models with different boson masses and self-coupling strengths, in particular between self-coupled models and non-coupled Fuzzy Dark Matter made up of heavier bosons. These findings open up the possibility of a richer phenomenology in scalar field dark matter models and could further inform efforts to place observational limits on their parameters.
#### ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Discovery of  an extremely dense and compact object embedded in the prestellar core  G208.68-19.92-N2

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure of the prestellar core G208.68-19.02-N2 (G208-N2) in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) region has been studied with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dust continuum emission revealed a filamentary structure with a length of $\sim$5000 au and an average H$_2$ volume density of $\sim$6 $\times$ 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. At the tip of this filamentary structure, there is a compact object, which we call a ``nucleus", with a radius of $\sim$150--200 au and a mass of $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$. The nucleus has a central density of $\sim$2 $\times$ 10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ with a radial density profile of $r^{-1.87{\pm}0.11}$. The density scaling of the nucleus is $\sim$3.7 times higher than that of the singular isothermal sphere. This as well as the very low virial parameter of 0.39 suggest that the gravity is dominant over the pressure everywhere in the nucleus. However, there is no sign of CO outflow localized to this nucleus. The filamentary structure is traced by the N$_2$D$^+$ 3--2 emission, but not by the C$^{18}$O 2--1 emission, implying the significant CO depletion due to high density and cold temperature. Toward the nucleus, the N$_2$D$^+$ also shows the signature of depletion. This could imply either the depletion of the parent molecule, N$_2$, or the presence of the embedded very-low luminosity central source that could sublimate the CO in the very small area. The nucleus in G208-N2 is considered to be a prestellar core on the verge of first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation or a candidate for the FHSC.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the cosmology of the Dark Dimension scenario taking into account perturbations in the linear regime. In the context of the Dark Dimension scenario, a natural candidate for dark matter in our universe is the excitations of a tower of massive spin-2 KK gravitons. These dark gravitons are produced in the early universe and decay to lighter KK gravitons during the course of cosmological evolution. The decay causes the average dark matter mass to decrease as the universe evolves. In addition, the kinetic energy liberated in each decay leads to a kick velocity for the dark matter particles leading to a suppression of structure formation. Using current CMB (Planck), BAO and cosmic shear (KiDS-1000) data, we put a bound on the dark matter kick velocity today $v_\mathrm{today} \leq 2.2 \times 10^{-4} c$ at 95\% CL. This leads to rather specific regions of parameter space for the dark dimension scenario. The combination of the experimental bounds from cosmology, astrophysics and table-top experiments lead to the range $l_5\sim 1- 10 \, \mu m$ for the size of the Dark Dimension. The Dark Dimension scenario is found to be remarkably consistent with current observations and provides signatures that are within reach of near-future experiments.
#### JWST measurements of $^{13}$C, $^{18}$O and $^{17}$O in the atmosphere  of super-Jupiter VHS 1256 b

 - **Abstract**
 Isotope ratios have recently been measured in the atmospheres of directly-imaged and transiting exoplanets from ground-based observations. The arrival of JWST allows us to characterise exoplanetary atmospheres in further detail and opens up wavelengths inaccessible from the ground. In this work we constrain the carbon and oxygen isotopes $^{13}$C, $^{18}$O and $^{17}$O from CO in the atmosphere of the directly-imaged companion VHS 1256 b through retrievals of the $\sim$4.1-5.3 $\mu$m NIRSpec G395H/F290LP observations from the early release science programme (ERS 1386). We detect and constrain $^{13}$C$^{16}$O, $^{12}$C$^{18}$O and $^{12}$C$^{17}$O at 32, 16 and 10$\sigma$ confidence respectively, thanks to the very high signal-to-noise observations. We find the ratio of abundances are more precisely constrained than their absolute values, with $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C=62^{+2}_{-2}}$, in between previous measurements for companions ($\sim$30) and isolated brown dwarfs ($\sim$100). The oxygen isotope ratios are $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{18}O =425^{+33}_{-28}}$ and $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{17}O=1010^{+120}_{-100}}$. All of the ratios are lower than the local inter-stellar medium and Solar System, suggesting that abundances of the more minor isotopes are enhanced compared to the primary. This could be driven by isotope fractionation in protoplanetary disks, which can potentially alter the carbon and oxygen ratios through isotope selective photodissociation, gas/ice partitioning and isotopic exchange reactions. In addition to CO, we constrain $^{1}$H$_2$$^{16}$O and $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ (the primary isotopologues of both species), but find only upper limits on $^{12}$C$^1$H$_4$ and $^{14}$N$^{1}$H$_3$. This work highlights the power of JWST to constrain isotopes in exoplanet atmospheres, with great promise in determining formation histories in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrogen 21-cm signal is predicted to be the richest probe of the young Universe including eras known as the cosmic Dark Ages, the Cosmic Dawn when the first star and black hole formed, and the Epoch of Reionization. This signal holds the key to deciphering processes that take place at the early stages of cosmic history. In this opinion piece, we discuss the potential scientific merit of lunar observations of the 21-cm signal and their advantages over more affordable terrestrial efforts. The moon is a prime location for radio cosmology which will enable precision observations of the low-frequency radio sky. The uniqueness of such observations is that they will provide an unparalleled opportunity to test cosmology and the nature of dark matter using the Dark Ages 21-cm signal. No less enticing is the opportunity to obtain a much clearer picture of Cosmic Dawn than what is achievable from the ground, which will allow us to probe properties of the first stars and black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the pulsar B0823+26 have been carried out using the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. At time span of 5.5 years, the amplitudes of the main pulse (MP), postcursor (PC) and interpulse (IP) were evaluated in daily sessions lasting 3.7 minutes. It is shown that the ratio of the average amplitudes of MP in the bright (B) and quiet (Q) modes is 60. For B-mode, the average ratio of MP amplitudes to IP amplitudes is 65, and the ratio of MP amplitudes to PC amplitudes is 28. The number of sessions with a nulling is 4% of the total number of sessions. Structure function (SF) and correlation function analysis of MP, IP and PC amplitude variations of over a long-time interval allowed us to detect typical time scales 37 \pm 5 days and one year. The analysis of time variations shows that the time scale of 37 days is well explained by refraction on inhomogeneities of interstellar plasma, which is distributed mostly quasi-uniformly in the line-of-sight. This scintillation makes the main contribution to the observed variability. Analysis of the structure function showed that there may be a few days variability. This time scale does not have an unambiguous interpretation but is apparently associated with the refraction of radio waves on the interstellar medium. One-year variability time scale has not been previously detected. We associate its appearance with the presence of a scattering layer on a closely located screen at a distance of about 50-100 pc from the Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 After 25 years of the prediction of the possibility of observations, and despite the many hundred of well studied transiting exoplanet systems, we are still waiting for the announcement of the first confirmed exomoon. Following the ``cascade'' structure of the Drake-equation, but applied to the existence of an observable exomoon instead the original scope of extraterrestrial intelligence. The scope of this paper is to reveal the structure of the problem, rather than giving a quantitative solution. We identify three important steps that can lead us to the discovery. The steps are the formation, the orbital dynamics and long-term stability, and the observability of a given exomoon in a given system. This way, the question will be closely related to questions of star formation, planet formation, 5 possible pathways of moon formation; long-term dynamics of evolved planet systems involving stellar and planetary rotation and internal structure; and the proper evaluation of the observed data, taken the correlated noise of stellar and instrumental origin and the sampling function also into account. This way, a successful exomoon observation and the interpretations of the expectable further measurements proves to be among the most complex and most interdisciplinary questions in astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical predictions suggest that very massive stars have the potential to form through multiple collisions and eventually evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within Population III star clusters that are embedded in mini dark matter haloes. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f_{\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code \textsc{petar}. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on the merging of their inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the \textsc{tsunami} code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-3}$. In the model with $f_{\rm b}=0$, the evolution of these merging inner BBHs is predominantly driven by their gravitational wave radiation at an early time, but their evolutionary dynamics are dominated by the interaction between them and tertiary BHs in the case with $f_{\rm b}=1$. The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Furthermore, the merging inner BBHs tend to have highly eccentric orbits at low frequency range, some of them with low redshift would be detected by LISA/TianQin. In the higher frequency range, the merging inner BBHs across a wider redshift range would be detected by DECIGO/ET/CE/LIGO/KAGRA.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument will enable the polarimetric imaging of debris disks and inner dust belts in the optical and near-infrared wavelengths, in addition to the high-contrast polarimetric imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets. The Coronagraph uses two Wollaston prisms to produce four orthogonally polarized images and is expected to measure the polarization fraction with measurement errors < 3% per spatial resolution element. To simulate the polarization observations through the Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC), we model disk scattering, the coronagraphic point-response function, detector noise, speckles, jitter, and instrumental polarization and calculate the Stokes parameters. To illustrate the potential for discovery and a better understanding of known systems with both the HLC and SPC modes, we model the debris disks around Epsilon Eridani and HR 4796A, respectively. For Epsilon Eridani, using astrosilicates with 0.37+/-0.01 as the peak input polarization fraction in one resolution element, we recover the peak disk polarization fraction of 0.33+/-0.01. Similarly, for HR 4796A, for a peak input polarization fraction of 0.92+/-0.01, we obtain the peak output polarization fraction as 0.80+/-0.03. The Coronagraph design meets the required precision, and forward modeling is needed to accurately estimate the polarization fraction.

 - **Abstract**
 The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW), arising from large amplitude primordial density fluctuations, provide a unique observational test for directly probing the epoch of inflation. In this work, we provide constraints on the SIGW background by taking into account the non-Gaussianity in the primordial density fluctuations, using the third observing run (O3) data of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We find that the non-Gaussianity gives a non-negligible effect on the GW energy density spectrum and starts to affect the analysis of the O3 data when the non-Gaussianity parameter is $F_{\rm NL} > 3.55$. Furthermore, the constraints exhibit asymptotic behavior given by $F_{\rm NL} A_g = \rm{const.}$ at large $F_{\rm NL}$ limit, where $A_g$ denotes the amplitude of the curvature perturbations. In the limit of large $F_{\rm NL}$, we placed a 95% confidence level upper limit $F_{\rm NL} A_g \leq 0.13, 0.09, 0.10$ at fixed scales of $10^{16}, 10^{16.5}, 10^{17}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently Lian et al. (2023), thanks to Gaia-ESO data, studied the chemical evolution of neutron-capture elements in the regime [Fe/H]>-1. We aim here to complement this study down to [Fe/H]=-3, and focus on Ba, Y, Sr, and abundance ratios of [Ba/Y] and [Sr/Y], which give comprehensive views on s-process nucleosynthesis channels. We measured LTE and NLTE abundances of Ba, Y, and Sr in 323 Galactic metal-poor stars using high-resolution optical spectra with high S/N. We used the spectral fitting code TSFitPy, together with 1D model atmospheres using previously determined LTE and NLTE atmospheric parameters. The NLTE effects are on the order of -0.1 to ~0.2dex depending on the element. T he ratio between heavy and light s-process elements [Ba/Y] varies weakly with [Fe/H] even in the metal-poor regime, consistently with the behavior in the metal-rich regime. The [Ba/Y] scatter at a given metallicity is larger than the abundance measurement uncertainties. Homogeneous chemical evolution models with different yields prescriptions are unable to accurately reproduce the [Ba/Y] scatter at low-[Fe/H]. Adopting the stochastic chemical evolution model by Cescutti & Chaippini (2014) allows to reproduce the observed scatter in the abundance pattern of [Ba/Y] and [Ba/Sr]. With our observations, we rule out the need for an arbitrary scaling of the r-process contribution as previously suggested by the model authors. We have showed how important it is to properly include NLTE effects when measuring chemical abundances, especially in the metal-poor regime. This work shows that the choice of the Galactic chemical evolution model (stochastic vs. 1-zone) is key when comparing models to observations. The upcoming surveys such as 4MOST and WEAVE will deliver high quality spectra of many thousands of metal-poor stars, and this work gives a typical case study of what could be achieved with such surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a campaign on the bright black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 centered around five observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). This is the first time it has been possible to trace the evolution of the X-ray polarization of a black hole X-ray binary across a hard to soft state transition. The 2--8 keV polarization degree slowly decreased from $\sim$4\% to $\sim$3\% across the five observations, but remained in the North-South direction throughout. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we measure the intrinsic 7.25 GHz radio polarization to align in the same direction. Assuming the radio polarization aligns with the jet direction (which can be tested in the future with resolved jet images), this implies that the X-ray corona is extended in the disk plane, rather than along the jet axis, for the entire hard intermediate state. This in turn implies that the long ($\gtrsim$10 ms) soft lags that we measure with the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) are dominated by processes other than pure light-crossing delays. Moreover, we find that the evolution of the soft lag amplitude with spectral state differs from the common trend seen for other sources, implying that Swift J1727.8$-$1613 is a member of a hitherto under-sampled sub-population.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we analyze Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data sourced from the Pantheon+ compilation to investigate late-time physics effects influencing the expansion history, $H(z)$, at redshifts $(z < 2)$. Our focus centers on a time-varying dark energy (DE) model that introduces a rapid transition in the equation of state, at a specific redshift, $z_a$, from the baseline, $\Lambda = -1$, value to the present value, $w_0$, through the implementation of a sigmoid function. The constraints obtained for the DE sigmoid phenomenological parametrization have broad applicability for dynamic DE models that invoke late-time physics. Our analysis indicates that the sigmoid model provides a slightly better, though not statistically significant, fit to the SNe Pantheon+ data compared to the standard LCDM alone. The fit results, assuming a flat geometry and maintaining $\Omega_m$ constant at the 2018-Planck value of $0.3153$, are as follows: $H_0 = 73.3^{+0.2}_{-0.6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $w_{0} = -0.95^{+0.15}_{-0.02}$, $z_a = 0.8 \pm 0.46$. The errors represent statistical uncertainties only. The available SN dataset lacks sufficient statistical power to distinguish between the baseline LCDM and the alternative sigmoid models. A feature of interest offered by the sigmoid model is that it identifies a specific redshift, $z_a = 0.8$, where a potential transition in the equation of state could have occurred. The sigmoid model does not favor a DE in the phantom region ($w_0 < -1$). Further constraints to the dynamic DE model have been obtained using CMB data to compute the distance to the last scattering surface. While the sigmoid DE model does not completely resolve the $H_0$ tension, it offers a transition mechanism that can still play a role alongside other potential solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The IAG solar observatory is producing high-fidelity, ultra-high-resolution spectra (R>500000) of the spatially resolved surface of the Sun using a Fourier Transform spectrometer (FTS). The radial velocity (RV) calibration of these spectra is currently performed using absorption lines from Earth's atmosphere, limiting the precision and accuracy. To improve the frequency calibration precision and accuracy we plan to use a Fabry-Perot etalon (FP) setup that is an evolution of the CARMENES FP design and an iodine cell in combination. To create an accurate wavelength solution, the iodine cell is measured in parallel with the FP. The FP can then be used to transfer the accurate wavelength solution provided by the iodine via simultaneous calibration of solar observations. To verify the stability and precision of the FTS we perform parallel measurements of the FP and an iodine cell. The measurements show an intrinsic stability of the FTS of a level of 1 m/s over 90 hours. The difference between the FP RVs and the iodine cell RVs show no significant trends during the same time span. The RMS of the RV difference between FP and iodine cell is 10.7 cm/s, which can be largely attributed to the intrinsic RV precisions of the iodine cell and the FP (10.2 cm/s and 1.0 cm/s, respectively). This shows that we can calibrate the FTS to a level of 10 cm/s, competitive with current state-of-the-art precision RV instruments. Based on these results we argue that the spectrum of iodine can be used as an absolute reference to reach an RV accuracy of 10 cm/s.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A using Very Long Baseline Interferomety (VLBI) with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), over a period spanning from 40 to 262 days after the initial GRB. The high angular resolution (~mas) of our observations allowed us, for the second time ever after GRB 030329, to measure the projected size, $s$, of the relativistic shock caused by the expansion of the GRB ejecta into the surrounding medium. Our observations support the expansion of the shock with a 3.6 $\sigma$-equivalent significance, and confirm its relativistic nature by revealing an apparently superluminal expansion rate. Fitting a power law expansion model, $s\propto t^a$, to the observed size evolution, we find a slope $a=1.9_{-0.6}^{+0.7}$, which is steeper than expected from either a forward shock (FS) or reverse shock (RS) model, implying an apparent acceleration of the expansion. Fitting the data at each frequency separately, we find different expansion rates, pointing to a frequency-dependent behaviour. We show that the observed size evolution can be reconciled with a RS plus FS in the case of a wind-like circum-burst medium, provided that the two shocks dominate the emission at different frequencies and, possibly, at different times.

 - **Abstract**
 An analytical solution of the perturbed equations is obtained, which exists in all ergodic models of collisionless spherical stellar systems with a single length parameter. This solution corresponds to variations of this parameter, i.e., stretching or shrinking the sphere while preserving the total mass. The system remains in an equilibrium state. The simplicity of the solution allows for explicit expressions for the distribution function, potential, and density at all orders of perturbation theory. This, in turn, helps to clarify the concept of perturbation energy, which, being a second-order quantity in amplitude, cannot be calculated in linear theory. It is shown that the correct expression for perturbation energy, constructed taking into account 2nd order perturbations, and the well-known expression for perturbation energy constructed as bilinear form obtained within linear theory from 1st order perturbations do not coincide. However, both of these energies are integrals of motion and differ only by a constant. The obtained solution can be used to control the correctness of codes and the accuracy of calculations in the numerical study of collisionless stellar models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background instrumentation suite being deployed in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The telescopes within SO use three types of dichroic transition-edge sensor (TES) detector arrays, with the 90 and 150 GHz Mid-Frequency (MF) arrays containing 65% of the approximately 68,000 detectors in the first phase of SO. All of the 26 required MF detector arrays have now been fabricated, packaged into detector modules, and tested in laboratory cryostats. Across all modules, we find an average operable detector yield of 84% and median saturation powers of (2.8, 8.0) pW with interquartile ranges of (1, 2) pW at (90, 150) GHz, respectively, falling within their targeted ranges. We measure TES normal resistances and superconducting transition temperatures on each detector wafer to be uniform within 3%, with overall central values of 7.5 mohm and 165 mK, respectively. Results on time constants, optical efficiency, and noise performance are also presented and are consistent with achieving instrument sensitivity forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of a specific class of slow Baryon Number Violation (BNV) -- one that induces quasi-equilibrium evolution -- on pulsar spin characteristics. This work reveals how BNV can potentially alter observable parameters, including spin-down rates, the second derivative of spin frequency, and braking indices of pulsars. Moreover, we demonstrate that BNV could lead to anomalies in pulsar timing, along with a wide array of braking indices, both positive and negative. In addition, we examine the possibility of pulsar spin-up due to BNV, which may result in a novel mechanism for the revival of ``dead'' pulsars. We conclude by assessing the sensitivity required for future pulsar timing efforts to detect such BNV effects, thus highlighting the potential for pulsars to serve as laboratories for testing fundamental physics.

 The study of core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) presents a fascinating puzzle, with intricate morphologies and a non-uniform distribution of stellar debris. Particularly, young remnants (aged less than 5000 years) hold immense value as they can offer crucial insights into the inner processes of the supernova (SN) engine, revealing details about nucleosynthetic yields and large-scale asymmetries arising from the early stages of the explosion. Furthermore, these remnants also bear characteristics that may reflect the nature of their progenitor stars and the interactions between the remnants and the surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM), shaped by the progenitor's mass-loss history. Hence, investigating the connection between young SNRs, parent SNe, and progenitor massive stars can be of paramount importance to delve into the physics of SN engines, and to investigate the final stages of massive star evolution and the elusive mechanisms governing their mass loss. In this contribution, I review recent advances in modeling the path from massive stars to SNe and SNRs achieved by our team. The focus is on investigating the links between the observed physical and chemical properties of SNRs and their progenitor stars and SN explosions. The unraveling of this connection offers us the opportunity to probe the physics of core-collapse SN explosions and the final stages of evolution of massive stars.

 The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) project is a scientific collaboration in observational astrophysics between the Li{\`e}ge Institute of Astrophysics and Geophysics (Li{\`e}ge University, Belgium), the Aryabatta Research Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES, Nainital, India) and several Canadian universities (British Columbia, Laval, Montr{\'e}al, Toronto, Victoria and York). Meanwhile, several other institutes have joined the project: the Royal Observatory of Belgium, the National University of Uzbekistan and the Ulugh Beg Astronomical Institute (Uzbekistan) as well as the Pozna{\'n} Observatory (Poland). The Li{\`e}ge company AMOS (Advanced Mechanical and Optical Systems) has fabricated the telescope structure that has been erected on the ARIES site in Devasthal (Uttarakhand, India). It is the first liquid mirror telescope being dedicated to astronomical observations. First light was obtained on 29 April 2022 and commissioning is being conducted at the present time. In this short article, we describe and illustrate the main components of the ILMT. We also highlight the ILMT papers presented during the third BINA workshop, which discuss various aspects of the ILMT science programs.

 - **Abstract**
 The 4m International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is the first optical survey telescope in India that performs zenithal observations of a 22$'$ wide strip of the sky. To determine the portion of the sky covered by the ILMT during the entire year, we represent the ILMT Field of View (FoV) in three different coordinate systems - galactic, ecliptic, and equatorial. We adopt a constant declination of $+29^{\circ}21'41.4"$ and varying right ascension (RA) ranges corresponding to the Local Sidereal Time (LST). The observations from June to September are hampered due to the monsoon season. The handiness of such representations will allow us to locate a transient event in the ILMT FoV. This will enable prompt follow-up observations with other facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Nestled in the mountains of Northern India, is a 4-metre rotating dish of liquid mercury. Over a 10-year period, the International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) will survey 117 square degrees of sky, to study the astrometric and photometric variability of all detected objects. One of the scientific programs will be a survey of variable stars. The data gathered will be used to construct a comprehensive catalog of light curves. This will be an essential resource for astronomers studying the formation and evolution of stars, the structure and dynamics of our Milky Way galaxy, and the properties of the Universe as a whole. This catalog will be an aid in our advance to understanding the cosmos and provide deeper insights into the fundamental processes that shape our Universe. In this work, we describe the survey and give some examples of variable stars found in the early commissioning data from the ILMT.

 Recent research suggests a correlation between the variability and intrinsic brightness of quasars. If calibrated, this could lead to the use of quasars on the cosmic distance ladder, but this work is currently limited by lack of quasar light curve data with high cadence and precision. The Python photometric data pipeline SunPhot is being developed as part of preparations for an upcoming quasar variability survey with the International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT). SunPhot uses aperture photometry to directly extract light curves for a catalogue of sources from calibrated ILMT images. SunPhot v.2.1 is operational, but the project is awaiting completion of ILMT commissioning.

 - **Abstract**
 The present article is based upon an invited talk delivered at the occasion of the inauguration of the 4m International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) which took place in Devasthal (ARIES, Uttarakhand, India) on 21st of March 2023. We present hereafter a short history of the liquid mirror telescopes and in particular of the 4m ILMT which is the first liquid mirror telescope entirely dedicated to astrophysical observations. We discuss a few preliminary scientific results and illustrate some direct CCD images taken during the first commissioning phase of the telescope. We invite the reader to refer to the series of ILMT poster papers published in these same proceedings of the BINA3 workshop for more details about the instrument, operation, first observations, performance and scientific results.
