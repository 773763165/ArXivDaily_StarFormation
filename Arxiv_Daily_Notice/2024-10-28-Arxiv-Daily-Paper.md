#### Title:
          Identification of Z Cam's Historical Counterpart: The Quest for an Ancient Nova

 - **Abstract**
 In recent astronomical discussions, attempts have been made to link the known dwarf nova Z Cam to historical celestial events, particularly the "guest star" phenomenon reported in China in 77 BCE. Despite other suggestions and the problems with regard to the location of the event in 77 BCE, its identification with Z Cam is used in the Variable Star IndeX (VSX) of the AAVSO and in several research papers that aim to derive knowledge on the evolution of cataclysmic variables. Through the reconstruction of the super-constellation of the Purple Palace in the Han Dynasty, we found that Z Cam is actually located outside this enclosure, contradicting the records of the 77 BCE guest star being "within the Purple Palace". With newly found text versions of the guest star in 77 BCE, we narrowed down the position given therein. Combined with a new analysis of accompanying divination text leads to the conclusion that this guest star was actually a comet. Finally, through meticulous examination and comparison, we conclude that the guest star of 369 CE appears the most plausible candidate for Z Cam's historical counterpart, aligning with both textual evidence and modern astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 With the new discoveries enabled thanks to the recent space missions, stellar physics is going through a revolution. However, these discoveries opened the door to many new questions that require more observations. The European Space Agency's Human and Robotic Exploration programme provides an excellent opportunity to push forward the limits of our knowledge and better understand stellar structure and dynamics evolution. Long-term observations, Ultra-Violet observations, and a stellar imager are a few highlights of proposed missions for late-type stars that will enhance the already planned space missions.

          Hidden in Plain Sight: Searching for Dark Companions to Bright Stars with the Large Binocular Telescope and SHARK-VIS

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results from a pilot study to search for black holes and other dark companions in binary systems using direct imaging with SHARK-VIS and the iLocater pathfinder "Lili" on the Large Binocular Telescope. Starting from known single-lined spectroscopic binaries, we select systems with high mass functions that could host dark companions and whose spectroscopic orbits indicate a projected orbital separation $\geq 30$ mas. For this first exploration, we selected four systems (HD 137909, HD 104438, HD 117044, and HD 176695). In each case, we identify a luminous companion and measure the flux ratio and angular separation. However, two of the systems (HD 104438 and HD 176695) are not consistent with simple binary systems and are most likely hierarchical triples. The observed companions rule out a massive compact object for HD 137909, HD 117044, and HD 176695. HD 104438 requires further study because the identified star cannot be responsible for the RV orbit and is likely a dwarf tertiary companion. The SHARK-VIS observation was taken near pericenter, and a second image near apocenter is needed to discriminate between a closely separated luminous secondary and a compact object. We show how the combination of RVs and direct imaging can be used to constrain the orbital inclination and companion mass, and discuss the potential of high resolution direct imaging surveys to identify and confirm non-interacting compact object candidates.

          Earth-like exoplanets in spin-orbit resonances: climate dynamics, 3D atmospheric chemistry, and observational signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial exoplanets around M- and K-type stars are important targets for atmospheric characterisation. Such planets are likely tidally locked with the order of spin-orbit resonances (SORs) depending on eccentricity. We explore the impact of SORs on 3D atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, employing a 3D coupled Climate-Chemistry Model to simulate Proxima Centauri b in 1:1 and 3:2 SOR. For a 1:1 SOR, Proxima Centauri b is in the Rhines rotator circulation regime with dominant zonal gradients (global mean surface temperature 229 K). An eccentric 3:2 SOR warms Proxima Centauri b to 262 K with gradients in the meridional direction. We show how a complex interplay between stellar radiation, orbit, atmospheric circulation, and (photo)chemistry determines the 3D ozone distribution. Spatial variations in ozone column densities align with the temperature distribution and are driven by stratospheric circulation mechanisms. Proxima Centauri b in a 3:2 SOR demonstrates additional atmospheric variability, including daytime-nighttime cycles in water vapour of ${+}$55% to ${-}$34% and ozone ($\pm5.2$%) column densities and periastron-apoastron water vapour cycles of ${+}$17% to ${-}$10%. Synthetic emission spectra for the spectral range of the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets fluctuate by up to 36 ppm with orbital phase angle for a 1:1 SOR due to 3D spatial and temporal asymmetries. The homogeneous atmosphere for the 3:2 SOR results in relatively constant emission spectra and provides an observational discriminant from the 1:1 SOR. Our work emphasizes the importance of understanding the 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres and associated spectral variations to determine habitability and interpret atmospheric spectra.

          Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. We argue that this crust failure is asymmetric and produces a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). A rotating star, with this ellipticity, radiates gravitational waves that limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Nascent binaries (NBs) are binary systems with very low mass ratios, less than ~0.2, in which the more massive component is an O- or B-type main-sequence star, while the secondary is a star contracting onto the main sequence. NBs are of interest because they can help to understand the formation of small-mass ratio systems and shed light on the origin of low-mass X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars and type Ia supernovae. In photometry, short-period NBs show a strong irradiation effect due to the large difference between the effective temperatures of the components and the strong irradiation of a cool secondary by a hot primary. In spectroscopy, they usually appear as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. In the present paper, we summarize the status of our knowledge of Galactic nascent binaries and characterize two new members of this group, c2 Sco and V390 Pup, for which photometric data were obtained by the BRIght Target Explorer (BRITE) nano-satellite mission.

          Profiling Near-Surface Winds on Mars Using Attitude Data from Mars 2020 Ingenuity

 - **Abstract**
 We used attitude data from the Mars Ingenuity helicopter with a simple steady-state model to estimate windspeeds and directions at altitudes of 3 meters up to 24 meters, the first time winds at such altitudes have been probed on Mars. We compared our estimates to concurrent wind data at 1.5 m height from the meteorology package MEDA onboard the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and to predictions from meteorological models. Wind directions inferred from the Ingenuity data agreed to within uncertainties with the directions measured by MEDA, when the latter were available, but deviated from model-predicted directions by as much as 180 deg in some cases. Also, the inferred windspeeds are often much higher than expected. For example, meteorological predictions tailored to the time and location of Ingenuity's 59th flight suggest Ingenuity should not have seen windspeeds above about 15 m/s, but we inferred speeds reaching nearly 25 m/s. By contrast, the 61st flight was at a similar time and season and showed weaker winds then the 59th flight, suggesting winds shaped by transient phenomena. For flights during which we have MEDA data to compare to, inferred windspeeds imply friction velocities exceeding 1 m/s and roughness lengths of more than 10 cm based on a boundary layer model that incorporates convective instability, which seem implausibly large. These results suggest Ingenuity was probing winds sensitive to aerodynamic conditions hundreds of meters upwind instead of the conditions very near Mars 2020, but they may also reflect a need for updated boundary layer wind models. An improved model for Ingenuity's aerodynamic response that includes the effects of transient winds may also modify our results. In any case, the work here provides a foundation for exploration of planetary boundary layers using drones and suggests important future avenues for research and development.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA experiments now regularly witness gravitational waves from compact binary mergers: the relativistic collisions of neutron stars and/or stellar-mass black holes. With hundreds of such events observed to date, gravitational-wave observations are enabling increasingly precise surveys of the demographics of merging compact binaries, including the distributions of their masses, rotation rates, and positions throughout the Universe. This article will provide an overview of our observational knowledge of the compact binary population, as it stands today. I will discuss, in turn, observations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers, describing what is currently known (or not yet known) about these different gravitational-wave sources. I will highlight emerging classes of binaries that do not fall cleanly into any of these existing categories. And I will conclude by reviewing the methodology by which population analyses of gravitational-wave sources are performed.

          A cosmological case study of a tower of warm dark matter states: $N$naturalness

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the cosmological effects of a tower of warm dark matter states on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and on large-scale structure (LSS). For concreteness, we consider the $N$naturalness model, which is a proposed mechanism to solve the Higgs hierarchy problem. In this framework, the sector of particles of the Standard Model is copied $N$ times where the Higgs mass-squared value is the only parameter that changes between sectors. The other sectors are similar to our own, except their particles are proportionally heavier and cooler compared to the Standard Model sector. Since each sector is extremely weakly coupled to other sectors, direct observations of the new particles are not expected. The addition of new photon-like species and new neutrino-like species, however, can be detected through the CMB and in LSS data. These additional neutrinos form a tower of states with increasing mass and decreasing temperature compared to the SM neutrinos. This tower causes a more gradual suppression of the matter power spectrum across different comoving wavenumbers than a single warm dark matter state would. We quantitatively explore these effects in the $N$naturalness model and compute the parameter space allowed by the Planck 2018, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ datasets. Depending on the underlying parameters, Planck 2018 and weak lensing data can require $N$naturalness to be tuned at the $10\%$ level for Dirac neutrinos and at the $5\%$ level for Majorana neutrinos. The additional neutrino states are crucial in constraining the model, particularly through their suppression of the power spectrum at small scales. The inclusion of many warm dark matter species is computationally very challenging and we make detailed assessments of our approximations and comment on potential future improvements.

          Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b's Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and leave clear spectral imprints in exoplanet spectra. Pre-JWST, exoplanet retrieval frameworks mostly adopted simple parametric approximations. With JWST, we now have access to mid-infrared wavelengths where aerosols have detectable composition-specific resonance features. Here, we implement new features into the open-source atmospheric retrieval code POSEIDON to account for the complex scattering, reflection, and absorption properties of Mie scattering aerosols. We provide an open-source database of these Mie scattering cross sections and optical properties. We also extend the radiative transfer and retrieval functionality in POSEIDON to include multiple scattering reflection and emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate these new retrieval capabilities on archival Hubble and Spitzer transmission and secondary eclipse spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We find that a high-altitude, low-density, thin slab composed of sub-micron particles is necessary to fit HD 189733 b's transmission spectrum, with multiple aerosol species providing a good fit. We additionally retrieve a sub-solar H$_2$O abundance, a sub-solar K abundance, and do not detect CO$_2$. Our joint thermal and reflection retrievals of HD 189733 b's secondary eclipse spectrum, however, finds no evidence of dayside aerosols, a sub-solar dayside H$_2$O abundance, enhanced CO$_2$, and slighty sub-solar alkali abundances. We additionally explore how retrieval model choices, such as cloud parameterization, aerosol species and properties, and thermal structure parameterization affect retrieved atmospheric properties. Upcoming JWST data for hot Jupiters like HD 189733 b will be well suited to enable deeper exploration of aerosol properties, allowing the formulation of a self-consistent, multi-dimensional picture of cloud formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an overview of the isotopic signatures of presolar supernova grains, specifically focusing on 44Ti-containing grains with robustly inferred supernova origins and their implications for nucleosynthesis and mixing mechanisms in supernovae. Recent technique advancements have enabled the differentiation between radiogenic (from 44Ti decay) and nonradiogenic 44Ca excesses in presolar grains, made possible by enhanced spatial resolution of Ca-Ti isotope analyses with the Cameca NanoSIMS (Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument. Within the context of presolar supernova grain data, we discuss (i) the production of 44Ti in supernovae and the impact of interstellar medium heterogeneities on the galactic chemical evolution of 44Ca/40Ca, (ii) the nucleosynthesis processes of neutron bursts and explosive H-burning in Type II supernovae, and (iii) challenges in identifying the progenitor supernovae for 54Cr-rich presolar nanospinel grains. Drawing on constraints and insights derived from presolar supernova grain data, we also provide an overview of our current understanding of the roles played by various supernova types - including Type II, Type Ia, and electron capture supernovae - in accounting for the diverse array of nucleosynthetic isotopic variations identified in bulk meteorites and meteoritic components. We briefly overview the potential mechanisms that have been proposed to explain these nucleosynthetic variations by describing the transport and distribution of presolar dust carriers in the protoplanetary disk. We highlight existing controversies in the interpretation of presolar grain data and meteoritic nucleosynthetic isotopic variations, while also outlining potential directions for future research.

          An independent hybrid imaging of Sgr A* from the data in EHT 2017 observations

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the ring structure found by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) as the black hole shadow of Sgr A*is an artifact by the bumpy PSF (Point Spread Function) of the EHT2017. The imaging using sparse u-v data requires detailed scrutiny of the PSF. The estimated shadow diameter (48.7 +- 7 muas) is equal to the spacing between the main beam and the first sidelobe of the PSF (49.09 muas), which immediately suggests a potential problem in the deconvolution of the PSF. We show that the ring image can be derived from non-ring simulated datasets (noise only; point source) with a narrow Field-of-View (FOV) and an assumed self-calibration suggesting the EHT2017's u-v coverage is insufficient for reliable imaging. The EHTC analysis, based on calibrations with assumptions about the source's size and properties, selected the final image by prioritizing appearance rate of the similar structure from a large imaging parameter space over data consistency. Our independent analysis with the conventional hybrid mapping reveals an elongated east-west structure, consistent with previous observations. We believe it to be more reliable than the EHTC image, due to half the residuals in normalized visibility amplitude. The eastern half is brighter, possibly due to a Doppler boost from the rapid rotating disk. We hypothesize our image shows a portion of the accretion disk about 2 to a few Rs away from the black hole, rotating with nearly 60 % of the speed of light viewed from an angle of 40 -45 degrees.

          Self-Shielding Enhanced Organics Synthesis in an Early Reduced Earth's Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Earth is expected to have acquired a reduced proto-atmosphere enriched in H2 and CH4 through the accretion of building blocks that contain metallic Fe and/or the gravitational trapping of surrounding nebula gas. Such an early, wet, reduced atmosphere that covers a proto-ocean would then ultimately evolve toward oxidized chemical compositions through photochemical processes that involve reactions with H2O-derived oxidant radicals and the selective escape of hydrogen to space. During this time, atmospheric CH4 could be photochemically reprocessed to generate not only C-bearing oxides but also organics. However, the branching ratio between organic matter formation and oxidation remains unknown despite its significance on the abiotic chemical evolution of early Earth. Here, we show via numerical analyses that UV absorptions by gaseous hydrocarbons such as C2H2 and C3H4 significantly suppress H2O photolysis subsequent CH4 oxidation during the photochemical evolution of a wet proto-atmosphere enriched in H2 and CH4. As a result, nearly half of the initial CH4 converted to heavier organics along with the deposition of prebiotically essential molecules such as HCN and H2CO on the surface of a primordial ocean for a geological timescale order of 10-100 Myr. Our results suggest that the accumulation of organics and prebiotically important molecules in the proto-ocean could produce a soup enriched in various organics, which might have eventually led to the emergence of living organisms.

          Assessing the Association between the Globular Cluster NGC 4147 and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The potential association of the globular cluster (GC) NGC 4147 with the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been proposed due to their comparable locations and radial velocities. However, there are still debates about this connection. In this study, we use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys to assess their association. We redetermine thefundamental parameters of NGC 4147 and find that the cluster is 11.0 Gyr old, has a metallicity of Z=0.0006, and is located 18.5 kpc from the Sun. We utilize the matched filter algorithm to identify extratidal structures in the surrounding sky of NGC 4147. The multiarmed tidal structures we find align more closely with the result of internal two-body relaxation processes within the cluster itself. The orientations of the dispersed tidal structures, the orbital direction of the cluster, and the mean orbital direction of Sgr do not show any apparent connection to each other. It seems to challenge the hypothesis of a common origin between the cluster and Sgr. To further investigate the association, we study the kinematics of NGC 4147 with the newly determined fundamental parameters. We find that the orbit, orbital energy, and angular momentum of NGC 4147 are not compatible with those of Sgr or its streams. This suggests that the cluster is not dynamically associated with Sgr. The morphology and dynamics of NGC 4147 are more consistent with it being a GC that formed with other origin rather than being accreted from the Sgr dwarf galaxy.

          Cold day-side winds shape large leading streams in evaporating exoplanet atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of planetary atmospheres in HAT-P-32 b and HAT-P-67 b reveal extensive outflows reaching up to hundreds of planetary radii. The helium 1083 nm light curves for these planets, captured across their full orbits, show notable asymmetries: both planets display more pronounced pre-transit than post-transit absorptions, with HAT-P-67 b being the more extreme case of that geometry. Using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, we identify key factors influencing the formation of a dense leading outflow stream and characterize its morphology. Our models suggest that such a geometry of escaped material is caused by a relatively cold outflow of high mass-loss rate, launched preferentially from the planet's day side. From the simulations we calculate synthetic He I 1083 nm spectra that show large absorption depths and irregular line profiles due to complex gas kinematics. We find that the measurements of the He I 1083 nm equivalent width and the velocity shift relative to the planet's rest frame, observed over a significant portion of the planet's orbital phase, can provide important constraints on the outflow properties and its interaction with the stellar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminal propagation is an intrinsic problem in the diffusion equation and has not been effectively addressed for a long time. In this work, a rigorous solution to this issue is obtained under the assumption that particles undergo a random flight process, where they move isotropically at a constant speed while experiencing random scatterings. We validate this solution by comparing it with comprehensive simulations of the random flight process and find that it significantly deviates from the solution derived from the Jüttner propagator. This solution is broadly applicable to various diffusion phenomena, such as cosmic-ray propagation. We emphasize that our rigorous solution is particularly crucial in scenarios involving burst-like particle injection, where previous phenomenological approaches to the superluminal diffusion problem may not yield accurate results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension refers to the significant discrepancy in the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ obtained from two different measurement methods in cosmology. One method derives data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, yielding a value of $67.4\pm{0.5} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}} \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}} $, while the other method relies on direct measurements of Type Ia supernovae, producing a value $73.04\pm{1.04} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}} \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}} $. This issue has persisted for several years. To theoretically explore potential solutions to this problem, this paper examines a model within the framework of Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory, where torsion is introduced with spin as the corresponding entity, allowing for the assumption $H = -\alpha \phi$. By employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) data, we impose parameter constraints on various parameters in the Friedmann equations, particularly focusing on the curvature density parameter $\Omega_k$, to assess whether the model remains stable under this assumption and whether the estimated parameters align more closely with either of the observational results. In conclusion, we find that the parameter constraints in the model incorporating torsion ($ H_0 = 67.6^{+2.1}_{-2.7} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, obtained under the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint with $\Omega_{k}=0$; $ H_0 = 66.2^{+4.4}_{-2.9} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, obtained under same constraint but set $\Omega_{k}$ as a free variable; $ H_0 = 68.8^{+2.9}_{-4.2} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, obtained under the Planck constraint) are more consistent with the value derived from CMB data, favoring the lower $H_0$ value.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole binaries are one of the important sources for the TianQin project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio squared during the inspiral phase of massive black hole binaries exhibits a direct proportionality to the ratio of the observation duration to the time remaining until coalescence. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for massive black hole binaries. In this paper, we demonstrated this relationship under both all-sky average and non-average conditions. The latter introduces only an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a simple estimation method with an error margin of within 2%.

 - **Abstract**
 We present systematic identifications of supergiants of M31/M33 based on massive LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Radial velocities of nearly 5000 photometrically selected M31/M33 supergiant candidates have been properly derived from the qualified spectra released in LAMOST DR10. By comparing their radial velocities with those predicted from the rotation curves of M31, as well as utilizing {\it Gaia} astrometric measurements to exclude foreground contaminations, 199 supergiant members in M31, including 168 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2', have been successfully identified. This sample contains 62 blue supergiants (BSGs, all `Rank1'), 134 yellow supergiants (YSGs, 103 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2') and 3 red supergiants (RSGs, all `Rank1'). For M33, we identify 84 supergiant members (56 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2'), which includes 28 BSGs (all `Rank1'), 53 YSGs (25 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2') and 3 RSGs (all `Rank1').

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the LHAASO Collaboration presented the first very-high-energy gamma-ray catalog, containing 90 TeV sources. Among these sources, 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u* is located 0.3$^\circ$ west of SNR G54.1 +0.3 and it also lies inside a $+53 \, \text{km s}^{-1}$ cloud (the Western Cloud) which may be associate with SNR G54.1+0.3. Moreover, one of IceCube's HESE track events is found at 1.3$^\circ$ north of 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u*. SNR G54.1+0.3 is young, with a powerful PWN inside. The X-ray radiation from the regions of SNR shell and PWN can be distinguished clearly. The radio emission from the PWN region is also available. However, due to the low angular resolution, the gamma-ray emission at the SNR by Fermi, HESS and VERITAS are considered as point sources. In this work, we explore a scenario that SNR G54.1 +0.3 is indeed associated with the Western Cloud and we derive the emissions from the PWN, the SNR shell, and the nearby molecular cloud. Our results can explain the multi-messenger observations, indicating that 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u* might be the excellent candidate of Galactic PeVatron.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in ultra-stable ground-based high-resolution spectrographs have propelled ground-based astronomy to the forefront of exoplanet detection and characterisation. Retrieving accurate atmospheric parameters depends on accurate modelling and removal of the telluric contamination while preserving the faint underlying exoplanet signal. There exist many methods to model telluric contamination, whether directly modelling the Earth's transmission spectrum via radiative transfer modelling, or using a principal component analysis (PCA)-like reconstruction to fit the time-invariant features of a spectrum. We aimed to assess the efficacy of these various telluric removal methods in preserving the underlying exoplanetary spectra. We compared two of the most common telluric modelling and removal methods, molecfit and the PCA-like algorithm SysRem, using planetary transmission spectra injected into three high-resolution optical observations taken with ESPRESSO. These planetary signals were injected at orbital periods of P = 2 days and 12 days, resulting in differing changes in radial velocity during transit. We then retrieved various injected atmospheric model parameters in order to determine the efficacy of the telluric removal methods. For the close-in, high velocity injected signal, we found that SysRem performed better for species that are also present in the Earth's atmosphere across each of the datasets. As we moved to slower moving signals at larger orbital separations, for one of the three datasets, SysRem dampened the planetary H$_2$O signal. In contrast, the H$_2$O signal was preserved for the telluric modelling method, molecfit. However, this behaviour was not ubiquitous across all three of the injected datasets, with another dataset showing a more precise H$_2$O/Fe ratio when preprocessed with SysRem.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of solar activity on the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) data collected over 10 years. We report the observation of Solar Radio Burst signals in AERA data associated with intense solar flares accompanied by moderate and strong radio blackout levels recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, although in a frequency range different from AERA, the increased level of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation during periods of larger solar activity also impacts the AERA data in a twofold way: (i) causing the atmosphere to bounce terrestrial radio waves emitted by sources far from the AERA site or (ii) causing radio signals to become degraded or completely absorbed (radio blackout) if the solar radiation results in larger ionization of the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere, respectively. We describe the identification of both cases in AERA data with a remarkable correlation between the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), that represents the highest frequency that can be used for radio communication between two points located on the Earth, modulated by the solar cycle, and the broadband noise observed in the frequency range of 30-40 MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ the combined charged particle measurements from Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) onboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO) to study the composition variation of the solar energetic particle (SEP) event occurring on May 16, 2023. During the event, SolO and PSP were located at a similar radial distance of ~0.7 au and were separated by $\sim$60$^\circ$ in longitude. The footpoints of both PSP and SolO were west of the flare region but the former was much closer (18$^\circ$ vs 80$^\circ$). Such a distribution of observers is ideal for studying the longitudinal dependence of the ion composition with the minimum transport effects of particles along the radial direction. We focus on H, He, O, and Fe measured by both spacecraft in sunward and anti-sunward directions. Their spectra are in a double power-law shape, which is fitted best by the Band function. Notably, the event was Fe-rich at PSP, where the mean Fe/O ratio at energies of 0.1 - 10 Mev/nuc was 0.48, higher than the average Fe/O ratio in previous large SEP events. In contrast, the mean Fe/O ratio at SolO over the same energy range was considerable lower at 0.08. The Fe/O ratio between 0.5 and 10 MeV/nuc at both spacecraft is nearly constant. Although the He/H ratio shows energy dependence, decreasing with increasing energy, the He/H ratio at PSP is still about twice as high as that at SolO. Such a strong longitudinal dependence of element abundances and the Fe-rich component in the PSP data could be attributed to the direct flare contribution. Moreover, the temporal profiles indicate that differences in the Fe/O and He/H ratios between PSP and SolO persisted throughout the entire event rather than only at the start.

          Combining REBOUND and MESA: Dynamical Evolution of Planets Orbiting Interacting Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Although planets have been found orbiting binary systems, whether they can survive binary interactions is debated. While the tightest-orbit binaries should host the most dynamically stable and long-lived circumbinary planetary systems, they are also the systems that are expected to experience mass transfer, common envelope evolution, or stellar mergers. In this study, we explore the effect of stable non-conservative mass transfer on the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets. We present a new script that seamlessly integrates binary evolution data from the 1D binary stellar evolution code MESA into the N-body simulation code REBOUND. This integration framework enables a comprehensive examination of the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets orbiting mass-transferring binaries, while simultaneously accounting for the detailed stellar structure evolution. In addition, we introduce a recalibration method to mitigate numerical errors from updates of binary properties during the system's dynamical evolution. We construct a reference binary model in which a $2.21\, M_\odot$ star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope through non-conservative mass transfer to the $1.76\, M_\odot$ companion star, creating a $0.38\,M_\odot$ subdwarf. We find the tightest stable orbital separation for circumbinary planets to be $\simeq 2.5$ times the binary separation after mass transfer. Accounting for tides by using the interior stellar structure, we find that tidal effects become apparent after the rapid mass transfer phase and start to fade away during the latter stage of the slow mass transfer phase. Our research provides a new framework for exploring circumbinary planet dynamics in interacting binary systems.

 We provide an accurate forecast of the expected constraining power from the main void statistics -- the void size function and the void-galaxy cross-correlation function -- to be measured by the Roman reference High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Relying on a realistic galaxy mock lightcone, covering 2000 square degrees, we find more than $8\times 10^4 $ voids and explore their constraining power in the framework of three different cosmological models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0 w_{\rm a}$CDM. This work confirms the strong complementarity of different void statistics and showcases the constraining power to be expected from Roman voids thanks to the combination of its high tracer density and large observed volume.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of binary companions to $\delta$ Scuti stars, detected through phase modulations of their pulsations in TESS data. Pulsation timing has provided orbits for hundreds of pulsating stars in binaries from space-based photometry. We have applied this technique to $\delta$ Sct stars observed in the first four years of TESS Mission photometry. We searched the 2-min cadence light curves of 1161 short-period instability strip pulsators for variations in pulsation phase caused by the dynamical influence of an unseen companion. We discovered 53 new binaries and we present orbital parameters and mass functions for the 24 systems with solvable orbits. For the brightest star in our sample $\alpha$ Pictoris, we perform a joint fit of the pulsation timing and Hipparcos astrometry. We present the first orbit for the $\alpha$ Pictoris system, obtaining an orbital period of 1316$\pm$2 days and a mass for $\alpha$ Pic b of 1.05$\pm$0.05 M$_\odot$. We revisit pulsation timing binaries from Kepler with Gaia kinematics, finding four systems that are members of the Galatic thick disk or halo. This suggests that they have been rejuvenated by mass transfer, and their companions are now white dwarfs. Further follow up of these systems may yield valuable constraints of the galactic blue straggler population.
