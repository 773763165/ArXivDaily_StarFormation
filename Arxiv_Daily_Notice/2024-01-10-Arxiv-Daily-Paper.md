 - **Abstract**
 PDS 70 hosts two massive, still-accreting planets and the inclined orientation of its protoplanetary disk presents a unique opportunity to directly probe the vertical gas structure of a planet-hosting disk. Here, we use high-spatial-resolution (${\approx}$0."1;10 au) observations in a set of CO isotopologue lines and HCO$^+$ J=4-3 to map the full 2D $(r,z)$ disk structure from the disk atmosphere, as traced by $^{12}$CO, to closer to the midplane, as probed by less abundant isotopologues and HCO$^+$. In the PDS 70 disk, $^{12}$CO traces a height of $z/r\approx0.3$, $^{13}$CO is found at $z/r\approx0.1$, and C$^{18}$O originates at, or near, the midplane. The HCO$^+$ surface arises from $z/r\approx0.2$ and is one of the few non-CO emission surfaces constrained with high fidelity in disks to date. In the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line, we resolve a vertical dip and steep rise in height at the cavity wall, making PDS 70 the first transition disk where this effect is directly seen in line emitting heights. In the outer disk, the CO emission heights of PDS 70 appear typical for its stellar mass and disk size and are not substantially altered by the two inner embedded planets. By combining CO isotopologue and HCO$^+$ lines, we derive the 2D gas temperature structure and estimate a midplane CO snowline of ${\approx}$56-85 au. This implies that both PDS 70b and 70c are located interior to the CO snowline and are likely accreting gas with a high C/O ratio of ${\approx}$1.0, which provides context for future planetary atmospheric measurements from, e.g., JWST, and for properly modeling their formation histories.

 - **Abstract**
 Discovering and characterizing exoplanets at the outer edge of the transit method's sensitivity has proven challenging owing to geometric biases and the practical difficulties associated with acquiring long observational baselines. Nonetheless, a sample of giant exoplanets on orbits longer than 100 days has been identified by transit hunting missions. We present long-term Doppler spectroscopy for 11 such systems with observation baselines spanning a few years to a decade. We model these radial velocity observations jointly with transit photometry to provide initial characterizations of these objects and the systems in which they exist. Specifically, we make new precise mass measurements for four long-period giant exoplanets (Kepler-111 c, Kepler-553 c, Kepler-849 b, and PH-2 b), we place new upper limits on mass for four others (Kepler-421 b, KOI-1431.01, Kepler-1513 b, and Kepler-952 b), and we show that several "confirmed" planets are in fact not planetary at all. We present these findings to complement similar efforts focused on closer-in short-period giant planets, and with the hope of inspiring future dedicated studies of cool giant exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We report multi-epoch astrometric VLBI observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio centroid positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the co-moving reference frame with an inclination $i=39.5^{+3.6}_{-3.5}$ degr and longitude of ascending node $\Omega=212\pm22$ degr. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by $\Delta\alpha=-0.81^{+0.25}_{-0.37}$ mas, $\Delta\delta=0.45^{+0.23}_{-0.25}$ mas. All radio centroids are well-displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the inter-binary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with $2\sigma$ upper limits in the range 200--1000 km sec$^{-1}$. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a $\sim3\sigma$ detection $v_{\perp}=228\pm85$ km sec$^{-1}$. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020) has recommended that NASA realize a large IR/O/UV space telescope optimized for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of ~25 exo-Earths and transformative general astrophysics. The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) has subsequently released a list of 164 nearby (d<25 pc) targets deemed the most accessible to survey for potentially habitable exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We present a catalog of system properties for the 164 ExEP targets, including 1744 abundance measurements for 14 elements from the Hypatia Catalog and 924 photometry measurements spanning from 151.6 nm to 22 {\mu}m in the GALEX, Str\"omgren, Tycho, Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE bandpasses. We independently derive stellar properties for these systems by modeling their spectral energy distributions with Bayesian model averaging. Furthermore, we identify TESS flare rates for 44 stars, optical variability for 78 stars, and X-ray emission for 41 stars in our sample from the literature. We discuss our catalog in the context of planet habitability and draw attention to key gaps in our knowledge where precursor science can help to inform HWO mission design trade studies in the near future. Notably, only 33 of the 164 stars in our sample have reliable space-based UV measurements, and only 40 have a mid-IR measurement. We also find that phosphorus, a bio-essential element, has only been measured in 11 of these stars, motivating future abundance surveys. Our catalog is publicly available and we advocate for its use in forthcoming studies of promising HWO targets.
#### The impact of spectral line wing cut-off: Recommended standard method  with application to MAESTRO opacity database

 - **Abstract**
 When computing cross-sections from a line list, the result depends not only on the line strength, but also the line shape, pressure-broadening parameters, and line wing cut-off (i.e., the maximum distance calculated from each line centre). Pressure-broadening can be described using the Lorentz lineshape, but it is known to not represent the true absorption in the far wings. Both theory and experiment have shown that far from the line centre, non-Lorentzian behaviour controls the shape of the wings and the Lorentz lineshape fails to accurately characterize the absorption, leading to an underestimation or overestimation of the opacity continuum depending on the molecular species involved. The line wing cut-off is an often overlooked parameter when calculating absorption cross sections, but can have a significant effect on the appearance of the spectrum since it dictates the extent of the line wing that contributes to the calculation either side of every line centre. Therefore, when used to analyse exoplanet and brown dwarf spectra, an inaccurate choice for the line wing cut-off can result in errors in the opacity continuum, which propagate into the modeled transit spectra, and ultimately impact/bias the interpretation of observational spectra, and the derived composition and thermal structure. Here, we examine the different methods commonly utilized to calculate the wing cut-off and propose a standard practice procedure (i.e., absolute value of 25~cm$^{-1}$ for $P\leqslant$~200~bar and 100~cm$^{-1}$ for $P >$ ~200~bar) to generate molecular opacities which will be used by the open-access {\tt MAESTRO} (Molecules and Atoms in Exoplanet Science: Tools and Resources for Opacities) database. The pressing need for new measurements and theoretical studies of the far-wings is highlighted.
#### Revealing multiple nested molecular outflows with rotating signatures in  HH270mms1-A with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present molecular line observations of the protostellar outflow associated with HH270mms1 in the Orion B molecular cloud with ALMA. The 12CO(J = 3 - 2) emissions show that the outflow velocity structure consists of four distinct components of low ($\gtrsim$ 10 km s-1), intermediate (~ 10 - 25 km s-1) and high ($\gtrsim$ 40 km s-1) velocities in addition to the entrained gas velocity (~ 25 - 40 km s-1). The high- and intermediate-velocity flows have well-collimated structures surrounded by the low-velocity flow. The chain of knots is embedded in the high-velocity flow or jet, which is the evidence of episodic mass ejections induced by time-variable mass accretion. We could detect the velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflow axis in both the low- and intermediate-velocity flows. We confirmed the rotation of the envelope and disk in the 13CO and C17O emission and found that their velocity gradients are the same as those of the outflow. Thus, we concluded that the velocity gradients in the low- and intermediate-velocity flows are due to the outflow rotation. Using observational outflow properties, we estimated the outflow launching radii to be 67.1 - 77.1 au for the low-velocity flow and 13.3 - 20.8 au for the intermediate-velocity flow. Although we could not detect the rotation in the jets due to the limited spatial resolution, we estimated the jet launching radii to be (2.36 - 3.14) x 10^-2 au using the observed velocity of each knots. Thus, the jet is driven from the inner disk region. We could identify the launching radii of distinct velocity components within a single outflow with all the prototypical characteristics expected from recent theoretical works.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics of a cosmological bubble wall beyond the approximation of an infinitely thin wall. In a previous paper, we discussed the range of validity of this approximation and estimated the first-order corrections due to the finite width. Here, we introduce a systematic method to obtain the wall equation of motion and its profile at each order in the wall width. We discuss in detail the next-to-next-to-leading-order terms. We use the results to treat the growth of spherical bubbles and the evolution of small deformations of planar walls.

 - **Abstract**
 Filamentary flows toward the centre of molecular clouds have been recognized as a crucial process in the formation and evolution of stellar clusters. In this paper, we present a comprehensive observational study that investigates the gas properties and kinematics of the Giant Molecular Cloud G148.24+00.41 using the observations of CO (1-0) isotopologues. We find that the cloud is massive (10$^5$ M$_\odot$) and is one of the most massive clouds of the outer Galaxy. We identified six likely velocity coherent filaments in the cloud having length, width, and mass in the range of 14$-$38 pc, 2.5$-$4.2 pc, and (1.3$-$6.9) $\times$ 10$^3$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We find that the filaments are converging towards the central area of the cloud, and the longitudinal accretion flows along the filaments are in the range of $\sim$ 26$-$264 M$_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$. The cloud has fragmented into 7 clumps having mass in the range of $\sim$ 260$-$2100 M$_\odot$ and average size around $\sim$ 1.4 pc, out of which the most massive clump is located at the hub of the filamentary structures, near the geometric centre of the cloud. Three filaments are found to be directly connected to the massive clump and transferring matter at a rate of $\sim$ 675 M$_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$. The clump hosts a near-infrared cluster. Our results show that large-scale filamentary accretion flows towards the central region of the collapsing cloud is an important mechanism for supplying the matter necessary to form the central high-mass clump and subsequent stellar cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle-5 observations of HBC 494, as well as calculations of the kinematic and dynamic variables which represent the object's wide-angle bipolar outflows. HBC 494 is a binary FU Orionis type object located in the Orion A molecular cloud. We take advantage of combining the ALMA main array, Atacama Compact Array (ACA), and Total Power (TP) array in order to map HBC 494's outflows and thus, estimate their kinematic parameters with higher accuracy in comparison to prior publications. We use $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and SO observations to describe the object's outflows, envelope, and disc, as well as estimate the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy of the outflows. After correcting for optical opacity near systemic velocities, we estimate a mass of $3.0\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the southern outflow and $2.8\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the northern outflow. We report the first detection of a secondary outflow cavity located approximately $15$" north of the central binary system, which could be a remnant of a previous large-scale accretion outburst. Furthermore, we find CO spatial features in HBC 494's outflows corresponding to position angles of $\sim35^{\circ}$ and $\sim145^{\circ}$. This suggests that HBC 494's outflows are most likely a composite of overlapping outflows from two different sources, i.e., HBC 494a and HBC 494b, the two objects in the binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of asymmetric fermionic dark matter (DM) on the thermal evolution of neutron stars (NSs), considering a scenario where DM interacts with baryonic matter (BM) through gravity. Employing the two-fluid formalism, our analysis reveals that DM accrued within the NS core exerts an inward gravitational pull on the outer layers composed of BM. This gravitational interaction results in a noticeable increase in baryonic density within the core of the NS. Consequently, it strongly affects the star's thermal evolution by triggering an early onset of the direct Urca (DU) processes, causing an enhanced neutrino emission and rapid star cooling. Moreover, the photon emission from the star's surface is modified due to a reduction of radius. We demonstrate the effect of DM gravitational pull on nucleonic and hyperonic DU processes that become kinematically allowed even for NSs of low mass. We then discuss the significance of observing NSs at various distances from the Galactic center. Given that the DM distribution peaks toward the Galactic center, NSs within this central region are expected to harbor higher fractions of DM, potentially leading to distinct cooling behaviors.
#### Formation of the Methyl Cation by Photochemistry in a Protoplanetary  Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Forty years ago it was proposed that gas phase organic chemistry in the interstellar medium was initiated by the methyl cation CH3+, but hitherto it has not been observed outside the Solar System. Alternative routes involving processes on grain surfaces have been invoked. Here we report JWST observations of CH3+ in a protoplanetary disk in the Orion star forming region. We find that gas-phase organic chemistry is activated by UV irradiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical observations typically provide three-dimensional maps, encoding the distribution of the observed flux in (1) the two angles of the celestial sphere and (2) energy/frequency. An important task regarding such maps is to statistically characterize populations of point sources too dim to be individually detected. As the properties of a single dim source will be poorly constrained, instead one commonly studies the population as a whole, inferring a source-count distribution (SCD) that describes the number density of sources as a function of their brightness. Statistical and machine learning methods for recovering SCDs exist; however, they typically entirely neglect spectral information associated with the energy distribution of the flux. We present a deep learning framework able to jointly reconstruct the spectra of different emission components and the SCD of point-source populations. In a proof-of-concept example, we show that our method accurately extracts even complex-shaped spectra and SCDs from simulated maps.
#### Intranight variability of ultraviolet emission from high-$z$ blazars

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid intranight variability of continuum and polarization in blazars is a very useful tool to probe the beaming of a relativistic jet and the associated population of the relativistic particles. Such intranight variability in the rest-frame optical continuum has been carried out extensively, but there is a scarcity of such information in the rest-frame ultra-violet (UV), where the cause of variability might be due to {a} secondary population of relativistic particles. To fill this gap, recently in Chand et al. (2022) we reported for the first time intranight variability study of a sample of high-$z$ blazars so that the monitored optical radiation is their rest-frame UV radiation. Here we discuss in detail the implication of this investigation with a proper comparison of high-$z$ blazar samples with fractional optical polarization ($p_{opt}$) smaller and higher than 3\%. In this context, we also report intranight variability study of an additional high-$z$ blazar at $z$=2.347, namely J161942.38+525613.41, monitored over three sessions each with a duration of $\sim$5 hr. Our investigation does not reveal any compelling evidence for a stronger intranight variability of UV emission for high polarization blazars, in contrast to the blazars monitored in the rest-frame blue-optical. We also discuss this trend in light of the proposal that the synchrotron radiation of blazar jets in the UV/X-ray regime may arise from a relativistic particle population different from that radiating up to near-infrared/optical frequencies.
#### Mid-infrared evidence for iron-rich dust in the multi-ringed inner disk  of HD 144432

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Rocky planets form by the concentration of solid particles in the inner few au regions of planet-forming disks. Their chemical composition reflects the materials in the disk available in the solid phase at the time the planets were forming. Aims. We aim to constrain the structure and dust composition of the inner disk of the young star HD 144432, using an extensive set of infrared interferometric data taken by the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), combining PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE observations. Methods. We introduced a new physical disk model, TGMdust, to image the interferometric data, and to fit the disk structure and dust composition. We also performed equilibrium condensation calculations with GGchem. Results. Our best-fit model has three disk zones with ring-like structures at 0.15, 1.3, and 4.1 au. Assuming that the dark regions in the disk at ~0.9 au and at ~3 au are gaps opened by planets, we estimate the masses of the putative gap-opening planets to be around a Jupiter mass. We find evidence for an optically thin emission ($\tau<0.4$) from the inner two disk zones ($r<4$ au) at $\lambda>3\ \mu$m. Our silicate compositional fits confirm radial mineralogy gradients. To identify the dust component responsible for the infrared continuum emission, we explore two cases for the dust composition, one with a silicate+iron mixture and the other with a silicate+carbon one. We find that the iron-rich model provides a better fit to the spectral energy distribution. Conclusions. We propose that in the warm inner regions ($r<5$ au) of typical planet-forming disks, most if not all carbon is in the gas phase, while iron and iron sulfide grains are major constituents of the solid mixture along with forsterite and enstatite. Our analysis demonstrates the need for detailed studies of the dust in inner disks with new mid-infrared instruments such as MATISSE and JWST/MIRI.
#### Detection of pairwise kSZ effect with DESI galaxy groups and Planck in  Fourier space

 - **Abstract**
 We report a $\sim5.2\sigma$ detection of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in Fourier space, by combining the DESI galaxy groups and the Planck data. We use the density-weighted pairwise kSZ power spectrum as the summary statistic, and the detailed procedure of its measurement is presented in this paper. Meanwhile, we analyze the redshift space group density power spectrum to constrain its bias parameters and photo-z uncertainties. These best fitted parameters are substituted to a non-linear kSZ model, and we fit the measured kSZ power spectrum with this model to constrain the group optical depth $\bar{\tau}$. Selected by a varying lower mass threshold $M_{\rm th}$, the galaxy group catalogs with different median masses ($\tilde{M}$) are constructed from the DR9 data of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. $\tilde{M}$ spans a wide range of $\sim10^{13}-10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot/h$ and the heaviest $\tilde{M}\sim10^{14} {\rm M}_\odot/h$ is larger than those of most other kSZ detections. When the aperture photometric filter radius $\theta_{\rm AP}$ is set to be $4.2$ arcmin, the $\tilde{M}=1.75\times10^{13}{\rm M}_\odot/h$ group sample at the median redshift $\tilde{z}=0.64$ has the highest kSZ detection ${\rm S/N}=5.2$. By fitting $\bar{\tau}$s from various samples against their $\tilde{M}$s, we obtain a linear $\log\bar{\tau}-\log \tilde{M}$ relation: $\log\bar{\tau} = \gamma(\log \tilde{M}-14)+\log\beta$, in which $\gamma=0.55\pm0.1$. We also vary the aperture photometric filter radius and measure the $\bar{\tau}$ profiles of group samples, whose constraints on the baryon distribution within and around dark matter halos will be discussed in a companion paper.

 The baryonic feedback effect is an important systematic error in the weak lensing (WL) analysis. It contributes partly to the $S_8$ tension in the literature. With the next generations of large scale structure (LSS) and CMB experiments, the high signal-to-noise kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect detection can tightly constrain the baryon distribution in and around dark matter halos, and quantify the baryonic effect in the weak lensing statistics. In this work, we apply the Fisher matrix technique to predict the future kSZ constraints on 3 kSZ-sensitive Baryon Correction Model (BCM) parameters. Our calculations show that, in combination with next generation LSS surveys, the 3rd generation CMB experiments such as AdvACT and Simon Observatory can constrain the matter power spectrum damping $S(k)$ to the precision of $\sigma_S(k)<0.8\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$ at $k\lesssim 10h/$Mpc, where $V$ is the overlapped survey volume between the future LSS and CMB surveys. For the 4th generation CMB surveys such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, the constraint will be enhanced to $\sigma_S(k)<0.4\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$. If extra-observations, e.g. X-ray detection and thermal SZ observation, can effectively fix the gas density profile slope parameter $\delta$, the constraint on $S(k)$ will be further boosted to $\sigma_S(k)<0.3\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$ and $\sigma_S(k)<0.1\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$ for the 3rd and 4th generation CMB surveys.

 The present epoch of the Gaia success gives us a possibility to predict the dynamical evolution of our Solar System in the global Galactic framework with high precision. We statistically investigated the total interaction of globular clusters with the Solar System during six billion years of look-back time. We estimated the gravitational influence of globular clusters' flyby onto the Oort cloud system. To perform the realistic orbital dynamical evolution for each individual cluster, we used our own high-order parallel dynamical $N$ body $\varphi$-GPU code that we developed. To reconstruct the orbital trajectories of clusters, we used five external dynamical time variable galactic potentials selected from the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological database and one static potential. To detect a cluster's close passages near the Solar System, we adopted a simple distance criterion of below 200 pc. To take into account a cluster's measurement errors (based on Gaia DR3), we generated 1000 initial positions and velocity randomizations for each cluster in each potential. We found 35 globular clusters that have had close passages near the Sun in all the six potentials during the whole lifetime of the Solar System. We can conclude that at a relative distance of 50 pc between a GC and the SolS, we obtain on average $\sim 15$\% of the close passage probability over all six billion years, and at $dR=100$ pc, we get on average $\sim 35$\% of the close passage probability over all six billion years. The globular clusters BH_140, UKS_1, and Djorg_1 have a mean minimum relative distance to the Sun of 9, 19, and 17 pc, respectively. We can assume that a globular cluster with close passages near the Sun is not a frequent occurrence but also not an exceptional event in the Solar System's lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The JCMT Transient Survey has been monitoring eight Gould Belt low-mass star-forming regions since December 2015 and six somewhat more distant intermediate-mass star-forming regions since February 2020 with SCUBA-2 on the JCMT at \ShortS and \LongS and with an approximately monthly cadence. We introduce our Pipeline v2 relative calibration procedures for image alignment and flux calibration across epochs, improving on our previous Pipeline v1 by decreasing measurement uncertainties and providing additional robustness. These new techniques work at both \LongS and \ShortNS, where v1 only allowed investigation of the \LongS data. Pipeline v2 achieves better than $0.5^{\prime\prime}$ relative image alignment, less than a tenth of the submillimeter beam widths. The v2 relative flux calibration is found to be 1\% at \LongS and $<5$\% at \ShortNS. The improvement in the calibration is demonstrated by comparing the two pipelines over the first four years of the survey and recovering additional robust variables with v2. Using the full six years of the Gould Belt survey the number of robust variables increases by 50\,\%, and at \ShortS we identify four robust variables, all of which are also robust at \LongNS. The multi-wavelength light curves for these sources are investigated and found to be consistent with the variability being due to dust heating within the envelope in response to accretion luminosity changes from the central source.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), we have detected absorption lines due to carbon-monoxide, CO(J=0-1), and the cyano radical, CN(N=0-1), associated with radio galaxy B2 0902+34 at redshift z=3.4. The detection of millimeter-band absorption observed 1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang facilitates studying molecular clouds down to gas masses inaccessible to emission-line observations. The CO absorption in B2 0902+34 has a peak optical depth of $\tau$ $\ge$ 8.6% and consists of two components, one of which has the same redshift as previously detected 21-cm absorption of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas. Each CO component traces an integrated H$_2$ column density of N(H2) $\ge$ 3x10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. CN absorption is detected for both CO components, as well as for a blueshifted component not detected in CO, with CO/CN line ratios ranging from $\le$0.4 to 2.4. We discuss the scenario that the absorption components originate from collections of small and dense molecular clouds that are embedded in a region with more diffuse gas and high turbulence, possibly within the influence of the central Active Galactic Nucleus or starburst region. The degree of reddening in B2 0902+34, with a rest-frame color B-K ~ 4.2, is lower than the very red colors (B-K > 6) found among other known redshifted CO absorption systems at z<1. Nevertheless, when including also the many non-detections from the literature, a potential correlation between the absorption-line strength and B-K color is evident, giving weight to the argument that the red colors of CO absorbers are due to a high dust content.

 - **Abstract**
 We present homogeneous multiband (grizJHKs) time-series observations of 78 Cepheids including 49 fundamental mode variables and 29 first-overtone mode variables. These observations were collected simultaneously using the ROS2 and REMIR instruments at the Rapid Eye Mount telescope. The Cepheid sample covers a large range of distances (0.5 - 19.7 kpc) with varying precision of parallaxes, and thus astrometry-based luminosity fits were used to derive PL and PW relations in optical Sloan (griz) and near-infrared (JHKs) filters. These empirically calibrated relations exhibit large scatter primarily due to larger uncertainties in parallaxes of distant Cepheids, but their slopes agree well with those previously determined in the literature. Using homogeneous high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities of 61 Cepheids covering -1.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.6 dex, we quantified the metallicity dependence of PL and PW relations which varies between $-0.30\pm0.11$ (in Ks) and $-0.55\pm0.12$ (in z) mag/dex in grizJHKs bands. However, the metallicity dependence in the residuals of the PL and PW relations is predominantly seen for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -0.3 dex), which also have larger parallax uncertainties. The modest sample size precludes us from separating the contribution to the residuals due to parallax uncertainties, metallicity effects, and reddening errors. While this Cepheid sample is not optimal for calibrating the Leavitt law, upcoming photometric and spectroscopic datasets of the C-MetaLL survey will allow the accurate derivation of PL and PW relations in the Sloan and near-infrared bandpasses, which will be useful for the distance measurements in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and upcoming extremely large telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), due to their high luminosities are detected up to redshift 10, and thus have the potential to be vital cosmological probes of early processes in the universe. Fulfilling this potential requires a large sample of GRBs with known redshifts, but due to observational limitations, only 11\% have known redshifts ($z$). There have been numerous attempts to estimate redshifts via correlation studies, most of which have led to inaccurate predictions. To overcome this, we estimated GRB redshift via an ensemble supervised machine learning model that uses X-ray afterglows of long-duration GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The estimated redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) and have a root mean square error, namely the square root of the average squared error $\langle\Delta z^2\rangle$, of 0.46 with the observed redshifts showing the reliability of this method. The addition of GRB afterglow parameters improves the predictions considerably by 63\% compared to previous results in peer-reviewed literature. Finally, we use our machine learning model to infer the redshifts of 154 GRBs, which increase the known redshifts of long GRBs with plateaus by 94\%, a significant milestone for enhancing GRB population studies that require large samples with redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed numerical simulations of the common envelope (CE) interaction between two thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of 1.7 $M_\odot$ and 3.7 $M_\odot$, and their 0.6 $M_\odot$ compact companion. We use tabulated equations of state to take into account recombination energy. For the first time, formation and growth of dust in the envelope is calculated explicitly, using a carbon dust nucleation network with a gas phase C/O number ratio of 2.5. By the end of the simulations, the total dust yield are $\sim8.2\times10^{-3}~M_\odot$ and $\sim2.2\times10^{-2}~M_\odot$ for the CE with a 1.7 $M_\odot$ and a 3.7 $M_\odot$ AGB star, respectively, close to the theoretical limit. Dust formation does not substantially lead to more mass unbinding or substantially alter the orbital evolution. The first dust grains appear as early as $\sim1-3$ yrs after the onset of the CE rapidly forming an optically thick shell at $\sim10-20$ au, growing in thickness and radius to values of $\sim400-500$ au by $\sim40$ yrs. These large objects have approximate temperatures of 400 K. While dust yields are commensurate with those of single AGB stars of comparable mass, the dust in CE ejections forms over decades as opposed to tens of thousands of years. It is likely that these rapidly evolving IR objects correspond to the post-optically-luminous tail of the lightcurve of some luminous red novae. The simulated characteristics of dusty CEs also lend further support to the idea that extreme carbon stars and the so called ``water fountains" may be objects observed in the immediate aftermath of a CE event.

 - **Abstract**
 Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries (BH-LMXBs) is an excellent observational laboratory for studying many open questions in accretion physics. However, determining the physical properties of BH-LMXBs necessitates knowing their distances. With the increased discovery rate of BH-LMXBs, many canonical methods cannot produce accurate distance estimates at the desired pace. In this study, we develop a versatile statistical framework to obtain robust distance estimates soon after discovery. Our framework builds on previous methods where the soft spectral state and the soft-to-hard spectral state transitions, typically present in an outbursting BH-LMXB, are used to place constraints on mass and distance. We further develop the traditional framework by allowing for general relativistic corrections, spectral/physical parameter uncertainties as well as utilizing assumptions based on the best current theoretical and observational knowledge. We tested our framework by analyzing a sample of 50 BH-LMXB sources using X-ray spectral data from the Swift/XRT, MAXI/GSC, and RXTE/PCA missions. By modeling their spectra, we applied our framework to 26 sources from the 50. Comparison of our estimated distances to previous distance estimates indicates that our findings are dependable and in agreement with the accurate estimates obtained through parallax, and H i absorption methods. Investigating the accuracy of our constraints, we have found that estimates obtained using both the soft and transition spectral information have a median uncertainty of 20%, while estimates obtained using only the soft spectral state spectrum have a median uncertainty of around 50%. Furthermore, we have found no instrument-specific biases.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse-to-pulse profile shape variations introduce correlations in pulsar times of arrival (TOAs) across radio frequency measured at the same observational epoch. This leads to a broadband noise in excess of radiometer noise, which is termed pulse jitter noise. The presence of jitter noise limits the achievable timing precision and decreases the sensitivity of pulsar-timing data sets to signals of interest such as nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves. Current white noise models used in pulsar timing analyses attempt to account for this, assuming complete correlation of uncertainties through the arrival times collected in a unique observation and no frequency dependence of jitter (which corresponds to a rank-one covariance matrix). However, previous studies show that the brightest millisecond pulsar at decimetre wavelengths, PSR J0437$-$4715, shows decorrelation and frequency dependence of jitter noise. Here we present a detailed study of the decorrelation of jitter noise in PSR J0437$-$4715 and implement a new technique to model it. We show that the rate of decorrelation due to jitter can be expressed as a power-law in frequency. We analyse the covariance matrix associated with the jitter noise process and find that a higher-rank-approximation is essential to account for the decorrelation and to account for frequency dependence of jitter noise. We show that the use of this novel method significantly improves the estimation of other chromatic noise parameters such as dispersion measure variations. However, we find no significant improvement in errors and estimation of other timing model parameters suggesting that current methods are not biased for other parameters, for this pulsar due to this misspecification. We show that pulse energy variations show a similar decorrelation to the jitter noise, indicating a common origin for both observables.
#### Dynamical study of Geminid formation assuming a rotational instability  scenario

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Various ideas have been proposed to explain the formation of the Geminid meteoroid stream from the asteroid (3200) Phaethon. However, little has been studied about the Geminid formation based on the assumption that mass ejection happened from this asteroid via rotational instability. Aims: Here, we present the first dynamical study of the Geminid formation, taking account of low-velocity mass ejection as a result of Phaethon's rotational instability. Methods: We conducted numerical simulations for 1 mm and 1 cm particles ejected in a wide range of ejection epochs (10$^3$--10$^5$ years ago). We computed the minimum orbital intersecting distance (MOID) of the dust particles as the realistic condition, that is, the Earth's radius and the Earth-Moon distance to be observed as the Geminid meteoroid stream. Results: We found that the low-velocity ejection model produced the Geminid-like meteoroid stream when the dust particles were ejected more than $\sim$2,000 years ago. In this case, close encounters with terrestrial planets would transport some dust particles from the Phaethon orbit (the current MOID is as large as $\sim$460 Earth radius) to the Earth-intersecting orbits. The optimal ejection epoch and the estimated mass were 18\,000 years ago and $\sim 10^{10} - 10^{14}$ g (<0.1 \% of the Phaethon mass). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the JAXA's DESTINY\textsuperscript{+} mission has the potential to find evidence of recent rotational instability recorded on the Phaethon's surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate physical parameters of exoplanet systems are essential for further exploration of planetary internal structure, atmospheres, and formation history. We aim to use simultaneous multicolour transit photometry to improve the estimation of transit parameters, to search for transit timing variations (TTVs), and to establish which of our targets should be prioritised for follow-up transmission spectroscopy. We performed time series photometric observations of 12 transits for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-19b, HAT-P-51b, HAT-P-55b, and HAT-P-65b using the simultaneous four-colour camera MuSCAT2 on the Telescopio Carlos S\'anchez. We collected 56 additional transit light curves from TESS photometry. To derive transit parameters, we modelled the MuSCAT2 light curves with Gaussian processes to account for correlated noise. To derive physical parameters, we performed EXOFASTv2 global fits to the available transit and radial velocity data sets, together with the Gaia DR3 parallax, isochrones, and spectral energy distributions. To assess the potential for atmospheric characterisation, we compared the multicolour transit depths with a flat line and a clear atmosphere model. We consistently refined the transit and physical parameters. We improved the orbital period and ephemeris estimates, and found no evidence for TTVs or orbital decay. The MuSCAT2 broadband transmission spectra of HAT-P-19b and HAT-P-65b are consistent with previously published low-resolution transmission spectra. We also found that, except for HAT-P-65b, the assumption of a planetary atmosphere can improve the fit to the MuSCAT2 data. In particular, we identified HAT-P-55b as a priority target among these four planets for further atmospheric studies using transmission spectroscopy.

 In a population of multiple protostellar systems with discs, the sub-population of circumbinary discs whose orbital plane is highly misaligned with respect to the binary's orbital plane constrains the initial distribution of orbital parameters of the whole population. We show that by measuring the polar disc fraction and the average orbital eccentricity in the polar discs, one can constrain the distributions of initial eccentricity and mutual inclination in multiple stellar systems at birth.

 The Open Science paradigm and the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are aiming at fostering scientific return, and reinforcing the trust in science production. The MASER (Measuring, Analysing and Simulating Emissions in the Radio range) services implement Open Science through a series of existing solutions that have been put together, only adding new pieces where needed. It is a "science ready" toolbox dedicated to time-domain low frequency radioastronomy, which data products mostly covers solar and planetary observations. MASER solutions are based on IVOA protocols for data discovery, on IHDEA tools for data exploration, and on a dedicated format developed by MASER for the temporal-spectral annotations. The service also proposes a data repository for sharing data collections, catalogues and associated documentation, as well as supplementary materials associated to papers. Each collection is managed through a Data Management Plan, which purpose is two-fold: supporting the provider for managing the collection content; and supporting the data centre for resource management. Each product of the repository is citable with a DOI, and the landing page contains web semantics annotations (using schema.org)
#### Low-mass stars: Their Protoplanetary Disc Lifetime Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 While most protoplanetary discs lose their gas within less than 10 Myr, individual disc lifetimes vary from < 1 Myr to >> 20 Myr, with some discs existing for > 40 Myr. Mean disc half lifetimes hide this diversity; only a so-far non-existing disc lifetime distribution could capture this fact. The benefit of a disc lifetime distribution would be twofold. First, it provides a stringent test on disc evolution theories. Second, it can function as input for planet formation models. Here, we derive such a disc lifetime distribution. We heuristically test different standard distribution forms for their ability to account for the observed disc fractions at certain ages. Here, we concentrate on the distribution for low-mass stars (spectral type M3.7 - M6, $M_s \approx $ 0.1 - 0.24 M$_{sun}$) because disc lifetimes depend on stellar mass. A Weibull-type distribution ($k$=1.78, $\lambda$=9.15) describes the observational data if all stars have a disc at a cluster age $t_c$=0. However, a better match exists for lower initial disc fractions. For f(t=0)= 0.65, a Weibull distribution (k=2.34, $\lambda$=11.22) and a Gauss distribution ($\sigma$=9.52, $\mu$=9.52) fit similarly well the data. All distributions have in common that they are wide, and most discs are dissipated at ages > 5 Myr. The next challenge is to quantitatively link the diversity of disc lifetimes to the diversity in planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss is a crucial process that affects the observational properties, evolution path and fate of highly evolved stars. However, the mechanism of mass loss is still unclear, and the mass-loss rate (MLR) of red supergiant stars (RSGs) requires further research and precise evaluation. To address this, we utilized an updated and complete sample of RSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and employed the 2-DUST radiation transfer model and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting approach to determine the dust-production rates (DPRs) and dust properties of the RSGs. We have fitted 4,714 selected RSGs with over 100,000 theoretical templates of evolved stars. Our results show that the DPR range of RSGs in the LMC is $10^{-11}\, \rm{M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}}$ to $10^{-7}\, \rm{M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}}$, and the total DPR of all RSGs is 1.14 $\times 10^{-6} \, \rm{M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$. We find that $63.3\%$ RSGs are oxygen-rich, and they account for $97.2\%$ of the total DPR. The optically thin RSG, which comprise $30.6\%$ of our sample, contribute only $0.1\%$ of the total DPR, while carbon-rich RSGs ($6.1\%$) produce $2.7\%$ of the total DPR. Overall, 208 RSGs contributed $76.6\%$ of the total DPR. We have established a new relationship between the MLR and luminosity of RSGs in the LMC, which exhibits a positive trend and a clear turning point at $\log{L/L_{\odot}} \approx 4.4$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of protostellar cores suggest that most of the material in the protostellar phase is accreted along streamers. Streamers in this context are defined as velocity coherent funnels of denser material potentially connecting the large scale environment to the small scales of the forming accretion disk. Using simulations which simultaneously resolve the driving of turbulence on the filament scale as well as the collapse of the core down to protostellar disk scales, we aim to understand the effect of the turbulent velocity field on the formation of overdensities in the accretion flow. We perform a three-dimensional numerical study on a core collapse within a turbulent filament using the RAMSES code and analyse the properties of overdensities in the accretion flow. We find that overdensities are formed naturally by the initial turbulent velocity field inherited from the filament and subsequent gravitational collimation. This leads to streams which are not really filamentary but show a sheet-like morphology. Moreover, they have the same radial infall velocities as the low density material. As a main consequence of the turbulent initial condition, the mass accretion onto the disk does not follow the predictions for solid body rotation. Instead, most of the mass is funneled by the overdensities to intermediate disk radii.

 - **Abstract**
 It is known from Earth that ionizing high-energy radiation can lead to ion-induced nucleation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. Since the amount of high-energy radiation can vary greatly based on the radiative environment of a host star, understanding the effect of high-energy radiation on cloud particles is critical to understand exoplanet atmospheres. This study aims to explore how high-energy radiation affects the aggregation and charging of mineral cloud particles. We present experiments conducted in an atmosphere chamber on mineral SiO$_2$ particles with diameters of 50 nm. The particles were exposed to gamma radiation in either low-humidity (RH $\approx$ 20%) or high-humidity (RH $>$ 50%) environments. The aggregation and charging state of the particles were studied with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer. We find that the single SiO$_2$ particles (N1) cluster to form larger aggregates (N2 - N4), and that this aggregation is inhibited by gamma radiation. We find that gamma radiation shifts the charging of the particles to become more negative, by increasing the charging state of negatively charged particles. Through an independent T-test we find that this increase is statistically significant within a 5% significance level for all aggregates in the high-humidity environment, and for all except the N1 particles in the low-humidity environment. For the positively charged particles the changes in charging state are not within the 5% significance level. We suggest that the overall effect of gamma radiation could favor the formation of a high number of small particles over a lower number of larger particles.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to investigate the chemical history of the entire MilkyWay, it is imperative to also study the dust-obscured regions, where most of the mass lies. The Galactic Center is an example of such a region of interest, where due to the intervening dust along the line-of-sight, near-infrared spectroscopic investigations are necessary. We demonstrate that M giants observed at high spectral resolution in the H and K bands (1.5-2.4 {\mu}m) can yield useful abundance-ratio trends versus metallicity for 21 elements. These elements can therefore be studied also for heavily dust-obscured regions of the Galaxy, such as the Galactic Center, and will be important for the further investigation of the Galactic chemical evolution in these regions. We have observed near-infrared spectra of 50 M giants in the solar neighbourhood at high SNR and at a high spectral resolution (R = 45, 000) with the IGRINS spectrometer on the GEMINI South telescope. We adopted the fundamental stellar parameters for these stars from Nandakumar et al. (2023a), with Teff ranging from 3400 to 3800 K. With a manual spectral synthesis method, we have derived stellar abundances for 21 elements, namely F, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Na, Al, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb. We demonstrate what elements can be analysed from H- and K-band high-resolution spectra, and we show which spectral lines can be used for abundance analysis, showing them line by line. We discuss the 21 abundance-ratio trends and compared them with those determined from APOGEE and from the optical GILD sample. Especially, we determine the trends of the heavy elements Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb. This opens up these nucleosynthetic channels, including both the s- and the r-process, in dust-obscured populations. The [Mn/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend is shown to be more or less flat at low metallicities, implying that existing NLTE correction are relevant.

 - **Abstract**
 From 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI $\gamma$-ray observations, we derive bounds on annihilating light dark matter particles in the halo of the Milky Way up to masses of about 300 MeV. We test four different spatial templates for the dark matter halo, including a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Einasto, Burkert, and isothermal sphere profile, as well as three different models for the underlying diffuse Inverse Compton emission. We find that the bounds on the s-wave velocity-averaged annihilation cross sections for both the electron-positron and the photon-photon final states are the strongest to date from $\gamma$-ray observations alone in the mass range $\lesssim 6$ MeV. We provide fitting formulae for the upper limits and discuss their dependences on the halo profile. The bounds on the two-photon final state are superseding the limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background in the range of 50 keV up to $\sim 3$ MeV, showing the great potential future MeV mission will have in probing light dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we describe the global on-sky calibration strategy of the LSPE-Strip instrument. Strip is a microwave telescope operating in the Q- and W-bands (central frequencies of 43 and 95 GHz respectively) from the Observatorio del Teide in Tenerife, with the goal to observe and characterise the polarised Galactic foreground emission, and complement the observations of the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background to be performed by the LSPE-SWIPE instrument and other similar experiments operating at higher frequencies to target the detection of the B-mode signal from the inflationary epoch of the Universe. Starting from basic assumptions on some of the instrument parameters (NET, 1/f noise knee frequency, beam properties, observing efficiency) we perform realistic simulations to study the level of accuracy that can be achieved through observations of bright celestial calibrators in the Strip footprint (sky fraction of 30 %) on the determination and characterisation of the main instrument parameters: global and relative gain factors (in intensity and in polarisation), polarisation direction, polarisation efficiency, leakage from intensity to polarisation, beams, window functions and pointing model.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed exoplanet transit spectra are usually retrieved using 1D models to determine atmospheric composition while planetary atmospheres are 3D. With the JWST and future space telescopes such as Ariel, we will be able to obtain increasingly accurate transit spectra. The 3D effects on the spectra will be visible, and we can expect biases in the 1D extractions. In order to elucidate these biases, we have built theoretical observations of transit spectra, from 3D atmospheric modeling through transit modeling to instrument modeling. 3D effects are observed to be strongly nonlinear from the coldest to the hottest planets. These effects also depend on the planet's metallicity and gravity. Considering equilibrium chemistry, 3D effects are observed through very strong variations in certain features of the molecule or very small variations over the whole spectrum. We conclude that we cannot rely on the uncertainty of retrievals at all pressures, and that we must be cautious about the results of retrievals at the top of the atmosphere. However the results are still fairly close to the truth at mid-altitudes (those probed). We also need to be careful with the chemical models used for planetary atmosphere. If the chemistry of one molecule is not correctly described, this will bias all the others, and the retrieved temperature as well. Finally, although fitting a wider wavelength range and higher resolution has been shown to increase retrieval accuracy, we show that this could depend on the wavelength range chosen, due to the accuracy on modeling the different features. In any case, 1D retrievals are still correct for the detection of molecules, even in the event of an erroneous abundance retrieval.

 - **Abstract**
 Color plays a crucial role in the visualization, interpretation, and analysis of multi-wavelength astronomical images. However, generating color images that accurately represent the full dynamic range of astronomical sources is challenging. In response, Gnuastro v0.22 introduces the program 'astscript-color-faint-gray', which is extensively documented in the Gnuastro manual. It employs a non-linear transformation to assign an 8-bit RGB (Red-Green-Blue) value to brighter pixels, while the fainter ones are shown in an inverse grayscale. This approach enables the simultaneous visualization of low surface brightness features within the same image. This research note is reproducible with Maneage, on the Git commit 48f5408.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are natural laboratories to study extreme physics in planetary atmospheres and their rich observational data sets are yet to be confronted with models with varying complexities at a population level. In this work, we update the general circulation model of Tan & Komacek (2019) to include a non-grey radiative transfer scheme and apply it to simulate the realistic thermal structures, phase-dependent spectra, and wavelength-dependent phase curves of UHJs. We performed grids of models over a large range of equilibrium temperatures and rotation periods for varying assumptions, showing that the fractional day-night brightness temperature differences remain almost constant or slightly increase with increasing equilibrium temperature from the visible to mid-infrared wavelengths. This differs from previous work primarily due to the increasing planetary rotation rate with increasing equilibrium temperature for fixed host star type. Radiative effects of varying atmospheric compositions become more significant in dayside brightness temperature in longer wavelengths. Data-model comparisons of dayside brightness temperatures and phase curve amplitudes as a function of equilibrium temperature are in broad agreement. Observations show a large scatter compared to models even with a range of different assumptions, indicating significantly varying intrinsic properties in the hot Jupiter population. Our cloud-free models generally struggle to match all observations for individual targets with a single set of parameter choices, indicating the need for extra processes for understanding the heat transport of UHJs.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs), having orbital period less than 20 years, provide us with an opportunity to observe their activity and analyse the homogeneity in their coma composition over multiple apparitions. Comet 46P/Wirtanen with its exceptionally close approach to Earth during its 2018 apparition offered the possibility for a long-term spectroscopic observations. We used a 1.2 m telescope equipped with a low-resolution spectrograph to monitor the comet's activity and compute the relative abundances in the coma, as a function of heliocentric distance. We report the production rates of four molecules CN, C$_2$, C$_3$ and NH$_2$, and Af$\rho$ parameter, a proxy to the dust production, before and after perihelion. We found that 46P has a typical coma composition with almost constant abundance ratios with respect to CN across the epochs of observation. Comparing the coma composition of comet 46P during the current and previous apparitions, we conclude the comet has a highly homogeneous chemical composition in the nucleus with an enhancement in ammonia abundance compared to the average abundance in comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Red novae are transients powered by collisions of non-compact stars. Among their progenitors are systems of evolved subgiants and giants stars. Remnants of such red novae display bipolar structures which have remarkably close characteristics to many post-AGB or pre-PN systems. It is important to ask (and eventually verify) whether some of the less-known post-main-sequence objects (mis-)classified as pre-PNe can be merger remnants similar to the red nova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 Maneuvering a spacecraft in the cislunar space is a complex problem, since it is highly perturbed by the gravitational influence of both the Earth and the Moon, and possibly also the Sun. Trajectories minimizing the needed fuel are generally preferred in order to decrease the mass of the payload. A classical method to constrain maneuvers is mathematically modelling them using the Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP), defining spacecraft positions at the start and end of the trajectory. Solutions to this problem can then be obtained with optimization techniques like the nonlinear least squares conjugated with the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) to embed the constraints, which recently became an effective method for deducing orbit transfers. In this paper, we propose a tangential velocity (TV) type of constraints to design orbital maneuvers. We show that the technique presented in this paper can be used to transfer a spacecraft (e.g. from the Earth to the Moon) and perform rendezvous maneuvers (e.g. a swing-by with the Moon). In comparison with the TPBVP, solving the TV constraints via TFC offers several advantages, leading to a significant reduction in computational time. Hence, it proves to be an efficient technique to design these maneuvers.

 - **Abstract**
 In Data Release 9 of LAMOST, we present measurements of v sin i for a total of 121,698 stars measured using the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) and 80,108 stars using the Low Resolution Spectrograph (LRS). These values were obtained through a chi^2 minimisation process, comparing LAMOST spectra with corresponding grids of synthetically broadened spectra. Due to the resolution and the spectral range of LAMOST, v sin i measurements are limited to stars with effective temperature (Teff) ranging from 5000 K to 8500 K for MRS and 7000 K to 9000 K for LRS. The detectable v sin i for MRS is set between 27 km/s and 350 km/s , and for LRS between 110 km/s and 350 km/s, This limitation is because the convolved reference spectra become less informative beyond 350 km/s. The intrinsic precisions of v sin i , determined from multi-epoch observations, is approximately 4.0 km/s for MRS and 10.0 km/s for LRS at signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 50. Our v sin i values show consistence with those from APOGEE17, displaying a scatter of 8.79 km/s. They are also in agreement with measurements from the Gaia DR3 and SUN catalogs. An observed trend in LAMOST MRS data is the decrease in v sin i with dropping Teff, particularly transiting around 7000 K for dwarfs and 6500 K for giants, primarily observed in stars with near-solar abundances.
#### Organic chemistry in the H2-bearing, CO-rich interstellar ice layer at  temperatures relevant to dense cloud interiors

 - **Abstract**
 Ice chemistry in the dense, cold interstellar medium (ISM) is probably responsible for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent laboratory experiments performed at T=4 K have shown that irradiation of CO:N2 ice samples analog to the CO-rich interstellar ice layer can contribute to the formation of COMs when H2 molecules are present. We have tested this organic chemistry under a broader range of conditions relevant to the interior of dense clouds by irradiating CO:15N2:H2 ice samples with 2 keV electrons in the 4-15 K temperature range. The H2 ice abundance depended on both, the ice formation temperature and the thermal evolution of the samples. Formation of H-bearing organics such as formaldehyde (H2CO), ketene (C2H2O), and isocyanic acid (H15NCO) was observed upon irradiation of ice samples formed at temperatures up to 10 K, and also in ices formed at 6 K and subsequently warmed up and irradiated at temperatures up to 15 K. These results suggest that a fraction of the H2 molecules in dense cloud interiors might be entrapped in the CO-rich layer of interstellar ice mantles, and that energetic processing of this layer could entail an additional contribution to the formation of COMs in the coldest regions of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the nonlinear growth of bound cosmological structures using the spherical collapse approach in the shift-symmetric Galileon theories. In particular, we focus on the class of models belonging to the Kinetic Gravity Braiding by adopting a general parametrization of the action encoding a large set of models by means of four free parameters: two defining the background evolution and two affecting the perturbations. For the latter we identify their specific signatures on the linearised critical density contrast, nonlinear effective gravitational coupling and the virial overdensity and how they drive their predictions away from $\Lambda$CDM. We then use the results of the spherical collapse model to predict the evolution of the halo mass function. We find that the shift-symmetric model predicts a larger number of objects compared to $\Lambda$CDM for masses $M \gtrsim 10^{14} h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and such number increases for larger deviations from the standard model. Therefore, the shift-symmetric model shows detectable signatures which can be used to distinguish it from the standard scenario.
#### Geometric and thermodynamic characterization of binary neutron star  accretion discs

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks formed in binary neutron star mergers play a central role in many astrophysical processes of interest, including the launching of relativistic jets or the ejection of neutron-rich matter hosting heavy element nucleosynthesis. In this work we analyze in detail the properties of accretion disks from 44 ab initio binary neutron star merger simulations for a large set of nuclear equations of state, binary mass ratios and remnant fates, with the aim of furnishing reliable initial conditions for disk simulations and a comprehensive characterization of their properties. We find that the disks have a significant thermal support, with an aspect ratio decreasing with the mass ratio of the binary from $\sim 0.7$ to 0.3. Even if the disk sample spans a broad range in mass and angular momentum, their ratio is independent from the equation of state and from the mass ratio. This can be traced back to the rotational profile of the disc, characterized by a constant specific angular momentum (as opposed to a Keplerian one) of $3-5 \times 10^{16} \rm ~ cm^2~s^{-1}$. The profiles of the entropy per baryon and of the electron fraction depend on the mass ratio of the binary. For more symmetric binaries, they follow a sigmoidal distribution as a function of the rest mass density, for which we provide a detailed description and a fit. The disk properties discussed in this work can be used as a robust set of initial conditions for future long-term simulations of accretion disks from binary neutron star mergers, posing the basis for a progress in the quantitative study of the outflow properties.
