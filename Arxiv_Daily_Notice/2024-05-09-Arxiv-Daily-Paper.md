          Orbital and Precession Periods in Repeating FRB 20121102A

 - **Abstract**
 Li {\it et al.\/} (2024) reported a 4.605 day period in the repeating FRB 20121102A in addition to the previously reported 157 day modulation of its activity. This note suggests that the shorter period is the orbital period of a mass-transferring star orbiting a black hole, possibly of intermediate mass, and that the 157 day period is the precession period of an accretion disc around the black hole. The mass-losing star must be evolved.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the ASKAP discovery of a new Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G308.73+1.38, which we name Raspberry. This new SNR candidate has an angular size of 20.7 arcmin $\times$ 16.7 arcmin, and we measure a total integrated flux of 407$\pm$50 mJy. We estimate Raspberry's most likely diameter of 10$-$30 pc which would place it at a distance of 3$-$5 kpc, on the near side of the Milky Way's Scutum$-$Centaurus Arm. We also find a Stokes$-$V point source close to the centre of Raspberry with a $\sim$5$\sigma$ significance. This point source may be the remaining compact source, a neutron star, or possibly a pulsar, formed during the initial supernova event.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We initiate the LISA template databank for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds sourced by cosmic strings. We include two templates, an analytical template, which enables more flexible searches, and a numerical template derived directly from large Nambu-Goto simulations of string networks. Using searches based on these templates, we forecast the parameter space within the reach of the experiment and the precision with which their parameters will be reconstructed, provided a signal is observed. The reconstruction permits probing the Hubble expansion and new relativistic DoF in the early universe. We quantify the impact that astrophysical foregrounds can have on these searches. Finally, we discuss the impact that these observations would have on our understanding of the fundamental models behind the string networks. Overall, we prove that LISA has great potential for probing cosmic string models and may reach tensions as low as $G\mu =10^{-16} - 10^{-17} $, which translates into energy scales of the order $10^{11}~\text{GeV}$.

          Comprehensive view on a $z\sim6.5$ radio-loud QSO: from the radio to the optical/NIR to the X-ray band

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength analysis, from the radio to the X-ray band, of the redshift $z=6.44$ VIK J2318$-$31 radio-loud (RL) quasi stellar object (QSO), one of the most distant currently known in this class. The work is based on newly obtained (uGMRT, ATCA, Chandra) as well as archival (GNIRS and X-Shooter) dedicated observations that have not been published yet. Based on the observed X-ray and radio emission, its relativistic jets are likely young and misaligned from our line of sight. Moreover, we can confirm, with simultaneous observations, the presence of a turnover in the radio spectrum at $\nu_{\rm peak} \sim 650$ MHz which is unlikely to be associated with self-synchrotron absorption. From the NIR spectrum we derived the mass of the central black hole, M$_{\rm BH}=8.1^{+6.8}_{-5.6} \times 10^8 {\rm M_{\odot}}$, and the Eddington ratio, $\lambda_{\rm EDD} = 0.8^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$, using broad emission lines as well as an accretion disc model fit to the continuum emission. Given the high accretion rate, the presence of a $\sim$8$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ black hole at $z=6.44$ can be explained by a seed black hole ($\sim$10$^{4}$ M$_\odot$) that formed at $z\sim25$, assuming a radiative efficiency $\eta_{\rm d}\sim0.1$. However, by assuming $\eta_{\rm d}\sim0.3$, as expected for jetted systems, the mass observed would challenge current theoretical models of black hole formation.

          White dwarf eccentricity fluctuation and dissipation by AGB convection

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions have typical eccentricities $e\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. The eccentricities of helium white dwarfs are explained well by applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to convective eddies in their red giant progenitors. We extend this theory to more massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitors. Due to the radiation pressure in AGB stars, the dominant factor in determining the remnant white dwarf's eccentricity is the critical residual hydrogen envelope mass $m_{\rm env}$ required to inflate the star to giant proportions. Using a suite of MESA stellar evolution simulations with $\Delta m_{\rm c}=10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ core-mass intervals, we resolved the AGB thermal pulses and found that the critical $m_{\rm env}\propto m_{\rm c}^{-6}$. This steep dependence causes the $e(m_{\rm c})$ relation to turn over, such that $e\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ almost independently of the remnant CO white dwarf's mass $m_{\rm c}$. Nearly all of the measured eccentricities lie below this robust theoretical limit, indicating that the eccentricity is damped during the common-envelope inspiral that follows the unstable Roche-lobe overflow of the AGB star. Specifically, we focused on white dwarfs with median masses $m_{\rm c}>0.6\,{\rm M}_\odot$. These massive white dwarfs begin their inspiral with practically identical orbital periods and eccentricities, eliminating any dependence on the initial conditions. For this sub-sample, we find an empirical relation $e\propto P^{3/2}$ between the final period and eccentricity that is much tighter than previous studies - motivating theoretical work on the eccentricity evolution during the common envelope phase.

          ATClean: A Novel Method for Detecting Low-Luminosity Transients and Application to Pre-explosion Counterparts from SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 In an effort to search for faint sources of emission over arbitrary timescales, we present a novel method for analyzing forced photometry light curves in difference imaging from optical surveys. Our method "ATLAS Clean'' or ATClean, utilizes the reported fluxes, uncertainties, and fits to the point-spread function from difference images to quantify the statistical significance of individual measurements. We apply this method to control light curves across the image to determine whether any source of flux is present in the data for a range of specific timescales. From ATLAS $o$-band imaging at the site of the Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101 from 2015--2023, we show that this method accurately reproduces the 3$\sigma$ flux limits produced from other, more computationally expensive methods. We derive limits for emission on timescales of 5~days and 80-300~days at the site of SN\,2023ixf, which are 19.8 and 21.3~mag, respectively. The latter limits rule out variability for unextinguished red supergiants (RSG) with initial masses $>$22~$M_{\odot}$, comparable to the most luminous predictions for the SN 2023ixf progenitor system. We also compare our limits to short timescale outbursts, similar to those expected for Type IIn SN progenitor stars or the Type II SN 2020tlf, and rule out outburst ejecta masses of $>$0.021~$M_{\odot}$, much lower than the inferred mass of circumstellar matter around SN 2023ixf in the literature. In the future, these methods can be applied to any forced point-spread function photometry on difference imaging from other surveys, such as Rubin optical imaging.

          Design and Performance of 30/40 GHz Diplexed Focal Plane for BICEP Array

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate a wide-band diplexed focal plane suitable for observing low-frequency foregrounds that are important for cosmic microwave background polarimetry. The antenna elements are composed of slotted bowtie antennas with 60% bandwidth that can be partitioned into two bands. Each pixel is composed of two interleaved 12$\times$12 pairs of linearly polarized antenna elements forming a phased array, designed to synthesize a symmetric beam with no need for focusing optics. The signal from each antenna element is captured in-phase and uniformly weighted by a microstrip summing tree. The antenna signal is diplexed into two bands through the use of two complementary, six-pole Butterworth filters. This filter architecture ensures a contiguous impedance match at all frequencies, and thereby achieves minimal reflection loss between both bands. Subsequently, out-of-band rejection is increased with a bandpass filter and the signal is then deposited on a transition-edge sensor bolometer island. We demonstrate the performance of this focal plane with two distinct bands, 30 and 40 GHz, each with a bandwidth of $\sim$20 and 15 GHz, respectively. The unequal bandwidths between the two bands are caused by an unintentional shift in diplexer frequency from its design values. The end-to-end optical efficiency of these detectors are relatively modest, at 20-30%, with an efficiency loss due to an unknown impedance mismatch in the summing tree. Far-field beam maps show good optical characteristics with edge pixels having no more than $\sim$ 5% ellipticity and $\sim$10-15% peak-to-peak differences for A-B polarization pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present TRACE, a time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom-Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez and Dehnen (2023). In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 13x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 20x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 47x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic PeVatrons are sources that can accelerate cosmic rays to PeV energies. The high-energy cosmic rays are expected to interact with the surrounding ambient material or radiation, resulting in the production of gamma rays and neutrinos. To optimize for the detection of such associated production of gamma rays and neutrinos for a given source morphology and spectrum, a multi-messenger analysis that combines gamma rays and neutrinos is required. In this study, we use the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) with IceCube Maximum Likelihood Analysis software (i3mla) and HAWC Accelerated Likelihood (HAL) to search for a correlation between 22 known gamma-ray sources from the third HAWC gamma-ray catalog and 14 years of IceCube track-like data. No significant neutrino emission from the direction of the HAWC sources was found. We report the best-fit gamma-ray model and 90% CL neutrino flux limit from the 22 sources. From the neutrino flux limit, we conclude that the gamma-ray emission from five of the sources can not be produced purely from hadronic interactions. We report the limit for the fraction of gamma rays produced by hadronic interactions for these five sources.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the origins of GW230529, delving into its formation from massive stars within isolated binary systems. Utilizing population synthesis models, we present compelling evidence that the neutron star component forms first. However, the event's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces complexities in identifying the underlying physical mechanisms driving its formation. Augmenting our analysis with insights from numerical relativity, we estimate the final black hole mass and spin to be approximately $5.3 M_\odot$ and $0.53$, respectively. Furthermore, we employ the obtained posterior samples to calculate the ejecta mass and kilonova light curves resulting from r-process nucleosynthesis. We find the ejecta mass to range within $0-0.06 M_{\odot}$, contingent on the neutron star equation of state. The peak brightness of the kilonovae light curves indicates that targeted follow-up observations with a Rubin-like observatory may have detected this emission.

          Observation uncertainty effects on the precision of interior planetary parameters

 - **Abstract**
 Determining compositions of low-mass exoplanets is essential in understanding their origins. The certainty by which masses and radius are measured affects our ability to discern planets that are rocky or volatile rich. In this study, we aim to determine sound observational strategies to avoid diminishing returns. We quantify how uncertainties in mass, radius and model assumptions propagate into errors in inferred compositions of rocky and water planets. For a target error in a planet's iron-mass fraction or water content, we calculate the corresponding required accuracies in radius and mass. For instance, a rocky planet with a known radius error of 2% (corresponding to TESS detection best errors) demands mass precision to be at 5-11% to attain a 8 wt% precision in iron-mass fraction, regardless of mass. Similarly, a water world of equal radius precision requires 9-20% mass precision to confine the water content within a 10 wt% margin. Lighter planets are more difficult to constrain, especially water-rich versus water-poor worlds. Studying Earth as an exoplanet, we find a $\sim \pm5$ point "error floor" in iron-mass fraction and $\sim \pm7$ in core-mass fraction from our lack of knowledge on mineralogy. The results presented here can quickly guide observing strategies to maximize insights into small exoplanet compositions while avoiding over-observing.

          Energy and temperature dependencies for electron-induced sputtering from H$_2$O-ice: Implications for the icy Galilean moons

 - **Abstract**
 To better assess the role that electrons play in exosphere production on icy-rich bodies, we measured the total and O$_2$ sputtering yields from H$_2$O-ice for electrons with energies between 0.75 and 10 keV and temperatures between 15 and 124.5 K. We find that both total and O$_2$ yields increase with decreasing energy over our studied range, increase rapidly at temperatures above 60 K, and that the relative amount of H$_2$O in the sputtered flux decreases quickly with increasing energy. Combining our data with other electron data in literature, we show that the accuracy of a widely used sputtering model can be improved significantly for electrons by adjusting some of the intrinsic parameter values. Applying our results to Europa, we estimate that electrons contribute to the production of the O$_2$ exosphere equally to all ion types combined. In contrast, sputtering of O$_2$ from Ganymede and Callisto appears to be dominated by irradiating ions, though electrons still likely contribute a non-negligible amount. While our estimates could be further refined by examining the importance of spatial variations in electron flux, we conclude that, at the very least, electrons seem to be important for exosphere production on icy surfaces and should be included in future modeling efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the list of variable stars we found in the \kep\ superstamp data covering approximately nine arcminutes from the central region of NGC6819. This is a continuation of our work presented by Sanjayan et al.(2022a). We classified the variable stars based on the variability type and we established their cluster membership based on the available Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry. Our search revealed 385 variable stars but only 128 were found to be cluster members. In the case of eclipsing and contact binaries we calculated the mid-times of eclipses and derived ephemerides. We searched for eclipse timing variation using the observed minus calculated diagrams. Only five objects show significant orbital period variation. We used isochrones calculated within the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks project and derived the average age (2.54 Gyr), average distance (2.3 kpc) and iron content [Fe/H] = -0.01(2), of NGC6819. We confirm this distance by the one derived from Gaia astrometry of the cluster members with membership probabilities greater than 0.9.

          Modeling and performance analysis of Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with two deformable mirrors applied to the Roman Coronagraph

 - **Abstract**
 High-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) is key to create a dark hole region within the coronagraphic image plane where high contrasts are achieved. The Roman Coronagraph is expected to perform its HOWFSC with a ground-in-the-loop scheme due to the computational complexity of the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) algorithm. This scheme provides the flexibility to alter the HOWFSC algorithm for given science objectives. The baseline HOWFSC scheme involves running EFC while observing a bright star such as {\zeta} Puppis to create the initial dark hole followed by a slew to the science target. The new implicit EFC (iEFC) algorithm removes the optical diffraction model from the controller, making the final contrast independent of model accuracy. While previously demonstrated with a single DM, iEFC is extended to two deformable mirror systems in order to create annular dark holes. The algorithm is then applied to the Wide-Field-of-View Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC-WFOV) mode designed for the Roman Space Telescope using end-to-end physical optics models. Initial monochromatic simulations demonstrate the efficacy of iEFC as well as the optimal choice of modes for the SPC-WFOV instrument. Further simulations with a 3.6% wavefront control bandpass and a broader 10% bandpass then demonstrate that iEFC can be used in broadband scenarios to achieve contrasts below 1E-8 with Roman. Finally, an EMCCD model is implemented to estimate calibration times and predict the controller's performance. Here, 1E-8 contrasts are achieved with a calibration time of about 6.8 hours assuming the reference star is {\zeta} Puppis. The results here indicate that iEFC can be a valid HOWFSC method that can mitigate the risk of model errors associated with space-borne coronagraphs, but to maximize iEFC performance, lengthy calibration times will be required to mitigate the noise accumulated during calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational constraints on time-varying dark energy ({\it e.g.}, quintessence) are commonly presented on a $w_0$-$w_a$ plot that assumes the equation of state of dark energy strictly satisfies $w(z)= w_0+ w_a z/(1+z)$ as a function of the redshift $z$. Recent observations favor a sector of the $w_0$-$w_a$ plane in which $w_0 > -1$ and $w_0+w_a< -1$, suggesting that the equation of state underwent a transition from violating the null energy condition (NEC) at large $z$ to obeying it at small $z$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this impression is misleading by showing that simple quintessence models satisfying the NEC for all $z$ predict an observational preference for the same sector. We also find that quintessence models that best fit observational data can predict a value for the dark energy equation of state at present that is significantly different from the best-fit value of $w_0$ obtained assuming the parameterization above. In addition, the analysis reveals an approximate degeneracy of the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameterization that explains the eccentricity and orientation of the likelihood contours presented in recent observational studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Supergiant shells (SGSs) are the largest interstellar structures where heated and enriched gas flows into the host galaxy's halo. The SGSs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are so close that their stars can be resolved with ground-based telescopes to allow studies of star formation history. Aiming to study the star formation history and energy budget of LMC 4, we have conducted a pilot study of the cluster NGC 2021 and the OB associations in its vicinity near the south rim of LMC 4. We use the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey data of the LMC to establish a methodology to examine the stellar population and assess the massive star formation history. We find a radial procession of massive star formation from the northwest part of the OB association LH79 through NGC 2021 to the OB association LH78 in the south. Using the stellar content of NGC 2021 and the assumption of Salpeter's initial mass function, we estimate that $\sim$4 supernovae have occurred in NGC 2021, injecting at least $4\times10^{51}$ ergs of kinetic energy into the interior of LMC 4.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of temporal properties of variable sources can elucidate their physical processes. In this context, we present a critical study comparing three approaches to periodic or quasiperiodic behavior: Gaussian process, power spectrum, and wavelet analysis, using celerite, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and weighted wavelet-Z transforms, respectively. We use 15 Swift-X-ray Telescope light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) as examples. A comprehensive analysis of two sGRB X-ray light curves is performed. The results reveal the importance of artifacts, largely in the form of false quasiperiodic oscillation signals, possibly introduced by preprocessing (such as detrending) or other aspects of the analysis. The exploration described in this paper can be helpful for future studies of variability in GRBs, active galactic nuclei, and other astronomical sources.

          Scattering of Giant Planets and Implications for the Origin of the Hierarchical and Eccentric Two-planet System GJ 1148

 - **Abstract**
 The GJ 1148 system has two Saturn-mass planets orbiting around an M dwarf star on hierarchical and eccentric orbits, with orbital period ratio of 13 and eccentricities of both planets of 0.375. The inner planet is in the regime of eccentric warm Jupiters. We perform numerical experiments to study the planet-planet scattering scenario for the origin of this orbital architecture. We consider a third planet of $0.1 M_J$ (Jupiter's mass) in the initial GJ 1148 system with initial orbital separations of 3.5, 4, and 4.5 mutual Hill radii and initial semimajor axis of the innermost planet in the range of 0.10-0.50 au. The majority of scattering results in planet-planet collisions, followed by planet ejections, and planet-star close approaches. Among them, only planet ejections produce eccentric and widely separated two-planet systems, with some having similar orbital properties to the GJ 1148 system. We also examine the effects of general relativistic apsidal precession and a higher mass of $0.227 M_J$ for the third planet. The simulation results suggest that the GJ 1148 system may have lost a giant planet. We also perform simulations of the general problem of the origin of warm Jupiters by planet-planet scattering. As in the GJ 1148 simulations, a nontrivial number of stable two-planet systems are produced by ejection, which disagrees with the result from a previous study showing that two-planet systems arise exclusively through planet-planet collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years astronomical surveys have expanded the reach of planetary science into the realm of small and dense extrasolar worlds. These share a number of characteristics with the terrestrial and icy planetary objects of the Solar System, but keep stretching previous understanding of the known limits of planetary thermodynamics, material properties, and climate regimes. Improved compositional and thermal constraints on exoplanets below $\sim$2 Earth radii suggest efficient accretion of atmosphere-forming volatile elements in a fraction of planetary systems, pointing to rapid formation, planet-scale melting, and chemical equilibration between the core, mantle, and atmosphere of rocky and volatile-rich exoplanets. Meaningful interpretation of novel observational data from these worlds necessitates cross-disciplinary expansion of known material properties under extreme thermodynamic, non-solar conditions, and accounting for dynamic feedbacks between interior and atmospheric processes. Exploration of the atmosphere and surface composition of individual, short-period super-Earths in the next few years will enable key inferences on magma ocean dynamics, the redox state of rocky planetary mantles, and mixing between volatile and refractory phases in planetary regimes that are absent from the present-day Solar System, and reminiscent of the conditions of the prebiotic Earth. The atmospheric characterization of climate diversity and the statistical search for biosignatures on terrestrial exoplanets on temperate orbits will require space-based direct imaging surveys, capable of resolving emission features of major and trace gases in both shortwave and mid-infrared wavelengths.

          The utility of infrasound in global monitoring of extraterrestrial impacts: A case study of the 23 July 2008 Tajikistan bolide

 - **Abstract**
 Among various observational techniques used for detection of large bolides on a global scale is a low frequency sound known as infrasound. Infrasound, which is also one of the four sensing modalities used by the International Monitoring System (IMS), offers continuous global monitoring, and can be leveraged towards planetary defense. Infrasonic records can provide an additional dimension for event characterization and a distinct perspective that might not be available through any other observational method. This paper describes infrasonic detection and characterization of the bolide that disintegrated over Tajikistan on 23 July 2008. This event was detected by two infrasound stations at distances of 1530 and 2130 km. Propagation paths to one of the stations were not predicted by the model despite being clearly detected. The presence of the signal is attributed to the acoustic energy being trapped in a weak but leaky stratospheric AtmoSOFAR channel. The infrasound signal analysis indicates that the shock originated at the point of the main breakup at an altitude of 35 km. The primary mode of shock production of the signal detected at the two stations was a spherical blast resulting from the main gross fragmentation episode. The energy estimate, based on the signal period, is 0.17-0.51 kt of TNT equivalent, suggesting a mass of 6.6-23.5 tons. The corresponding object radius, assuming the chondritic origin, was 0.78-1.18 m.

          A MeerKAT Polarization Survey of Southern Calibration Sources

 - **Abstract**
 We report on full-Stokes L-band observations of 98 MeerKAT calibration sources. Linear polarization is detected in 71 objects above a fractional level of 0.2\%. We identify ten sources with strong fractional linear polarization and low Faraday Rotation Measure that could be suitable for wide-band absolute polarization calibration. We detect significant circular polarization from 24\% of the sample down to a detection level of 0.07\%. Circularly polarized emission is seen only for flat spectrum sources $\alpha > -0.5$. We compare our polarized intensities and Faraday Synthesis results to data from the NVSS at 1400\,MHz and the ATCA SPASS survey at 2300\,MHz. NVSS data exists for 54 of our sources and SPASS data for 20 sources. The percent polarization and Rotation Measures from both surveys agree well with our results. The residual instrumental linear polarization for these observations is measured at 0.16\% and the residual instrumental circular polarization is measured at 0.05\%. These levels may reflect either instabilities in the relative bandpass between the two polarization channels with either time or antenna orientation, or atmospheric/ionospheric variations with pointing direction. Tracking of the hourly gain solutions on J0408-6545 after transfer of the primary gain solutions suggests a deterioration of the gain stability by a factor of several starting about two hours after sunrise. This suggests that observing during the nighttime could dramatically improve the precision of polarization calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing is a competitive tool to probe the dark matter and energy content of the universe. However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders both quantities effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and further that any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight. There is evidence to indicate that the probability of strong lensing is higher towards overdense lines of sight, and this could result in a small systematic bias towards overestimations of $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The architecture and masses of planetary systems in the habitable zone could be strongly influenced by outer giant planets, if present. We investigate here the impact of outer giants on terrestrial planet formation, under the assumption that the final assembly of the planetary system is set by a giant impact phase. Utilizing a state-of-the-art N-body simulation software, GENGA, we interpret how the late stage of terrestrial planet formation results in diversity within planetary systems. We design two global model setups: in the first we place a gas giant on the outer side of planetesimals and embryos disk, while the other only has planetesimals and embryos but no giant. For the model including the outer giant, we study the effect of different giant initial masses, in the range 1.0-3.0 Jupiter mass, and orbital radii, in the range 2.0-5.8 AU.We also study the influence of different initial positions of planetesimals and embryos on the results. Our N-body simulation time is approximately 50 Myr. The results show that the existence of outer giant will promote the interaction between planetesimals and embryos, making the orbits of the formed terrestrial planets more compact, but placing the giant planet too close to the planetesimals and embryos disk suppresses the formation of massive rocky planets. In addition, under the classical theory, where planetary embryos and planetesimals collide to form terrestrial planets, our results show that the presence of a giant planet actually decreases the gap complexity of the inner planetary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern photometric surveys of the sky suggest that many, perhaps most supernovae (SNe) associated with the explosion of massive stars are influenced at an appreciable level by their interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). The photometric and spectroscopic diversity of these transients point to a wide range of CSM properties in terms of mass, extent, composition, and location relative to the exploding star, suggesting progenitors that cover from standard to the most extreme mass loss rates. Surveys at high-cadence catch massive stars at shock breakout and inform us on the immediate mass loss history before core collapse. In contrast, long-term monitoring of these SNe cover the transition to the birth of a SN remnant and document the progenitor mass loss that took place centuries to millennia before explosion. Interacting SNe are therefore not just extraordinary astrophysical laboratories to study radiation-dominated shocks and probe the distant Universe, they also open the path to novel and fundamental studies on stellar evolution, stellar stability, or mass loss in single and binary massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 There are two contradictory views of the eROSITA bubbles: either a 10 kpc-scale pair of giant bubbles blown by the Galactic center (GC), or a 100 pc-scale local structure coincidentally located in the direction of GC. A key element of this controversy is the distance to the bubbles. Based on the 3D dust distribution in the Galactic plane, we found three isolated, distant (500-800 pc) clouds at intermediate Galactic latitudes. Their projected morphologies perfectly match the X-ray shadows on the defining features of the north eROSITA bubble, i.e., the North Polar Spur (NPS) and the Lotus Petal Cloud (LPC), indicating that both the NPS and LPC are distant with a distance lower limit of nearly 1kpc. In the X-ray dark region between the NPS and LPC, we found a few polarized radio arcs and attributed them to the bubble's shock front. These arcs match up perfectly with the outer border of the NPS and LPC and provide a way to define the bubble's border. The border defined in this way can be well described by the line-of-sight tangent of a 3D skewed cup model rooted in the GC. We conclude that, instead of being two independent, distant features, NPS and LPC compose a single, giant bubble, which, therefore, is most plausibly a 10-kpc scale bubble rooted at the GC.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in the unified description of the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy that accommodates both scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories. The boundaries of different classes of theories are universally parameterised by a new EFT parameter $\alpha_V$ characterising the vectorial nature of dark energy and a set of consistency relations associated with the global/local shift symmetry. After implementing the equations of motion in a Boltzmann code, as a demonstration, we compute the CMB power spectrum based on the $w$CDM background with the EFT parameterisation of perturbations and a concrete Horndeski/generalised Proca theory. We show that the vectorial nature generically prevents modifications of gravity in the CMB spectrum. On the other hand, while the shift symmetry is less significant in the perturbation equations unless the background is close to the $\Lambda$CDM, it requires that the effective equation of state of dark energy is in the phantom region $w_{\rm DE}<-1$. The latter is particularly interesting in light of the latest result of the DESI+CMB combination as the observational verification of $w_{\rm DE}>-1$ can rule out shift-symmetric theories including vector-tensor theories in one shot.

          The forest at EndEoR: The effect of Lyman Limit Systems on the End of Reionisation

 - **Abstract**
 The final stages of cosmic reionisation (EndEoR) are expected to be strongly regulated by the residual neutral hydrogen in the already ionised regions of the Universe. Its presence limits the mean distance that ionising photons can travel and hence, the extent of the regions that sources of ionising photons can affect. The structures containing most of this residual neutral hydrogen are typically unresolved in large-scale simulations of reionisation. Here, we investigate and compare a range of approaches for including the effect of these small-scale absorbers, also known as Lyman limit systems (LLS), in such simulations. We evaluate the impact of these different approaches on the reionisation history, the evolution of the ultraviolet background, and its fluctuations. We also compare to observational results on the distribution of Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity towards the EndEoR and the measured mean free path of ionising photons. We further consider their effect on the 21-cm power spectrum. We find that although each of the different approaches can match some of the observed probes of the final stages of reionisation, only the use of a redshift-dependent and position-dependent LLS model is able to reproduce all of them. We therefore recommend that large-scale reionisation simulations, which aim to describe both the state of the ionised and neutral intergalactic medium use such an approach, although the other, simpler approaches are applicable depending on the science goal of the simulation.

          Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries

 - **Abstract**
 There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a major component of Galactic emission in the frequency band 10 to 60 GHz and is commonly modelled as rapidly rotating spinning dust grains. The photodissociation region (PDR) at the boundary of the $\lambda$-Orionis Hii region has been identified by several recent analyses as one of the brightest spinning dust emitting sources in the sky. We investigate the Barnard 30 dark cloud, a dark cloud embedded within the $\lambda$-Orionis PDR. We use total-power observations of Barnard 30 from the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) pathfinder instrument at 26 to 34GHz with a resolution of 4.5 arcminutes alongside existing data from Planck, WISE, IRAS, ACT, and the 1.447GHz GALFACTS survey. We use aperture photometry and template fitting to measure the spectral energy distribution of Barnard 30. We find that the spinning dust is the dominant emission component in the 26 to 34GHz range at the $7 \sigma$ level ($S_{30GHz} = 2.85\pm0.43$Jy). We find no evidence that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the preferred carrier for the spinning dust emission, suggesting that the spinning dust carriers are due to a mixed population of very small grains. Finally, we find evidence for variations in spinning dust emissivity and peak frequency within Barnard 30, and that these variations are possibly driven by changes in dust grain population and the total radiation field. Confirming the origin of the variations in the spinning dust spectrum will require both future COMAP observations at 15GHz combined with spectroscopic mid-infrared data of Barnard 30.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations -- and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations -- provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze primordial tensor perturbations using the latest cosmic microwave background and gravitational waves data, focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and the tensor spectral tilt, $n_t$. Utilizing data from Planck PR4, BICEP/Keck, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to provide robust constraints on these parameters. Our results indicate more conservative upper limits for $r$ with profile likelihoods compared to Bayesian credible intervals, highlighting the influence of prior selection and volume effects. The profile likelihood for $n_t$ shows that the current data do not provide sufficient information to derive quantitative bounds, unless extra assumptions on $r$ are used. Additionally, we conduct a 2D profile likelihood analysis of $r$ and $n_t$, indicating a closer agreement between both statistical methods for the largest values of $r$. This study not only updates our understanding of the tensor perturbations but also highlights the importance of employing both statistical methods to explore less constrained parameters, crucial for future explorations in cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled approximately 5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. The pristine nature of Ryugu makes the returned samples ideal for constraining the composition of the Solar System. However, some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements in the returned materials studied so far, most likely due to the presence of aqueously formed secondary minerals (e.g., carbonates, phosphates) in Ryugu. Therefore, the estimation of the Solar System composition using currently available Ryugu data is challenging due to the so-called nugget effect of carbonates, phosphates, and possibly other accessory minerals. The nugget effect can be mitigated by analyzing a homogenized, relatively large amount of sample. We estimate that for approximately 0.1 g of Ryugu sample, the dispersion (2SD) of the bulk Mn/Cr and Rb/Sr ratios are +/-13% and +/-15%, respectively, while they will be improved to be better than +/-5% for approximately 1 g of homogenized Ryugu sample. To further constrain the Solar System composition and to evaluate if previous estimates based on CI chondrites stored in museums for decades to centuries are reliable, it is strongly recommended to determine the chemical and isotopic compositions of Ryugu using a homogenized sample prepared from relatively large (approx. 1 g) returned material. Determining Ryugu reference compositions will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.

 We present a multi-wavelength (1.16$\mu$m-2.37$\mu$m) view of the debris disk around BD+45$^\circ$598, using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system paired with the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph. With an assumed age of 23 Myr, this source allows us to study the early evolution of debris disks and search for forming planets. We fit a scattered light model to our disk using a differential evolution algorithm, and constrain its geometry. We find the disk to have a peak density radius of $R_0 = 109.6$ au, an inclination of $i = 88.1^\circ$, and position angle $PA = 111.0^\circ$. While we do not detect a substellar companion in the disk, our calculated contrast limits indicate sensitivity to planets as small as $\sim 10 M_{\rm Jup}$ at a projected separation of 12 au of the star, and as small as $\sim 4 M_{\rm Jup}$ beyond 38 au. When measuring intensity as a function of wavelength, the disk color constrains the minimum dust grain size within a range of $\sim0.13$ to 1.01$\mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 110067 is the brightest star known to have six transiting planets. Each adjacent pair of planets has a period ratio that is nearly equal to a ratio of small integers, suggesting the planets are in a chain of mean-motion resonances, but the limited timespan of the available data has prevented firm conclusions. Here, we show that the requirement of long-term dynamical stability implies that all six planets are very likely to form a resonant chain. Dynamical simulations of non-resonant systems with initial conditions compatible with the available data almost always suffer an instability within $25$ Myr ($\sim 0.3 \%$ of the system's age). Assuming the system is in resonance, we place upper limits on the planets' eccentricities, and lower limits on the masses of the planets that have not yet been measured. We also predict the characteristics of transit timing variations and the values of the three-body libration centers.

 A statistical analysis of the impact of the diminishing number of operational shutters experienced by the JWST/NIRSpec Micro Shutter Array since Commissioning is presented. It is shown that the number of high priority science targets that NIRSpec is able to observe simultaneously has so far decreased by 3.1%. Of greater concern, however, is NIRSpec's diminished ability to carry out autonomous MSATA target acquisition, which is more sensitive to the loss of shutters than is the multiplexing. In the flagship case of MSA observations of deep fields, the number of pointings at which it is not possible to reach the required minimum number of 5 Valid Reference Stars has increased from 4.9% to 6.3% and is beginning to become noticeable. Similarly, the number of higher risk target acquisitions that need to be carried out with fewer than the maximum allowed number of 8 Reference Stars has grown from 27% to 31%.
