#### Unveiling MOA-2007-BLG-192: An M Dwarf Hosting a Likely Super-Earth

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high angular resolution images of the microlensing target MOA-2007-BLG-192 using Keck adaptive optics and the Hubble Space Telescope. The planetary host star is robustly detected as it separates from the background source star in nearly all of the Keck and Hubble data. The amplitude and direction of the lens-source separation allows us to break a degeneracy related to the microlensing parallax and source radius crossing time. Thus, we are able to reduce the number of possible solutions by a factor of ${\sim}2$, demonstrating the power of high angular resolution follow-up imaging for events with sparse light curve coverage. Following Bennett et al. 2023, we apply constraints from the high resolution imaging on the light curve modeling to find host star and planet masses of $M_{\textrm{host}} = 0.28 \pm 0.04M_{\odot}$ and $m_p = 12.49^{+65.47}_{-8.03}M_{\oplus}$ at a distance from Earth of $D_L = 2.16 \pm 0.30\,$kpc. This work illustrates the necessity for the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to use its own high resolution imaging to inform light curve modeling for microlensing planets that the mission discovers.

 - **Abstract**
 The rise of synoptic sky surveys has ushered in an era of big data in time-domain astronomy, making data science and machine learning essential tools for studying celestial objects. Tree-based (e.g. Random Forests) and deep learning models represent the current standard in the field. We explore the use of different distance metrics to aid in the classification of objects. For this, we developed a new distance metric based classifier called DistClassiPy. The direct use of distance metrics is an approach that has not been explored in time-domain astronomy, but distance-based methods can aid in increasing the interpretability of the classification result and decrease the computational costs. In particular, we classify light curves of variable stars by comparing the distances between objects of different classes. Using 18 distance metrics applied to a catalog of 6,000 variable stars in 10 classes, we demonstrate classification and dimensionality reduction. We show that this classifier meets state-of-the-art performance but has lower computational requirements and improved interpretability. We have made DistClassiPy open-source and accessible at https://pypi.org/project/distclassipy/ with the goal of broadening its applications to other classification scenarios within and beyond astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform simulations here that include the gravitational effects of the primordial planetesimal belt consisting of ~10^5 massive bodies. In our simulations, Neptune unlocks from resonance with the other giant planets and begins to migrate outward due to interactions with planetesimals before a planetary orbital instability is triggered, and afterward, residual Neptunian migration completes the formation of the modern Kuiper belt. Our present work exhibits a number of notable differences from prior work. First, Neptune's planetary resonance unlocking requires the Neptunian 3:2 mean motion resonance to sweep much of the primordial disk interior to 30 au prior to the giant planet instability. The pre-instability population of planetesimals is consequently lower in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination, and this effect persists after the instability. Second, direct scattering between Pluto-mass bodies and other small bodies removes material from Neptunian resonances more efficiently than resonant dropout resulting from small changes in Neptune's semimajor axis during scattering between Pluto-mass bodies and Neptune. Thus, the primordial population of Pluto-mass bodies may be as few as ~200 objects. Finally, our simulation end states display a wide variety of orbital distributions, and clear relationships between final bulk Kuiper belt properties and Neptune's migration or initial planetesimal properties largely elude us. In particular, we find that the rapid, stochastic planetary orbital evolution occurring during the giant planet instability can significantly alter final Kuiper belt properties such as its inclination dispersion and the prominence of resonant populations. This complicates using modern Kuiper belt properties to confidently constrain early solar system events and conditions, including planetary orbital migration and the primordial Kuiper belt's characteristics.
#### The environment around young eruptive stars. SPHERE/IRDIS polarimetric  imaging of 7 protostars

 - **Abstract**
 Eruptive stars are a class of young stellar objects that show an abrupt increase in their luminosity. These burst-like episodes are thought to dominate the stellar accretion process during the class 0/class I stage. We present an overview of a survey of seven episodically accreting protostars aimed at studying their potentially complex circumstellar surroundings. The observations were performed with the instrument SPHERE, mounted at the VLT. We observed the eruptive stars in $H$-band with the near-infrared imager IRDIS and used the polarimeter to extract the polarized light scattered from the stars' surroundings. We produced polarized light images for three FUor objects, Z CMa, V960 Mon, and FU Ori, and four EXor objects, XZ Tau, UZ Tau, NY Ori, and EX Lup. We calculated the intrinsic polarization fraction for all the observed stars. In all systems we registered scattered light from around the primary star. FU Ori and V960 Mon are surrounded by complex structures including spiral-like features. In Z CMa, we detected a point source 0.7 arcsec to the northeast of the primary. Based on the astrometric measurements from archival Keck/NIRC2 data, we find this source to be a third member of the system. Further, Z CMa displays an outflow extending thousands of au. Unlike the other EXor objects in our sample, XZ Tau shows bright, extended scattered light structures, also associated with an outflow on a scale of hundreds of au. The other EXors show relatively faint disk-like structures in the immediate vicinity of the coronagraph. Asymmetric arms were only found around FUor objects, while faint disks seem to predominantly occur around EXors. Importantly, for Z CMa the detection of the faint extended structure questions previous interpretations of the system's dynamic state. The streamer which was associated with a fly-by object turned out to be part of a huge outflow extending 6000 au.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a machine-learning-based model for the total density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M \gtrsim 7\times 10^8\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The model is based on an interpretable variational encoder (IVE) which returns the independent factors of variation in the density profiles within a low-dimensional representation, as well as the predictions for the density profiles themselves. The IVE returns accurate and unbiased predictions on all radial ranges, including the outer region profile where the subhaloes experience tidal stripping; here its fit accuracy exceeds that of the commonly used Einasto profile. The IVE discovers three independent degrees of freedom in the profiles, which can be interpreted in terms of the formation history of the subhaloes. In addition to the two parameters controlling the normalization and inner shape of the profile, the IVE discovers a third parameter that accounts for the impact of tidal stripping onto the subhalo outer profile; this parameter is sensitive to the mass loss experienced by the subhalo after its infall onto its parent halo. Baryonic physics in the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model does not impact the number of degrees of freedom identified in the profile compared to the pure dark matter expectations, nor their physical interpretation. Our newly proposed profile fit can be used in strong lensing analyses or other observational studies which aim to constrain cosmology from small-scale structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational capture of a stellar-mass object by a supermassive black hole represents a unique probe of warped spacetime. The small object, typically a stellar-mass black hole, describes a very large number of cycles before crossing the event horizon. Because of the mass difference, we call these captures extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Their merger event rate at the Galactic Centre is negligible, but the amount of time spent in the early inspiral is not. Early EMRIs (E-EMRIs) spend hundreds of thousands of years in band during this phase. At very early stages, the peak of the frequency will not change during an observational time. At later stages, it will change a bit and finally the EMRI explores a wide range of them when it is close to merger. We distinguish between ``monocromatic'' E-EMRIs, which do not change their (peak) frequency, oligochromatic E-EMRIs, which explore a short range and polychromatic ones, the EMRIs which have been discussed so far in the literature. We derive the number of E-EMRIs at the Galactic Centre, and their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and perform a study of parameter extraction. We show that parameters such as the spin and the mass can be extracted with an error which can be as small as $10^{-11}$ and $10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$. There are between hundreds and thousands of E-EMRIs in their monochromatic stage at the GC, and tens in their oligochromatic phase. The SNR ranges from a minimum of $10$ (larger likelihood) to a maximum of $10^6$ (smaller likelihood). Moreover, we derive the contribution signal corresponding to the incoherent sum of continuous with two representatives masses; $10\,M_{\odot}$ and $40\,M_{\odot}$ and show that their curves will cover a significant part of LISA's sensitivity curve. Depending on their level of circularisation, they might be detected as individual sources or form a foreground population.

 - **Abstract**
 Using MeerKAT, we have discovered three new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge globular cluster M62: M62H, M62I, and M62J. All three are in binary systems, which means all ten known pulsars in the cluster are in binaries. M62H has a planetary-mass companion with a median mass $M_{\rm c,med} \sim 3$ M$_{\rm J}$ and a mean density of $\rho \sim 11$ g cm$^{-3}$. M62I has an orbital period of 0.51 days and a $M_{\rm c,med} \sim 0.15$ M$_{\odot}$. Neither of these low-mass systems exhibit eclipses. M62J has only been detected in the two UHF band (816 MHz) observations with a flux density $S_{816} = 0.08$ mJy. The non-detection in the L-band (1284 MHz) indicates it has a relatively steep spectrum ($\beta < -3.1$). We also present 23-yr-long timing solutions obtained using data from the Parkes "Murriyang", Effelsberg and MeerKAT telescopes for the six previously known pulsars. For all these pulsars, we measured the second spin-period derivatives and the rate of change of orbital period caused by the gravitational field of the cluster, and their proper motions. From these measurements, we conclude that the pulsars' maximum accelerations are consistent with the maximum cluster acceleration assuming a core-collapsed mass distribution. Studies of the eclipses of the redback M62B and the black widow M62E at four and two different frequency bands, respectively, reveal a frequency dependence with longer and asymmetric eclipses at lower frequencies. The presence of only binary MSPs in this cluster challenges models which suggest that the MSP population of core-collapsed clusters should be dominated by isolated MSPs.
#### Triaxial Schwarzschild Models of NGC 708: a 10-billion solar mass black  hole in a low dispersion galaxy with a Kroupa IMF

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a $(1.0 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ Supermassive Black Hole (BH) at the centre of NGC 708, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy of Abell 262. Such high BH masses are very rare and allow to investigate BH - host galaxy scaling relations at the high mass end, which in turn provide hints about the (co)evolution of such systems. NGC~708 is found to be an outlier in all the canonical scaling relations except for those linking the BH mass to the core properties. The galaxy mass-to-light ratio points to a Kroupa IMF rather than Salpeter, with this finding confirmed using photometry in two different bands. We perform this analysis using our novel triaxial Schwarzschild code to integrate orbits in a 5-dimensional space, using a semi-parametric deprojected light density to build the potential and non-parametric Line-of-Sight Velocity Distributions (LOSVDs) derived from long-slit spectra recently acquired at Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to exploit the full information in the kinematic. We find that the galaxy geometry changes as a function of the radius going from prolate, nearly spherical in the central regions to triaxial at large radii, highlighting the need to go beyond constant shape profiles. Our analysis is only the second of its kind and will systematically be used in the future to hunt Supermassive Black Holes in giant ellipticals.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to analyze Phobos' photometric properties using Mars Express mission observations to support the Martian Moons eXploration mission. We analyzed resolved images of Phobos acquired between 2004 and 2022 by the HRSC and the SRC cameras on board the Mars Express spacecraft. We performed photometric analysis using the Hapke model for both integrated and disk-resolved data. The Phobos phase function has a strong opposition effect due to shadow hiding, with an amplitude and a half-width of the opposition surge of 2.28$\pm$0.03 and 0.0573$\pm$0.0001, respectively. Overall, the surface of Phobos is dark, with a geometric albedo of 6.8 % in the green filter and backscattering. We also found a surface porosity of 87\%, indicating the presence of a thick dust mantle or of fractal aggregates on the top surface. The SSA maps revealed high reflectance variability, with the blue unit area in the northeast Stickney rim being up to 65\% brighter than average, while the Stickney floor is among the darkest regions, with reflectance 10 to 20% lower than average. Photometric modeling of the regions of interest selected in the red and blue units indicates that red unit terrains have a stronger opposition effect and a smaller SSA value than the blue ones, but they have similar porosity and backscattering properties. The HRSC data provide a unique investigation of the Phobos phase function and opposition surge, which is valuable information for the MMX observational planning. The Phobos opposition surge, surface porosity, phase integral, and spectral slope are very similar to the values observed for the comet 67P and for Jupiter family comets in general. Based on these similarities, we formulate a hypothesis that the Mars satellites might be the results of a binary or bilobated comet captured by Mars.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.

 - **Abstract**
 Until the advent of the SOLARNET recommendations, metadata sharing of simulated data within the Solar Physics community has been mostly on a "private communication" basis, with the description of the data format and content conveyed in an ad hoc manner. This document aims to amend this situation by establishing recommendations for representing such data and the associated metadata, based on the SOLARNET Metadata Recommendations for Solar Observations (arXiv:2011.12139)
#### Measurement of anisotropies in Supernova Remnant observations and their  interpretation using numerical models

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit varying degrees of anisotropy, which have been extensively modeled using numerical methods. We implement a technique to measure anisotropies in SNRs by calculating power spectra from their high-resolution images. To test this technique, we develop 3D hydrodynamical models of supernova remnants and generate synthetic x-ray images from them. Power spectra extracted from both the 3D models and the synthetic images exhibit the same dominant angular scale, which separates large scale features from small scale features due to hydrodynamic instabilities. The angular power spectrum at small length scales during relatively early times is too steep to be consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence, but it transitions to Kolmogorov turbulence at late times. As an example of how this technique can be applied to observations, we extract a power spectrum from a \textit{Chandra} observation of Tycho's SNR and compare with our models. Our predicted power spectrum picks out the angular scale of Tycho's fleece-like structures and also agrees with the small-scale power seen in Tycho. We use this to extract an estimate for the density of the circumstellar gas ($n \sim 0.28/\mathrm{cm^3}$), consistent with previous measurements of this density by other means. The power spectrum also provides an estimate of the density profile of the outermost ejecta. Moreover, we observe additional power at large scales which may provide important clues about the explosion mechanism itself.

 - **Abstract**
 The combined strength of asteroseismology and empirical stellar basic parameter determinations for in-depth asteroseismic analysis of massive pulsators in eclipsing binaries shows great potential for treating the challenging and mysterious discrepancies between observations and models of stellar structure and evolution of massive stars. This paper compiles a comprehensive list of massive pulsators in eclipsing binary systems observed with TESS. The TESS light curves and Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of a sample of 8055 stars of spectral type B0--B3 were examined for eclipses and stellar pulsations and the ephemerides of the resulting sub-sample of massive pulsators in eclipsing binaries were computed. This sub-sample was also cross-matched with existing catalogues of massive pulsators. Until now, fewer than 30 $\beta$ Cep pulsators in eclipsing binaries have been reported in the literature. Here we announce a total of 78 pulsators of the $\beta$ Cephei type in eclipsing binaries, 59 of which are new discoveries. Forty-three are recognized as definite and 35 are candidate pulsators. Our sample of pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binaries allows for future asteroseismic modelling to better understand the internal mixing profile and to resolve the mass discrepancy in massive stars. We have already started follow-up of some of the most interesting candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an X-ray analysis of three different XMM-Newton observations together with simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4190 ULX-1. Our goal is to constrain the structure of the accretion disk and the geometrical properties of the source. We performed a temporal and spectral analyses in the 0.4--30 keV energy range where the source is significantly detected in dedicated XMM-Newton, NICER and NuSTAR observations. The temporal analysis shows no flaring activity in the light curves. No pulsation is detected throughout. The source exhibits a typical ULX spectrum, which can be fitted with two thermal blackbody components plus a Comptonization tail at high energies. The luminosity-temperature relation of each thermal spectral component is consistent with the $L \propto T^{2}$ relation expected from an advection-dominated supercritical disk. We interpret these results as a super-Eddington accreting black hole seen almost face-on. A dense wind ejected from the disk obscures the central source, and a hot electron plasma is evacuated through the funnel formed above the hole. Geometric beaming is responsible for the ULX soft emission, whereas the hard tail is the result of Comptonization of soft photons by the electrons ejected through the funnel.
#### BD-14 3065b (TOI-4987b): from giant planet to brown dwarf: evidence for  deuterium burning in old age?

 - **Abstract**
 The present study reports the confirmation of BD-14 3065b, a transiting planet/brown dwarf in a triple-star system, with a mass near the deuterium burning boundary. BD-14 3065b has the largest radius observed within the sample of giant planets and brown dwarfs around post-main-sequence stars. Its orbital period is 4.3 days, and it transits a subgiant F-type star with a mass of $M_\star=1.41 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=2.35 \pm 0.08 R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6935\pm90$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.34\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the TRES and Pucheros+ spectrographs, we measured a mass of $M_p=12.37\pm0.92 M_J$ and a radius of $R_p=1.926\pm0.094 R_J$. Our discussion of potential processes that could be responsible for the inflated radius led us to conclude that deuterium burning is a plausible explanation resulting from the heating of BD-14 3065b's interior. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity $e_p=0.066\pm0.011$ and reveals BD-14 3065b has a brightness temperature of $3520 \pm 130$ K. With its unique characteristics, BD-14 3065b presents an excellent opportunity to study its atmosphere through thermal emission spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigations into the propagation characteristics, specifically loss and wave velocity, of superconducting coplanar waveguides and microstrip lines were conducted at a 2 mm wavelength. This was achieved through the measurement of on-chip half-wavelength resonators, employing superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions as detectors. A continuous wave millimeter wave probe signal was introduced to the chip via a silicon membrane-based orthomode transducer. This setup not only facilitated the injection of the probe signal but also provided a reference path essential for differential measurements. The observed resonance frequencies aligned closely with theoretical predictions, exhibiting a discrepancy of only several percent. However, the measured losses significantly exceeded those anticipated from quasi-particle loss mechanisms, suggesting the presence of additional loss factors. Notably, the measurement results revealed that the tangential loss attributable to the dielectric layer, specifically silicon dioxide, was approximately $\rm{7\pm 2 \times 10^{-3}}$. This factor emerged as the dominant contributor to overall loss at temperatures around 4 K.

 - **Abstract**
 An expansion of cross-sectional area directly impacts the mass flow along a coronal loop, and significantly alters the radiative and hydrodynamic evolution of that loop as a result. Previous studies have found that an area expansion from chromosphere to corona significantly lengthens the cooling time of the corona, and appears to suppress draining from the corona. In this work, we examine the fluid dynamics to understand how the mass flow rate, the energy balance, and the cooling and draining timescales are affected by a non-uniform area. We find that in loops with moderate or large expansion (cross-sectional area expansion factors of 2, 3, 10, 30, 100 from photosphere to apex), impulsive heating, for either direct thermal heating or electron beam heating, induces a steady flow into the corona, so that the coronal density continues to rise during the cooling phase, whereas a uniform loop drains during the cooling phase. The induced upflow carries energy into the corona, balancing the losses from thermal conduction, and continues until thermal conduction weakens enough so that it can no longer support the radiative losses of the transition region (TR). As a result, the plasma cools primarily radiatively until the onset of catastrophic collapse. The speed and duration of the induced upflow both increase in proportion to the rate of area expansion. We argue that observations of blue-shifted spectral lines, therefore, could place a constraint on a loop's area expansion.

 This work shows details of an evaluation of an observational system comprising a CMOS detector, 60-cm telescope, and filter complement. The system's photometric precision and differential photometric precision, and extinction coefficients were assessed through observations of Supersky flat fields, open clusters, standard stars, and exoplanets. Photometry was precision achieved at the 0.02 mag level, while differential photometry of 0.004 mag precision. Extinction was found to be agreed with previous studies conducted at Xinglong Observatory. Ultimately, the results demonstrate this observing system is capable of precision scientific observations with CCD across the optical wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of five Y dwarfs with three optical and near-infrared instruments at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias are reported. Deep images of the five targets and a low-resolution far-red optical spectrum for one of the targets were obtained. One of the Y dwarfs, WISE J173835+273258 (Y0), was clearly detected in the optical (z- and i-bands) and another, WISE J182831+265037 (Y2), was detected only in the z-band. We measured the colours of our targets and found that the z-J and i-z colours of the Y dwarfs are bluer than those of mid- and late-T dwarfs. This optical blueing has been predicted by models, but our data indicates that it is sharper and happens at temperatures about 150 K warmer than expected. Likely, the culprit is the K I resonance doublet, which weakens more abruptly in the T- to Y-type transition than expected. We show that the alkali resonance lines (Cs I and K I) are weaker in Y dwarfs than in T dwarfs; the far-red optical spectrum of WISE J173835+273258 is similar to that of late-T dwarfs, but with stronger methane and water features; and we noted the appearance of new absorption features that we propose could be due to hydrogen sulphide. The optical properties of Y dwarfs presented here pose new challenges to understanding grain sedimentation in extremely cool objects. The weakening of the very broad K I resonance doublet due to condensation in dust grains is more abrupt than theoretically anticipated. Consequently, the observed blueing of the z-J and i-z colours of Y dwarfs with respect to T dwarfs is more pronounced than predicted by models and could boost the potential of upcoming deep large-area optical surveys regarding their ability to detect extremely cool objects
#### Uranus and Neptune as methane planets: producing icy giants from  refractory planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 Uranus and Neptune are commonly considered ice giants, and it is often assumed that, in addition to a solar mix of hydrogen and helium, they contain roughly twice as much water as rock. This classical picture has led to successful models of their internal structure and has been understood to be compatible with the composition of the solar nebula during their formation (Reynolds and Summers 1965; Podolak and Cameron 1974; Podolak and Reynolds 1984; Podolak et al. 1995; Nettelmann et al. 2013). However, the dominance of water has been recently questioned (Teanby et al. 2020; Helled and Fortney 2020; Podolak et al. 2022). Planetesimals in the outer solar system are composed mainly of refractory materials, leading to an inconsistency between the icy composition of Uranus and Neptune and the ice-poor planetesimals they accreted during formation (Podolak et al. 2022). Here we elaborate on this problem, and propose a new potential solution. We show that chemical reactions between planetesimals dominated by organic-rich refractory materials and the hydrogen in gaseous atmospheres of protoplanets can form large amounts of methane 'ice'. Uranus and Neptune could thus be compatible with having accreted refractory-dominated planetesimals, while still remaining icy. Using random statistical computer models for a wide parameter space, we show that the resulting methane-rich internal composition could be a natural solution, giving a good match to the size, mass and moment of inertia of Uranus and Neptune, whereas rock-rich models appear to only work if a rocky interior is heavily mixed with hydrogen. Our model predicts a lower than solar hydrogen to helium ratio, which can be tested. We conclude that Uranus, Neptune and similar exoplanets could be methane-rich, and discuss why Jupiter and Saturn cannot.

 - **Abstract**
 Red dwarfs have been suggested to be among the possible astrophysical species accelerating particles and emitting TeV $\gamma$-rays. As an effort to search for the GeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts of the suggested TeV emission from eight red dwarfs, we analyse the 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission of the regions covering them exploiting the $\sim$13.6 yr Pass 8 data of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. A GeV $\gamma$-ray emission excess with significance of 3.8$\sigma$ is detected in the direction of the red dwarf V962 Tau. This emission contains V962 Tau in 1$\sigma$ error radius and is independent of the catalog source. However, the stellar flare scenario can hardly explain the total energy and lightcurve derived from the $\gamma$-ray emission in view of the spectral analysis. We also analyse the lightcurves in the positions of the eight red dwarfs and no time bin with significance $>$5$\sigma$ is found. Therefore, no significant emission from the red dwarfs could be concluded to be detected by Fermi-LAT.

 - **Abstract**
 In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model. We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting an atmosphere on nearby temperate planets is one of the most important scientific objectives of the Webb mission, an endeavour in practice limited to a handful of well-characterized planets: Trappist-1d, e, f, g, LHS1140b, and the mini-Neptune K2- 18b. The first 18 months of atmospheric characterization with JWST have confirmed both its power and versatility to probe exoplanet atmospheres, and have highlighted the challenge of stellar activity in studying those atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. Assessing the prevalence of atmosphere in temperate planets with a minimal degree of confidence will require a multi-cycle program of order of a few 1000 hours involving both eclipse photometry and transmission spectroscopy, a program that would have to be executed over a significant fraction of JWST's lifetime. The forthcoming 500 hours of Cycle 3 Director Discretionary Time dedicated to exoplanet programs represent a unique opportunity to initiate a deep reconnaissance of habitability of the best keystone temperate planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting solar burst properties as well as sources viewed through the turbulent atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model based on solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The frequency broadening is consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances $\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$, but the levels of frequency broadening for $\lesssim 10$ $R_\odot$ require additional radial speeds $\sim (100-300)$ km s$^{-1}$ and/or transverse speeds $\sim (20-70)$ km s$^{-1}$. The inferred radial velocities appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with non-thermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfv\'enic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allow an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of $\sim(1-3)$ $R_\odot$ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves to the small scales where heating takes place.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted an analysis of nebulae around Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M33 using data collected by the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope as part of the SIGNALS Large Program. Of the 211 known Wolf-Rayet stars in M33, 178 are located in the fields observed in this study. We present the results of this analysis in the form of a comprehensive summary of all nebulae found around the observed WR stars. Based on three criteria we find to be the most effective for their detection, we detect a clear association with a circumstellar bubble around 33 of them (19\%). Our results show that the presence of bubbles does not correlate with the spectral type of the central star. The mean diameter of the WR nebulae we have found is 21 parsecs.

 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical massive quadruple systems are ideal laboratories for examining the theories of star formation, dynamical evolution, and stellar evolution. The successive mergers of hierarchical quadruple systems might explain the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Looking for light curves of O-type binaries identified by LAMOST, we find a (2+2) quadruple system: TYC 3340-2437-1, located in the stellar bow-shock nebula (SBN). It has a probability of over 99.99\% being a quadruple system derived from the surface density of the vicinity stars. Its inner orbital periods are 3.390602(89) days and 2.4378(16) days, respectively, and the total mass is about (11.47 + 5.79) + (5.2 + 2.02) = 24.48 $M_{\odot}$. The line-of-sight inclinations of the inner binaries, B$_1$ and B$_2$, are 55.94 and 78.2 degrees, respectively, indicating that they are not co-planar. Based on observations spanning 34 months and the significance of the astrometric excess noise ($D>2$) in Gaia DR3 data, we guess that its outer orbital period might be a few years. If it were true, the quadruple system might form through the disk fragmentation mechanism with outer eccentric greater than zero. This eccentricity could be the cause of both the arc-like feature of the SBN and the noncoplanarity of the inner orbit. The outer orbital period and outer eccentric could be determined with the release of future epoch astrometric data of Gaia.

 - **Abstract**
 The dwarf planet Haumea is one of the most compelling transneptunian objects (TNOs) to study, hosting two small, dynamically interacting satellites, a family of nearby spectrally unique objects, and a ring system. Haumea itself is extremely oblate due to its 3.9 hour rotation period. Understanding the orbits of Haumea's satellites, named Hi'iaka and Namaka, requires detailed modeling of both satellite-satellite gravitational interactions and satellite interactions with Haumea's nonspherical gravitational field (parameterized here as $J_2$). Understanding both of these effects allows for a detailed probe of the satellites' masses and Haumea's $J_2$ and spin pole. Measuring Haumea's $J_2$ provides information about Haumea's interior, possibly determining the extent of past differentation. In an effort to understand the Haumea system, we have performed detailed non-Keplerian orbit fitting of Haumea's satellites using a decade of new ultra-precise observations. Our fits detect Haumea's $J_2$ and spin pole at $\gtrsim2.5\sigma$ confidence. Degeneracies present in the dynamics prevent us from precisely measuring Haumea's $J_2$ with the current data, but future observations should enable a precise measurement. Our dynamically determined spin pole shows excellent agreement with past results, illustrating the strength of non-Keplerian orbit fitting. We also explore the spin-orbit dynamics of Haumea and its satellites, showing that axial precession of Hi'iaka may be detectable over decadal timescales. Finally, we present an ephemeris of the Haumea system over the coming decade, enabling high-quality observations of Haumea and its satellites for years to come.

 - **Abstract**
 About 40 transneptunian binaries (TNBs) have fully determined orbits with about 10 others being solved except for breaking the mirror ambiguity. Despite decades of study almost all TNBs have only ever been analyzed with a model that assumes perfect Keplerian motion (e.g., two point masses). In reality, all TNB systems are non-Keplerian due to non-spherical shapes, possible presence of undetected system components, and/or solar perturbations. In this work, we focus on identifying candidates for detectable non-Keplerian motion based on sample of 45 well-characterized binaries. We use MultiMoon, a non-Keplerian Bayesian inference tool, to analyze published relative astrometry allowing for non-spherical shapes of each TNB system's primary. We first reproduce the results of previous Keplerian fitting efforts with MultiMoon, which serves as a comparison for the non-Keplerian fits and confirms that these fits are not biased by the assumption of a Keplerian orbit. We unambiguously detect non-Keplerian motion in 8 TNB systems across a range of primary radii, mutual orbit separations, and system masses. As a proof of concept for non-Keplerian fitting, we perform detailed fits for (66652) Borasisi-Pabu, possibly revealing a $J_2 \approx 0.44$, implying Borasisi (and/or Pabu) may be a contact binary or an unresolved compact binary. However, full confirmation of this result will require new observations. This work begins the next generation of TNB analyses that go beyond the point mass assumption to provide unique and valuable information on the physical properties of TNBs with implications for their formation and evolution.
#### Beyond Point Masses. I. New Non-Keplerian Modeling Tools Applied to  Trans-Neptunian Triple (47171) Lempo

 - **Abstract**
 Many details of the formation and evolution of the solar system are best inferred by understanding the orbital and physical properties of small bodies in the solar system. For example, small body binaries are particularly valuable for measuring masses. By extending the models of small body binaries beyond point masses, new information about the shape and spin orientation becomes available. This is particularly informative for Trans-Neptunian multiples (two or more components) where shapes and spin orientations are poorly understood. Going beyond point masses requires modeling tools that no longer assume fixed Keplerian orbits. To this end, we have developed a new n-quadrupole integrator SPINNY (SPIN+N-bodY) and pair it with a Bayesian parameter inference tool MultiMoon, both of which are publicly available. We describe these tools and how they can be used to learn more about solar system small body multiple systems. We then apply them to the unique Trans-Neptunian hierarchical triple system (47171) Lempo, finding a three-point-mass solution for the first time. This solution has two surprises: unequal densities of the inner components and a dynamical configuration apparently unstable on the age of the solar system.
#### Beyond Point Masses. IV. TNO Altjira is Likely a Hierarchical Triple  Discovered Through Non-Keplerian Motion

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamically studying Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO) binaries allows us to measure masses and orbits. Most of the known objects appear to have only two components, except (47171) Lempo which is the single known hierarchical triple system with three similar-mass components. Though hundreds of TNOs have been imaged with high-resolution telescopes, no other hierarchical triples (or trinaries) have been found among solar system small bodies, even though they are predicted in planetesimal formation models such as gravitational collapse after the streaming instability. By going beyond the point-mass assumption and modeling TNO orbits as non-Keplerian, we open a new window into the shapes and spins of the components, including the possible presence of unresolved ``inner'' binaries. Here we present evidence for a new hierarchical triple, (148780) Altjira (2001 UQ$_{18}$), based on non-Keplerian dynamical modeling of the two observed components. We incorporate two recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, leading to a 17 year observational baseline. We present a new open-source Bayesian Point Spread Function (PSF) fitting code called nPSF that provides precise relative astrometry and uncertainties for single images. Our non-Keplerian analysis measures a statistically-significant ($\sim$2.5-$\sigma$) non-spherical shape for Altjira. The measured $J_2$ is best explained as an unresolved inner binary and an example hierarchical triple model gives the best fit to the observed astrometry. Using an updated non-Keplerian ephemeris (which is significantly different from the Keplerian predictions), we show that the predicted mutual event season for Altjira has already begun with several excellent opportunities for observations through $\sim$2030.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.
#### On the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the  Galactic bar as revealed by the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is widely considered to exhibit features of a rotational bar or quadrupole bar. In either case, the feature of the resonance of the Galactic bar should be present in the properties of the chemistry and kinematics, over a large area of the disk. With a sample of over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars from LAMOST-APOGEE data, we attempt to detect the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar, within 4.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The measurement of the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ $-$ $R$ with subtracted the global profiles trends, shows that the thin and thick disks values Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.010 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.598 $R$ + 2.551) and Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.006 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.258 $R$ $-$ 0.019), respectively. The analysis of the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid indicates that the thin and thick disks are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ arctan (Z/R), with $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.198 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.853 $R$ + 1.982) + 0.630 and $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.220 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.884 $R$ + 2.012) + 0.679 for thin and thick disks, respectively. These periodic oscillations in Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ and $\alpha_{0}$ with $R$ appear in both thin and thick disks, are the most likely chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonance of the Galactic bar. The difference in the phase of the functions of the fitted periodic oscillations for the thin and thick disks may be related to the presence of a second Galactic bar.

 - **Abstract**
 The protostar IRAS 15398-3359 is associated with a bipolar molecular outflow ejected in an nearly northeast-southwest (NE-SW) direction which has been extensively studied. It has been suggested previous episodic accretion events by this source. Furthermore, the analysis of the morphology and kinematics of the molecular outflow revealed the presence of four $^{12}$CO(2-1) bipolar elliptical shock-like structures identified in both lobes. These structures seem to trace different ejections inclined $\sim$10\deg on the plane of the sky from each other. This led to the hypothesis that the outflow axis likely precesses and launches material episodically. We analyze ALMA archive observations in Band 6, revealing the presence of low-velocity ($<3.5$km s$^{-1}$) emission from the line $^{12}$CO(2-1) to the south and north of the protostar. We study the morphology and kinematics of the gas, which seems to support the hypothesis of a precessing episodic outflow. The ALMA observations reveal a north-south (N-S) outflow most likely associated with the IRAS 15398-3359 protostellar system. This outflow could be older than the well-studied NE-SW outflow. The orientation of the N-S outflow is 50\deg - 60\deg on the plane of the sky away from that of the NE-SW outflow. We also analyze the Spectral Energy Distribution of a far away young star and preliminary discard it as the driver of the SE outflow remnants. The new observations support the hypothesis of strong episodic accretion-ejection events in IRAS 15398-3359, accompanied by dramatic changes in the orientation of its ejection axis, implying that all the outflows in the region may have been driven by the same protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 As the brightest gamma-ray burst ever observed, GRB 221009A provided a precious opportunity to explore spectral line features. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive spectroscopy analysis of GRB 221009A jointly with GECAM-C and Fermi/GBM data to search for emission and absorption lines. For the first time we investigated the line feature throughout this GRB including the most bright part where many instruments suffered problems, and identified prominent emission lines in multiple time intervals. The central energy of the Gaussian emission line evolves from about 37 MeV to 6 MeV, with a nearly constant ratio (about 10\%) between the line width and central energy. Particularly, we find that both the central energy and the energy flux of the emission line evolve with time as a power law decay with power law index of -1 and -2 respectively. We suggest that the observed emission lines most likely originate from the blue-shifted electron positron pair annihilation 511 keV line. We find that a standard high latitude emission scenario cannot fully interpret the observation, thus we propose that the emission line comes from some dense clumps with electron positron pairs traveling together with the jet. In this scenario, we can use the emission line to directly, for the first time, measure the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet ($\Gamma$) and reveal its time evolution (i.e. $\Gamma \sim t^{-1}$) during the prompt emission. Interestingly, we find that the flux of the annihilation line in the co-moving frame keeps constant. These discoveries of the spectral line features shed new and important lights on the physics of GRB and relativistic jet.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new hot-PAGB star identified in the Galactic GC E3, which is one of the first to show a binary signature among the identified PAGB stars of GCs. We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis to study the evolutionary status of the newly identified hot-PAGB star. We use Gaia EDR3 proper motion (PM) and parallax measurements to confirm the cluster membership. We supplement the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from multi-epoch high resolution (R$\sim$28000) spectroscopic observations. We fitted the spectral energy distribution of 30 photometric fluxes of the PAGB star from ultraviolet to infra-red passbands with the TLUSTY BSTAR2006 stellar atmosphere model to derive its physical parameters, \Teff, $\log g$, \Lbol, and R. We derive the chemical abundances of nine elements (He, C, N, O, Ne, Al, Si, S, and Fe) using spectroscopic measurements. The derived chemical abundances, kinematic information, and stellar parameters are used to study the evolution history of the star. The PM and parallax of the identified PAGB star match well with cluster parameters, which confirms its cluster membership. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio, q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex matches well with the cluster metallicity. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the H-R diagram suggest a current mass of the identified PAGB star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars of GCs with the evidence of 3rd dredge-up on the AGB phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a spectral survey towards a dense molecular condensation and young stellar objects (YSOs) projected on the border of the HII region RCW 120 and discuss emission of 20 molecules which produce the brightest lines. The survey was performed with the APEX telescope in the frequency range 200 -- 260 GHz. We provide evidences for two outflows in the dense gas. The first one is powered by the RCW 120 S2 YSO and oriented along the line of sight. The second outflow around RCW 120 S1 is aligned almost perpendicular to the line of sight. We show that area with bright emission of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH and CH$_3$CN are organised into an onion-like structure where CH$_3$CN traces warmer regions around the YSOs than the other molecules. Methanol seems to be released to the gas phase by shock waves in the vicinity of the outflows while thermal evaporation still does not work towards the YSOs. We find only a single manifestation of the UV radiation to the molecules, namely, enhanced abundances of small hydrocarbons CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in the photo-dissociation region.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae have considerably improved our understanding of this complex phenomenon. In addition to that, one-dimensional (1D) studies have been employed to study the explosion mechanism and its causal connection to the pre-collapse structure of the star, as well as to explore the vast parameter space of supernovae. Nonetheless, many uncertainties still affect the late stages of the evolution of massive stars, their collapse, and the subsequent shock propagation. In this review, we will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art of both 1D and 3D simulations and how they can be employed to study the evolution of massive stars, supernova explosions, and shock propagation, focusing on the uncertainties that affect each of these phases. Finally, we will illustrate the typical nucleosynthesis products that emerge from the explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale structure surveys have reported measurements of the density of matter, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and the amplitude of clustering, $\sigma_8$, that are in tension with the values inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background. While this may be a sign of new physics that slows the growth of structure at late times, strong astrophysical feedback processes could also be responsible. In this work, we argue that astrophysical processes are not independent of cosmology and that their coupling naturally leads to stronger baryonic feedback in cosmological models with suppressed structure formation or when combined with a mechanism that removes dark matter from halos. We illustrate this with two well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model known to suppress structure formation: massive neutrinos and decaying dark matter. Our results, based on the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, show that the combined effect of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for decaying dark matter. We also show that the dependence of baryonic feedback on cosmology can be modelled as a function of the ratio $f_\mathrm{b}/c^2_\mathrm{v}\sim f_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{m}\sigma_8)^{1/4}$ of the universal baryon fraction, $f_\mathrm{b}$, to a velocity-based definition of halo concentration, $c^2_\mathrm{v}$, giving an accurate fitting formula for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Although the combination of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms can resolve the tension, the models with neutrinos and decaying dark matter are challenged by constraints on the expansion history.
