#### ELemental abundances of Planets and brown dwarfs Imaged around Stars  (ELPIS): I. Potential Metal Enrichment of the Exoplanet AF Lep b and a Novel  Retrieval Approach for Cloudy Self-luminous Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 AF Lep A+b is a remarkable planetary system hosting a gas-giant planet that has the lowest dynamical mass among directly imaged exoplanets. We present an in-depth analysis of the atmospheric composition of the star and planet to probe the planet's formation pathway. Based on new high-resolution spectroscopy of AF Lep A, we measure a uniform set of stellar parameters and elemental abundances (e.g., [Fe/H] = $-0.27 \pm 0.31$ dex). The planet's dynamical mass ($2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$) and orbit are also refined using published radial velocities, relative astrometry, and absolute astrometry. We use petitRADTRANS to perform chemically-consistent atmospheric retrievals for AF Lep b. The radiative-convective equilibrium temperature profiles are incorporated as parameterized priors on the planet's thermal structure, leading to a robust characterization for cloudy self-luminous atmospheres. This novel approach is enabled by constraining the temperature-pressure profiles via the temperature gradient $(d\ln{T}/d\ln{P})$, a departure from previous studies that solely modeled the temperature. Through multiple retrievals performed on different portions of the $0.9-4.2$ $\mu$m spectrophotometry, along with different priors on the planet's mass and radius, we infer that AF Lep b likely possesses a metal-enriched atmosphere ([Fe/H] $> 1.0$ dex). AF Lep b's potential metal enrichment may be due to planetesimal accretion, giant impacts, and/or core erosion. The first process coincides with the debris disk in the system, which could be dynamically excited by AF Lep b and lead to planetesimal bombardment. Our analysis also determines $T_{\rm eff} \approx 800$ K, $\log{(g)} \approx 3.7$ dex, and the presence of silicate clouds and dis-equilibrium chemistry in the atmosphere. Straddling the L/T transition, AF Lep b is thus far the coldest exoplanet with suggested evidence of silicate clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The dipole moment in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is thought to originate from the Doppler Effect and our motion relative to the CMB frame. Observations of large-scale structure (LSS) should show a related "kinematic dipole" and help test the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. Intriguingly, many previous LSS dipole studies suggest discrepancies with the expectations from the CMB. Here we reassess the apparent inconsistency between the CMB measurements and dipole estimates from the NVSS catalog of radio sources. We find that it is important to account for the shot-noise and clustering of the NVSS sources, as well as kinematic contributions, in determining the expected dipole signal. We use the clustering redshift method and a cross-matching technique to refine estimates of the clustering term. We then derive a probability distribution for the expected NVSS dipole in a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model including all (i.e., kinematic, shot-noise and clustering) dipole components. Our model agrees with most of the previous NVSS dipole measurements in the literature at better than $\lesssim 2\sigma$. We conclude that the NVSS dipole is consistent with a kinematic origin for the CMB dipole within $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate possible factors that drive fast quasar outflows using a sample of 39,249 quasars at median redshift $\langle z \rangle \approx$ 2.17. Unique to this study, the quasar redshifts are re-measured based on the Mg II emission line, allowing for exploration of unprecedented outflow velocities (>6000 km/s) while maintaining statistical significance and uniformity. We measure reliable C IV blueshifts for 1178 quasars with velocities >2500 km/s. From those, 255(13) quasars have blueshifts above 4000(6000) km/s, with the highest C IV velocity $\approx$ 7000 km/s. Several correlations are observed, where higher C IV blueshifts in general are in quasars with broader, weaker C IV emission profiles, weak He II emission, larger Eddington ratios, and bluer UV continuum slope across the rest-frame UV to Near-IR. Analysis reveals two primary factors contributing to faster outflows: higher Eddington ratios, and softer far-UV continuum (h$\nu$ >24.6 eV). We find supporting evidence that radiative line-driving may generate extreme outflow velocities, influenced by multiple factors as suggested by the aforementioned correlations. This evidence highlights the importance of considering a multi-dimensional parameter space in future studies when analyzing large C IV blueshifts to determine the fundamental causes of outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine deep {\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn observations of the Centaurus cluster to study the hot intracluster medium (ICM) and radial metal distributions within such an environment. We found that the best-fit spectral model corresponds to a log-normal temperature distribution, with discontinuities around $\sim10$~kpc, $\sim50$~kpc, and $\sim100$~kpc, also observed in the abundances distributions. We measured the radial profiles of O, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. These profiles reveal prominent negative gradients for distances $<90$~kpc, which then transition to flatter profiles. We modeled X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of SNIcc and SNIa models. The best-fit model suggests a uniform SNIa percentage contribution to the total cluster enrichment, thus supporting an early enrichment of the ICM, with most of the metals present being produced before clustering.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex interelement trends among magmatic IIIF iron meteorites are difficult to explain by fractional crystallization and have raised uncertainty about their genetic relationships. Nucleosynthetic Mo isotope anomalies provide a powerful tool to assess if individual IIIF irons are related to each other. However, while trace-element data are available for all nine IIIF irons, Mo isotopic data are limited to three samples. We present Mo isotopic data for all but one IIIF irons that help assess the genetic relationships among these irons, together with new Mo and W isotopic data for Fitzwater Pass (classified IIIF), and the Zinder pallasite (for which a cogenetic link with IIIF irons has been proposed). After correction for cosmic-ray exposure, the Mo isotopic compositions of the IIIF irons are identical within uncertainty and confirm their belonging to carbonaceous chondrite-type (CC) meteorites. The mean Mo isotopic composition of Group IIIF overlaps those Groups IIF and IID, but a common parent body for these groups is ruled out based on distinct trace element systematics. The new Mo isotopic data do not argue against a single parent body for the IIIF irons, and suggest a close genetic link among these samples. By contrast, Fitzwater Pass has distinct Mo and W isotopic compositions, identical to those of some non-magmatic IAB irons. The Mo and W isotope data for Zinder indicate that this meteorite is not related to IIIF irons, but belongs to the non-carbonaceous (NC) type and has the same Mo and W isotopic composition as main-group pallasites.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar surveys with modern radio telescopes are becoming increasingly computationally demanding. This is particularly true for wide field-of-view pulsar surveys with radio interferometers, and those conducted in real or quasi-real time. These demands result in data analysis bottlenecks that can limit the parameter space covered by the surveys and diminish their scientific return. In this paper, we address the computational challenge of `candidate folding' in pulsar searching, presenting a novel, efficient approach designed to optimise the simultaneous folding of large numbers of pulsar candidates. We provide a complete folding pipeline appropriate for large-scale pulsar surveys including radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, dedispersion, folding and parameter optimization. By leveraging the Fast Discrete Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm proposed by Zackay et al. (2017), we have developed an optimized, and cache-friendly implementation that we term the pruned FDMT (pFDMT). The pFDMT approach efficiently reuses intermediate processing results and prunes the unused computation paths, resulting in a significant reduction in arithmetic operations. In addition, we propose a novel folding algorithm based on the Tikhonov-regularised least squares method (TLSM) that can improve the time resolution of the pulsar profile. We present the performance of its real-world application as an integral part of two major pulsar search projects conducted with the MeerKAT telescope: the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (MMGPS) and the Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) project. In our processing, for approximately 500 candidates, the theoretical number of dedispersion operations can be reduced by a factor of around 50 when compared to brute-force dedispersion, which scales with the number of candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 The complexity of modern cosmic ray observatories and the rich data sets they capture often require a sophisticated software framework to support the simulation of physical processes, detector response, as well as reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data. Here we present the EUSO-OffLine framework. The code base was originally developed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration, and portions of it have been adopted by other collaborations to suit their needs. We have extended this software to fulfill the requirements of UHECR detectors and VHE neutrino detectors developed for the JEM-EUSO. These path-finder instruments constitute a program to chart the path to a future space-based mission like POEMMA. For completeness, we describe the overall structure of the framework developed by the Pierre Auger collaboration and continue with a description of the JEM-EUSO simulation and reconstruction capabilities. The framework is written predominantly in modern C++ and incorporates third-party libraries chosen based on functionality and our best judgment regarding support and longevity. Modularity is a central notion in the framework design, a requirement for large collaborations in which many individuals contribute to a common code base and often want to compare different approaches to a given problem. For the same reason, the framework is designed to be highly configurable, which allows us to contend with a variety of JEM-EUSO missions and observation scenarios. We also discuss how we incorporate broad, industry-standard testing coverage which is necessary to ensure quality and maintainability of a relatively large code base, and the tools we employ to support a multitude of computing platforms and enable fast, reliable installation of external packages. Finally, we provide a few examples of simulation and reconstruction applications using EUSO-OffLine.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first extragalactic detection of the higher-order millimeter hydrogen recombination lines ($\Delta n>2$). The $\gamma$-, $\epsilon$-, and $\eta$-transitions have been detected toward the millimeter continuum source N105-1A in the star-forming region N105 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We use the H40$\alpha$ line, the brightest of the detected recombination lines (H40$\alpha$, H36$\beta$, H50$\beta$, H41$\gamma$, H57$\gamma$, H49$\epsilon$, H53$\eta$, and H54$\eta$), and/or the 3 mm free-free continuum emission to determine the physical parameters of N105-1A (the electron temperature, emission measure, electron density, and size) and study ionized gas kinematics. We compare the physical properties of N105-1A to a large sample of Galactic compact and ultracompact (UC) H II regions and conclude that N105-1A is similar to the most luminous ($L>10^5$ $L_{\odot}$) UC H II regions in the Galaxy. N105-1A is ionized by an O5.5 V star, it is deeply embedded in its natal molecular clump, and likely associated with a (proto)cluster. We incorporate high-resolution molecular line data including CS, SO, SO$_2$, and CH$_3$OH ($\sim$0.12 pc), and HCO$^{+}$ and CO ($\sim$0.087 pc) to explore the molecular environment of N105-1A. Based on the CO data, we find evidence for a cloud-cloud collision that likely triggered star formation in the region. We find no clear outflow signatures, but the presence of filaments and streamers indicates on-going accretion onto the clump hosting the UC H II region. Sulfur chemistry in N105-1A is consistent with the accretion shock model predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos play pivotal roles in determining fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and their observables in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and binary neutron star merger (BNSM). In this Letter, we present a novel phenomenon, collisional flavor swap, in which neutrino-matter interactions trigger the complete interchange of neutrino spectra between two different flavors, aided by neutrino self-interactions. We find a necessary condition to trigger the collisional swap is occurrences of resonance-like collisional flavor instability. After the collisional swap, spectral-swap like features emerge in neutrino spectra. Since flavor swaps correspond to the most extreme case in flavor conversions, they have a great potential to affect CCSN and BNSM phenomena.

 In this manuscript, an overview of the accomplishments of the Indo-Belgian co-operation is presented in the current era of multi-wavelength global astronomy. About two decades ago, in the field of astronomy and astrophysics, academicians from India and Belgium embarked on formal interaction and collaboration. The Belgo-Indian Network for Astronomy & astrophysics (BINA), initiated in 2014, has been very productive and its activities have set a landmark for Indo-Belgian co-operation. Under this program, three international workshops were conducted. Several exchange work visits were also made among the astronomers of the two 13countries. Since the necessary foundation work has already been done, continuation of the BINA activities in future is strongly recommended.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue straggler stars (BSS), one of the most massive members of star clusters, have been used for over a decade to investigate mass segregation and estimate the dynamical ages of globular clusters (GCs) and open clusters (OCs). This work is an extension of our previous study, in which we investigated a correlation between theoretically estimated dynamical ages and the observed $A^+_{\mathrm{rh}}$ values, which represent the sedimentation level of BSS with respect to the reference population. Here, we use the ML-MOC algorithm on \textit{Gaia} EDR3 data to extend this analysis to 23 OCs. Using cluster properties and identified members, we estimate their dynamical and physical parameters. In order to estimate the $A^+_{\mathrm{rh}}$ values, we use the main sequence and main sequence turnoff stars as the reference population. OCs are observed to exhibit a wide range of degrees of dynamical evolution, ranging from dynamically young to late stages of intermediate dynamical age. Hence, we classify OCs into three distinct dynamical stages based on their relationship to $A^+_{\mathrm{rh}}$ and $N_{\text{relax}}$. NGC 2682 and King 2 are discovered to be the most evolved OCs, like Familly III GCs, while Berkeley 18 is the least evolved OC. Melotte 66 and Berkeley 31 are peculiar OCs because none of their dynamical and physical parameters correlate with their BSS segregation levels.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring planetary atmospheres, particularly Mars, captivates planetary science. Mars' thin, CO2-rich atmosphere poses a unique puzzle involving composition, climate history, and habitability. Understanding Mars' atmosphere not only reveals insights about the planet but also aids in comprehending atmospheres across the cosmos. This study aims to investigate the complex relationship between Mars' atmospheric variations and dynamic solar activity patterns. We focus on periodic oscillations in H$_2$O vapor and the Pectinton solar flux index in the $\lambda$ = 10.7 cm radio band, around the characteristic 11-year solar cycle. Periodic Mars activity was studied using data from Mars Express' SPICAM instrument spanning 2004-2018. The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram method was applied to analyze the power spectra of both signals around this period, calibrated using peaks associated with the seasonal Martian cycle. This method was validated by analyzing power spectra of chemical species abundances in Earth's atmosphere, obtained from the NRLMSISE$-$00 empirical model provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Model executions reproduced chemical abundance data for various atmospheric species (N$_2$, O$_2$, N, H$_2$, Ar, and He) at two reference heights (upper mesosphere and low ionosphere) over a 1961-2021 time span. Results suggest a connection between variability in H$_2$O vapor concentration in Mars' atmosphere and fluctuations in the Pectinton solar flux index. We propose the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram method as a heuristic for studying oscillatory activity in planetary atmospheres with non-uniformly sampled data. While our results provide valuable insights, further analysis, cross-referencing with data from different orbiters, is required to deepen our understanding of these findings in the fields of planetary climatology and atmospheric physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays of energies up to a few PeV are believed to be of galactic origin, yet individual sources have still not been firmly identified. Due to inelastic collisions with the interstellar gas, cosmic-ray nuclei produce a diffuse flux of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. Fermi-LAT has provided maps of galactic gamma-rays at GeV energies which can be produced by both hadronic and leptonic processes. Neutrinos, on the other hand, are exclusively produced by the sought-after hadronic processes, yet they can be detected above backgrounds only at hundreds of TeV. Oftentimes, diffuse emission maps are extrapolated from GeV to PeV energies, but the sources contributing at either energies likely differ. We have modelled the production of diffuse emission from GeV through PeV energies in a Monte Carlo approach, taking into consideration the discrete nature of sources. We can generate realisations of the diffuse sky in a matter of seconds, thus allowing for characterising correlations in direction and energy. At hundreds of TeV, relevant for observations with LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube and the upcoming SWGO, variations between different realisations are sizeable. Specifically, we show that extrapolations of diffuse emission from GeV to PeV energies must fail and apply our results on the recent experimental findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Our goal is to calculate the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way, along with corresponding uncertainties that quantify various sources of systematic uncertainty in a self-consistent manner. The observed rotational velocities are described as circular velocities minus the asymmetric drift. The latter is described by the radial axisymmetric Jeans equation. We thus reconstruct the circular velocity curve between Galactocentric distances from 5 kpc to 14 kpc using a Bayesian inference approach. The estimated error bars quantify uncertainties in the Sun's Galactocentric distance and the spatial-kinematic morphology of the tracer stars. As tracers, we used a sample of roughly 0.6 million stars on the red giant branch stars with six-dimensional phase-space coordinates from Gaia data release 3 (DR3). More than 99% of the sample is confined to a quarter of the stellar disc with mean radial, rotational, and vertical velocity dispersions of $(35\pm 18)\,\rm km/s$, $(25\pm 13)\,\rm km/s$, and $(19\pm 9)\,\rm km/s$, respectively. We find a circular velocity curve with a slope of $0.4\pm 0.6\,\rm km/s/kpc$, which is consistent with a flat curve within the uncertainties. We further estimate a circular velocity at the Sun's position of $v_c(R_0)=233\pm7\, \rm km/s$ and that a region in the Sun's vicinity, characterised by a physical length scale of $\sim 1\,\rm kpc$, moves with a bulk motion of $V_{LSR} =7\pm 7\,\rm km/s$. Finally, we estimate that the dark matter (DM) mass within 14 kpc is $\log_{10}M_{\rm DM}(R<14\, {\rm kpc})/{\rm M_{\odot}}= \left(11.2^{+2.0}_{-2.3}\right)$ and the local spherically averaged DM density is $\rho_{\rm DM}(R_0)=\left(0.41^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\right)\,{\rm GeV/cm^3}=\left(0.011^{+0.003}_{-0.002}\right)\,{\rm M_\odot/pc^3}$. In addition, the effect of biased distance estimates on our results is assessed.
#### Revised Constraints on the fast radio burst population from the first  CHIME/FRB catalog

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We first reconstruct the extragalactic dispersion measure -- redshift relation ($\mathrm{DM_E} - z$ relation) from well-localized FRBs, then use it to infer redshift and isotropic energy of the first CHIME/FRB catalog. The intrinsic energy distribution is modeled by the power law with an exponential cutoff, and the selection effect of the CHIME telescope is modeled by a two-parametric function of specific fluence. For the intrinsic redshift distribution, the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as other five SFH-related models are considered. We construct the joint likelihood of fluence, energy and redshift, and all the free parameters are constrained simultaneously using Bayesian inference method. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used to choose the model that best matches the observational data. For comparison, we fit our models with two data samples, i.e. the Full sample and the Gold sample. The power-law index and cutoff energy are tightly constrained to be $1.8 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 2.0$ and $\mathrm{log}(E_c/{\rm erg}) \approx 42.5$, which are almost independent of the redshift distribution model and the data sample we choose. The parameters involving the selection effect strongly depends on the data sample, but are insensitive to the redshift distribution model. According to BIC, the pure SFH model is strongly disfavored by both the Full sample and Gold sample. For the rest five SFH-related redshift distribution models, most of them can match the data well if the parameters are properly chosen. Therefore, with the present data, it is still premature to draw a conclusive conclusion on the FRB population.

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a systematic analysis of the gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs) light curves detected in the SPI-ACS experiment onboard the INTEGRAL observatory aimed to search extended emission. The emission occasionally recorded after the prompt active phase of a GRB in the form of an emission that is longer than the active phase and less intense is called the extended one. Out of the 739 brightest GRBs recorded from 2002 to 2017, extended emission has been detected in $\sim20\%$ of the individual light curves; its maximum duration reaches $\sim 10000$ s. Two different types of extended emission have been revealed. One of them is an additional component of the light curve and is described by a power law (PL) with an index $\alpha \sim -1$ close to the PL index of the afterglow in the optical and X-ray bands. The second type can be described by a steeper PL decay of the light curve typical of the active burst phase. Extended emission has also been found in the combined light curve of long GRBs in the individual curves of which no extended emission has been detected. The PL index of the extended emission in the combined light curve is $\alpha \sim -2.4$. It is most likely associated with the superposition of light curves at the active phase; its total duration is $\sim 800$ s.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical polarized foregrounds represent the most critical challenge in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode experiments. Multi-frequency observations can be used to constrain astrophysical foregrounds to isolate the CMB contribution. However, recent observations indicate that foreground emission may be more complex than anticipated. We investigate how the increased spectral resolution provided by band splitting in Bolometric Interferometry (BI) through a technique called spectral imaging can help control the foreground contamination in the case of unaccounted Galactic dust frequency decorrelation along the line-of-sight. We focus on the next generation ground-based CMB experiment CMB-S4, and compare its anticipated sensitivities, frequency and sky coverage with a hypothetical version of the same experiment based on BI. We perform a Monte-Carlo analysis based on parametric component separation methods (FGBuster and Commander) and compute the likelihood on the recovered tensor-to-scalar ratio. The main result of this analysis is that spectral imaging allows us to detect systematic uncertainties on r from frequency decorrelation when this effect is not accounted for in component separation. Conversely, an imager would detect a biased value of r and would be unable to spot the presence of a systematic effect. We find a similar result in the reconstruction of the dust spectral index, where we show that with BI we can measure more precisely the dust spectral index also when frequency decorrelation is present. The in-band frequency resolution provided by BI allows us to identify dust LOS frequency decorrelation residuals where an imager of similar performance would fail. This opens the prospect to exploit this potential in the context of future CMB polarization experiments that will be challenged by complex foregrounds in their quest for B-modes detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of the Fermi satellite in 2008, with its Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board, has opened a new era for the study of gamma-ray sources at GeV ($10^9$ eV) energies. Similarly, the commissioning of the third generation of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) - H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS - in the mid-2000's has firmly established the field of TeV ($10^{12}$ eV) gamma-ray astronomy. Together, these instruments have revolutionised our understanding of the high-energy gamma-ray sky, and they continue to provide access to it over more than six decades in energy. In recent years, the ground-level particle detector arrays HAWC, Tibet, and LHAASO have opened a new window to gamma rays of the highest energies, beyond 100 TeV. Soon, next-generation facilities such as CTA and SWGO will provide even better sensitivity, thus promising a bright future for the field. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of methods commonly employed for the analysis of gamma-ray data, focusing on those used for Fermi-LAT and IACT observations. We describe the standard data formats, explain event reconstruction and selection algorithms, and cover in detail high-level analysis approaches for imaging and extraction of spectra, including aperture photometry as well as advanced likelihood techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 We present solar low-degree rotational splitting values based on a new analysis of Sun-as-a-star observations from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network, covering a 16,425-day period from 1976 December 31--2021 December 20 with a duty cycle of 57 per cent. The splitting values are estimated from the power spectrum using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method, and we also present for comparison the results from an analysis of 100 realizations of synthetic data with the same resolution and gap structure. Comparison of the scatter in the results from the synthetic realizations with their estimated uncertainties suggests that for this data set the formal uncertainty estimates are about 30 per cent too small. An upward bias in the splittings at frequencies above 2200 microHz, where the components are not fully resolved, is seen in both the observed and synthetic data. When this bias is taken into account our results are consistent with a frequency-independent synodic rotational splitting value of 400 nHz.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array and the KM3NeT neutrino telescopes are major upcoming facilities in the fields of $\gamma$-ray and neutrino astronomy, respectively. Possible simultaneous production of $\gamma$ rays and neutrinos in astrophysical accelerators of cosmic-ray nuclei motivates a combination of their data. We assess the potential of a combined analysis of CTA and KM3NeT data to determine the contribution of hadronic emission processes in known Galactic $\gamma$-ray emitters, comparing this result to the cases of two separate analyses. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of Gammapy, an open-source software package for the analysis of $\gamma$-ray data, to also process data from neutrino telescopes. For a selection of prototypical $\gamma$-ray sources within our Galaxy, we obtain models for primary proton and electron spectra in the hadronic and leptonic emission scenario, respectively, by fitting published $\gamma$-ray spectra. Using these models and instrument response functions for both detectors, we employ the Gammapy package to generate pseudo data sets, where we assume 200 hours of CTA observations and 10 years of KM3NeT detector operation. We then apply a three-dimensional binned likelihood analysis to these data sets, separately for each instrument and jointly for both. We find that the largest benefit of the combined analysis lies in the possibility of a consistent modelling of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission. Assuming a purely leptonic scenario as input, we obtain, for the most favourable source, an average expected 68% credible interval that constrains the contribution of hadronic processes to the observed $\gamma$-ray emission to below 15%.
#### Doppler confirmation of TESS planet candidate TOI1408.01: grazing  transit and likely eccentric orbit

 - **Abstract**
 We report an independent Doppler confirmation of the TESS planet candidate orbiting an F-type main sequence star TOI-1408 located 140 pc away. We present a set of radial velocities obtained with a high-resolution fiber-optic spectrograph FFOREST mounted at the SAO RAS 6-m telescope (BTA-6). Our self-consistent analysis of these Doppler data and TESS photometry suggests a grazing transit such that the planet obscures its host star by only a portion of the visible disc. Because of this degeneracy, the radius of TOI-1408.01 appears ill-determined with lower limit about $\sim$1 R$_{\rm Jup}$, significantly larger than in the current TESS solution. We also derive the planet mass of $1.69\pm0.20$~$M_{\rm Jup}$ and the orbital period $\sim4.425$ days, thus making this object a typical hot Jupiter, but with a significant orbital eccentricity of $0.259\pm0.026$. Our solution may suggest the planet is likely to experience a high tidal eccentricity migration at the stage of intense orbital rounding, or may indicate possible presence of other unseen companions in the system, yet to be detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic nuclei showing recurrent phases of activity and quiescence have recently been discovered, with recurrence times as short as a few hours to a day -- known as quasi-periodic X-ray eruption (QPE) sources -- to as long as hundreds to a thousand days for repeating nuclear transients (RNTs). Here we report the discovery of Swift J023017.0+283603 (hereafter Swift J0230+28), a source that exhibits X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions from the nucleus of a previously unremarkable galaxy at $\sim$ 165 Mpc, with a recurrence time of approximately 22 days, an intermediary timescale between known RNTs and QPE sources. We also report transient radio emission from the source, which is likely associated with the X-ray eruptions. Such recurrent soft X-ray eruptions from a low-mass black hole, with no accompanying UV/optical emission are strikingly similar to QPE sources. However, in addition to having a recurrence time that is $\sim 25$ times longer than the longest-known QPE source, Swift J0230+28's eruptions exhibit slightly distinct shapes and temperature evolution than the known QPE sources. The observed properties disfavor disk instability models, and instead favor scenarios involving extreme mass ratio inspirals. Our discovery reveals a new timescale for repeating extragalactic transients and highlights the need for a wide-field, time-domain X-ray mission, which would enable the exploration of the parameter space of recurring X-ray transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We present forecasts on cosmological parameters for a CMB-HD survey. For a $\Lambda$CDM + $N_{eff}$ + $\sum m_\nu$ model, we find $\sigma(n_s) = 0.0013$ and $\sigma(N_{eff}) = 0.014$ using CMB and CMB lensing multipoles in the range of $\ell \in [30, 20000]$, after adding anticipated residual foregrounds, delensing the acoustic peaks, and adding DESI BAO data. This is about a factor of two improvement in ability to probe inflation via $n_s$ compared to precursor CMB surveys. The $N_{eff}$ constraint can rule out light thermal particles back to the end of inflation with 95% CL; for example, it can rule out the QCD axion in a model-independent way assuming the Universe's reheating temperature was high enough that the axion thermalized. We find that delensing the acoustic peaks and adding DESI BAO tightens parameter constraints. We also find that baryonic effects can bias parameters if not marginalized over, and that uncertainties in baryonic effects can increase parameter error bars; however, the latter can be mitigated by including information about baryonic effects from kinetic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements by CMB-HD. The CMB-HD likelihood and Fisher estimation codes used here are publicly available; the likelihood is integrated with Cobaya to facilitate parameter forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 The Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) is a project by scientists and engineers from 14 countries and 78 institutions to design and build the first wide-field, ground-based gamma-ray observatory in the Southern Hemisphere, with high duty cycle and covering an energy range rom hundreds of GeV to the PeV scale. The observatory will cover the Southern sky and aims to map the Galaxy's large-scale emission, as well as detecting transient and variable phenomena. The host sites under consideration are at a minimum altitude of 4400 m.a.s.l. and comprise two types: flat plateaus of at least 1 km$^{2}$ for the installation of an array of tank-based water Cherenkov detectors (WCD), or large natural lakes for the direct deployment of WCD units. Four South American countries proposed excellent sites to host the observatory meeting these requirements. Argentina proposed two locations in the Salta province, Bolivia presented one site in Chacaltaya, Chile two locations within the Atacama Astronomical Park, and Peru two ground-based locations in the Arequipa district as well as lakes in the Cuzco region. The SWGO collaboration is currently conducting a site characterization study, gathering all the necessary information for site shortlisting and final site selection by the end of 2023. The process has reached the shortlisting phase, in which primary and backup sites for each country have been identified. The primary sites were visited by a team of experts from the collaboration, to investigate and validate the proposed site characteristics. Here we present an update on these site selection activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric retrievals (AR) of exoplanets typically rely on a combination of a Bayesian inference technique and a forward simulator to estimate atmospheric properties from an observed spectrum. A key component in simulating spectra is the pressure-temperature (PT) profile, which describes the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Current AR pipelines commonly use ad hoc fitting functions here that limit the retrieved PT profiles to simple approximations, but still use a relatively large number of parameters. In this work, we introduce a conceptually new, data-driven parameterization scheme for physically consistent PT profiles that does not require explicit assumptions about the functional form of the PT profiles and uses fewer parameters than existing methods. Our approach consists of a latent variable model (based on a neural network) that learns a distribution over functions (PT profiles). Each profile is represented by a low-dimensional vector that can be used to condition a decoder network that maps $P$ to $T$. When training and evaluating our method on two publicly available datasets of self-consistent PT profiles, we find that our method achieves, on average, better fit quality than existing baseline methods, despite using fewer parameters. In an AR based on existing literature, our model (using two parameters) produces a tighter, more accurate posterior for the PT profile than the five-parameter polynomial baseline, while also speeding up the retrieval by more than a factor of three. By providing parametric access to physically consistent PT profiles, and by reducing the number of parameters required to describe a PT profile (thereby reducing computational cost or freeing resources for additional parameters of interest), our method can help improve AR and thus our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and their habitability.
#### Is NanoGRAV signals pointing towards resonant particle creation during  inflation?

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the observed cosmic gravitational wave background by the NANOGrav 15-year collaboration may be the result of resonant particle creation during inflation. For the appropriate amplitude and particle mass an enhancement of the primordial scalar power spectrum could induce Secondary Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW) which will appear on a scale corresponding to the frequency of the NANOGrav detection. Since the resonant creation will have an effect comparable to that of a delta function increment as studied by the NANOGrav 15-year collaboration, our study indicates that the low-frequency Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data could reveal the aspects of the physics during inflation through the detection of a cosmic background of Gravitational Waves (GW).

 - **Abstract**
 The Ch-type asteroid (130) Elektra is orbited by three moons, making it the first quadruple system in the main asteroid belt. We aim to characterise the irregular shape of Elektra and construct a complete orbital model of its unique moon system. We applied the All-Data Asteroid Modelling (ADAM) algorithm to 60 light curves of Elektra, including our new measurements, 46 adaptive-optics (AO) images obtained by the VLT/SPHERE and Keck/Nirc2 instruments, and two stellar occultation profiles. For the orbital model, we used an advanced $N$-body integrator, which includes a multipole expansion of the central body (with terms up to the order $\ell = 6$), mutual perturbations, internal tides, as well as the external tide of the Sun acting on the orbits. We fitted the astrometry measured with respect to the central body and also relatively, with respect to the moons themselves. We obtained a revised shape model of Elektra with the volume-equivalent diameter $(201\pm 2)\,{\rm km}$. Out of two pole solutions, $(\lambda, \beta) = (189; -88)\,{\rm deg}$ is preferred, because the other one leads to an incorrect orbital evolution of the moons. We also identified the true orbital period of the third moon S/2014 (130) 2 as $P_2 = (1.642112 \pm 0.000400)\,{\rm d}$, which is in between the other periods, $P_1 \simeq 1.212\,{\rm d}$, $P_3 \simeq 5.300\,{\rm d}$, of S/2014 (130) 1 and S/2003 (130) 1, respectively. The resulting mass of Elektra, $(6.606 \substack{+0.007 \\ -0.013}) \times 10^{18}\,{\rm kg}$, is precisely constrained by all three orbits. Its bulk density is then $(1.536 \pm 0.038)\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$. The expansion with the assumption of homogeneous interior leads to the oblateness $J_2 = -C_{20} \simeq 0.16$. However, the best-fit precession rates indicate a slightly higher value, ${\simeq}\,0.18$.
#### Correlating high-energy IceCube neutrinos with 5BZCAT blazars and RFC  sources

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that blazars in the Roma-BZCAT Multifrequency Catalogue of Blazars (5BZCAT) are sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, as recently suggested by Buson et al. (2022a,b). Although we can reproduce their $\sim 4.6\, \sigma$ result, which applies to 7 years of neutrino data in the Southern sky, we find no significant correlation with 5BZCAT sources when extending the search to the Northern sky, where IceCube is most sensitive to astrophysical signals. To further test this scenario, we use a larger sample consisting of 10 years of neutrino data recently released by the IceCube collaboration, this time finding no significant correlation in either the Southern or the Northern sky. These results suggest that the strong correlation reported by Buson et al. (2022a,b) using 5BZCAT could be due to a statistical fluctuation and possibly the spatial and flux non-uniformities in the blazar sample. We perform some additional correlation tests using the more uniform, flux-limited, and blazar-dominated Radio Fundamental Catalogue (RFC) and find a $\sim 3.2\sigma$ equivalent p-value when correlating it with the 7-year Southern neutrino sky. However, this correlation disappears completely when extending the analysis to the Northern sky and when analyzing 10 years of all-sky neutrino data. Our findings support a scenario where the contribution of the whole blazar class to the IceCube signal is relevant but not dominant, in agreement with most previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present hybrid spectral energy distributions, combining photon and neutrino fluxes, for a sample of blazars, which are candidate IceCube neutrino sources. We furthermore check for differences in our sources' variability in the near-infrared, optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands compared to a sample of non-neutrino source candidate blazars, and investigate the state of each blazar at the arrival time of high-energy neutrinos. We find no significant differences when comparing our sample with control sources, also in terms of their spectral energy distributions, and no correlation between flaring states and neutrino arrival times. Looking for signatures of hadronic production, we check for similar strengths of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes and find a $2.2\,\sigma$ signal for our source candidates. The hybrid spectral energy distributions assembled here will form the basis of the next step of our project, namely lepto-hadronic modelling of these blazars to assess the physical likelihood of a neutrino connection.

 We have carried detailed time-resolved timing analysis of an intermediate polar V709 Cas using the long-baseline, short-cadence optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We found an orbital period of 5.3341 $\pm$ 0.0004 hr, a spin period of 312.75 $\pm$ 0.02 sec, and a beat period of 317.93 $\pm$ 0.03 sec, which is similar to the earlier published results. From the continuous high cadence data, we found that V709 Cas is a disc overflow system with disc-fed dominance.
#### HCN emission from translucent gas and UV-illuminated cloud edges  revealed by wide-field IRAM 30m maps of Orion B GMC: Revisiting its role as  tracer of the dense gas reservoir for star formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present 5 deg^2 (~250 pc^2) HCN, HNC, HCO+, and CO J=1-0 maps of the Orion B GMC, complemented with existing wide-field [CI] 492 GHz maps, as well as new pointed observations of rotationally excited HCN, HNC, H13CN, and HN13C lines. We detect anomalous HCN J=1-0 hyperfine structure line emission almost everywhere in the cloud. About 70% of the total HCN J=1-0 luminosity arises from gas at A_V < 8 mag. The HCN/CO J=1-0 line intensity ratio shows a bimodal behavior with an inflection point at A_V < 3 mag typical of translucent gas and UV-illuminated cloud edges. We find that most of the HCN J=1-0 emission arises from extended gas with n(H2) < 10^4 cm^-3, even lower density gas if the ionization fraction is > 10^-5 and electron excitation dominates. This result explains the low-A_V branch of the HCN/CO J=1-0 intensity ratio distribution. Indeed, the highest HCN/CO ratios (~0.1) at A_V < 3 mag correspond to regions of high [CI] 492 GHz/CO J=1-0 intensity ratios (>1) characteristic of low-density PDRs. Enhanced FUV radiation favors the formation and excitation of HCN on large scales, not only in dense star-forming clumps. The low surface brightness HCN and HCO+ J=1-0 emission scale with I_FIR (a proxy of the stellar FUV radiation field) in a similar way. Together with CO J=1-0, these lines respond to increasing I_FIR up to G0~20. On the other hand, the bright HCN J=1-0 emission from dense gas in star-forming clumps weakly responds to I_FIR once the FUV radiation field becomes too intense (G0>1500). The different power law scalings (produced by different chemistries, densities, and line excitation regimes) in a single but spatially resolved GMC resemble the variety of Kennicutt-Schmidt law indexes found in galaxy averages. As a corollary for extragalactic studies, we conclude that high HCN/CO J=1-0 line intensity ratios do not always imply the presence of dense gas.
