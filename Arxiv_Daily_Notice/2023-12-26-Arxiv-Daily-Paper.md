#### A Fully Explicit Integrator for Modeling Astrophysical Reactive Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Simulating complex astrophysical reacting flows is computationally expensive -- reactions are stiff and typically require implicit integration methods. The reaction update is often the most expensive part of a simulation, which motivates the exploration of more economical methods. In this research note, we investigate how the explicit Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev (RKC) method performs compared to an implicit method when applied to astrophysical reactive flows. These integrators are applied to simulations of X-ray bursts arising from unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted fuel on the surface of neutron stars. We show that the RKC method performs with similar accuracy to our traditional implicit integrator, but is more computationally efficient when run on CPUs.
#### Beyond mirkwood: Enhancing SED Modeling with Conformal Predictions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14212
 - **Abstract**
 Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques face uncertainties due to assumptions in star formation histories and dust attenuation curves. We propose an advanced machine learning-based approach that enhances flexibility and uncertainty quantification in SED fitting. Unlike the fixed NGBoost model used in mirkwood, our approach allows for any sklearn-compatible model, including deterministic models. We incorporate conformalized quantile regression to convert point predictions into error bars, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Using CatBoost as the base predictor, we compare results with and without conformal prediction, demonstrating improved performance using metrics such as coverage and interval width. Our method offers a more versatile and accurate tool for deriving galaxy physical properties from observational data.
#### Inertial Waves in a Nonlinear Simulation of the Sun's Convection Zone  and Radiative Interior

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of Rossby waves and other more exotic forms of inertial oscillations in the Sun's convection zone have kindled the hope that such waves might be used as a seismic probe of the Sun's interior. Here we present a 3D numerical simulation in spherical geometry that models the Sun's convection zone and upper radiative interior. This model features a wide variety of inertial oscillations, including both sectoral and tesseral equatorial Rossby waves, retrograde mixed inertial modes, prograde thermal Rossby waves, the recently observed high-frequency retrograde (HFR) vorticity modes, and what may be latitudinal overtones of these HFR modes. With this model, we demonstrate that sectoral and tesseral Rossby waves are ubiquitous within the radiative interior as well as within the convection zone. We suggest that there are two different Rossby-wave families in this simulation that live in different wave cavities: one in the radiative interior and one in the convection zone. Finally, we suggest that many of the retrograde inertial waves that appear in the convection zone, including the HFR modes, are in fact all related, being latitudinal overtones that are mixed modes with the prograde thermal Rossby waves.
#### Cometary outbursts in the Oort cloud
 - **Authors:** D. V. Belousov (1), A. K. Pavlov (1) ((1) Ioffe Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia)

 - **Abstract**
 Comet nuclei in the outer Solar system are constantly irradiated by cosmic rays at low temperatures. Accumulated high concentrations of radicals can undergo fast recombination with significant heating of cometary surface layers. We present the model of comet activity at large heliocentric distances caused by the recombination of radicals. We found that the considered mechanism can cause activity of comets in distant regions of the Solar system, even at the Oort cloud distances. Outbursts in distant comet reservoirs can be a new source of dust and ice particles contributing to the recently discovered anomalous diffuse light in the cosmic extragalactic background optic light. The orbits of small-radii comets in the Oort cloud are highly influenced by cometary outbursts. This effect may account for the observed decrease in the number of small-radius long-period comets.
#### Probing scalar induced gravitational waves with PTA and LISA: The  Importance of third order correction

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the calculation of third order \acp{SIGW} and extend it from a monochromatic primordial power spectrum to a more general log-normal one. We investigate the impact of third order SIGWs on \ac{SNR} of \ac{LISA} and \ac{PTA} observations, and find that third order SIGWs significantly contribute to the total energy density spectrum of \acp{GW} in high-frequency region. For a primordial power spectrum amplitude of $A_{\zeta}=10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$, the effects of third order SIGWs lead to a $40\%$ to $400\%$ increase in the SNR for LISA. Additionally, our PTA data analysis reveals that third order SIGWs diminish both the amplitude $A_{\zeta}$ and the peak frequency $f_*$ of the primordial power spectrum.
#### Dynamical structures associated with high-order and secondary resonances  in the spin-orbit problem

 - **Abstract**
 In our Solar system, spin-orbit resonances are common under Sun--planet, planet--satellite and binary asteroid configurations. In this work, high-order and secondary spin-orbit resonances are investigated by taking numerical and analytical approaches. Poincar\'e sections as well as two types of dynamical maps are produced, showing that there are complicated structures in the phase space. To understand numerical structures, we adopt the theory of perturbative treatments to formulate resonant Hamiltonian for describing spin-orbit resonances. Results show that there is an excellent agreement between analytical and numerical structures. It is concluded that the main V-shape structure arising in the parameter space $(\dot\theta,\alpha)$ is sculpted by the synchronous primary resonance, those minute structures inside the V-shape region are dominated by secondary resonances and those structures outside the V-shape region are governed by high-order resonances. At last, the analytical approach is applied to binary asteroid systems (65803) Didymos and (4383) Suruga to reveal their phase-space structures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an initial analysis of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) flagging statistics from archived Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations for the 'Survey and Monitoring of ASKAP's RFI environment and Trends' (SMART) project. The survey component covers ASKAP's full 700 MHz to 1800 MHz frequency range, including bands not typically used due to severe RFI. In addition to this dedicated survey, we routinely archive and analyse flagging statistics for all scientific observations to monitor the observatory's RFI environment in near real-time. We use the telescope itself as a very sensitive RFI monitor and directly assess the fraction of scientific observations impacted by RFI. To this end, flag tables are now automatically ingested and aggregated as part of routine ASKAP operations for all science observations, as a function of frequency and time. The data presented in this paper come from processing all archived data for several ASKAP Survey Science Projects (SSPs). We found that the average amount of flagging due to RFI across the routinely-used 'clean' continuum science bands is 3%. The 'clean' mid band from 1293 MHz to 1437 MHz (excluding the 144 MHz below 1293 MHz impacted by radionavigation-satellites which is discarded before processing) is the least affected by RFI, followed by the 'clean' low band from 742 MHz to 1085 MHz. ASKAP SSPs lose most of their data to the mobile service in the low band, aeronautical service in the mid band and satellite navigation service in the 1510 MHz to 1797 MHz high band. We also show that for some of these services, the percentage of discarded data has been increasing year-on-year. SMART provides a unique opportunity to study ASKAP's changing RFI environment and informing the implementation of a suite of RFI mitigation techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 We present very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the hyperactive repeating FRB 20220912A using the European VLBI Network (EVN) with an EVN-Lite setup. We detected 150 bursts from FRB 20220912A over two observing epochs in October 2022. Combining the data of these bursts allows us to localise FRB 20220912A to a precision of a few milliarcseconds, corresponding to a transverse scale of less than 10 pc at the distance of the source. The precision of this localisation shows that FRB 20220912A lies closer to the centre of its host galaxy than previously found, although still significantly offset from the host galaxy's nucleus. On arcsecond scales, FRB 20220912A is coincident with a persistent continuum radio source known from archival observations, however, we find no compact persistent emission on milliarcsecond scales. The persistent radio emission is thus likely to be from star-formation in the host galaxy. This is in contrast to some other active FRBs, such as FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B.

 - **Abstract**
 In this proceedings, we study the possible gravitational impact of primordial black holes (PBHs) or dark matter (DM) clumps on GNSS satellite orbits and gravimeter measurements. It provides a preliminary step to the future exhaustive statistical analysis over 28 years of gravimeter and GNSS data to get constraints over the density of asteroid-mass PBH and DM clumps inside the solar system. Such constraints would be the first to be obtained by direct observation on a terrestrial scale.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory is a unique facility designed to study ultra-high energy cosmic rays, with energies up to 10$^{20}$ eV and beyond. The Observatory is located in Argentina and comprises more than 1600 water Cherenkov detectors spread over an area of 3000 square kilometers overlooked by Fluorescence detectors. The first phase of the Observatory's data-taking began in 2004 and continued until the end of 2021. In this contribution, the results from the Phase~I data analysis of the Pierre Auger Observatory are presented. They include, among others, measurements of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum, composition, and arrival direction anisotropy. The Phase~I results from the Pierre Auger Observatory provide major advances in the understanding of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray phenomena and lay the foundation for second-phase studies with the upgraded AugerPrime detector. The status of the AugerPrime upgrade and its performance will be also discussed.
#### À Propos Nonlinear Pulsations of R CrB Variables

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14693
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14693
 - **Abstract**
 Helium-star models were dynamically evolved into the region of the HR Diagram where R CrB variables are found. The MESA stellar evolution code was able to pick up pulsational instabilities with cycle lengths that are compatible with the periods observed in pulsating R CrB variables. The properties of the computed pulsations hint at their being strange modes.
#### Very high-energy gamma rays from GRB 180720B and GRB 190829A with  external Compton emission

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) comprise of short, bright, energetic flashes of emission from extragalactic sources followed by a longer afterglow phase of decreased brightness. Recent discoveries of very-high-energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) afterglow emission from GRB 180720B and GRB 190829A by H.E.S.S. have raised questions regarding the emission mechanism responsible. We interpret these observed late-time emission to be the result of inverse Compton emission of ultra-relativistic electrons in the GRB blastwave in an external radiation field, i.e., external Compton (EC), considering both the wind and interstellar medium scenarios. We present predictions of multiwavelength light curves and energy spectra, ranging from optical to VHE, and include the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation mechanisms as well. We corrected the EC and SSC model for the $\gamma$-ray attenuation by absorption of photons through their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We compared our results to multiwavelength data and found that EC gives a satisfactory fit for a given set of fixed model parameters for GRB 180720B, whereas SSC result in a better fit for GRB 190829A. For both GRBs a wind environment is preferred over constant density inter-stellar medium, and the Cosmic Microwave Background as the external radiation field. However, with more data and an effective optimisation tool we can find a more robust fit of the model, implying better constraints on the GRB environment and the particle energy requirements for the emission observed at late times. This has consequences for future observations of GRBs at these extreme energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to IXPE , the X-ray spectro-polarimeter launched at the end of 2021, X-ray polarimetry has finally become an extraordinary tool in investigating the physics of accretion in low mass X-ray binaries. Similarly to what happened with gravitational waves, X-ray polarimetry would play a new complementary but at the same time fundamental role in the high-energy astrophysical domain. We summarize here the first 1.5 year results on accreting low-mass X-ray binaries obtained by a huge IXPE observation campaign coordinated with the principal X-ray and Gamma-ray telescopes. Then we compare these results with the theoretical prediction highlighting the unexpected results.
#### Truncated, Tilted Discs as a Possible Source of Quasi-Periodic  Oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 Many accreting black holes and neutron stars exhibit rapid variability in their X-ray light curves, termed quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The most commonly observed type is the low-frequency ($\lesssim 10$ Hz), type-C QPO, while only a handful of sources exhibit high-frequency QPOs ($\gtrsim 60$ Hz). The leading model for the type-C QPO is Lense-Thirring precession of a hot, geometrically thick accretion flow that is misaligned with the black hole's spin axis. However, existing versions of this model have not taken into account the effects of a surrounding, geometrically thin disc on the precessing, inner, geometrically thick flow. In Bollimpalli et. al 2023, using a set of GRMHD simulations of tilted, truncated accretion discs, we confirmed that the outer thin disc slows down the precession rate of the precessing torus, which has direct observational implications for type-C QPOs. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of those simulations and compare them with an aligned truncated disc simulation. We find that the misalignment of the disc excites additional variability in the inner hot flow, which is absent in the comparable aligned-disc simulations. This suggests that the misalignment may be a crucial requirement for producing QPOs. We attribute this variability to global vertical oscillations of the inner torus at epicyclic frequencies corresponding to the transition radius. This explanation is consistent with current observations of higher frequency QPOs in black hole X-ray binary systems.
#### Virialized Profiles and Oscillations of Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark  Matter Solitons

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14917
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14917
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of self-interactions on the shape and oscillations of the solitonic core profile of condensed fuzzy dark matter systems without the backdrop of a halo, revealing universal features in terms of an appropriately scaled interaction strength characterizing the crossover between the weakly- and strongly-interacting regimes. Our semi-analytical results are further confirmed by spherically symmetric simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations. Inverting our obtained relations, we highlight a degeneracy that could significantly affect constraints on the boson mass in the presence of repulsive boson self-interactions and propose the simultaneous extraction of static and dynamical solitonic features as a way to uniquely constrain both the boson mass and self-interactions.
