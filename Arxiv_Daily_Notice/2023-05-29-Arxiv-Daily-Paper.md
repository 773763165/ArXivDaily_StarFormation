 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed the thermal and turbulent properties of the Low-Latitude Intermediate-Velocity Arch 1 (LLIV1). This was accomplished using archival H I emission and absorption data from two 21,cm line surveys: GHIGLS at $9.^\prime$4 resolution and DHIGLS at $1^\prime$ resolution. The spectral decomposition code $\tt{ROHSA}$ was used to model the column density of different thermal phases and also to analyze an absorption measurement against the radio source 4C~+66.09. From the latter we found spin temperature $T_{\mathrm{s}} \sim 75$K, cold gas mass fraction $f\sim0.5$, and turbulent sonic Mach number $M_t\sim3.4$. Similar to the absorption line modeling against 4C~+66.09, our best emission line decomposition model has no unstable gas across the whole field of view, suggesting that the thermal condensation and phase transition are not on-going but rather have reached an equilibrium state. The cold phase of LLIV1 appears as a collection of elongated filaments that forms a closed structure within the field decomposed. These substructures follow the orientation of the overall large scale cloud, along the diagonal of the GHIGLS field from north-west to south-east (in Galactic coordinates). The angular power spectrum of the cold phase is slightly shallower than that of the warm phase, quantifying that the cold phases have relatively more structure on small scales. Our spatially resolved map of the cold gas mass fraction in LLIV1 from DHIGLS reveals significant variations spanning the possible range of $f$, with mean and standard deviation 0.33 and 0.19, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a Cherenkov detector located at the South Pole. Its main component consists of an in-ice array of optical modules instrumenting one cubic kilometer of deep Glacial ice. The DeepCore sub-detector is a denser in-fill array with a lower energy threshold, allowing us to study atmospheric neutrinos oscillations with energy below 100 GeV arriving through the Earth. We present preliminary results of an atmospheric muon neutrino disappearance analysis using data from 2012 to 2021 and employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for precise and fast event reconstructions.

 - **Abstract**
 Heliophysics image data largely relies on a forty-year-old ecosystem built on the venerable Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) data standard. While many in situ measurements use newer standards, they are difficult to integrate with multiple data streams required to develop global understanding. Additionally, most data users still engage with data in much the same way as they did decades ago. However, contemporary missions and models require much more complex support for 3D multi-parameter data, robust data assimilation strategies, and integration of multiple individual data streams required to derive complete physical characterizations of the Sun and Heliospheric plasma environment. In this white paper we highlight some of the 21$^\mathsf{st}$ century challenges for data frameworks in heliophysics, consider an illustrative case study, and make recommendations for important steps the field can take to modernize its data products and data usage models. Our specific recommendations include: (1) Investing in data assimilation capability to drive advanced data-constrained models, (2) Investing in new strategies for integrating data across multiple instruments to realize measurements that cannot be produced from single observations, (3) Rethinking old data use paradigms to improve user access, develop deep understanding, and decrease barrier to entry for new datasets, and (4) Investing in research on data formats better suited for multi-dimensional data and cloud-based computing.
#### Sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array to TeV photon emission from  the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 A deep survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud at ~0.1-100TeV photon energies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array is planned. We assess the detection prospects based on a model for the emission of the galaxy, comprising the four known TeV emitters, mock populations of sources, and interstellar emission on galactic scales. We also assess the detectability of 30 Doradus and SN 1987A, and the constraints that can be derived on the nature of dark matter. The survey will allow for fine spectral studies of N157B, N132D, LMC P3, and 30 Doradus C, and half a dozen other sources should be revealed, mainly pulsar-powered objects. The remnant from SN 1987A could be detected if it produces cosmic-ray nuclei with a flat power-law spectrum at high energies, or with a steeper index 2.3-2.4 pending a flux increase by a factor >3-4 over ~2015-2035. Large-scale interstellar emission remains mostly out of reach of the survey if its >10GeV spectrum has a soft photon index ~2.7, but degree-scale 0.1-10TeV pion-decay emission could be detected if the cosmic-ray spectrum hardens above >100GeV. The 30 Doradus star-forming region is detectable if acceleration efficiency is on the order of 1-10% of the mechanical luminosity and diffusion is suppressed by two orders of magnitude within <100pc. Finally, the survey could probe the canonical velocity-averaged cross section for self-annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles for cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Many of the short-lived radioactive nuclei that were present in the early Solar System can be produced in massive stars. In the first paper in this series (Brinkman et al. 2019), we focused on the production of $^{26}$Al in massive binaries. In our second paper (Brinkman et al. 2021), we considered rotating single stars, two more short-lived radioactive nuclei, $^{36}$Cl and $^{41}$Ca, and the comparison to the early Solar System data. In this work, we update our previous conclusions by further considering the impact of binary interactions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code with an extended nuclear network to compute massive (10-80 M$ _{\odot} $), binary stars at various initial periods and solar metallicity (Z=0.014), up to the onset of core collapse. The early Solar System abundances of $^{26}$Al and $^{41}$Ca can be matched self-consistently by models with initial masses $\geq$25 M$_{\odot}$, while models with initial primary masses $\geq$35 M$_{\odot}$ can also match $^{36}$Cl. Almost none of the models provide positive net yields for $^{19}$F, while for $^{22}$Ne the net yields are positive from 30 M$_{\odot}$ and higher. This leads to an increase by a factor of approximately 4 in the amount of $^{22}$Ne produced by a stellar population of binary stars, relative to single stars. Also, besides the impact on the stellar yields, our 10 M$_{\odot}$ primary star undergoing Case A mass-transfer ends its life as a white dwarf instead of as a core-collapse supernova. This demonstrates that binary interactions can also strongly impact the evolution of stars close to the supernova boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigations of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) have revealed that exotic new phases, the so called {\it color superconducting phases}, may arise at very high baryon densities. It is speculated that these exotic phases may arise in the cores of neutron stars. Focus on neutrons stars has tremendously intensified in recent years with the direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) by LIGO/Virgo from BNS merger events which has allowed the possibility of directly probing the properties of the interior of a neutron star. A remarkable phenomenon manifested by rapidly rotating neutron stars is in their {\it avatar} as {\it Pulsars}. The accuracy of pulsar timing can reach the level of one part in 10$^{15}$, comparable to that of atomic clocks. This suggests that even a tiny deformation of the pulsar can leave its imprints on the pulses by inducing tiny perturbations in the entire moment of inertia (MI) tensor affecting the pulse timings, as well as the pulse profile (from wobbling induced by off-diagonal MI components). This may allow a new probe of various phase transitions occurring inside a pulsar core through induced density fluctuations affecting the MI tensor. Such perturbations also naturally induce a rapidly changing quadrupole moment of the star, thereby providing a new source of gravitational wave emission. Another remarkable possibility arises when we consider the effect of an external GW on neutron star. With the possibility of detecting any minute changes in its configuration through pulse observations, the neutron star has the potential of performing as a Weber detector of gravitational wave. This brief review will focus on these specific aspects of a pulsar. Specifically, the focus will be on the type of physics which can be probed by utilizing the effect of changes in the MI tensor of the pulsar on pulse properties.
#### Awesome SOSS: Atmospheric Characterisation of WASP-96 b using the JWST  Early Release Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The newly operational JWST offers the potential to study the atmospheres of distant worlds with precision that has not been achieved before. One of the first exoplanets observed by JWST in the summer of 2022 was WASP-96 b, a hot-Saturn orbiting a G8 star. As part of the Early Release Observations program, one transit of WASP-96 b was observed with NIRISS/SOSS to capture its transmission spectrum from 0.6-2.85 microns. In this work, we utilise four retrieval frameworks to report precise and robust measurements of WASP-96 b's atmospheric composition. We constrain the logarithmic volume mixing ratios of multiple chemical species in its atmosphere, including: H$_2$O = $-3.59 ^{+ 0.35 }_{- 0.35 }$, CO$_2$ = $-4.38 ^{+ 0.47 }_{- 0.57 }$ and K = $-8.04 ^{+ 1.22 }_{- 1.71 }$. Notably, our results offer a first abundance constraint on potassium in WASP-96 b's atmosphere, and important inferences on carbon-bearing species such as CO$_2$ and CO. Our short wavelength NIRISS/SOSS data are best explained by the presence of an enhanced Rayleigh scattering slope, despite previous inferences of a clear atmosphere - although we find no evidence for a grey cloud deck. Finally, we explore the data resolution required to appropriately interpret observations using NIRISS/SOSS. We find that our inferences are robust against different binning schemes. That is, from low $R = 125$ to the native resolution of the instrument, the bulk atmospheric properties of the planet are consistent. Our systematic analysis of these exquisite observations demonstrates the power of NIRISS/SOSS to detect and constrain multiple molecular and atomic species in the atmospheres of hot giant planets.

 The future is now - after its long-awaited launch in December 2021, JWST began science operations in July 2022 and is already revolutionizing exoplanet astronomy. The Early Release Observations (ERO) program was designed to provide the first images and spectra from JWST, covering a multitude of science cases and using multiple modes of each on-board instrument. Here, we present transmission spectroscopy observations of the hot-Saturn WASP-96b with the Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, observed as part of the ERO program. As the SOSS mode presents some unique data reduction challenges, we provide an in-depth walk-through of the major steps necessary for the reduction of SOSS data: including background subtraction, correction of 1/f noise, and treatment of the trace order overlap. We furthermore offer potential routes to correct for field star contamination, which can occur due to the SOSS mode's slitless nature. By comparing our extracted transmission spectrum with grids of atmosphere models, we find an atmosphere metallicity between 1x and 5x solar, and a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio. Moreover, our models indicate that no grey cloud deck is required to fit WASP-96b's transmission spectrum, but find evidence for a slope shortward of 0.9$\mu$m, which could either be caused by enhanced Rayleigh scattering or the red wing of a pressure-broadened Na feature. Our work demonstrates the unique capabilities of the SOSS mode for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy and presents a step-by-step reduction guide for this new and exciting instrument.
