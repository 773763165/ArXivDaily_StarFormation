          The First Evidence of a Host Star Metallicity Cut-off In The Formation of Super-Earth Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation is expected to be severely limited in disks of low metallicity, owing to both the small solid mass reservoir and the low opacity accelerating the disk gas dissipation. While previous studies have found a weak correlation between the occurrence rates of small planets ($\leq$4R$_\oplus$) and stellar metallicity, so far no studies have probed below the metallicity limit beyond which planet formation is predicted to be suppressed. Here, we constructed a large catalog of ~110,000 metal-poor stars observed by the TESS mission with spectroscopically-derived metallicities, and systematically probed planet formation within the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.5) for the first time. Extrapolating known higher-metallicity trends for small, short-period planets predicts the discovery of ~68 superEarths around these stars (~85,000 stars) after accounting for survey completeness; however, we detect none. As a result, we have placed the most stringent upper limit on super-Earth occurrence rates around metal-poor stars (-0.75 < [Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.5) to date, $\leq$ 1.67%, a statistically significant (p-value=0.000685) deviation from the prediction of metallicity trends derived with Kepler and K2. We find a clear host star metallicity cliff for super-Earths that could indicate the threshold below which planets are unable to grow beyond an Earth-mass at short orbital periods. This finding provides a crucial input to planet formation theories, and has implications for the small planet inventory of the Galaxy and the galactic epoch at which the formation of small planets started.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multiwavelength observations of the Swift short $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 231117A, localized to an underlying galaxy at redshift $z = 0.257$ at a small projected offset ($\sim 2~$kpc). We uncover long-lived X-ray (Chandra) and radio/millimeter (VLA, MeerKAT, and ALMA) afterglow emission, detected to $\sim 37~$days and $\sim 20~$days (rest frame), respectively. We measure a wide jet ($\sim 10.4^\circ$) and relatively high circumburst density ($\sim 0.07~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) compared to the short GRB population. Our data cannot be easily fit with a standard forward shock model, but they are generally well fit with the incorporation of a refreshed forward shock and a reverse shock at $< 1~$day. We incorporate GRB 231117A into a larger sample of 132 X-ray detected events, 71 of which were radio-observed (17 cm-band detections), for a systematic study of the distributions of redshifts, jet and afterglow properties, galactocentric offsets, and local environments of events with and without detected radio afterglows. Compared to the entire short GRB population, the majority of radio-detected GRBs are at relatively low redshifts ($z < 0.6$) and have high circumburst densities ($> 10^{-2}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$), consistent with their smaller ($< 8~$kpc) projected galactocentric offsets. We additionally find that 70% of short GRBs with opening angle measurements were radio-detected, indicating the importance of radio afterglows in jet measurements, especially in the cases of wide ($> 10^\circ$) jets where observational evidence of collimation may only be detectable at radio wavelengths. Owing to improved observing strategies and the emergence of sensitive radio facilities, the number of radio-detected short GRBs has quadrupled in the past decade.

          The Impact of $\texttt{CLEAN}$ing on Strong Gravitational Lens Modelling

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparison of image and uv-plane galaxy-galaxy strong lensing modelling results for simulated ALMA observations with different antenna configurations and on-source integration times. Image-plane modelling is carried out via use of the $\texttt{CLEAN}$ algorithm, and we explore the effects of different visibility weighting schemes on the inferred lens model parameters. We find that direct modelling of the visibility data consistently outperforms image-plane modelling for both the naturally and Briggs-weighted images. We also find that the modelling of images created with Briggs weighting generally produces more accurate results than those obtained by modelling images constructed with natural weighting. We explain this by quantifying the suppression of information due to $\texttt{CLEAN}$ing on scales at which the modelling is sensitive, and how this differs between Briggs and natural weighting. At higher resolutions, the differences between the lens modelling techniques are much less pronounced and overall, modelling errors are significantly reduced. We also find that time-binning the visibilities by up to a factor of three makes no significant difference to the inferred lens parameters when directly modelling in the uv-plane. This work provides some guidance on navigating the many choices faced when modelling strong lens interferometric imaging data.

          Living at the Edge: A Critical Look at the Cosmological Neutrino Mass Bound

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological neutrino mass bounds are becoming increasingly stringent. The latest limit within $\Lambda$CDM from Planck 2018+ACT lensing+DESI is $\sum m_\nu < 0.072\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% CL, very close to the minimum possible sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu > 0.06\,{\rm eV}$), hinting at vanishing or even ''negative'' cosmological neutrino masses. In this context, it is urgent to carefully evaluate the origin of these cosmological constraints. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of these results in three ways: i) we check the role of potential anomalies in Planck CMB and DESI BAO data; ii) we compare the results for frequentist and Bayesian techniques, as very close to physical boundaries subtleties in the derivation and interpretation of constraints can arise; iii) we investigate how deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, potentially alleviating these anomalies, can alter the constraints. From a profile likelihood analysis, we derive constraints in agreement at the $\sim 10\%$ level with Bayesian posteriors. We find that the weak preference for negative neutrino masses is mostly present for Planck 18 data, affected by the well-known `lensing anomaly'. It disappears when the new Planck 2020 HiLLiPoP is used, leading to significantly weaker constraints. Additionally, the pull towards negative masses in DESI data stems from the $z=0.7$ bin, which is in $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with Planck expectations. Without these outliers, and in combination with HiLLiPoP, the bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu < 0.11\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% CL. The recent preference for dynamical dark energy alleviates this tension and further weakens the bound. As we are at the dawn of a neutrino mass discovery from cosmology, it will be very exciting to see if this trend is confirmed by future data.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy supplies detailed information on their atmospheric composition, physics, and chemistry. Prior to JWST, these observations were limited to a narrow wavelength range across the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared, alongside broadband photometry at longer wavelengths. To understand more complex properties of exoplanet atmospheres, improved wavelength coverage and resolution are necessary to robustly quantify the influence of a broader range of absorbing molecular species. Here we present a combined analysis of JWST transmission spectroscopy across four different instrumental modes spanning 0.5-5.2 micron using Early Release Science observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b. Our uniform analysis constrains the orbital and stellar parameters within sub-percent precision, including matching the precision obtained by the most precise asteroseismology measurements of stellar density to-date, and further confirms the presence of Na, K, H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, and SO$_2$ atmospheric absorbers. Through this process, we also improve the agreement between the transmission spectra of all modes, except for the NIRSpec PRISM, which is affected by partial saturation of the detector. This work provides strong evidence that uniform light curve analysis is an important aspect to ensuring reliability when comparing the high-precision transmission spectra provided by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 We are in a golden era observing Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), protoplanetary disks, and substellar objects, crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. This Ph.D. thesis explores two binary systems. Firstly, we study an eruptive YSO, HBC 494, using ALMA band 6 (1.3 mm) observations. It's a FUor system in Orion Molecular Cloud with a resolved binary system: HBC 494 N (primary) and HBC 494 S (secondary) separated by 75 au. The disks show hints of aligned formation scenarios, with HBC 494 N being brighter and larger. Molecular line observations reveal bipolar outflows and rotating envelopes. Cavity features within the continuum disks' area suggest continuum over-subtraction or slow-moving jets and chemical destruction along the line-of-sight. Secondly, we examine the young binary system $\eta$ Tel using VLT/SPHERE H band imaging. It consists of an A-type star and a brown dwarf companion $\eta$ Tel B, separated by 208 au. Astrometric measurements over 19 years yield a low eccentric orbit with an inclination of 81.9 degrees. The mass of $\eta$ Tel B is determined to be 48 M$_{Jup}$, consistent with previous literature. No significant residual indicative of a satellite or disk surrounding the companion is detected, with limits ruling out massive objects around $\eta$ Tel B at separations down to 33 au with masses as low as 1.6M$_{Jup}$. These studies employ sub-mm to near-IR observations, highlighting the complexity of (sub)stellar formation/evolution. This thesis contributes diverse analyses, providing insights into these intriguing processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Stability is one of the most fundamental aspects regarding planetary systems. It plays an important role in our understanding on the formation channel of the planetary systems, as well as their habitability. Many approaches have been adopted to determine the stability of these systems, including brute-force N-body simulations, semi-analytical calculations, and more recently machine learning methods. This allows significant advances in our understanding of planetary system dynamics, as well as providing tools to constrain unknown parameters of exoplanetary systems (assuming these systems are stable). In the following, we focus on planets around single star hosts, and we provide an overview of the studies of planetary system stability for compact multi-planet systems and hierarchical multi-planet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of star formation results in binaries or higher multiple systems, and planets in such systems are constrained to a limited range of orbital parameters in order to remain stable against perturbations from stellar companions. Many planets have been discovered in such multiple systems (such as stellar binaries), and understanding their stability is important in exoplanet searches and characterization. In this chapter, we focus on the orbital stability of planets in stellar binaries. We review key results based on semi-analytical secular (long term) methods, as well as results based on N-body simulations and more recent Machine Learning methods. We discuss planets orbiting one of the stellar binary components (S-type) and those orbiting both stars (P-type) separately.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic Microwave Background experiments need to measure polarization properties of the incoming radiation very accurately to achieve their scientific goals. As a result of that, it is necessary to properly characterize these instruments. However, there are not natural sources that can be used for this purpose. For this reason, we developed the PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, which is a calibrator source designed for the 90 GHz band of these telescopes. This source is purely polarized and the direction of the polarization vector is known with an accuracy better than 0.1 deg. This source flew for the first time in May 2022 showing promising result.

 - **Abstract**
 China Space Station Telescope (CSST) has the capability to conduct slitless spectroscopic survey simultaneously with photometric survey. The spectroscopic survey will measure slitless spectra, potentially providing more accurate estimations of galaxy properties, particularly redshift, compared to broadband photometry. However, due to low-resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of slitless spectra, measurement of these properties is significantly challenging. In this study, we employ a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to assess the accuracy of redshift estimations from slitless spectra anticipated to be observed by CSST. The slitless spectra are simulated based on real data from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI-EDR) and the 16th data release of the Baryon Oscillaton Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS-DR16), combining the 9th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey (DESI LS DR9). The BNN provides redshifts estimates along with corresponding uncertainties, achieving an accuracy of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.00063$, outlier percentage $\eta=0.92\%$ and weighted mean uncertainty $\bar{E} = 0.00228$. These results successfully meet the requirement for cosmological studies using slitless spectra from CSST.

 - **Abstract**
 The Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) is developing a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) system for the Kodaikanal Tower Telescope (KTT). In this context, we have measured the daytime turbulence strength profile at the Kodaikanal Observatory. The first method based on wavefront sensor (WFS) images, called S-DIMM+ (Solar-Differential Image Motion Monitor+), was used to estimate the higher altitude turbulence up to a height of 5 - 6 km. The second method used balloon-borne temperature sensors to measure the near-Earth turbulence up to 350 m. We also carried out simulations to validate the performance of our system. We report the first-ever daytime turbulence strength profile measurements at the observatory. We have identified the presence of a strong turbulence layer about 3 km above the observatory. The measured near-Earth turbulence matches the trend that is expected from the model for daytime component of turbulence and gives an integrated $r_0$ of about 4 cm at 500 nm. This is consistent with earlier seeing measurements. This shows that a low-cost setup with a small telescope and a simple array of temperature sensors can be used for estimating the turbulence strength profile at the site.

 - **Abstract**
 The Thermal Management Integrated System (TheMIS) is a key element of the Australia-Italy Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) mission, launched in a 510km Polar Sun-Synchronous orbit in December 2023. SpIRIT is a 6U CubeSat led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with ASI, with support from ASA and with contributions from Australian space industry and international research organizations. The TheMIS subsystem actively cools and controls the temperature of sensitive instruments, increasing the potential range of payloads supported on small spacecraft systems. TheMIS core functionality is based on a commercial Stirling Cycle Cryocooler in-principle capable of reaching cold-tip temperatures below T=100K. The cooler is operated by customized control electronics and is connected to deployable radiators through pyrolytic graphite sheet thermal straps, all developed by the University of Melbourne. Until now, this level of thermal control has been relatively uncommon in nanosatellites. TheMIS aims to validate the design and performance by controlling the thermal environment of SpIRIT's HERMES payload, an X-ray instrument provided by ASI which has a noise background strongly sensitive to temperature. Beyond SpIRIT, TheMIS has the potential to support a broad range of applications, including holding infrared focal plane arrays at cryogenic temperatures, and increasing resilience of electronics to space weather. This paper provides an overview of TheMIS's design, implementation, and operational performance, detailing the commissioning phase and the early results obtained from its operations in orbit, with comparison to the thermal model developed during the mission environmental testing campaign. Finally, the paper discusses ongoing challenges for thermal management of payloads in small satellite systems and potential future strategies for continuous improvement

 - **Abstract**
 The Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) 6U CubeSat is a mission led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with the Italian Space Agency. Launched in a 510 km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit in December 2023, SpIRIT carries multiple subsystems for scientific and technology demonstration. The main payload is the HERMES instrument for detection of high-energy astrophysics transients (Gamma Ray Bursts), and for studies of their variability at scales below 1 ms. The satellite includes a novel thermal management system for its class, based on a Stirling-cycle cooler and deployable thermal radiator, designed to cool HERMES to reduce instrumental background noise. A low-latency communication subsystem based on a sat-phone network is supporting rapid transmission of time-critical data and telecommands. SpIRIT is also equipped with a set of RGB and thermal IR cameras, connected to an on-board image processing unit with artificial intelligence capabilities for autonomous feature recognition. To effectively manage all interfaces between different subsystems and mission stakeholders, the University of Melbourne developed an instrument control unit (PMS) which operates all payloads. PMS also provides backup uninterruptible power to the HERMES instrument through a supercapacitor-based UPS for safe instrument shutdown in case of platform power interruptions. This paper first presents a mission and payload overview, and early in-orbit results, along with lessons learned throughout the mission. This work not only sheds light on the novelty of some of the on-board technologies onboard and on their potential impact to enable greater utilization of CubeSats for scientific missions, but also offers insights into the practical challenges and accomplishments related to developing and operating a multi-organization CubeSat with a complex array of instruments and systems.

 - **Abstract**
 From the turbulent interstellar medium to the cosmic web, astronomers in many different fields have needed to make sense of spatial data describing our Universe, spanning centimetre to Gigaparsec scales. Through different historical choices for mathematical conventions, many different subfields of spatial data analysis have evolved their own language for analysing structures and quantifying correlation in spatial data. Because of this history, terminology from a myriad of different fields is used, often to describe two data products that are mathematically identical. In this Note, we define and describe the differences and similarities between the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the covariance function, the semivariogram, and the structure functions, in an effort to unify the languages used to study spatial correlation. We also highlight under which conditions these data products are useful and describe how the results found using one method can be translated to those found using another, allowing for easier comparison between different subfields' native methods. We hope for this document to be a ``Rosetta Stone" for translating between different statistical approaches, allowing results to be shared between researchers from different backgrounds, facilitating more cross-disciplinary approaches to data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-IFU is one of the two instruments of ATHENA, the next ESA large X-ray observatory. It is a cryogenic spectrometer based on an array of TES microcalorimeters. To reduce the particle background, the TES array works in combination with a Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC). The CryoAC is a 4-pixel detector, based on ~1 cm2 silicon absorbers sensed by Ir/Au TES. It is required to have a wide energy bandwidth (from 20 keV to ~1 MeV), high efficiency (< 0.014% missed particles), low dead-time (< 1%) and good time-tagging accuracy (10 us at 1 sigma). An end-to-end simulator of the CryoAC detector has been developed both for design and performance assessment, consisting of several modules. First, the in-flight flux of background particles is evaluated by Geant4 simulations. Then, the current flow in the TES is evaluated by solving the electro-thermal equations of microcalorimeters, and the detector output signal is generated by simulating the SQUID FLL dynamics. Finally, the output is analyzed by a high-efficiency trigger algorithm, producing the simulated CryoAC telemetry. Here, we present in detail this end-to-end simulator, and how we are using it to define the new CryoAC baseline configuration in the new Athena context.

          Formation and desorption of sulfur chains (H$_2$S$_x$ and S$_x$) in cometary ice: effects of ice composition and temperature

 - **Abstract**
 The reservoir of sulfur accounting for sulfur depletion in the gas of dense clouds and circumstellar regions is still unclear. One possibility is the formation of sulfur chains, which would be difficult to detect by spectroscopic techniques. This work explores the formation of sulfur chains experimentally, both in pure H$_2$S ice samples and in H$_2$O:H$_2$S ice mixtures. An ultra-high vacuum chamber, ISAC, eqquipped with FTIR and QMS, was used for the experiments. Our results show that the formation of H$_2$S$_x$ species is efficient, not only in pure H$_2$S ice samples, but also in water-rich ice samples. Large sulfur chains are formed more efficiently at low temperatures ($\approx$10 K), while high temperatures ($\approx$50 K) favour the formation of short sulfur chains. Mass spectra of H$_2$S$_x$, x~=~2-6, species are presented for the first time. Their analysis suggests that H$_2$S$_x$ species are favoured in comparison with S$_x$ chains. Nevertheless, the detection of several S$_x^+$ fragments at high temperatures in H$_2$S:H$_2$O ice mixtures suggests the presence of S$_8$ in the irradiated ice samples, which could sublimate from 260~K. ROSINA instrument data from the cometary Rosetta mission detected mass-to-charge ratios 96 and 128. Comparing these detections with our experiments, we propose two alternatives: 1) H$_2$S$_4$ and H$_2$S$_5$ to be responsible of those S$_3^+$ and S$_4^+$ cations, respectively, or 2) S$_8$ species, sublimating and being fragmented in the mass spectrometer. If S$_8$ is the parent molecule, then S$_5^+$ and S$_6^+$ cations could be also detected in future missions by broadening the mass spectrometer range.

          Isotropic cosmic birefringence from an oscillating axion-like field

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new mechanism for isotropic cosmic birefringence with an axion-like field that rapidly oscillates during the recombination epoch. In conventional models, the field oscillation during the recombination epoch leads to a cancellation of the birefringence effect and significantly suppresses the EB spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. By introducing an asymmetric potential to the axion, this cancellation becomes incomplete, and a substantial EB spectrum can be produced. This mechanism also results in a washout of the EE spectrum, which can be probed in future CMB observations. Our findings suggest the possibility that an axion-like field responsible for isotropic cosmic birefringence can also account for a significant fraction of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope (CE) evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disk after tidal disruption is $\sim$$0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WD.

 - **Abstract**
 The term "unstable neutral media" (UNM) has traditionally been used to describe the transient phase formed between the warm and cold neutral hydrogen (HI) phases and has not been the focus of HI studies. However, recent observations suggest that the UNM phase not only has a significantly longer-than-expected lifetime but also occupies at least 20\% to 40\% of both the volume and mass fraction of HI. In this paper, we argue that the existence and dominance of the UNM can be explained by the presence of strong turbulence using an energy balance argument. The mass fraction of UNM is directly proportional to the turbulent velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$: mass fraction of UNM $\propto \sigma_v^{\frac{2n}{1+n}}$, where $n$ is the absolute value of the adiabatic index in the unstable phase. We discuss the implications of long-lived unstable thermal phases on ISM physics, including cold dense filament formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and measurement of galactic foreground statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. B supergiants (BSGs) represent an important connection between the main sequence and more extreme evolutionary stages of massive stars. Additionally, lying toward the cool end of the hot star regime, determining their wind properties is crucial to constrain the evolution and feedback of massive stars as, for instance, they might manifest the bi-stability jump phenomenon. Aims. We undertake a detailed analysis of a representative sample of 18 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) BSGs within the ULLYSES and XShootU datasets. Our UV and optical analysis spans BSGs from B0 to B8 - covering the bi-stability jump region. We aim to evaluate their evolutionary status and verify what their wind properties say about the bi-stability jump in a low-metallicity environment. Methods. We used the CMFGEN to model the spectra and photometry (from UV to infrared) of our sample. We compare our results with different evolutionary models, with previous determinations in the literature of OB stars, and with diverging mass-loss recipes at the bi-stability jump. Additionally, we provide the first BSG models in the SMC including X-rays. Results. (i) Within a single-stellar evolution framework, the evolutionary status of early BSGs seem less clear than that of late BSGs, which agree with H-shell burning models. (ii) UV analysis shows evidence that BSGs contain X-rays in their atmospheres, for which we provide constraints. In general, we find higher X-ray luminosity (close to the standard log(L_X/L) ~ -7) for early BSGs. For cooler BSGs, lower values are preferred, log(L_X/L) ~ -8.5. (iii) The obtained mass-loss rates suggest neither a jump nor a monotonic decrease with temperature. Instead, a rather constant trend is observed, which is at odds with the increase found for Galactic BSGs. (iv) The wind velocity behavior with temperature shows a sharp drop at ~19 kK, similar to what is observed for Galactic BSGs.

 In this contribution, we aim to summarise the efforts of the Italian SKA scientific community in conducting surveys of star-forming regions within our Galaxy, in the development of astrochemical research on protostellar envelopes and disks, and in studying the planet formation process itself. The objective is dual: Firstly, to investigate the accumulation and development of dust throughout the formation of planets, and secondly, to chemically examine protoplanetary disks and protostellar envelopes by studying heavy molecules, such as chains and rings containing over seven carbon atoms, which exhibit significantly reduced strength at millimeter wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaseous X-ray polarimetry refers to a class of detectors used for measuring the polarization of soft X-rays. The systematic effects of such detectors introduce residual modulation, leading to systematic biases in the polarization detection results of the source. This paper discusses the systematic effects and their calibration and correction using the Gas Microchannel Plate-Pixel Detector (GMPD) prototype for POLAR-2/Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD). Additionally, we propose an algorithm that combines parameterization with Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian iteration to eliminate residual modulation. The residual modulation after data correction at different energy points has been reduced to below 1%, and a good linear relationship is observed between the polarization degree and modulation degree. The improvement in modulation degree after correction ranges from 2% to 15%, and the results exceed those of the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) above 5 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 Variations in X-ray and EUV irradiance during solar flares lead to a noticeable increase in the electron concentration in the illuminated part of the Earth's ionosphere. Due to the large amount of experimental data accumulated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the total electron content (TEC) response to the impulsive phase of a solar flare has been studied quite well. However, recent studies have shown that large fraction of X-class flares have second strong peak of warm coronal emission (which is called 'EUV late phase'), whose influence on the ionization of ionospheric layers is not yet clear. A combined analysis of successive solar emissions and the caused TEC changes made it possible to numerically estimate the ionospheric response to the impulsive, gradual, and late phases of the X2.9 solar flare occurred on 2011 November 3 and demonstrate the high geoeffectiveness of the rather weak Fe XV 28.4 nm solar emission during the EUV late phase. It was found that the ionospheric response to the relatively weak emissions of the EUV late phase of the X2.9 solar flare amounted to almost a third of the TEC increase during the impulsive phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Provenance data from astronomical pipelines are instrumental in establishing trust and reproducibility in the data processing and products. In addition, astronomers can query their provenance to answer questions routed in areas such as anomaly detection, recommendation, and prediction. The next generation of astronomical survey telescopes such as the Vera Rubin Observatory or Square Kilometre Array, are capable of producing peta to exabyte scale data, thereby amplifying the importance of even small improvements to the efficiency of provenance storage or querying. In order to determine how astronomers should store and query their provenance data, this paper reports on a comparison between the turtle and JSON provenance serialisations. The triple store Apache Jena Fuseki and the graph database system Neo4j were selected as representative database management systems (DBMS) for turtle and JSON, respectively. Simulated provenance data was uploaded to and queried over each DBMS and the metrics measured for comparison were the accuracy and timing of the queries as well as the data upload times. It was found that both serialisations are competent for this purpose, and both have similar query accuracy. The turtle provenance was found to be more efficient at storing and uploading the data. Regarding queries, for small datasets ($<$5MB) and simple information retrieval queries, the turtle serialisation was also found to be more efficient. However, queries for JSON serialised provenance were found to be more efficient for more complex queries which involved matching patterns across the DBMS, this effect scaled with the size of the queried provenance.

          Towards a universal analytical model for Population III star formation: interplay between feedback and fragmentation

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has brought us new insights into Cosmic Dawn with tentative detection of the unique signatures of metal-free Population III (Pop III) stars, such as strong HeII emission, extremely blue UV spectrum, and enhanced nitrogen abundance. Self-consistent theoretical predictions of the formation rates, sites, and masses of Pop III stars are crucial for interpreting the observations, but are challenging due to complex physical processes operating over the large range of length scales involved. One solution is to combine analytical models for the small-scale star formation process with cosmological simulations that capture the large-scale physics such as structure formation, radiation backgrounds, and baryon-dark matter streaming motion that regulate the conditions of Pop III star formation. We build an analytical model to predict the final masses of Pop III stars/clusters from the properties of star-forming clouds, based on the key results of small-scale star formation simulations and stellar evolution models. Our model for the first time considers the interplay between feedback and fragmentation and covers different modes of Pop III star formation ranging from ordinary small ($\sim 10-2000\ \rm M_\odot$) clusters in molecular-cooling clouds to massive ($\gtrsim 10^{4}\ \rm M_\odot$) clusters containing supermassive ($\sim 10^{4}-3\times 10^{5}\ \rm M_\odot$) stars under violent collapse of atomic-cooling clouds. As an example, the model is applied to the Pop III star-forming clouds in the progenitors of typical haloes hosting high-$z$ luminous quasars, which shows that formation of Pop III massive clusters is common ($\sim 20-70\%$) in such biased ($\sim4\sigma$) regions, and the resulting heavy black hole seeds from supermassive stars can account for a significant fraction of observed luminous ($\gtrsim 10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$) quasars at $z\sim 6$.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide yields from 189 neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations covering zero-age main sequence masses between 11 and 75 solar masses and three different metallicities. Our CCSN simulations have two main advantages compared to previous methods used for applications in Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Firstly, the mass cut between remnant and ejecta evolves naturally. Secondly, the neutrino luminosities and thus the electron fraction are not modified. Both is key to obtain an accurate nucleosynthesis. We follow the composition with an in-situ nuclear reaction network including the 16 most abundant isotopes and use the yields as input in a GCE model of the Milky Way. We adopt a GCE which takes into account infall of gas as well as nucleosynthesis from a large variety of stellar sources. The GCE model is calibrated to reproduce the main features of the solar vicinity. For the CCSN models, we use different calibrations and propagate the uncertainty. We find a big impact of the CCSN yields on our GCE predictions. We compare the abundance ratios of C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ti, and Cr with respect to Fe to an observational data set as homogeneous as possible. From this, we conclude that at least half of the massive stars have to explode to match the observed abundance ratios. If the explosions are too energetic, the high amount of iron will suppress the abundance ratios. With this, we demonstrate how GCE models can be used to constrain the evolution and deaths of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The wavelength dependent refraction of light in the atmosphere causes the chromatic dispersion of a target on the focal plane of an instrument. This is known as atmospheric dispersion, with one of the consequences being wavelength dependent flux losses which are difficult to minimise, requiring analysis in both instrument design and operations. We present Atmosphyre, a novel python package developed to characterise the impact of atmospheric dispersion on a spectrograph, with a focus on fibre multi-object spectrographs (MOS) which will be at the forefront of ground-based astronomy for the next few decades. We show example simulations and provide recommendations for minimising fibre MOS flux losses. We conclude that the guiding wavelength should typically be bluer than the observing band mid-wavelength, around 25-45% of the way through the band. The aperture should be centred on this wavelength's location on the focal plane. This wavelength/position remains constant for all reasonable declinations and target hour angles. We also present an application of the package to MOSAIC, the ELT's multi-object spectrograph. We find that differential losses greater than 10% are unavoidable for 1h observations that are a) after a local hour angle of 2.5h, or b) at declinations below -60 degrees and above 10 degrees. We identify that the introduction of an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) would result in the significant reduction of spectral distortions, a gain in survey speed for many observations, and enable the implementation of wider visible observing bands; as a result, there has been a proposal to adopt ADCs at a positioner level for MOSAIC. Future work includes adding field differential refraction to Atmosphyre, important for future wide-field multi-object spectrograph projects such as the proposed WST.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of JWST, we acquire unprecedented insights into the physical and chemical structure of the inner regions of planet-forming disks where terrestrial planet formation occurs. The very low-mass stars (VLMS) are known to have a high occurrence rate of the terrestrial planets around them. Exploring the chemical composition of the gas in these inner regions of the disks can aid a better understanding of the connection between planet-forming disks and planets. The MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) project is a large JWST Guaranteed Time program to characterize the chemistry and physical state of planet-forming and debris disks. We use the JWST-MIRI/MRS spectrum to investigate the gas and dust composition of the planet-forming disk around the very low-mass star Sz28 (M5.5, 0.12\,M$_{\odot}$). We use the dust-fitting tool (DuCK) to determine the dust continuum and to get constraints on the dust composition and grain sizes. We use 0D slab models to identify and fit the molecular spectral features, yielding estimates on the temperature, column density and the emitting area. To test our understanding of the chemistry in the disks around VLMS, we employ the thermo-chemical disk model {P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O}} and investigate the reservoirs of the detected hydrocarbons. We explore how the C/O ratio affects the inner disk chemistry. JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including \ce{CH3}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H2}, \ce{^{13}CCH2}, \ce{C2H6}, \ce{C3H4}, \ce{C4H2} and \ce{C6H6} suggesting a disk with a gaseous C/O\,>\,1. Additionally, we detect \ce{CO2}, \ce{^{13}CO2}, \ce{HCN}, and \ce{HC3N}. \ce{H2O} and OH are absent in the spectrum. We do not detect PAHs. Photospheric stellar absorption lines of \ce{H2O} and \ce{CO} are identified. Notably, our radiation thermo-chemical disk models are able to produce these detected hydrocarbons in the surface layers of the disk when the ...

 - **Abstract**
 Gas giant planets are formed by gas accretion onto planetary cores in protoplanetary disks. However, direct evidence of this process is still lacking, limiting our understanding of planetary formation processes. During mass accretion, planet-driven outflows may be launched, which could be observable by shock tracers such as sulfur monoxide (SO). We report the detection of SO gas in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya in archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. The $\rm SO\ J=8_7 - 7_6\ $ emission line is detected at a $6\sigma$ significance and localized to the southeast region of the disk with an arc-like morphology. The line center is red-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity by $\sim5\ \rm km\ s^{-1}$. The starting point of the SO emission is located at a planet-carved dust gap at $42$ au. We attribute this to an outflow driven by an embedded protoplanet. Indeed, the observed morphology is well reproduced by a ballistic outflow model. The outflow velocity suggests that the outflow launching source has a mass of $\sim 4 M_\oplus\ (0.012 M_{\rm Jup})$ and the mass-loss rate is $3\times10^{-8} - 1\times10^{-6}\ M_{\rm Jup}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$. With the relation of mass-loss and mass-accretion rates established for protostars, we estimated the mass-accretion rate onto the protoplanet to be $3\times10^{-7} - 1\times10^{-5}\ M_{\rm Jup}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$, which matches theoretical predictions for a $\sim 4 M_\oplus$ planet at this separation. The detection of planet-driven outflow provides us a unique opportunity to directly probe the earliest phase of gas giant planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The use of flexures to achieve fibre positioner motion is being actively investigated by several institutes, for example at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) and Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. One challenge when designing with flexures is the large number of degrees of freedom available which makes it difficult or impossible to optimise their motion by hand. In this paper we demonstrate two approaches for optimising flexure geometry to follow arbitrary focal surface curvature and to orient the optical fibre with arbitrary tilt. These approaches are: analytical using MATLAB models and FEA based using Ansys. The approaches are complementary allowing the designer to efficiently explore the parameter space and then do precise optimisation of the flexure geometry. We demonstrate the applicability both to the UKATCs preferred design for WST, and to flexure-based fibre positioner designs generally. We also present a sensitivity analysis relating small changes in design parameters to changes in fibre tip motion. Finally we briefly present the UKATCs preferred geometry for the WST fibre positioner.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-common path quasi-static and differential aberrations are one of the big hurdles of direct imaging for current and future high-contrast imaging instruments. They increase speckle and photon noise thus reducing the achievable contrast and lead to a significant hit in HCI performance. The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) will provide high-contrast imaging, including vortex coronagraphy in L, M and N bands, with the ultimate goal of directly imaging temperate rocky planets around the nearest stars. Ground-based mid-infrared observations are however also impacted by water vapor inhomogeneities in the atmosphere, which generate additional chromatic turbulence not corrected by the near-infrared adaptive optics. This additional source of wavefront error (WFE) significantly impacts HCI performance, and even dominates the WFE budget in N band. Instantaneous focal plane wavefront sensing is thus required to mitigate its impact. In this context, we propose to implement a novel wavefront sensing approach for the vortex coronagraph using an asymmetric Lyot stop and machine learning. The asymmetric pupil stop allows for the problem to become solvable, lifting the ambiguity on the sign of even Zernike modes. Choosing the Lyot plane instead of the entrance pupil for this mask is also not arbitrary: it preserves the rejection efficiency of the coronagraph and minimizes the impact of the asymmetry on the throughput. Last but not least, machine learning allows us to solve this inversion problem which is non-linear and lacks an analytical solution. In this contribution, we present our concept, our simulation framework, our results and a first laboratory demonstration of the technique.

 - **Abstract**
 High contrast imaging (HCI) is fundamentally limited by wavefront aberrations, and the ability to perform wavefront sensing from focal plane images is key to reach the full potential of ground and space-based instruments. Vortex focal plane mask coupled with downstream pupil (Lyot) stop stands as one of the best small-angle coronagraphs, but is also sensitive to low-order aberrations. Here, we revisit the behavior of the vortex phase mask, from entrance pupil down to the final detector plane, with Zernike polynomials as input phase aberrations. In particular we develop a second-order expansion that allows us to analyze the phase retrieval properties in a more intuitive and accurate way than previously proposed. With this formalism, we show how the azimuthal vortex modulation modifies the phase retrieval properties compared to normal imaging. In particular, our results suggest that images obtained with a scalar vortex coronagraph can be used for unambiguous focal-plane wavefront sensing in any practical situation. We compare our results with numerical simulations and discuss practical implementation in coronagraphic instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is the new near-infrared instrument at the VLT-UT4. ERIS replaces and extends the observational capabilities formerly provided by SINFONI and NACO: integral field spectroscopy at 1 - 2.5 $\mu$m, imaging at 1 - 5 $\mu$m with several options for high-contrast imaging, and long-slit spectroscopy. In particular, a vortex coronagraph is now available for high contrast observations at L and M band. It is implemented using annular groove (or vortex) phase masks (one for each of the L and M bands) in a focal plane, and a Lyot stop in a downstream pupil plane. The vortex coronagraph has a discovery space starting already at $\sim$1$\lambda/D$, and works well in broadbands. However, to reach its optimal performance, it is critical to correct for slow pointing errors onto the vortex phase mask, which mandates a dedicated pointing control strategy. To do so, a control loop based on the QACITS algorithm has been developed and commissioned for ERIS. Good pointing stability is now regularly achieved with errors between 0.01 and 0.02 $\lambda/D$ and a correction rate of 0.2 Hz. In this contribution, we first review the design of the ERIS vortex coronagraph. We then detail the implementation of the QACITS algorithm describing the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, the initial centering, and the stabilization during the observing template. We then discuss performance based on commissioning data in terms of pointing accuracy and stability. Finally, we present post-processed contrast curves obtained during commissioning and compare them with NACO vortex data, showing a significant improvement of about 1 mag at all separations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations have recently gathered substantial evidence for the existence of a gravitational wave background in the nHz frequency band. Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining its origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from cosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and future pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance matrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only set mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that percent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near future. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave background and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence of GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed independently. These results can be reproduced with \href{this https URL}{\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly available Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.
