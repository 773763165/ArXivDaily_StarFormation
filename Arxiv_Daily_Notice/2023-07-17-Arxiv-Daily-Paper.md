#### On the Short-Period Eclipsing High-Mass X-ray Binary in NGC 4214

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our study of the luminous (L_{X} ~ 10^{39} erg/s) X-ray binary CXOU J121538.2+361921 in NGC 4214, the high mass X-ray binary with the shortest known orbital period. Using Chandra data, we confirm the ~13,000 s (3.6 hr) eclipse period, and an eclipse duration of ~2000 s. From this, we estimate a mass ratio M_2/M_1 >~ 3 and a stellar density of about 6 g cm^{-3}, which implies that the donor must be a Wolf-Rayet or a stripped Helium star. The eclipse egress is consistently much slower than the ingress. This can be explained by denser gas located either in front of the compact object (as expected for a bow shock) or trailing the donor star (as expected for a shadow wind, launched from the shaded side of the donor). There is no change in X-ray spectral shape with changing flux during the egress, which suggests either variable partial covering of the X-ray source by opaque clumps or, more likely, a grey opacity dominated by electron scattering in a highly ionized medium. We identify the optical counterpart from Hubble images. Photometry blueward of ~5500 Ang indicates a bright (M_{B} = -3.6 +/- 0.3 mag, for a range of plausible extinctions), hot (T = 90,000 +/- 30,000 K) emitter, consistent with the Wolf-Rayet scenario. There is also a bright (M_{I} ~ -5.2 mag), cool (T = 2700 +/- 300 K) component consistent with an irradiated circumbinary disk or with a chance projection of an unrelated asymptotic giant branch star along the same line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and statistical studies have shown that giant planets are rare around M dwarfs compared with Sun-like stars. The formation mechanism of these extreme systems remains under debate for decades. With the help of the TESS mission and ground based follow-up observations, we report the discovery of TOI-4201b, the most massive and densest hot Jupiter around an M dwarf known so far with a radius of $1.22\pm 0.04\ R_J$ and a mass of $2.48\pm0.09\ M_J$, about 5 times heavier than most other giant planets around M dwarfs. It also has the highest planet-to-star mass ratio ($q\sim 4\times 10^{-3}$) among such systems. The host star is an early-M dwarf with a mass of $0.61\pm0.02\ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $0.63\pm0.02\ R_{\odot}$. It has significant super-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H]=$0.52\pm 0.08$ dex). However, interior structure modeling suggests that its planet TOI-4201b is metal-poor, which challenges the classical core-accretion correlation of stellar-planet metallicity, unless the planet is inflated by additional energy sources. Building on the detection of this planet, we compare the stellar metallicity distribution of four planetary groups: hot/warm Jupiters around G/M dwarfs. We find that hot/warm Jupiters show a similar metallicity dependence around G-type stars. For M dwarf host stars, the occurrence of hot Jupiters shows a much stronger correlation with iron abundance, while warm Jupiters display a weaker preference, indicating possible different formation histories.
#### Collisions of red giants in galactic nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 In stellar-dense environments, stars can collide with each other. For collisions close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), the collisional kinetic energy can be so large that the colliding stars can be completely destroyed, potentially releasing an amount of energy comparable to that of a supernova. These violent events have been examined mostly analytically, with the non-linear hydrodynamical effects being left largely unstudied. Using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code {\small AREPO}, we investigate high-velocity ($>10^{3}$ km/s) collisions between 1M$_{\odot}$ giants with varying radii, impact parameters, and initial approaching velocities, and estimate their observables. Very strong shocks across the collision surface efficiently convert $\gtrsim10\%$ of the initial kinetic energy into radiation energy. The outcome is a gas cloud expanding supersonically, homologously, and quasi-spherically, generating a flare with a peak luminosity $\simeq 10^{41}-10^{44}$ erg/s in the extreme UV band ($\simeq 10$ eV). The luminosity decreases approximately following a power-law $t^{-0.7}$ initially, then $t^{-0.4}$ after $t\simeq$10 days at which point it would be bright in the optical band ($\lesssim 1$eV). Subsequent, and possibly even brighter, emission would be generated due to the accretion of the gas cloud onto the nearby SMBH, possibly lasting up to multi-year timescales. This inevitable BH-collision product interaction can contribute to the growth of BHs at all mass scales, in particular, seed BHs at high redshifts. Furthermore, the proximity of the events to the central BH makes them a potential tool for probing the existence of dormant BHs, even very massive ones which cannot be probed by tidal disruption events.
#### Azimuthal temperature variations in ISO-Oph2 from multi-frequency ALMA  observations

 - **Abstract**
 Environmental effects, such as stellar fly-bys and external irradiation, are thought to affect the evolution of protoplanetary disks in clustered star formation. Previous ALMA images at 225 GHz of the ISO-Oph 2 binary revealed a peculiar morphology in the disk of the primary, perhaps due to a possible fly-by with the secondary. Here we report on new ALMA continuum observations of this system at 97.5 GHz, 145 GHz and 405 GHz, which reveal strong morphological variations. Multi-frequency positional alignment allows to interpret these spectral variations in terms of underlying physical conditions. ISO-Oph 2A is remarkably offset from the centroid of its ring, at all frequencies, and the disk is lopsided, pointing at gravitational interactions. However, the dust temperature also varies in azimuth, with two peaks whose direction connects with HD 147889, the earliest-type star in the Ophiuchus complex, suggesting that it is the dominant heat source. The stellar environment of ISO-Oph 2 appears to drive both its density structure and its thermal balance.Simon Casassus, Lucas Cieza, Miguel C\'arcamo, \'Alvaro Ribas, Valentin Christiaens, Abigali Rodr\'iguez-Jim\'enez, Carla Arce-Tord, Trisha Bhowmik, Prachi Chavan, Camilo Gonz\'alez-Ruilova, Rafael Mart\'inez-Brunner, Valeria Guidotti, Mauricio Leiva

 - **Abstract**
 We report high angular resolution observations, made with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in band 6, of high excitation molecular lines of CH3CN and SO2 and of the H29a radio recombination line towards the G345.0061+01.794 B HC H II region, in order to investigate the physical and kinematical characteristics of its surroundings. Emission was detected in all observed components of the J=14-13 rotational ladder of CH3CN and in the 30(4,26)-30(3,27) and 32(4,28)-32(3,29) lines of SO2. The peak of the velocity integrated molecular emission is located \sim0.4" northwest of the peak of the continuum emission. The first-order moment images and channel maps show a velocity gradient, of 1.1 km s-1 arcsec-1, across the source, and a distinctive spot of blueshifted emission towards the peak of the zero-order moment. We derived that the rotational temperature decreases from 230 Kelvin at the peak position to 137 Kelvin at its edge, indicating that our molecular observations are probing a hot molecular core that is internally excited. The emission in the H29a line arises from a region of 0.65" in size, whose peak is coincident with that of the dust continuum, has a center velocity of -18.1pm0.9 km s-1 and a width (FWHM) of 33.7pm2.3 km s-1. We modeled the kinematical characteristics of "central blue spot" feature as due to infalling motions, deriving a central mass of 126.0pm8.7M_sun. Our observations indicate that this HC H II region is surrounded by a compact structure of hot molecular gas, which is rotating and infalling toward a central mass, that is most likely confining the ionized region.
