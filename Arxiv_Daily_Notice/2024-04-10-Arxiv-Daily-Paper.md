 - **Abstract**
 Two-body relaxation may drive stars onto near-radial orbits around a massive black hole, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE). In some circumstances, stars are unlikely to undergo a single terminal disruption, but rather to have a sequence of many grazing encounters with the black hole. It has long been unclear what is the physical outcome of this sequence: each of these encounters can only liberate a small amount of stellar mass, but may significantly alter the orbit of the star. We study the phenomenon of repeating partial tidal disruptions (pTDEs) by building a semi-analytical model that accounts for mass loss and tidal excitations. In the empty loss cone regime, where two-body relaxation is weak, we estimate the number of consecutive partial disruption that a star can undergo, on average, before being significantly affected by two-body encounters. We find that in this empty loss cone regime, a star will be destroyed in a sequence of weak pTDEs, possibly explaining the tension between the low observed TDE rate and its higher theoretical estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming new coronographs with deeper contrast limits, together with planned and current high-contrast imaging campaigns will push the detectability limit of protoplanets. These planet-hunting campaigns present a new opportunity to characterize protoplanets and their surrounding environments. However, there are clear uncertainties as to what are the extinction levels at different regions of protoplanetary disks, which will impede our ability to characterize young planets. A correct understanding of the expected extinction together with multiple photometric observations will lead to constraints on the extinction levels, dust growth, disk evolution and protoplanetary accretion rates. In this work, we used hydrodynamic simulations and protoplanetary disk observational constraints obtained from both dust and gas emission to explore the expected extinction maps for continuum filters associated with strong hydrogen lines as tracers of accretion and key broadband photometric filters. We provide a scaling relationship for the extinction as a function of planetary separation and disk mass for three different gas giant masses. We also report values for a subset of disks of interest targetted by multiple imaging campaigns. The described values will be useful for the optimal design of future planet-hunting surveys and for giving context to non-detections in protoplanetary disks and the observed fluxes of point sources along with the birth conditions of protoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant planetary migration in protoplanetary discs can lead to an interplay between the resonant interaction of planets and their disc torques called overstability. While theoretical predictions and N-body simulations hinted at its existence, there was no conclusive evidence until hydrodynamical simulations were performed. Our primary purpose is to find a hydrodynamic setup that induces overstability in a planetary system with two moderate-mass planets in a first-order 2:1 mean motion resonance. We also aim to analyse the impact of key disc parameters, namely the viscosity, surface density, and aspect ratio, on the occurrence of overstability in this planetary system when the masses of the planets are kept constant. We performed 2D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of two planets, with masses of 5 and 10 $M_{\oplus}$, in a 2:1 resonance. Upon identifying the fiducial model in which the system exhibits overstability, we performed simulations with different disc parameters to explore the effects of the disc on the overstability of the system. We observe an overstable planetary system in our hydrodynamic simulations. In the parameter study, we note that overstability occurs in discs characterised by low surface density and low viscosity. Increasing the surface density reduces the probability of overstability within the system. A limit cycle was observed in a specific viscous model with $\alpha_{\nu} = 10^{-3}$. In almost all our models, planets create partial gaps in the disc, which affects both the migration timescale and structure of the planetary system. We demonstrate the existence of overstability using hydrodynamic simulations but find deviations from the analytic approximation and show that the main contribution to this deviation can be attributed to dynamic gap opening.
#### Deep Learning the Intergalactic Medium using Lyman-alpha Forest at $ 4  \leq z \leq 5$

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $4 \leq z \leq 5$ holds the potential to reveal early onset HeII reionization or lingering thermal fluctuations from HI reionization. We set out to reconstruct the IGM gas properties along simulated Lyman-alpha forest data on pixel-by-pixel basis, employing deep Bayesian neural networks. Our approach leverages the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite, consisting of diverse thermal histories, to generate mock spectra. Our convolutional and residual networks with likelihood metric predicts the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth-weighted density or temperature for each pixel in the Ly$\alpha$ forest skewer. We find that our network can successfully reproduce IGM conditions with high fidelity across range of instrumental signal-to-noise. These predictions are subsequently translated into the temperature-density plane, facilitating the derivation of reliable constraints on thermal parameters. This allows us to estimate temperature at mean cosmic density, $T_{\rm 0}$ with one sigma confidence $\delta T_{\rm 0} \sim 1000{\rm K}$ using only one $20$Mpc/h sightline ($\Delta z\simeq 0.04$) with a typical reionization history. Existing studies utilize redshift pathlength comparable to $\Delta z\simeq 4$ for similar constraints. We can also provide more stringent constraints on the slope ($1\sigma$ confidence interval $\delta {\rm \gamma} \lesssim 0.1$) of the IGM temperature-density relation as compared to other traditional approaches. We test the reconstruction on a single high signal-to-noise observed spectrum ($20$ Mpc/h segment), and recover thermal parameters consistent with current measurements. This machine learning approach has the potential to provide accurate yet robust measurements of IGM thermal history at the redshifts in question.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.
#### Planet Formation by Gas-Assisted Accretion of Small Solids

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05906
 - **Abstract**
 We compute the accretion efficiency of small solids, with radii 1 cm $\le$ Rs $\le$ 10 m, on planets embedded in gaseous disks. Planets have masses 3 $\le$ Mp $\le$ 20 Earth masses (Me) and orbit within 10 AU of a solar-mass star. Disk thermodynamics is modeled via three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic calculations that typically resolve the planetary envelopes. Both icy and rocky solids are considered, explicitly modeling their thermodynamic evolution. Maximum efficiencies of 1 $\le$ Rs $\le$ 100 cm particles are generally $\lesssim$ 10%, whereas 10 m solids tend to accrete efficiently or be segregated beyond the planet's orbit. A simplified approach is applied to compute the accretion efficiency of small cores, with masses Mp $\le$ 1 Me and without envelopes, for which efficiencies are approximately proportional to Mp^(2/3). The mass flux of solids, estimated from unperturbed drag-induced drift velocities, provides typical accretion rates dMp/dt $\lesssim$ 1e-5 Mearth/yr. In representative disk models with an initial gas-to-dust mass ratio of 70-100 and total mass of 0.05-0.06 Msun, solids' accretion falls below 1e-6 Mearth/yr after 1-1.5 million years (Myr). The derived accretion rates, as functions of time and planet mass, are applied to formation calculations that compute dust opacity self-consistently with the delivery of solids to the envelope. Assuming dust-to-solid coagulation times of approximately 0.3 Myr and disk lifetimes of approximately 3.5 Myr, heavy-element inventories in the range 3-7 Me require that approximately 90-150 Me of solids cross the planet's orbit. The formation calculations encompass a variety of outcomes, from planets a few times the Earth mass, predominantly composed of heavy elements, to giant planets. Peak luminosities during the epoch of solids' accretion range from $\approx$ 1e-7 to $\approx$ 1e-6 times the solar luminosity.
#### OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136:  Microlensing events with prominent orbital effects

 - **Abstract**
 We undertake a project to reexamine microlensing data gathered from high-cadence surveys. The aim of the project is to reinvestigate lensing events with light curves exhibiting intricate anomaly features associated with caustics, yet lacking prior proposed models to explain these features. Through detailed reanalyses considering higher-order effects, we identify that accounting for orbital motions of lenses is vital in accurately explaining the anomaly features observed in the light curves of the lensing events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136. We estimate the masses and distances to the lenses by conducting Bayesian analyses using the lensing parameters of the newly found lensing solutions. From these analyses, we identify that the lenses of the events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971 and MOA-2023-BLG-065 are binaries composed of M dwarfs, while the lens of OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 is likely to be a binary composed of an early K-dwarf primary and a late M-dwarf companion. For all lensing events, the probability of the lens residing in the bulge is considerably higher than that of it being located in the disk.
#### Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal  neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap

 - **Abstract**
 The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.
#### Chondrule Destruction via Dust Collisions in Shock Waves

 - **Abstract**
 A leading candidate for the heating source of chondrules and igneous rims is shock waves. This mechanism generates high relative velocities between chondrules and dust particles. We have investigated the possibility of the chondrule destruction in collisions with dust particles behind a shock wave using a semianalytical treatment. We find that the chondrules are destroyed during melting in collisions. We derive the conditions for the destruction of chondrules and show that the typical size of the observed chondrules satisfies the condition. We suggest that the chondrule formation and rim accretion are different events if they are heated by shock waves.
#### On Variation of Light Curves and Broad Emission Lines for Periodic QSOs  from co-rotating Supermassive binary black holes in elliptical orbits

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Periodic QSOs are considered as candidates of supermassive binary black hole (BBH) systems in galactic centers. Further confirmation of these candidates may require different lines of observational evidences. Aims. Assuming the Doopler boosting scenario, in this paper we investigate the (coherent) variations of both broad emission lines (BELs) and continuum light curves for active BBH systems surrounding by a circumbinary broad line region (cBLR) and focus on their dependence on the eccentric orbital configuration. Methods. We calculate the variation of continuum light and the Doppler enhanced/weakened photoionization of each BLR cloud according to the motion of BBHs in elliptical orbits, and finally obtain the coherent variation of the continuum and BELs. Results. We find that both the amplitude and variation pattern of the continuum light curves and the evolution of the BEL profiles sensitively depend on the eccentric orbital configuration of BBH systems. If only the secondary BH is active, both the variation amplitudes of continuum light curves and BELs increase with increasing BBH inclination angles and orbital eccentricities, but decrease with increasing BBH mass ratio. If both BHs are active, the asymmetry in the ionization of BLR clouds at different areas caused by the Doppler boosting effect of the secondary BH is weakened due to that of the primary BH at the opposite direction, which leads to systematically smaller variation amplitudes of both continuum light curves and BELs than the cases with only secondary BH activated. Conclusions. The coherent variations of the BEL profiles with the continuum light for those periodic QSOs provide an important way to confirm the existence of BBHs in their center. Future joint analysis of the light curves and multi-epoch observed BEL profiles for periodic QSOs may lead to the identification of a number of BBH systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Iron line spectroscopy has been one of the leading methods not only for measuring the spins of accreting black holes but also for testing fundamental physics. Basing on such a method, we present an analysis of a dataset observed simultaneously by NuSTAR and NICER for the black hole binary candidate MAXI J1803-298, which shows prominent relativistic reflection features. Various relxill_nk flavors are utilized to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. The results obtained from our analysis provide stringent constraints on Johannsen deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ with the highest precise to date, namely $\alpha_{13}=0.023^{+0.071}_{-0.038}$ from relxillD_nk and $\alpha_{13}=0.006^{+0.045}_{-0.022}$ from relxillion_nk respectively in 3-$\sigma$ credible lever, where Johannsen metric reduces to Kerr metric when $\alpha_{13}$ vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate the best model-fit results using Akaike Information Criterion and assess its systematic uncertainties.
#### REPUBLIC: A variability-preserving systematic-correction algorithm for  PLATO's multi-camera light curves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06132
 - **Abstract**
 Space-based photometry missions produce exquisite light curves that contain a wealth of stellar variability on a wide range of timescales. Light curves also typically contain significant instrumental systematics -- spurious, non-astrophysical trends that are common, in varying degrees, to many light curves. Empirical systematics-correction approaches using the information in the light curves themselves have been very successful, but tend to suppress astrophysical signals, particularly on longer timescales. Unlike its predecessors, the PLATO mission will use multiple cameras to monitor the same stars. We present REPUBLIC, a novel systematics-correction algorithm which exploits this multi-camera configuration to correct systematics that differ between cameras, while preserving the component of each star's signal that is common to all cameras, regardless of timescale. Through simulations with astrophysical signals (star spots and planetary transits), Kepler-like errors, and white noise, we demonstrate REPUBLIC's ability to preserve long-term astrophysical signals usually lost in standard correction techniques. We also explore REPUBLIC's performance with different number of cameras and systematic properties. We conclude that REPUBLIC should be considered a potential complement to existing strategies for systematic correction in multi-camera surveys, with its utility contingent upon further validation and adaptation to the specific characteristics of the PLATO mission data
#### Radial and vertical constraints on the icy origin of H$_{2}$CO in the HD  163296 Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 H$_2$CO is a small organic molecule widely detected in protoplanetary disks. As a precursor to grain-surface formation of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO is considered an important precursor of O-bearing organic molecules that are locked in ices. Still, since gas-phase reactions can also form H$_2$CO, there remains an open question on the channels by which organics form in disks, and how much the grain versus the gas pathways impact the overall organic reservoir. We present spectrally and spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of several ortho- and para-H$_2$CO transitions toward the bright protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We derive column density, excitation temperature, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) radial profiles for H$_2$CO, as well as disk-averaged values of $N_{\mathrm{T}}\sim4\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, $T_{\mathrm{ex}}\sim20$ K, and $\mathrm{OPR}\sim2.7$, respectively. We empirically determine the vertical structure of the emission, finding vertical heights of $z/r\sim0.1$. From the profiles, we find a relatively constant $\mathrm{OPR}\sim2.7$ with radius, but still consistent with $3.0$ among the uncertainties, a secondary increase of $N_{\mathrm{T}}$ in the outer disk, and low $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ values that decrease with disk radius. Our resulting radial, vertical, and OPR constraints suggest an increased UV penetration beyond the dust millimeter edge, consistent with an icy origin but also with cold gas-phase chemistry. This Herbig disk contrasts previous results for the T Tauri disk, TW Hya, which had a larger contribution from cold gas-phase chemistry. More observations of other sources are needed to disentangle the dominant formation pathway of H$_2$CO in protoplanetary disks.
#### The radius variations of accreting main sequence stars and mass transfer  instability

 - **Abstract**
 Many previous works studied the dynamical timescale mass transfer stability criteria based on the donor response with neglecting the stellar structure of the accretor. In this letter, we investigate the radial response of accretors with mass accumulation and its effect on the binary mass transfer stability. We perform a series of detailed stellar evolution simulations with different types of accretors and obtain the radial variations of stars accreting at different rates. Since the time within which the donor loses half of the original mass has a correlation with the donor mass, we approximately obtain the mean mass transfer rate as a function of mass ratio. Assuming that the common envelope (CE) phase occurs if the accretor radius exceeds the outer Roche lobe radius, we obtain the critical mass ratio of dynamically unstable mass transfer. We find the critical mass ratios for donors filling their Roche lobes at the Main Sequence (MS) and Hertzsprung Gap (HG) stages are smaller than that derived from the radial response of the donor in the traditional way. Our results may suggest that the binary is easier to enter into the CE phase for a donor star at the MS or HG stage than previously believed.

 - **Abstract**
 The most promising mechanism of generating primordial black holes (PBHs) is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function with such non-Gaussianities. I also show non-Gaussianity only has mild effects on the induced gravitational waves (GWs), which gives robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, currently in construction in Chile, will start performing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in 2025 for 10 years. Its 8.4-meter telescope will survey the southern sky in less than 4 nights in six optical bands, and repeatedly generate about 2 000 exposures per night, corresponding to a data volume of about 20 TiB every night. Three data facilities are preparing to contribute to the production of the annual data releases: the US Data Facility will process 35% of the raw data, the UK data facility will process 25% of the raw data and the French data facility, operated by CC-IN2P3, will locally process the remaining 40% of the raw data. In the context of the Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2), the Data Release Production pipelines have been executed on the DC-2 simulated dataset (generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration, DESC). This dataset includes 20 000 simulated exposures, representing 300 square degrees of Rubin images with a typical depth of 5 years. DP0.2 ran at the Interim Data Facility (based on Google cloud), and the full exercise was independently replicated at CC-IN2P3. During this exercise, 3 PiB of data and more than 200 million files were produced. In this contribution we will present a detailed description of the system that we set up to perform this processing campaign using CC-IN2P3's computing and storage infrastructure. Several topics will be addressed: workflow generation and execution, batch job submission, memory and I/O requirements, etc. We will focus on the issues that arose during this campaign and how we addressed them and will present some perspectives after this exercise.

 - **Abstract**
 We extract key information of dark energy from current observations of BAO, OHD and $H_0$, and find hints of dynamical behaviour of dark energy. In particular, a dynamical dark energy model whose equation of state crosses $-1$ is favoured by observations. We also find that the Universe has started accelerating at a lower redshift than expected.

 - **Abstract**
 Chance-aligned sources or blended companions can cause false positives in planetary transit detections or simply bias the determination of the candidate properties. In the era of high-precision space-based photometers, the need for high-spatial resolution images has demonstrated to be critical for validating and confirming transit signals. This already applied to the Kepler mission, it is now applicable to the TESS survey and will be critical for PLATO. We present the results of the AstraLux-TESS survey, a catalog of high-spatial resolution images obtained with the AstraLux instrument (Calar Alto) in the context of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. We use the lucky-imaging technique to obtain high-spatial resolution images from planet candidate hosts included mostly in two relevant regimes: exoplanet candidates belonging to the level-one requirement of the TESS mission (planets with radii $R<4~R_{\oplus}$), and candidates around intermediate-mass stars. Among the 185 planet host candidate stars observed, we found 13 (7%) to be accompanied by additional sources within 2.2 arcsec separation. Among them, six are not associated to sources in the Gaia DR3 catalog, thus contaminating the TESS light curve. We provide upper limits and probabilities to the possible existence of field contaminants through the sensitivity limits of our images. Among the isolated hosts, we can discard hazardous companions (bright enough to mimic a planetary transit signals) for all their planets. The results from this catalog are key for the statistical validation of small planets (prime targets of the TESS mission) and planets around intermediate-mass stars in the main-sequence. These two populations of planets are hard to confirm with the radial velocity technique. Our results also demonstrate the importance of this type of follow-up observations for future transit missions like PLATO, even in the Gaia era.

 In order to test the efficacy of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) as cosmological probes, we the characterize the scatter in the correlations between six pairs of GRB related observables, which have previously also been studied in arXiv:2011.14040. However, some of these observables depend on the luminosity distance, for which one needs to assume an underlying cosmological model. In order to circumvent this circularity problem, we use X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars as distance anchors to calculate the luminosity distance in a model-independent manner, which in turn gets used to calculate the GRB-related quantities. We find that all the six pairs of regression relations show a high intrinsic scatter for both the low and high redshift sample. This implies that these GRB observables cannot be used as model-independent cosmological probes.

 Recently published studies suggested that the difference between Universal and Coordinated Time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in a few years, making it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC scale for the first time in its history. Based on the latest UT1 series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and its prediction, it was shown that the tendency to acceleration of the Earth's rotation observed over past four years most likely will return to the deceleration, which is the usual behavior of the Earth rotational dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform high resolution simulations of forming star clusters as they merge inside giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using hydrodynamics coupled to N-body dynamics to simultaneously model both the gas and stars. We zoom in to previously run GMC simulations and resolve clusters into their stellar and gas components while including the surrounding GMC environment. We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters' stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space. Our results suggest that subcluster mergers in the presence of background gas can imprint dynamical signatures that can be used to constrain cluster formation histories.

 - **Abstract**
 We do a careful investigation of the prospects of dark energy (DE) interacting with cold dark matter (CDM) in alleviating the $S_8$ clustering tension. To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS), and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets, the constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H_0-\sigma_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\sigma_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\sigma_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. In addition, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension. In this regard, the CPL and JBP models perform the best in relaxing the $S_8$ tension to $<1\sigma$. However, for the non-phantom regime the $\sigma_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom dark energy from latest data. We further do an investigation of the role of RSD datasets and find an overall reduction in tension, with a value of $\sigma_{8,0}$ relatively closer to the CMB value. We finally check if further extensions of this scenario, like the inclusion of the sound speed of dark energy and warm dark matter interacting with DE, can have some effects.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important to distinguish whether compact stars could contain electric charge.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray burst (GRBs) are the brightest events in the universe. For decades, astrophysicists have known about their cosmological nature. Every year, space missions such as Fermi and SWIFT detect hundreds of them. In spite of this large sample, GRBs show a complex taxonomy in the first seconds after their appearance, which makes it very difficult to find similarities between them using conventional techniques. It is known that GRBs originate from the death of a massive star or from the merger of two compact objects. GRB classification is typically based on the duration of the burst (Kouveliotou et al., 1993). Nevertheless, events such as GRB 211211A (Yang et al., 2022), whose duration of about 50 seconds lies in the group of long GRBs, has challenged this categorization by the evidence of features related with the short GRB population (the kilonova emission and the properties of its host galaxy). Therefore, a classification based only on their gamma-ray duration does not provide a completely reliable determination of the progenitor. Motivated by this problem, Jespersen et al. (2020) and Steinhardt et al. (2023) carried out analysis of GRB light curves by using the t-SNE algorithm, showing that Swift/BAT GRBs database, consisting of light curves in four energy bands (15-25 keV, 25-50 keV, 50-100 keV, 100-350 keV), clusters into two groups corresponding with the typical long/short classification. However, in this case, this classification is based on the information provided by their gamma-ray emission light curves. ClassiPyGRB is a Python 3 package to download, process, visualize and classify GRBs database from the Swift/BAT Instrument (up to July 2022). It is distributed over the GNU General Public License Version 2 (1991). We also included a noise-reduction and an interpolation tools for achieving a deeper analysis of the data.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor transformation offers a window into the physics of various astrophysical environments, including our Sun and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements. Currently, the best estimates of $n_e(r)$ come from the standard solar model. We seek to ascertain, through novel application of the SDA method, whether estimates of the same from neutrino data can serve as independent constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of effort, the mechanisms by which the spin axis of a star and the orbital axes of its planets become misaligned remain elusive. Particularly, it is of great interest whether the large spin-orbit misalignments observed are driven primarily by high-eccentricity migration -- expected to have occurred for short-period, isolated planets -- or reflect a more universal process that operates across systems with a variety of present-day architectures. Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between these competing hypotheses, as their tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing them to trace the primordial disk plane. In this context, we report measurements of the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two sub-Saturns in multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126 b ($\lambda=1\pm 48\,^{\circ}$) and TOI-5398 b ($\lambda=-24^{+14}_{-13} \,^{\circ}$). Both are spin-orbit aligned, joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment. Our results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase through violent dynamical interactions inherent to eccentric migration, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, much attention has been focused on the false-vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false-vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false-vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.
