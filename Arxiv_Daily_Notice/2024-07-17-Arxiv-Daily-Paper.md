#### Title:

 - **Abstract**
 In 2010, Bakos and collaborators discovered a Neptune-sized planet transiting the K-dwarf HAT-P-11 every five days. Later in 2018, Yee and collaborators reported an additional Jovian-mass companion on a nine year orbit based on a decade of Doppler monitoring. The eccentric outer giant HAT-P-11c may be responsible for the peculiar polar orbit of the inner planet HAT-P-11b. However, Basilicata et al. (2024) recently suggested that the HAT-P-11c Doppler signal could be caused by stellar activity. In this research note, we extend the Yee et al. (2018) Doppler time series by six years. The combined dataset spanning 17 years covers nearly two orbits of the outer planet. Importantly, we observe two periastron passages of planet c and do not observe a coherent activity signature. Together with the previously reported astrometric acceleration of HAT-P-11 from Hipparcos and Gaia, we believe there is strong evidence for HAT-P-11c as a bona fide planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Phase separation between hydrogen and helium at high pressures and temperatures leads to the rainout of helium in the deep interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. This process, also known as "helium rain", affects their long-term evolution. Therefore, modelling the evolution and internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn (and giant exoplanets) relies on the phase diagram of hydrogen and helium. In this work, we simulate the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn with helium rain by applying different phase diagrams of hydrogen and helium. We find that consistency between Jupiter s evolution and the Galileo measurement of its atmospheric helium abundance is achieved only if a shift in temperature in the existing phase diagrams is applied (-1250 K, +350 K or -3850 K depending on the used phase diagram). We next use the shifted phase diagrams to model Saturn s evolution and find consistent solutions for both planets. We confirm that demixing in Jupiter is modest while in Saturn, the process of helium rain is significant. We find that Saturn has a large helium gradient and a helium ocean. Saturn s atmospheric helium mass fraction is estimated to be between 0.13 and 0.16. We also investigate how the used hydrogen-helium equation of state and atmospheric model affect the planetary evolution and find that the predicted cooling times can change by several hundred million years. Constraining the level of super-adiabaticity in the helium gradient formed in Jupiter and Saturn remains challenging and should be investigated in detail in future research. We conclude that further explorations of the immiscibility between hydrogen and helium are valuable as this knowledge directly affects the evolution and current-state structure of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, we argue that measuring Saturn s atmospheric helium content is crucial for constraining Saturn s evolution as well as the hydrogen-helium phase diagram.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multiwavelength polarization measurements of the luminous blazar Mrk~501 over a 14-month period. The 2--8 keV X-ray polarization was measured with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) with six 100-ks observations spanning from 2022 March to 2023 April. Each IXPE observation was accompanied by simultaneous X-ray data from NuSTAR, Swift/XRT, and/or XMM-Newton. Complementary optical-infrared polarization measurements were also available in the B, V, R, I, and J bands, as were radio polarization measurements from 4.85 GHz to 225.5 GHz. Among the first five IXPE observations, we did not find significant variability in the X-ray polarization degree and angle with IXPE. However, the most recent sixth observation found an elevated polarization degree at $>3\sigma$ above the average of the other five observations. The optical and radio measurements show no apparent correlations with the X-ray polarization properties. Throughout the six IXPE observations, the X-ray polarization degree remained higher than, or similar to, the R-band optical polarization degree, which remained higher than the radio value. This is consistent with the energy-stratified shock scenario proposed to explain the first two IXPE observations, in which the polarized X-ray, optical, and radio emission arises from different regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsar timing array community has recently reported the first evidence of a low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background. With longer observational timespans we expect to be able to resolve individual gravitational wave sources in our data alongside the background signal. The statistical modeling and Bayesian searches for such individual signals is a computationally taxing task that is the focus of many different avenues of methods development. We present a pipeline for performing efficient joint searches for gravitational waves originating from individual supermassive black hole binaries as well as a gravitational wave background using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling scheme. Hamiltonian sampling proposes samples based on the gradients of the model likelihood, and can both converge faster to more complicated and high-dimensional distributions as well as efficiently explore highly covariant parameter spaces such as the joint gravitational wave background and individual binary model. We show the effectiveness of our scheme by demonstrating accurate parameter estimation for simulated datasets containing low- (6 nHz) or high- (60 nHz) frequency binary sources. Additionally we show that our method is capable at more efficiently generating skymaps for individual binary sources -- maps displaying the upper limits on the gravitational wave strain of the source, $h_{0}$, as a function of sky location -- by sampling over larger portions of the full sky. Comparing against results for the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset, we find similar reconstructed upper limits on the gravitational wave strain while simultaneously reducing the number of required analyses from 72 independent binned searches down to a single run.

          General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations of binary strange star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We perform fully general-relativistic simulations of binary strange star mergers considering two different approaches for thermal effects. The first uses a cold equation of state (EOS) derived from a modified version of the MIT bag model which is then supplemented by a $\Gamma$-law correction. The second approach employs a microphysical description of the finite-temperature effects. We describe results obtained with the two treatments, highlighting the influence of thermal effects. We find that the postmerger dynamics differs significantly in the two cases, leading to quantitative differences in the postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and ejecta mass. The peak frequency of the postmerger gravitational-wave emission is consistent with the established quasi-universal relations for binary neutron star mergers and as a result, our simulations cannot distinguish between mergers of neutron stars and those of strange stars. Our models with realistic treatment of finite-temperature effects produce a significant amount of ejecta $\gtrsim 0.02\ M_{\odot}$. The resulting flux of strangelets near the Earth, computed assuming that all neutron star mergers are in fact strange-stars mergers and that the binary considered here is representative, is in tension with experimental upper limits. As such, our results tentatively disfavor a scenario in which strange-quark matter is the lowest energy state of matter.

          The future looks dark: improving high contrast imaging with hyper-parameter optimization for data-driven predictive wavefront control

 - **Abstract**
 The direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets requires extreme adaptive optics (XAO), achieving exquisite wavefront correction (upwards of 90$\%$ Strehl) over a narrow field of view (a few arcseconds). For these XAO systems the temporal error is often a leading term in the error budget, wherein the wavefront evolves faster than the lag between wavefront sensing and control. For atmospheres with high-velocity wind layers, this can result in a wind-driven halo in the coronagraphic dark-zone, limiting sensitivity to faint, close-in companions. The AO system's lag-time is often limited by the wavefront sensor exposure time, especially in the case of fainter guidestars. Predictive control mitigates the temporal error by predicting the shape of the wavefront by time the system correction is applied. One such method of prediction is empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), wherein previous states in the wavefront sensor history are used to learn linear correlations with a minimization problem. This method has been demonstrated on-sky at Subaru/SCExAO and Keck/NIRC2, but has yet to be optimized. With this work as a starting point, we explore the optimal filter hyper-parameter space for implementing EOF on-sky, study its stability under varying atmospheric parameters, and discuss future paths for facilitization of predictive control. This work not only offers a pathway to optimize Keck and Subaru observing, but also acts as a pathfinder for predictive control methods with extremely large telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Observational evidence has accumulated in the past years, showing that the Galactic bulge includes two populations, a metal poor and a metal rich one that, in addition to a different metallicity, show different alpha over iron abundances, spatial distribution, and kinematics. While the metal rich, barred component has been fairly well characterized, the metal poor, spheroidal component has been more elusive and harder to describe. RR Lyrae variables are clean tracers of the old bulge component, and they are, on average, more metal poor than red clump stars. Aims. In the present paper, we provide a new catalog of 16488 ab type RR Lyrae variables in the bulge region within -10<l<10 and -2.8<b<2.8, extracted from multi epoch PSF photometry performed on VISTA Variable in the Via Lactea survey data. We used the catalog to constrain the shape of the old, metal poor, bulge stellar population. Methods. The identification of ab type RR Lyrae among a large sample of candidate variables of different types has been performed via a combination of a Random Forest classifier and visual inspection... [abridged] Results. We use the present catalog to derive the shape of their distribution around the Galactic Center, resulting in an elongated spheroid with projected axis ratio b/a~0.7 and inclination angle ~20 degrees. We discuss how observational biases such as errors on the distances and a non-uniform sampling in longitude, affect both the present measurements and previous ones, especially those based on red clump stars... [abridged] Conclusions. We publish a high purity RRab sample for future studies of the oldest Galactic bulge population, close to the midplane. We explore different choices for the period-luminosity-metallicity relation, highlighting how some of them introduce spurious trends of distances with either period or metallicity, or both...

 - **Abstract**
 Recent data seem to suggest a preference for the evolving dark energy (DE). However, if the case is actually so, and not caused by unknown systematics in data, it might impact our understanding about our Universe in an anomalous way due to the shifts of some primary parameters. As an example, we present the search for the primordial gravitational waves, based on the evolving DE. The joint analysis of recent BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization data with Planck18 CMB, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and PantheonPlus data shows that the bestfit tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$, and the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $\sim 2\sigma$ non-zero.

 - **Abstract**
 With high equilibrium temperatures and tidally locked rotation, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are unique laboratories within which to probe extreme atmospheric physics and chemistry. In this paper, we present high-resolution dayside spectroscopy of the UHJ WASP-189b obtained with the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at the Gemini South Observatory. The observations, which cover three hours of post-eclipse orbital phases, were obtained during the instrument's System Verification run. We detect the planet's atmosphere via the Doppler cross-correlation technique, and recover a detection of neutral iron in the planet's dayside atmosphere at a significance of 7.5$\sigma$ in the red-arm of the data, verifying the presence of a thermal inversion. We also investigate the presence of other species in the atmosphere and discuss the implications of model injection/recovery tests. These results represent the first atmospheric characterization of an exoplanet with GHOST's high-resolution mode, and demonstrate the potential of this new instrument in detecting and studying ultra-hot exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed closed-loop lab testing of large-format deformable mirrors (DMs) with hybrid variable reluctance actuators. TNO has been developing the hybrid variable reluctance actuators in support for a new generation of adaptive secondary mirrors (ASMs), which aim to be more robust and reliable. Compared to the voice coil actuators, this new actuator technology has a higher current to force efficiency, and thus can support DMs with thicker facesheets. Before putting this new technology on-sky, it is necessary to understand how to control it and how it behaves in closed-loop. We performed closed-loop tests with the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with three large-format deformable mirrors that use the TNO actuators: DM3, FLASH, and IRTF-ASM-1 ASM. The wavefront sensor and the real-time control systems were developed for the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and the UH 2.2-meter telescope ASMs. We tested IRTF-ASM-1 on-sky and proved that it meets all of our performance requirements. This work presents our lab setup for the experiments, the techniques we have employed to drive these new ASMs, the results of our closed-loop lab tests for FLASH and IRTF-ASM-1, and the on-sky closed-loop results of IRTF-ASM-1 ASM.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the detection accuracy of double white dwarfs (DWDs), stellar-mass black hole binaries (SBHBs), light and heavy intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of astronomical origin for TianQin, LISA, and joint detection. We use a Fisher matrix analysis and consider for each source the averaged detection accuracy over a realistic range of parameters. We find that on average TianQin obtains more accurate parameter estimation for DWDs and light IMRIs, LISA for heavy IMRIs, EMRIs, MBHBs, and the galactic foreground of the SGWB, and both contribute similarly to the detection of SBHBs and the extra-galactic SGWB. Nevertheless, for all sources joint detection allows setting tighter constraints on most parameters highlighting its importance for future detection.

          Modeling Foreground Spatial Variations in 21 cm Gaussian Process Component Separation

 - **Abstract**
 Gaussian processes (GPs) have been extensively utilized as nonparametric models for component separation in 21 cm data analyses. This exploits the distinct spectral behavior of the cosmological and foreground signals, which are modeled through the GP covariance kernel. Previous approaches have employed a global GP kernel along all lines of sight (LoS). In this work, we study Bayesian approaches that allow for spatial variations in foreground kernel parameters, testing them against simulated HI intensity mapping observations. We consider a no-pooling (NP) model, which treats each LoS independently by fitting for separate covariance kernels, and a hierarchical Gaussian Process (HGP) model that allows for variation in kernel parameters between different LoS, regularized through a global hyperprior. We find that accounting for spatial variations in the GP kernel parameters results in a significant improvement in cosmological signal recovery, achieving up to a 30% reduction in the standard deviation of the residual distribution and improved model predictive performance. Allowing for spatial variations in GP kernel parameters also improves the recovery of the HI power spectra and wavelet scattering transform coefficients. Whilst the NP model achieves superior recovery as measured by the residual distribution, it demands extensive computational resources, faces formidable convergence challenges, and is prone to overfitting. Conversely, the HGP model strikes a balance between the accuracy and robustness of the signal recovery. Further improvements to the HGP model will require more physically motivated modeling of foreground spatial variations.

 - **Abstract**
 A small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed with multiple bursts, whereas most Galactic sources emitting radio pulses are known to repeat. Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and four rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been observed with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s. For comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in CSIRO's data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the Parkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are suggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the other sources. Reporting details of the non-detection observations for the apparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and catastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic sources.

          SN 2021dbg: A Luminous Type IIP-IIL Supernova Exploding from a Massive Star with a Layered Shell

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive observations and analysis of supernova (SN) 2021dbg, utilizing optical photometry and spectroscopy. For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most SNe II. This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant $^{56}$Ni ($0.17 \pm 0.05$ M$_{\odot}$) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to $\sim$(1.0--2.0) $\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2--3 yr preceding the explosion. Considering the bolometric light curve, nebular spectrum modeling, and mass-loss rate, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2021dbg was a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of $\sim 20$ M$_{\odot}$ and a radius of 1200 R$_{\odot}$. This RSG featured a thick hydrogen shell, which may have contained a region with a sharp decrease in material density, electron density, and temperature, contributing to its layered structure. This object demonstrates mixed features of SNe IIP and SNe IIL, making it as a transitional event linking the above two subclasses of SNe II.

          Epsilon Sagittarii: An Extreme Rapid Rotator with a Decretion Disk

 - **Abstract**
 We report high-precision multi-wavelength linear-polarization observations of the bright B9 (or A0) star $\epsilon$ Sagittarii. The polarization shows the distinctive wavelength dependence expected for a rapidly rotating star. Analysis of the polarization data reveals an angular rotation rate $\omega$ (= $\Omega/\Omega_{crit})$ of 0.995 or greater, the highest yet measured for a star in our galaxy. An additional wavelength-independent polarization component is attributed to electron scattering in a low-density edge-on gas disk that also produces the narrow absorption components seen in the spectrum. Several properties of the star (polarization due to a disk, occasional weak H$\alpha$ emission, and multiple periodicities seen in space photometry) resemble those of Be stars, but the level of activity in all cases is much lower than that of typical Be stars. The stellar properties are inconsistent with single rotating-star evolutionary tracks, indicating that it is most likely a product of binary interaction. The star is an excellent candidate for observation by interferometry, optical spectropolarimetry to detect the Öhman effect, and UV polarimetry; any of which would allow its extreme rotation to be tested and its stellar properties to be refined.

          Multiple overspill flood channels from young craters require surface melting and hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice late in Mars history

 - **Abstract**
 Mars' tadpole craters are small, young craters whose crater rims are incised by one or more exit breaches but lack visible inlets. The tadpole forming climate records the poorly understood drying of Mars since the Early Hesperian. A third of tadpole craters have multiple breaches, therefore a process is needed that was able to generate crater rim incision in multiple locations. We use HiRISE data for four multiple breach tadpole craters to measure their crater fill, rims, and exit breaches. We compare these measurements and other data to our calculations of liquid water supply by rain, surface melting, groundwater discharge, and basal ice sheet melting to discriminate between four proposed formation hypotheses for tadpole breaches, favoring scenarios with ice-filled craters and supraglacial melting. We conclude that multiple breach tadpole craters record hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice and climate conditions enabling intermittent melting in the Late Hesperian and Amazonian, suggesting that liquid water on Mars has been available in association with water ice for billions of years.

 Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino. In this study, we calculate the contribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud model within the TDE framework. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of TDEs becomes negligible when the redshift $Z$ exceeds 2. Employing a set of fiducial values, which includes outflow energy $E_{\rm kin}=10^{51}$ erg, a proton spectrum cutoff energy $E_{\rm p,max}=100$ PeV, a volume TDE rate $\dot{N}=8 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm Mpc^{-3}\ year^{-1}$, covering fraction of clouds $C_V=0.1$, energy conversion efficiency in the shock $\eta =0.1$, and a proton spectrum index $\Gamma=-1.7$, we find that TDEs can account for approximately 80\% of the contribution at energies around 0.3 PeV. Additionally, TDEs still contribute around 18\% to the IceCube data below 0.1 PeV and the total contribution is $\sim 24^{+2}_{-15}\%$. In addition, we also discuss the potential influence of various parameter values on the results in detail. With the IceCube data, we impose constraints on the combination of the physical parameters, i.e., $C_{f}=\dot{N}E_{\rm kin}C_{\rm v}\eta$. Future observations or theoretical considerations would fix some physical parameters, which will help to constrain some individual parameters of TDEs.

 On the Sun, the energetic, erupting phenomena of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often occur together. While space-based photometry has revealed frequent white-light flares for vast numbers of stars, only a handful of coronal mass ejections have been detected. Space-based photometry reveals the timing and detailed structure of flares. To detect CME signatures, however, optical spectroscopy is essential, as the ejected plasma can be detected by Doppler-shifted emission bumps in the Balmer-regions. We present a dedicated ground-based multi-object spectroscopic observations of the young, nearby Praesepe (600 Myr) and Pleiades (135 Myr) clusters to detect CMEs and flares parallel with the observations of Praesepe by the TESS satellite. During the 10 days of overlapping observations, we did not find any obvious signs of CMEs or flares in the H$\alpha$ region.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations play a crucial role in time-domain astronomy. The Einstein Probe (EP), a recently launched X-ray astronomical satellite, emerges as a forefront player in the field of time-domain astronomy and high-energy astrophysics. With a focus on systematic surveys in the soft X-ray band, EP aims to discover high-energy transients and monitor variable sources in the universe. To achieve these objectives, a quick and reliable classification of observed sources is essential. In this study, we developed a machine learning classifier for autonomous source classification using data from the EP-WXT Pathfinder Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) and EP-WXT simulations. The proposed Random Forest classifier, built on selected features derived from light curves, energy spectra, and location information, achieves an accuracy of approximately 95% on EP simulation data and 98% on LEIA observational data. The classifier is integrated into the LEIA data processing pipeline, serving as a tool for manual validation and rapid classification during observations. This paper presents an efficient method for the classification of X-ray sources based on single observations, along with implications of most effective features for the task. This work facilitates rapid source classification for the EP mission and also provides valuable insights into feature selection and classification techniques for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of X-ray source classification that can be adapted to other X-ray telescope data.

 - **Abstract**
 GJ 581 is a nearby M dwarf known to host a packed multiple planet system with 2 super-Earths and a Neptune-mass planet. We present new orbital analyses of the system, utilizing recent RV data obtained from the CARMENES spectrograph combined with newly reprocessed archival data from the HARPS and HIRES spectrographs. Our aim was to analyze the post-discovery spectroscopic data of GJ 581, which were obtained with CARMENES. In addition, we used publicly available HIRES and HARPS spectroscopic data to seek evidence of the known and disputed exoplanets in this system. We aimed to investigate the stellar activity of GJ 581 and update the planetary system's orbital parameters using state-of-the-art numerical models and techniques. We performed a periodogram analysis of the available precise CARMENES, HIRES, and HARPS RVs and of stellar activity indicators. We conducted detailed orbital analyses by testing various orbital configurations consistent with the RV data. We studied the posterior probability distribution of the parameters fit to the data and explored the long-term stability and overall orbital dynamics of the system. We refined the orbital parameters of the system using the most precise and complete set of Doppler data available. Consistent with the existing literature, we confirm that the system is unequivocally composed of only 3 planets detectable in the present data, dismissing the putative planet GJ 581 d as an artifact of stellar activity. Our N-body fit reveals that the system's inclination is i $=$ 47.0 deg, which implies that the planets could be up to 30% more massive than their previously reported minimum masses. Furthermore, we report that the system exhibits long-term stability, as indicated by the posterior probability distribution, characterized by secular dynamical interactions without the involvement of mean motion resonances.

 - **Abstract**
 The Grand Tack model, more generally called the Masset & Snellgrove mechanism, is a planetary migration model whereby two giant planets conspired with their natal disk to migrate to larger orbital radii. While its relevance in our own Solar System remains in question, the fact that the Masset & Snellgrove mechanism is a general hydrodynamical effect implies that it may have occured in another planetary system. In this letter I search through the exoplanet data for evidence of the Masset & Snellgrove mechanism which requires (1) the inner of two planets is more massive than the outer planet; (2) the planets are sufficiently massive that their gravity-induced gap overlap; and (3) they orbit at sufficiently close radii that their co-rotation regions also overlap. These last two requirements are met when the planet's orbit with a 3:2 mean motion resonance. I do not find conclusive evidence for a Grand Tack-like system, but find some evidence for planet formation at the edge of a planet-induced protoplanetary disk gap in three systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical accretion discs that carry a significant mass compared with their central object are subject to the effect of self-gravity. In the context of circumstellar discs, this can, for instance, cause fragmentation of the disc gas, and -- under suitable conditions -- lead to the direct formation of gas-giant planets. If one wants to study these phenomena, the disc's gravitational potential needs to be obtained by solving the Poisson equation. This requires to specify suitable boundary conditions. In the case of a spherical-polar computational mesh, a standard multipole expansion for obtaining boundary values is not practicable. We hence compare two alternative methods for overcoming this limitation. The first method is based on a known Green's function expansion (termed "CCGF") of the potential, while the second (termed "James' method") uses a surface screening mass approach with a suitable discrete Green's function. We demonstrate second-order convergence for both methods and test the weak scaling behaviour when using thousands of computational cores. Overall, James' method is found superior owing to its favourable algorithmic complexity of $\sim \mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compared with the $\sim\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ scaling of the CCGF method.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results on simultaneous observations of Class~I methanol masers at 25, 36, and 44 GHz towards 22 Galactic targets carried out with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. The study investigates relations between the hyperfine (HF) structure of the torsion-rotation transitions in CH3OH and maser activity. By analyzing the radial velocity shifts between different maser lines together with the patterns of the HF structure based on laboratory measurements and quantum-chemical calculations, we find that in any source only one specific HF transition forms the maser emission and that this transition changes from source to source. The physical conditions leading to this selective behavior are still unclear. Using accurate laboratory rest frequencies for the 25 GHz transitions, we have refined the centre frequencies for the HF multiplets at 36, 44, and 95 GHz: f_36 = (36169.2488 +/- 0.0002_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz. f_44 = (44069.4176 +/- 0.0002_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz, and f_95 = (95169.4414 +/- 0.0003_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz. Comparison with previous observations of 44 GHz masers performed 6-10 years ago with a Korean 21-m KVN telescope towards the same targets confirms the kinematic stability of Class~I maser line profiles during this time interval and reveals a systematic radial velocity shift of 0.013 +/- 0.005 km/s between the two telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe remains an open question in cosmology. We show for the first time that the evolution of SMBHs with redshift leads to a unique signature on the angular cross-correlation power spectrum between the multi-frequency nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) and the galaxy density in the Universe. By using galaxy catalogs from the upcoming Rubin LSST Observatory in synergy with the nHz SGWB signal accessible from the Square Kilometer Array, we can measure this signal with a signal-to-noise ratio above five, thereby opening a new observational window to the cosmic evolution of SMBHs across redshift. This discovery space that can be opened by the cross-correlation of the nHz SGWB will not be possible by any other currently known techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-Żytkow object (TŻO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult. Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential TŻO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of TŻOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation. Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of TŻOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary TŻO models from the literature to determine a fit for TŻO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of TŻOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger. Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of TŻO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ TŻOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ TŻOs in the Milky Way at present.

 - **Abstract**
 The star HD 118203, classified as a K0 subgiant, was known to harbour a transiting hot Jupiter planet on a 6.1-day eccentric orbit. Previous studies also revealed a linear trend in the radial velocity (RV) domain, indicative of a companion on a wide orbit. Such a hierarchical orbital architecture could be helpful in studies of the origins of hot Jupiters. We acquired precise RV measurements over 17 years using the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope and the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Combining these observations with space-born photometric time series from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we constructed a two-planetary model for the system. Astrometric observations from Hipparcos and Gaia were used to constrain the orbital inclination of the wide-orbit companion and its mass. Numerical simulations were used to investigate the dynamics of the system. The photometric data were searched for additional transit-like flux drops. We found that the additional companion is an 11-Jupiter mass planet orbiting HD 118203 on a 14-year moderately eccentric orbit, constituting a hierarchical planetary system with the hot Jupiter. Both planets were found to be dynamically decoupled mainly due to the general relativistic apsidal precession of the inner planet, marginalising secular interactions. The orbits of both planets might have a relatively low mutual inclination unless the longitudes of the ascending node differ substantially. This configuration favours the coplanar high-eccentricity migration as a path to the present-day orbital configuration. No other transiting planets with radii down to 2 Earth radii and orbital periods less than 100 days were found in the system.

          Fate of a remnant solid disk around an eccentric giant planet

 - **Abstract**
 The composition of giant planets' atmospheres is an important tracer of their formation history. While many theoretical studies investigate the heavy-element accretion within a gaseous protoplanetary disk, the possibility of solid accretion after disk dissipation has not been explored. Here, we focus on the case of a gas giant planet excited to an eccentric orbit and assess the likelihood of solid accretion after disk dissipation. We perform N-body simulations of planetesimals and embryos around an eccentric giant planet. We consider various sizes and orbits for the eccentric planet and determine the fate of planetesimals and embryos. We find that the orbital evolution of solids, such as planetesimals and embryos, is regulated by weak encounters with the eccentric planet rather than strong close encounters. Even in the region where the Safronov number is smaller than unity, most solid materials fall onto the central star or are ejected from the planetary system. We also develop an analytical model of the solid accretion along the orbital evolution of a giant planet, where the accretion probability is obtained as a function of the planetary mass, radius, semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and solid disk thickness. Our model predicts that $\sim$0.01-0.1 $M_\oplus$ of solids is accreted onto an eccentric planet orbiting in the outer disk ($\sim10$ au). The accreted heavy-element mass increases (decreases) with the eccentricity (inclination) of the planet. We also discuss the possibility of collisions of terrestrial planets and find that $\sim10\%$ of the hot Jupiters formed via high-eccentric migration collide with a planet of $10M_\oplus$. However, we find that solid accretion and collisions with terrestrial planets are minor events for planets in the inner orbit, and a different accretion process is required to enrich eccentric giant planets with heavy elements.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Most stars form in clusters or associations but only a small number of these groups are expected to remain bound for longer than a few Myr. Once star formation has ended and the molecular gas around young stellar objects has been expelled via feedback processes, most initially bound young clusters lose the majority of their binding mass and begin to disperse into the Galactic field. Aims. This process can be investigated by analysing the structure and kinematic trends in nearby young clusters, particularly expansion, the tell-tale sign that a cluster is no longer gravitationally bound but is dispersing into the field. Methods. We combine Gaia DR3 5-parameter astrometry with calibrated radial velocities for members of the nearby young cluster {\lambda} Ori (Collinder 69). Results. We characterise the plane-of-sky substructure of the cluster using the Q-parameter and Angular Dispersion parameter. We find evidence that the cluster contains significant substructure, but that this is preferentially located away from the central cluster core, which is smooth and likely remains bound. We find strong evidence for expansion in {\lambda} Ori in the plane-of-sky using a number of metrics, but also that the trends are asymmetric at the 5{\sigma} significance level. with the maximum rate of expansion being directed nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. We then invert the maximum rate of expansion of 0.144^{+0.003}_{-0.003} kms^{-1}pc^{-1} to give an expansion timescale of 6.944^{+0.148}_{-0.142} Myr, which is slightly larger than typical literature age estimates for the cluster. We also find asymmetry in the velocity dispersion, potential signatures of cluster rotation, and calculate kinematic ages for individual cluster members by tracing their motion back in time to their closest approach to the cluster center.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the stellar and accretion properties of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) require comparison with photospheric spectral templates. Here we aim at expanding the currently available grid of wide-wavelength coverage observed spectra of non-accreting stars with additional new spectra and an interpolation method that allows us to obtain a continuous grid of low resolution spectra ranging from spectral type G8 to M9.5, while also mitigating observational uncertainties. This interpolated grid is then implemented in the self-consistent method to derive stellar and accretion properties of CTTS. With the new templates, we aim to estimate a lower limit on the accretion luminosities that can be obtained through a study of the UV excess emission using observed templates. We analyse the molecular photospheric features present in the VLT/X-Shooter spectra of the targets to perform a spectral classification, including estimates of their extinction. We apply a non-parametric fitting method to the full grid of observed templates to obtain an interpolated grid of templates. We use the uncertainties on our interpolated grid to estimate a lower limit on the accretion luminosity that we can measure with this method. We find that the measurable accretion luminosities ranges from $\sim 2.7$ dex lower than the stellar luminosity in M5.5 stars to $\sim 1.3$ dex lower for G8 stars. For young stars with masses of $\sim 1M_{\odot}$ and ages of 3-6 Myr this limit translates into an observational limit of mass accretion rate on the order of $10^{-10} \rm M_{\odot}/yr$. The implementation of an interpolated grid of observed templates allows us to better disentangle degenerate solutions, leading to a more reliable estimate of accretion rates in young accreting stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The all-particle spectrum of cosmic rays measured at Earth has a knee-like feature around 4 PeV. A priori, it is not clear if this is a local feature specific to the Solar neighbourhood in the Milky Way, or if it is a generic property of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. We argue that combining gamma-ray and cosmic-ray data of LHAASO indicates that the knee is a local feature. In order to demonstrate this, we derive a model for the local cosmic-ray spectra and composition, consistent with the recent LHAASO measurements of the all-particle spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass in the knee region. We calculate the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray emission based on this model and find that the expected spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux is not consistent with LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the 10-100 TeV energy range.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce mochi_class, an extension of the Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class, designed to unlock the full phenomenological potential of Horndeski gravity. This extension allows for general input functions of time without the need for hard-coded parametrisations or covariant Lagrangians. By replacing the traditional $\alpha$-parametrisation with a set of stable basis functions, mochi_class ensures that the resulting effective theories are inherently free from gradient and ghost instabilities. Additionally, mochi_class features a quasi-static approximation implemented at the level of modified metric potentials, enhancing prediction accuracy, especially for models transitioning between a super- and sub-Compton regime. mochi_class can robustly handle a wide range of models without fine-tuning, and introduces a new approximation scheme that activates modifications to the standard cosmology deep in the matter-dominated era. Furthermore, it incorporates viability conditions on the equation of motion for the scalar field fluctuations, aiding in the identification of numerical instabilities. Through comprehensive validation against other Einstein-Boltzmann solvers, mochi_class demonstrates excellent performance and accuracy, broadening the scope of hi_class by facilitating the study of specific modified gravity models and enabling exploration of previously inaccessible regions of the Horndeski landscape.
