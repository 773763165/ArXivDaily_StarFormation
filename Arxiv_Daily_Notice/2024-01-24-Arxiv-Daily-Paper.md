 - **Abstract**
 We report precise radial velocity (RV) observations of HD 212657 (= K2-167), a star shown by K2 to host a transiting sub-Neptune-sized planet in a 10 day orbit. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, we refined the planet parameters, especially the orbital period. We collected 74 precise RVs with the HARPS-N spectrograph between August 2015 and October 2016. Although this planet was first found to transit in 2015 and validated in 2018, excess RV scatter originally limited mass measurements. Here, we measure a mass by taking advantage of reductions in scatter from updates to the HARPS-N Data Reduction System (2.3.5) and our new activity mitigation method called CCF Activity Linear Model (CALM), which uses activity-induced line shape changes in the spectra without requiring timing information. Using the CALM framework, we performed a joint fit with RVs and transits using EXOFASTv2 and find $M_p = 6.3_{-1.4}^{+1.4}$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $R_p = 2.33^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ $R_{\oplus}$, which places K2-167 b at the upper edge of the radius valley. We also find hints of a secondary companion at a $\sim$ 22 day period, but confirmation requires additional RVs. Although characterizing lower-mass planets like K2-167 b is often impeded by stellar variability, these systems especially help probe the formation physics (i.e. photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss) of the radius valley. In the future, CALM or similar techniques could be widely applied to FGK-type stars, help characterize a population of exoplanets surrounding the radius valley, and further our understanding of their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments are expected to detect new signals probing interaction of CMB photons with intervening large-scale structure. Among these the moving-lens effect, the CMB temperature anisotropy induced by cosmological structures moving transverse to our line of sight, is anticipated to be measured to high significance in the near future. In this paper, we investigate two possible strategies for the detection of this signal: pairwise transverse-velocity estimation and oriented stacking. We expand on previous studies by including in the analysis realistic simulations of competing signals and foregrounds. We confirm that the moving lens effect can be detected at $\ge 10\sigma$ level by a combination of CMB-S4 and LSST surveys. We show that the limiting factors in the detection depend on the strategy: for the stacking analysis, correlated extragalactic foregrounds, namely the cosmic infrared background and thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, play the most important role. The addition of foregrounds make the signal-to-noise ratio be most influenced by large and nearby objects. As for the pairwise detection, halo lensing and pair number counts are the main issues. In light of our findings, we elaborate on possible strategies to improve the analysis approach for the moving lens detection with upcoming experiments. We also deliver to the community all the simulations and tools we developed for this study.
#### Cosmography of the Local Universe by Multipole Analysis of the Expansion  Rate Fluctuation Field

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12291
 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility of characterizing the expansion rate on local cosmic scales $(z \lesssim 0.1)$, where the cosmological principle is violated, in a model-independent manner, i.e. in a more meaningful and comprehensive way than is possible using the $H_0$ parameter of the Standard Model alone. We do this by means of the expansion rate fluctuation field $\eta$, an unbiased Gaussian observable that measures deviations from isotropy in the redshift-distance relation. We show that an expansion of $\eta$ in terms of covariant cosmographic parameters, both kinematic (expansion rate $\mathbb{H}_o$, deceleration $\mathbb{Q}_o$ and jerk $\mathbb{J}_o$) and geometric (curvature $\mathbb{R}_o$), allows for a consistent description of metric fluctuations even in a very local and strongly anisotropic universe. The covariant cosmographic parameters critically depend on the observer's state of motion. We thus show how the lower order multipoles of ${\eta}_{\ell}$ ($\ell \leq 4$), measured by a generic observer in an arbitrary state of motion can be used to disentangle expansion effects that are induced by observer's motion from those sourced by pure metric fluctuations. We test the formalism using analytical, axis-symmetric toy models which simulate large-scale linear fluctuations in the redshift-distance relation in the local Universe and which are physically motivated by available observational evidences. We show how to exploit specific features of $\eta$ to detect the limit of validity of a covariant cosmographic expansion in the local Universe, and to define the region where data can be meaningfully analyzed in a model-independent way, for cosmological inference. We also forecast the precision with which future data sets, such as ZTF, will constrain the structure of the expansion rate anisotropies in the local spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 The observational evidence that planetary systems can be very different from each other, suggests that their dynamical histories were very diverse, probably as a result of a strong sensitivity to the initial conditions. Severe dynamical processes can drive the orbital decay of planets or planetesimals ending in their accretion onto the host star. When this material enters the star, it is rapidly dissolved in the stellar envelope, altering the star's chemical pattern in a way that mirrors the composition observed in rocky objects. Indeed, chemical signatures of planet ingestion has been found in an increasing number of Sun-like stars. These observations carry substantial implications for the field of exoplanet science, as they are entirely detached from both specific biases associated with exoplanet detection techniques and assumptions made in n-body numerical simulations of systems' evolution. For instance, signatures of planet engulfment events suggest that a non-negligible portion of planetary systems has undergone highly dynamic histories, ultimately resulting in the fall of planetary material into the host star. Also, these studies open to the possibility of using chemical abundances of stars to identify which ones are the most likely to host analogues of the calm Solar System.
#### Stellar Populations With Optical Spectra: Deep Learning vs. Popular  Spectrum Fitting Codes

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the performance of several popular spectrum fitting codes (Firefly, starlight, pyPipe3D and pPXF), and a deep-learning convolutional neural network (StarNet), in recovering known stellar population properties (mean stellar age, stellar metallicity, stellar mass-to-light ratio M*/L_r and the internal E(B-V)) of simulated galaxy spectra in optical wavelengths. Our mock spectra are constructed from star-formation histories from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation. These spectra mimic the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) through a novel method of including the noise, sky residuals and emission lines taken directly from SDSS. We find that StarNet vastly outperforms all conventional codes in both speed and recovery of stellar population properties (error scatter < 0.08 dex, average biases < 0.02 dex for all tested quantities), but it requires an appropriate training set. Of the non-machine-learning codes, pPXF was a factor of 3-4 times faster than the other codes, and was the best in recovering stellar population properties (error scatter of < 0.11 dex, average biases < 0.08 dex). However, the errors and biases are strongly dependent on both true and predicted values of stellar age and metallicity, and signal-to-noise ratio. The biases of all codes can approach 0.15 dex in stellar ages, metallicities and log M*/L_r , but remain < 0.05 for E(B-V). Using unrealistic Gaussian noise in the construction of mock spectra will underestimate the errors in the metallicities by a factor of two or more, and mocks without emission lines will underestimate the errors in stellar age and M*/L_r by a factor of two.
#### The $R$-Process Alliance: Detailed Composition of an $R$-Process  Enhanced Star with UV and Optical Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed chemical-abundance analysis of a highly $r$-process enhanced (RPE) star, 2MASS J00512646-1053170, using high-resolution spectroscopic observations with $Hubble\ Space\ Telescope$/STIS in the UV and Magellan/MIKE in the optical. We determined abundances for 41 elements in total, including 23 $r$-process elements and rarely probed species such as Al II, Ge I, Mo II, Cd I, Os II, Pt I, and Au I. We find that [Ge/Fe] $= +0.10$, which is an unusually high Ge enhancement for such a metal-poor star and indicates contribution from a production mechanism decoupled from that of Fe. We also find that this star has the highest Cd abundance observed for a metal-poor star to date. We find that the dispersion in the Cd abundances of metal-poor stars can be explained by the correlation of Cd I abundances with the stellar parameters of the stars, indicating the presence of NLTE effects. We also report that this star is now only the 6th star with Au abundance determined. This result, along with abundances of Pt and Os, uphold the case for the extension of the universal $r$-process pattern to the third $r$-process peak and to Au. This study adds to the sparse but growing number of RPE stars with extensive chemical-abundance inventories and highlights the need for not only more abundance determinations of these rarely probed species, but also advances in theoretical NLTE and astrophysical studies to reliably understand the origin of $r$-process elements.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) plays an important role in astronomy and geodesy. The realization of ICRF is based on the position of thousands of quasars observed using the Very-Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique. Better quality of ICRF is achieved when the position of the quasars is stable. In this study, we aim to analyze the stability of one of the quasars in ICRF called 4C31.61 (2201+315). We performed VLBI data analysis by using Vienna VLBI and Satellite Software (VieVS) to get the position of the quasar. We also used the data of the quasar's position from the Paris Observatory Geodetic VLBI Center. We examined the stability of the quasar position by using the Allan standard deviation technique. We found that the quasar 4C31.61 (2201+315) has a stable position with the dominance of white noise across the majority of time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23 and 24 to investigate whether the base of the solar convection zone shows any departure from spherical symmetry. We used the even-order splitting coefficients, $a_2$-$a_8$, and estimated the contributions from each one separately. The average asphericity over the two solar cycles was determined using frequencies and splittings obtained with a 9216-day time-series. We find that evidence of asphericity is, {\em at best}, marginal: the $a_2$ component is consistent with no asphericity, the $a_4$ and $a_6$ components yield results at a level a little greater than $1\,\sigma$, while the $a_8$ component shows a signature below $1\,\sigma$. The combined results indicate that the time average of the departure from the spherically symmetric position of the base of the convection zone is $\lesssim 0.0001R_\odot$. We have also used helioseismic data obtained from time-series of lengths 360 days, 576 days, 1152 days, and 2304 days in order to examine the consistency of the results and evaluate whether there is any time variation. We find that the evidence for time variation is statistically marginal in all cases, except for the $a_6$ component, for which tests consistently yield $p$ values of less than $0.05$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the prompt emission properties of the long duration GRB~200613A using \textit{Fermi}-Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. The prompt emission light curve of GRB~200613A reveals a strong peak emission up to $\sim$ 50 s after the burst accompanied by an extended emission up to $\sim$ 470 s similar to that seen in ultra-long GRB light curves. The time-integrated spectroscopy shows that the Band function best fits the main emission episode, and the extended emission follows the power-law behaviour because of poor count rates. Due to its high isotropic energy and low peak energy, GRB~200613A lies at the extreme end in both the $E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ and $E_{\rm p}$--$T_{90}$ plots. In addition to the GBM detection, the \textit{Fermi}-LAT detected the highest energetic photons of 7.56 GeV after 6.2 ks since burst, which lies beyond the maximum synchrotron energy range.
#### Investigating the Ultra-Compact X-ray Binary Candidate SLX 1735-269 with  NICER and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 We present two simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate SLX 1735-269. Using various reflection modeling techniques, we find that XILLVERCO, a model used for fitting X-ray spectra of UCXBs with high carbon and oxygen abundances is an improvement over RELXILL or RELXILLNS, which instead contains solar-like chemical abundances. This provides indirect evidence in support of the source being ultra-compact. We also use this reflection model to get a preliminary measurement of the inclination of the system, i = $57^{+23}_{-6}$ degrees. This is consistent with our timing analysis, where a lack of eclipses indicates an inclination lower than 80 degrees. The timing analysis is otherwise inconclusive, and we can not confidently measure the orbital period of the system.
#### Shallower radius valley around low-mass hosts provides evidence for icy  planets or collisions

 - **Abstract**
 The radius valley, i.e., a dearth of planets with radii between 1.5 and 2 Earth radii, provides insights into planetary formation and evolution. Using homogenously revised planetary parameters from Kepler 1-minute short cadence light curves, we remodel transits of 72 small planets orbiting low-mass stars, improving the precision and accuracy of planet parameters. By combining this sample with a similar sample of planets around higher-mass stars, we determine the depth of the radius valley as a function of stellar mass. We find that the radius valley is shallower for low-mass stars compared to their higher mass counterparts. Upon comparison, we find that theoretical models of photoevaporation under-predict the number of planets observed inside the radius valley for low-mass stars: with decreasing stellar mass, the predicted fraction of planets inside the valley remains approximately constant whereas the observed fraction increases. We argue that this provides evidence for the presence of icy planets around low-mass stars. Alternatively, planets orbiting low-mass stars undergo more frequent collisions. We predict that more precise mass measurements for planets orbiting low mass stars would be able to distinguish between these scenarios.
#### Multi-energy diffuse neutrino fluxes originating from core-collapse  supernovae

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12403
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12403
 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive framework is proposed for the diffuse neutrino fluxes attributed to two different physical processes in core collapse of massive stars. In this scheme, models of thermal MeV-scale neutrinos produced at the core of collapsing stars and non-thermal high-energy neutrinos emitted from accelerated cosmic rays interacting with circumstellar material are bridged through features of core-collapse supernovae (progenitor mass and optical properties). The calculated diffuse fluxes are presented with discussion about their detection prospects at neutrino telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 From Nov. 2019 to May 2020, the red supergiant star Betelgeuse experienced an unprecedented drop of brightness in the visible domain called the great dimming event. Large atmospheric dust clouds and large photospheric convective features are suspected to be responsible for it. To better understand the dimming event, we used mid-infrared long-baseline spectro-interferometric measurements of Betelgeuse taken with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument before (Dec. 2018), during (Feb. 2020), and after (Dec. 2020) the GDE. We present data in the 3.98 to 4.15\,$\mu$m range to cover SiO spectral features molecules as well as adjacent continuum. We have employed geometrical models, image reconstruction, as well as radiative transfer models to monitor the spatial distribution of SiO over the stellar surface. We find a strongly in-homogeneous spatial distribution of SiO that appears to be looking very different between our observing epochs, indicative of a vigorous activity in the stellar atmosphere. The contrast of our images is small in the pseudo-continuum for all epochs, implying that our MATISSE observations support both cold spot and dust cloud model.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the jitter noise resulting from single-pulse phase and shape variations is important for the detection of gravitational waves using pulsar timing array. We presented measurements of jitter noise and single-pulse variability of 12 millisecond pulsars that are part of the International Pulsar Timing Array sample using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We found that the levels of jitter noise can vary dramatically among pulsars. A moderate correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.57 between jitter noise and pulse width is detected. To mitigate jitter noise, we performed matrix template matching using all four Stokes parameters. Our results revealed a reduction in jitter noise ranging from 6.7\% to 39.6\%. By performing longitude-resolved fluctuation spectrum analysis, we identified periodic intensity modulations in 10 pulsars. In PSR J0030+0451, we detected single-pulses with energies more than 10 times the average pulse energy, suggesting the presence of giant pulses. We also observed a periodic mode-changing phenomenon in PSR J0030+0451. We examined the achievable timing precision by selecting a sub-set of pulses with a specific range of peak intensity, but no significant improvement in timing precision is achievable.
#### A new route to massive hot subdwarfs: common envelope ejection from  asymptotic giant branch stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12429
 - **Abstract**
 The hot subdwarf O/B stars (sdO/Bs) are known as extreme horizontal branch stars, which is of great importance in stellar evolution theory. The sdO/Bs are generally thought to have a helium-burning core and a thin hydrogen envelope $(M_{\rm env }<0.02M_\odot)$. In the canonical binary evolution scenario, sdO/Bs are considered to be the stripped cores of red giants. However, such a scenario cannot explain the recently discovered sdO/B binary, SMSS J1920, where the strong Ca H$\&$K lines in the spectrum are found. It suggests that this binary is likely originated from the recent ejection of common envelope (CE). In this {work}, we proposed a new formation channel of massive sdO/Bs, namely sdO/Bs produced from a CE ejection process with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (hereafter AGB CE channel). We constructed the evolutionary model of sdO/Bs and successfully explained most of the important observed parameters of the sdO/B star in SMSS J1920, including the evolutionary age, sdO/B mass, effective temperature, surface gravity and surface helium abundance. The minimum sdO/B mass produced from the AGB CE channel is about $0.48M_\odot$. The evolutionary tracks in $\log T_{\rm eff}-\log g$ plane {may explain a fraction of the observational samples} with high-$\log T_{\rm eff}$ and low-$\log g$. Considering wind mass-loss of sdO/Bs, the model could produce helium-rich hot subdwarfs with $\log (n_{\rm He}/n_{\rm H})\gtrsim-1$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the outflows detected in HOPS 373SW, a protostar undergoing a modest $30\%$ brightness increase at 850 $\mu$m. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of shock tracers, including SiO 8--7, CH$_3$OH 7$_{\rm k}$--6$_{\rm k}$, and $^{12}$CO 3--2 emission, reveal several outflow features around HOPS 373SW. The knots in the extremely high-velocity SiO emission reveal the wiggle of the jet, for which a simple model derives a 37$^\circ$ inclination angle of the jet to the plane of the sky, a jet velocity of 90 km s$^{-1}$, and a period of 50 years. The slow SiO and CH$_3$OH emission traces U-shaped bow shocks surrounding the two CO outflows. One outflow is associated with the high-velocity jets, while the other is observed to be close to the plane of the sky. The misaligned outflows imply that previous episodic accretion events have either reoriented HOPS 373SW or that it is an unresolved protostellar binary system with misaligned outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The remnant of the historical supernova 1181 has recently been claimed to be associated with a white dwarf merger remnant J005311. The supernova remnant (SNR) shock, and a termination shock expected to be formed by the intense wind of J005311, are potential sites for radio emission via synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. In this paper, we estimate the radio emission from these two shocks, and find the peak radio flux to be 0.1--10 mJy (at 0.01--1 GHz) in the outer SNR shock and 0.01--0.1 mJy (at 1--10 GHz) in the inner termination shock. We also search for radio emission from this source in the archival data of the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey at 3 GHz, NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz and the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey at 408 MHz, resulting in no significant detection. While targeted observations with higher sensitivity are desired, we particularly encourage those at higher frequency and angular resolution, such as the Jansky VLA in X-band (10 GHz), to probe the inner termination shock and its evolution.
#### Apparently ultra-long period radio sources from self-lensed pulsar-black  hole binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar-black hole (BH) close binary systems, which have not been found yet, are unique laboratories for testing theories of gravity and understanding the formation channels of gravitational-wave sources. We study the self-gravitational lensing effect in a pulsar-BH system on the pulsar's emission. Because this effect occurs once per orbital period for almost edge-on binaries, we find that it could generate apparently ultra-long period (minutes to hours) radio signals when the intrinsic pulsar signal is too weak to detect. Each of such lensed signals, or 'pulse', is composed of a number of amplified intrinsic pulsar pulses. The model is applied to three recently found puzzling long-period radio sources: GLEAM-X J1627, PSR J0901-4046, and GPM J1839-10. To explain their observed signal durations and periods, the masses of their lensing components would be $\sim10^4 M_{\odot}$, $\sim4 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim10^{3-6} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Their binary coalescence times are from a few tens to thousands of years. We estimate that a radio telescope with a sensitivity of 10 mJy could detect approximately 20 systems that emit such signals in our galaxy. For a binary containing a millisecond pulsar and a stellar-mass BH, the Shapiro delay effect would cause at least a 10% variation of the profile width for the sub-pulses in such lensed signals.

 We present the first estimate of the intrinsic binary fraction of young stars across the central $\approx$ 0.4 pc surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Milky Way Galactic center (GC). This experiment searched for photometric variability in 102 young stars, using 119 nights of 10"-wide adaptive optics imaging observations taken at Keck Observatory over 16 years in the K'- and H-bands. We photometrically detected three binary stars, all of which are situated more than 1" (0.04 pc) from the SMBH and one of which, S2-36, is newly reported here with spectroscopic confirmation. To convert the observed binary fraction into an estimate of the underlying binary fraction, we determined experiment sensitivity through detailed light curve simulations, incorporating photometric effects from eclipses, irradiation, and tidal distortion in stellar binaries. The simulations assumed a population of young binary stars, with age (4 Myr) and masses matched to the most probable values measured for the GC young star population and underlying binary system parameters similar to that of local massive stars. The detections and simulations imply young, massive stars in the GC have a stellar binary fraction $\geq$ 71% (68% confidence), or $\geq$ 42% (95% confidence). The inferred binary fraction of young stars at the GC is consistent with that typically seen in young stars in the solar neighborhood. Furthermore, our measured binary fraction is significantly higher than that recently reported by Chu et al. (2023) based on RV measurements of young stars <~1" of the SMBH. Constrained with these two studies, the probability that the same underlying young binary fraction extends across the entire region is <1.4%. This tension provides support for a radial dependence of the binary star fraction and, therefore, for the dynamical predictions of binary mergers and binary evaporation events close to the SMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent stellar occultations allowed accurate instantaneous size and apparent shape determinations of the large Kuiper belt object (50000) Quaoar and detected two rings with spatially variable optical depth. In this paper we present new visible range light curve data of Quaoar from the Kepler/K2 mission, and thermal light curves at 100 and 160\,$\mu$m obtained with Herschel/PACS. K2 data provide a single-peaked period of 8.88 h, very close to the previously determined 8.84 h, and it favours an asymmetric double-peaked light curve with 17.76 h period. We clearly detected a thermal light curve with relative amplitudes of $\sim$10% both at 100 and 160 $\mu$m. A detailed thermophysical modeling of the system shows that the measurements can be best fitted with a triaxial ellipsoid shape, with a volume-equivalent diameter of 1090 km, and axis ratios of a/b = 1.19, and b/c = 1.16. This shape matches the published occultation shape, as well as visual and thermal light curve data. The radiometric size uncertainty remains relatively large ($\pm$40 km) as the ring and satellite contributions to the system-integrated flux densities are unknown. In the less likely case of negligible ring/satellite contributions, Quaoar would have a size above 1100 km and a thermal inertia $\leq$ 10 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$. A large and dark Weywot in combination with a possible ring contribution would lead to a size below 1080 km in combination with a thermal inertia $\gtrsim$ 10 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$, notably higher than that of smaller Kuiper belt objects with similar albedo and colours. We find that Quaoar's density is in the range 1.67-1.77 g/cm$^3$ significantly lower than previous estimates. This density value fits very well to the relationship observed between the size and density of the largest Kuiper belt objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lac object PKS 0735+178 was in its historic $\gamma$-ray brightness state during December 2021. This period also coincides with the detection of a neutrino event IC211208A, which was localized close to the vicinity of PKS 0735+178. We carried out detailed $\gamma$-ray timing and spectral analysis of the source in three epochs (a) quiescent state ($E_{1}$), (b) moderate activity state ($E_{2}$) and (c) high activity state ($E_{3}$) coincident with the epoch of neutrino detection. During the epoch of neutrino detection ($E_{3}$), we found the largest variability amplitude of 95%. The $\gamma$-ray spectra corresponding to these three epochs are well fit by the power law model and the source is found to show spectral variations with a softer when brighter trend. In the epoch $E_{3}$, we found the shortest flux doubling/halving time of 5.75 hrs. Even though the spectral energy distribution in the moderate activity state and in the high activity state could be modeled by the one-zone leptonic emission model, the spectral energy distribution in the quiescent state required an additional component of radiation over and above the leptonic component. Here we show that a photo-meson process was needed to explain the excess $\gamma$-ray emission in the hundreds of GeV which could not be accounted for by the synchrotron self-Compton process.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral smoothness properties of the low-frequency array of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), namely SKA-Low, are an important issue for its scientific objectives to be attainable. A large array of 256 log-periodic dipole antennas, installed on top of a 42~m circular ground plane, will work as an SKA-Low station in the frequency range 50-350 MHz. In this article, the ground plane induced effects are examined in terms of antenna beam spectral characteristics, while different antenna placements are considered. Results are produced both at isolated antenna and at array level in the band 50-100 MHz, by employing an approximate method for the speeding-up of array simulations. We attempt to distinguish the ground plane effect from that of mutual coupling among antennas, which appears to be more severe at specific frequencies, using 2 figures of merit. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) components of gain pattern ratios identify the fundamental spatial components of the ripple, while the Envelope Correlation Coefficient quantifies the penalty to considering an infinite ground plane.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation metal free stars, referred to as population III (Pop III) stars, are believed to be the first objects to form out of the pristine gas in the very early Universe. Pop III stars have different structures from the current generation of stars and are important for generating heavy elements and shaping subsequent star formation. However, it is very challenging to directly detect Pop III stars given their high redshifts and short lifetimes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature for detecting Pop III stars through their tidal disruption events (TDEs) by massive black holes. We model the emission properties and calculate the expected rates for these unique TDEs in the early Universe at z ~ 10. We find that Pop III star TDEs have much higher mass fallback rates compared to normal TDEs in the local universe and are therefore rather luminous, rendering them feasible for detection. They also have very long observed flare evolution timescale, making it more likely to detect such TDEs during their rising phase. We further demonstrate that a large fraction of the TDE emissions are redshifted to infrared wavelengths and can be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Lastly, the TDE rate sensitively depends on the black hole mass function in the early Universe. We find a promising Pop III star TDE detection rate of up to a few tens per year using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 By accurately measuring composition and energy spectrum of cosmic ray, the origin problem of so called "keen" region (energy > 1 PeV) can be solved. However, up to the present, the results of the spectrum in the knee region obtained by several previous experiments have shown obvious differences, so they cannot give effective evidence for judging the theoretical models on the origin of the knee. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has reported several major breakthroughs and important results in astro-particle physics field. Relying on its advantages of wide-sky survey, high altitude location and large area detector arrays, the research content of LHAASO experiment mainly includes ultra high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, measurement of cosmic ray spectra in the knee region, searching for dark matter and new phenomena of particle physics at higher energy. The electron and Thermal Neutron detector (EN-Detector) is a new scintillator detector which applies thermal neutron detection technology to measure cosmic ray extensive air shower (EAS). This technology is an extension of LHAASO. The EN-Detector Array (ENDA) can highly efficiently measure thermal neutrons generated by secondary hadrons so called "skeleton" of EAS. In this paper, we perform the optimization of ENDA configuration, and obtain expectations on the ENDA results, including thermal neutron distribution, trigger efficiency and capability of cosmic ray composition separation. The obtained real data results are consistent with those by the Monte Carlo simulation.
#### A New Precise Determination of the Primordial Abundance of Deuterium:  Measurement in the metal-poor sub-DLA system at z=3.42 towards quasar  J1332+0052

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, coupled with an estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance (D/H)_pr, offers insights into the baryon density of the Universe. Independently, the baryon density can be constrained during a different cosmological era through the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. The comparison of these estimates serves as a rigorous test for the self-consistency of the Standard Cosmological Model and stands as a potent tool in the quest for new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics. For a meaningful comparison, a clear understanding of the various systematic errors affecting deuterium measurements is crucial. Given the limited number of D/H measurements, each new estimate carries significant weight. This study presents the detection of DI absorption lines in a metal-poor sub-Damped Lyman-alpha system ([O/H]=-1.71+-0.02, logN(HI)=19.304+-0.004) at z_abs=3.42 towards the quasar J1332+0052. Through simultaneous fitting of HI and DI Lyman-series lines, as well as low-ionization metal lines, observed at high spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise using VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, we derive log(DI/HI)=-4.622+-0.014, accounting for statistical and systematic uncertainties of 0.008dex and 0.012dex, respectively. Thanks to negligible ionization corrections and minimal deuterium astration at low metallicity, this D/H ratio provides a robust measurement of the primordial deuterium abundance, consistent and competitive with previous works. Incorporating all prior measurements, the best estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance is constrained as: (D/H)_pr=(2.533+-0.024)*10^-5. This represents a 5% improvement in precision over previous studies and reveals a moderate tension with the expectation from the Standard Model (~2.2sig). This discrepancy underscores the importance of further measurements in the pursuit of new physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Measured properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key tools for research into pre-main-sequence stellar evolution. YSO properties are commonly measured by comparing observed radiation to existing grids of template YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) calculated by radiative transfer. These grids are often sampled and constructed using simple models of mass assembly/accretion over time. However, because we do not yet have a complete theory of star formation, the choice of model sets the tracked parameters and range of allowed values. By construction, then, the assumed model limits the measurements that can be made using the grid. Radiative transfer models not constrained by specific accretion histories would enable assessment of a wider range of theories. We present an updated version of the Robitaille (2017) set of YSO SEDs, a collection of models with no assumed evolutionary theory. We outline our newly calculated properties: envelope mass, weighted-average dust temperature, disk stability, and circumstellar $A_{\rm V}$. We also convolve the SEDs with new filters, including JWST, and provide users the ability to perform additional convolutions. We find a correlation between the average temperature and millimeter-wavelength brightness of optically thin dust in our models and discuss its ramifications for mass measurements of pre- and protostellar cores. We also compare the positions of YSOs of different observational classes and evolutionary stages in IR color space and use our models to quantify the extent to which class and stage may be confused due to observational effects. Our updated models are released to the public.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model is the most accredited cosmological model, information at intermediate redshifts (z) between type Ia Supernovae (z = 2.26) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (z = 1100) is crucial to validate this model further. Here, we present a detailed and reliable methodology for binning the quasars (QSO) data that allows the identification of a golden sample of QSOs to be used as standard candles. This procedure has the advantage of being very general. Thus, it can be applied to any astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. This methodology allows us to avoid the circularity problem since it involves a flux-flux relation and includes the analysis of removing selection biases and the redshift evolution. With this method, we have discovered a sample of 1253 quasars up to z = 7.54 with reduced intrinsic dispersion of the relation between Ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes, with $\delta_{int} = 0.096\pm 0.003$ (56\% less than the original sample where $\delta_{int} =0.22$). Once the luminosities are corrected for selection biases and redshift evolution, this `gold' sample allows us to determine the matter density parameter to be $\Omega_M=0.240 \pm 0.064$. This value is aligned with the results of the $\Lambda CDM$ model obtained with SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the long-term (rest-frame time scales from a few months to $\sim 20$ years) X-ray variability of a sample of 2344 X-ray bright quasars from the SDSS DR14Q Catalogue, based on the data of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey complemented for $\sim 7$% of the sample by archival data from the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue. We characterise variability by a structure function, $SF^2(\Delta t)$. We confirm the previously known anti-correlation of the X-ray variability amplitude with luminosity. We also study the dependence of X-ray variability on black hole mass, $M_{\rm BH}$, and on an X-ray based proxy of the Eddington ratio, $\lambda_{\rm X}$. Less massive black holes prove to be more variable for given Eddington ratio and time scale. X-ray variability also grows with decreasing Eddington ratio and becomes particularly strong at $\lambda_{\rm X}$ of less than a few per cent. We confirm that the X-ray variability amplitude increases with increasing time scale. The $SF^2(\Delta t)$ dependence can be satisfactorily described by a power law, with the slope ranging from $\sim 0$ to $\sim 0.4$ for different ($M_{\rm BH}$, $\lambda_{\rm X}$) subsamples (except for the subsample with the lowest black hole mass and lowest Eddington ratio, where it is equal to $1.1\pm 0.4$)

 - **Abstract**
 In the interstellar medium (ISM), the complex prebiotic molecule cyanamide (NH$_{2}$CN) plays a key role in producing adenine (C$_{5}$H$_{5}$N$_{5}$), purines (C$_{5}$H$_{4}$N$_{4}$), pyrimidines (C$_{4}$H$_{4}$N$_{2}$), and other biomolecules via a series of reactions. Therefore, studying the emission lines of NH$_{2}$CN is important for understanding the hypothesis of the pre-solar origin of life in the universe. We present the detection of the rotational emission lines of NH$_{2}$CN with vibrational states $v$ = 0 and 1 towards the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 using the high-resolution twelve-meter array of Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 3. The estimated column density of NH$_{2}$CN towards G31.41+0.31 using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model is (7.21$\pm$0.25)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 250$\pm$25 K. The abundance of NH$_{2}$CN with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G31.41+0.31 is (7.21$\pm$1.46)$\times$10$^{-10}$. The NH$_{2}$CN and NH$_{2}$CHO column density ratio towards G31.41+0.31 is 0.13$\pm$0.02. We compare the estimated abundance of NH$_{2}$CN with that of other hot cores and corinos and observed that the abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards G31.41+0.31 is nearly similar to that of the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, the hot corinos IRAS 16293-2422 B, and NGC 1333 IRAS4A2. We compute the two-phase warm-up chemical model of NH$_{2}$CN using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM, and after chemical modelling, we notice that the observed and modelled abundances are nearly similar. After chemical modelling, we conclude that the neutral-neutral reaction between NH$_{2}$ and CN is responsible for the production of NH$_{2}$CN on the grain surface of G31.41+0.31.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent pulsar timing observations with MeerKAT on the eccentric binary millisecond pulsar, PSR J0514$-$4002E, reveal a companion with a mass (between $2.09\, M_\odot$ and $2.71\, M_\odot$) in the mass gap, challenging conventional astrophysical scenarios for black hole formation. In this letter, we propose an alternative explanation: PSR J0514$-$4002E exists in a PBH-NS binary, with the companion potentially being a primordial black hole formed during the early Universe's first-order phase transition. The associated stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during this phase transition can explain the detected signal from the pulsar timing array and the abundance of primordial black holes is consistent with constraints from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.

 - **Abstract**
 New boron abundances or upper limits have been determined for 8 early-B stars in the young Galactic open cluster NGC 3293, using ultraviolet spectra obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. With previous observations, there are now 18 early-B stars in this cluster with boron measurements. Six of the newly observed stars have projected rotational velocities greater than 200 km/s, allowing new constraints on rotationally driven mixing in main-sequence stars. When comparing to synthetic model populations, we find that the majority of our sample stars agree well with the predicted trends of stronger boron depletion for larger rotation and for larger mass or luminosity. Based on those, a smaller than the canonical rotational mixing efficiency,(fc = 0.0165 vs the more standard value of 0.033), appears to be required. However, our five most slowly rotating stars are not well explained by rotational mixing, and we speculate that they originate from binary mergers.

We describe the properties of atmospheric features traced by aerosols covering a large range of spatial and temporal scales, including dynamical interpretations and modelling when available. We present the areographic distribution and the daily and seasonal cycles of those atmospheric phenomena. We rely primarily on images taken by cameras on Mars Express.

 The pressure sensors on Mars rover Perseverance measure the pressure field in the Jezero crater on regular hourly basis starting in sol 15 after landing. The present study extends up to sol 460 encompassing the range of solar longitudes from Ls 13{\deg} - 241{\deg} (Martian Year (MY) 36). The data show the changing daily pressure cycle, the sol-to-sol seasonal evolution of the mean pressure field driven by the CO2 sublimation and deposition cycle at the poles, the characterization of up to six components of the atmospheric tides and their relationship to dust content in the atmosphere. They also show the presence of wave disturbances with periods 2-5 sols, exploring their baroclinic nature, short period oscillations (mainly at night-time) in the range 8-24 minutes that we interpret as internal gravity waves, transient pressure drops with duration 1-150 s produced by vortices, and rapid turbulent fluctuations. We also analyze the effects on pressure measurements produced by a regional dust storm over Jezero at Ls 155{\deg}.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong deviations from scale invariance and the appearance of high peaks in the primordial power spectrum have been extensively studied for generating primordial black holes (PBHs) or gravitational waves (GWs). It is also well-known that the effect of non-linearities can be significant in both phenomena. In this paper, we advocate the existence of a general single-field consistency relation that relates the amplitude of non-Gaussianity in the squeezed limit $f_{\text{NL}}$ to the power spectrum and remains valid when almost all other consistency relations are violated. In particular, it is suitable for studying scenarios where scale invariance is strongly violated. We discuss the general and model-independent consequences of the consistency relation on the behavior of $f_{\text{NL}}$ at different scales. Specifically, we study the size, sign and slope of $f_{\text{NL}}$ at the scales where the power spectrum peaks and argue that generally the peaks of $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the power spectrum occur at different scales. As an implication of our results, we argue that non-linearities can shift or extend the range of scales responsible for the production of PBHs or GWs, relative to the window as determined by the largest peak of the power spectrum, and may also open up new windows for both phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is located close to the Galactic mid-plane, meaning that we observe the Galaxy through significant quantities of dust. Moreover, the vast majority of the Galaxy's stars also lie in the disc, meaning that dust has an enormous impact on the massive astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy that are currently underway. To exploit the data from these surveys we require good three-dimensional maps of the Galaxy's dust. We present a new method for making such maps in which we form the best linear unbiased predictor of the extinction at an arbitrary point based on the extinctions for a set of observed stars. This method allows us to avoid the artificial inhomogeneities (so-called 'fingers of God') and resolution limits that are characteristic of many published dust maps. Moreover, it requires minimal assumptions about the statistical properties of the interstellar medium. In fact, we require only a model of the first and second moments of the dust density field. The method is suitable for use with directly measured extinctions, such as those provided by the Rayleigh-Jeans colour excess method, and inferred extinctions, such as those provided by hierarchical Bayesian models like StarHorse. We test our method by mapping dust in the region of the giant molecular cloud Orion A. Our results indicate a foreground dust cloud at a distance of 350 pc, which has been identified in work by another author.
