 - **Abstract**
 Prior to the 1990s, speculations about the occurrence of planets around other stars were based only on planet formation theory, observations of circumstellar disks, and the knowledge that at least one seemingly ordinary star is the host of four terrestrial planets, two gas giants, and two ice giants. Since then, Doppler and transit surveys have been exploring the population of planets around other Sun-like stars, especially those with orbital periods shorter than a few years. Over the last decade, these surveys have risen to new heights with Doppler spectrographs with a precision better than 1 m/s precision, and space telescopes capable of detecting the transits of Earth-sized planets. This article is a brief introductory review of the knowledge of planet occurrence that has been gained from these surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have two distinct emission episodes: prompt emission from ultra-relativistic ejecta and afterglow from shocked circumstellar material. While both components are extremely luminous in known GRBs, a variety of scenarios predict the existence of luminous afterglow emission with little or no associated high-energy prompt emission. We present AT 2019pim, the first secure example of this phenomenon to be identified. Serendipitously discovered during follow-up observations of a gravitational-wave trigger and located in a contemporaneous TESS sector, it is hallmarked by a fast-rising (t ~ 2 hr), luminous (M_UV,peak ~ -24.4 mag) optical transient with accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. No gamma-ray emission consistent with the time and location of the transient was detected by Fermi-GBM or by Konus, placing strong limits on an accompanying GRB. We investigate several independent observational aspects of the afterglow in the context of constraints on relativistic motion and find all of them are consistent with an initial Lorentz factor of Gamma_0 ~ 30-50, significantly lower than in any well-observed GRB and consistent with the theoretically-predicted "dirty fireball" scenario in which the high-energy prompt emission is stifled by pair production. However, we cannot rule out a structured jet model in which only the line-of-sight material was ejected at low-Gamma, off-axis from a classical high-Gamma jet core. This event represents a milestone in orphan afterglow searches, demonstrating that luminous afterglows with weak or no detectable gamma-ray radiation exist in nature and can be discovered by high-cadence optical surveys.
#### A High-Resolution Non-Detection of Escaping Helium In The Ultra-Hot  Neptune LTT 9779b: Evidence for Weakened Evaporation

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of ``ultra-hot'' ($P < 1$ day) Neptunes has come as a surprise: some of these planets have managed to retain gaseous envelopes despite being close enough to their host stars to trigger strong photoevaporation and/or Roche lobe overflow. Here, we investigate atmospheric escape in LTT 9779b, an ultra-hot Neptune with a volatile-rich envelope. We observed two transits of this planet using the newly-commissioned WINERED spectrograph ($R\sim68,000$) on the 6.5 m Clay/Magellan II Telescope, aiming to detect an extended upper atmosphere in the He 10830 A triplet. We found no detectable planetary absorption: in a 0.75 A passband centered on the triplet, we set a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.12% ($\delta R_p/H < 14$) and a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.20% ($\delta R_p/H < 22$). Using a H/He isothermal Parker wind model, we found corresponding 95% and 99.7% upper limits on the planetary mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} < 10^{10.03}$ g s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} < 10^{11.11}$ g s$^{-1}$ respectively, smaller than predicted by outflow models even considering the weak stellar XUV emission. The low evaporation rate is plausibly explained by a metal-rich envelope, which would decrease the atmospheric scale height and increase the cooling rate of the outflow. This hypothesis is imminently testable: if metals commonly weaken planetary outflows, then we expect that \textit{JWST} will find high atmospheric metallicities for small planets that have evaded detection in He 10830 A.
#### Airy worlds or barren rocks? On the survivability of secondary  atmospheres around the TRAPPIST-1 planets

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we aim to determine the atmospheric survivability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets by modelling the response of the upper atmosphere to incoming stellar high-energy radiation. Through this case study, we also aim to learn more about rocky planet atmospheres in the habitable zone around low-mass M dwarfs. We simulated the upper atmospheres using the Kompot code, a self-consistent thermo-chemical code. Specifically, we studied the atmospheric mass loss due to Jeans escape induced by stellar high-energy radiation. This was achieved through a grid of models that account for the differences in planetary properties, irradiances, and atmospheric properties, allowing the exploration of the different factors influencing atmospheric loss. The present-day irradiance of the TRAPPIST-1 planets would lead to the loss of an Earth's atmosphere within just some 100 Myr. Taking into account the much more active early stages of a low-mass M dwarf, the planets undergo a period of even more extreme mass loss, regardless of planetary mass or atmospheric composition. This indicates that it is unlikely that any significant atmosphere could survive for any extended amount of time around any of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. The assumptions used here allow us to generalise the results, and we conclude that the results tentatively indicate that this conclusion applies to all Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of low-mass M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations of the central 1 kpc of the M 82 starburst obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared camera (NIRCam) instrument at a resolution ~0.05"-0.1" (~1-2 pc). The data comprises images in three mostly continuum filters (F140M, F250M, and F360M), and filters that contain [FeII] (F164N), H2 v=1-0 (F212N), and the 3.3 um PAH feature (F335M). We find prominent plumes of PAH emission extending outward from the central starburst region, together with a network of complex filamentary substructure and edge-brightened bubble-like features. The structure of the PAH emission closely resembles that of the ionized gas, as revealed in Paschen alpha and free-free radio emission. We discuss the origin of the structure, and suggest the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel, data-driven model of deflagration-to-detonationtransition (DDT) is constructed for application to explosions of thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia). The DDT mechanism has been suggested as the necessary physics process to obtain qualitative agreement between SN Ia observations and computational explosion models. This work builds upon a series of studies of turbulent combustion that develops during the final stages of the SN explosion. These studies suggest that DDT can occur in the turbulerized flame of the white dwarf via the Zel'dovich reactivity gradient mechanism when hotspots are formed. We construct a large database of direct numerical simulations that explore the parameter space of the Zel'dovich initiated detonation. We use this database to construct a neural network classifier for hotspots. The classifier is integrated into our supernova simulation code, FLASH/Proteus, and is used as the basis for a subgrid-scale model for DDT. The classifier is evaluated both in the training environment and in reactive turbulence simulations to verify its accuracy in realistic conditions.
#### Insight into the Galactic Bulge Chemodynamical Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the chemodynamical properties of the Galaxy in the azimuthal velocity $V_\phi$ and metallicity [Fe/H] space using red giant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. The row-normalized $V_\phi$-[Fe/H] maps form a coherent sequence from the bulge to the outer disk, clearly revealing the thin/thick disk and the Splash. The metal-rich stars display bar-like kinematics while the metal-poor stars show dispersion-dominated kinematics. The intermediate-metallicity population ($-1<$[Fe/H]$<-0.4$) can be separated into two populations, one that is bar-like, i.e. dynamically cold ($\sigma_{V_R}\sim80$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) and fast rotating ($V_\phi\gtrsim100$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$), and the Splash, which is dynamically hot ($\sigma_{V_R}\sim110$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) and slow rotating ($V_\phi\lesssim100$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$). We compare the observations in the bulge region with an Auriga simulation where the last major merger event concluded $\sim10$ Gyr ago: only stars born around the time of the merger reveal a Splash-like feature in the $V_\phi$-[Fe/H] space, suggesting that the Splash is likely merger-induced, predominantly made-up of heated disk stars and the starburst associated with the last major merger. Since the Splash formed from the proto-disk, its lower metallicity limit coincides with that of the thick disk. The bar formed later from the dynamically hot disk with [Fe/H] $>-1$ dex, with the Splash not participating in the bar formation and growth. Moreover, with a set of isolated evolving $N$-body disk simulations, we confirm that a non-rotating classical bulge can be spun up by the bar and develop cylindrical rotation, consistent with the observation for the metal-poor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of solar filaments, also known as prominences appearing off-limb, is a common phenomenon in the solar atmosphere. It ejects massive plasma and high-energy particles into interplanetary space, disturbing the solar-terrestrial environment. It is vital to obtain the three-dimensional velocity fields of erupting filaments for space-weather predictions. We derive the three-dimensional kinematics of an off-limb prominence and an on-disk filament, respectively, using the full-disk spectral and imaging data detected by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). It is found that both the prominence and the filament experience a fast semicircle-shaped expansion at first. The prominence keeps propagating outward with an increasing velocity until escaping successfully, whereas the south leg of the prominence finally moves back to the Sun in a swirling manner. For the filament, the internal plasma falls back to the Sun associated with an anticlockwise rotation in the late ejection, matching the failed eruption without a coronal mass ejection. During the eruptions, both the prominence and the filament show material splitting along the line-of-sight direction, revealed by the bimodal H$\alpha$ spectral profiles. For the prominence, the splitting begins at the top and gradually spreads to almost the whole prominence with a fast blue-shift component and a slow red-shift component. The material splitting in the filament is more fragmental. As shown by the present results, the CHASE full-disk spectroscopic observations make it possible to systematically study the three-dimensional kinematics of solar filament eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a long-term X-ray study of a nearby Active Galactic Nucleus Mrk 6, utilizing observations from XMM-Newton, Suzaku, Swift and NuSTAR observatories, spanning 22 years from 2001 to 2022. From timing analysis, we estimated variance, normalized variance, and fractional rms amplitude in different energy bands.The temporal study shows fractional rms amplitude ($F_{\rm var}$) below $10\%$ for the shorter timescale $(\sim60 ~\rm ks)$ and above $20\%$ for the longer timescale ($\sim \rm weeks$ ). A complex correlation is observed between the soft $(0.5-3.0$ keV) and hard $(3.0-10.0$ keV) X-ray bands of different epochs of observations. This result prompts a detailed investigation through spectral analysis, employing various phenomenological and physical models on the X-ray spectra. Our analysis reveals a heterogeneous structure of the obscuring material surrounding Mrk 6. A partially ionized absorber exhibits a rapid change in location and extends up to the narrow line regions or torus. In contrast, another component, located far from the central engine, remained relatively stable. During the observation period, the source luminosity in the 3.0--10.0 keV range varies between $(3-15) \times10^{42}$ erg $\rm sec^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (pop III) stars were born in halos characterised by a pristine gas composition. In such a halo, once the gas density reaches n$_{\mathrm{H}} \sim$ 1 cm$^{-3}$, molecular cooling leads to the collapse of the gas and the birth of pop III stars. Halo properties, such as the chemical abundances, mass, and angular momentum can affect the collapse of the gas, thereby leading to the pop III initial mass function (IMF) of star formation. We want to study the properties of primordial halos and how halos that host early star formation differ from other types of halos. The aim of this study is to obtain a representative population of halos at a given redshift hosting a cold and massive gas cloud that enables the birth of the first stars. We investigated the growth of primordial halos in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe in a large cosmological simulation. We used the hydrodynamic code RAMSES and the chemical solver KROME to study halo formation with non-equilibrium thermochemistry. We then identified structures in the dark and baryonic matter fields, thereby linking the presence or absence of dense gas clouds to the mass and the physical properties of the hosting halos. In our simulations, the mass threshold for a halo for hosting a cold dense gas cloud is $\simeq 7 \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$ and the threshold in the H$_2$ mass fraction is found to be $\simeq 2 \times 10^{-4}$. This is in agreement with previous works. We find that the halo history and accretion rate play a minor role. Here, we present halos with higher HD abundances, which are shown to be colder, as the temperature in the range between $10^2 - 10^4 \, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ depends on the HD abundance to a large extent. The higher fraction of HD is linked to the higher spin parameter that is seen for the dense gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar vortices are common in the atmospheres of rapidly rotating planets [1-4]. On Earth and Mars they are tied to the surface and their existence follows the seasonal insolation cycle [1-3]. Venus is a slowly rotating planet but it is also known to have vortices at both poles at the edge of a superrotating atmosphere [5-8]. However, their nature and long-term properties have not been constrained so far impeding precise modeling. Here we report cloud motions at two altitude levels (about 42 km and 63 km above the surface) using infrared images from the VIRTIS instrument onboard Venus Express that show that the south polar vortex is a permanent but erratic and unpredictable feature. We find that the centers of rotation of the vortex at these levels rarely coincide and both wander erratically around the pole with speeds of up to 16 m s-1. The cloud morphology and vorticity patches are uncorrelated and change continuously developing transient areas of small vertical motions. Venus south polar vortex is a continuously evolving structure immersed in a baroclinic environment laying at altitude levels that have variable vertical and meridional wind shears, extending at least 20 km in height through a quasi-convective turbulent region.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) of gamma ray observatory TAIGA detect the Extesnive Air Showers (EASs) originating from the cosmic or gamma rays interactions with the atmosphere. Thereby, telescopes obtain images of the EASs. The ability to segregate gamma rays images from the hadronic cosmic ray background is one of the main features of this type of detectors. However, in actual IACT observations simultaneous observation of the background and the source of gamma ray is needed. This observation mode (called wobbling) modifies images of events, which affects the quality of selection by neural networks. Thus, in this work, the results of the application of neural networks (NN) for image classification task on Monte Carlo (MC) images of TAIGA-IACTs are presented. The wobbling mode is considered together with the image adaptation for adequate analysis by NNs. Simultaneously, we explore several neural network structures that classify events both directly from images or through Hillas parameters extracted from images. In addition, by employing NNs, MC simulation data are used to evaluate the quality of the segregation of rare gamma events with the account of all necessary image modifications.
#### Partial tidal disruptions of spinning eccentric white dwarfs by spinning  intermediate mass black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) black holes. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruption of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive black holes. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between black hole and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. We find substantial effects of the ``coupling'' between the black hole spin and the spin of the white dwarf, although the pericenter distance of the white dwarf is taken to be large enough so that the Newtonian limit of its fluid dynamics is a robust approximation. In particular, the core mass, the bound tail mass, and the mass difference between the two tidal tails strongly depend on such ``coupled'' spin effects. However, the late time fallback rate of the debris behaves similar to the non-spinning cases. We also compute gravitational wave amplitudes and find that while the black hole spin influences the same, there is no evidence of influence of stellar spin on such amplitudes in our regime of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 Venus Express provided a long-term monitoring of Venus atmosphere. Several works focused on the dynamics of the upper cloud visible on the day-side in ultraviolet images sensitive to the 65-70 km altitude and in the lower cloud level (50 km height) observable in the night-side of the planet in 1.74 microns. Here we use VIRTIS-M spectral images to study the upper cloud layer in ultraviolet (360-400 nm), visible (570-680 nm) and near infrared (900-955 nm) extending in time previous analysis of VIRTIS-M data. UV images show relatively well contrasted cloud features at the cloud top. Cloud features in the visible and near infrared images lie a few kilometers below the upper cloud top, have low contrast and are distinct to the features observed in the uv. Wind measurements were obtained over a six-year period using a semi-automatic cloud correlation algorithm. Results for the upper cloud confirm analysis based on images obtained by the Venus Monitoring Camera (Khatuntsev et al. 2013). At the cloud top the mean zonal and meridional winds vary with local time accelerating towards the local afternoon. The upper branch of the Hadley cell reaches maximum velocities at 45deg latitude and local times of 14-16h. The mean zonal winds in the uv cloud accelerated in the course of the 2006-2012 period 15 ms-1. The near infrared and visible images show a more constant circulation without time variability or longitudinal variations. The meridional circulation is absent in near infrared and visible images indicating thatthe Hadley-cell circulation in Venus atmosphere is shallow or the returning branch of the meridional circulation extends to levels below levels sensed in near infrared images. At the clod tops observed in UV images there are signatures of a long-term acceleration of the zonal winds when comparing winds from 2006-2008 to 2009-2012 with a mean acceleration of 17 ms-1 between both time periods

 - **Abstract**
 Solar oscillations can be modeled by Galbrun's equation which describes Lagrangian wave displacement in a self-gravitating stratified medium. For spherically symmetric backgrounds, we construct an algorithm to compute efficiently and accurately the coefficients of the Green's tensor of the time-harmonic equation in vector spherical harmonic basis. With only two resolutions, our algorithm provides values of the kernels for all heights of source and receiver, and prescribes analytically the singularities of the kernels. We also derive absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) to model wave propagation in the atmosphere above the cut-off frequency. The construction of ABC, which contains varying gravity terms, is rendered difficult by the complex behavior of the solar potential in low atmosphere and for frequencies below the Lamb frequency. We carry out extensive numerical investigations to compare and evaluate the efficiency of the ABCs in capturing outgoing solutions. Finally, as an application towards helioseismology, we compute synthetic solar power spectra that contain pressure modes as well as internal-gravity (g-) and surface-gravity (f-) ridges which are missing in simpler approximations of the wave equation. For purpose of validation, the location of the ridges in the synthetic power spectra are compared with observed solar modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies of the protoplanetary disk HD 163296 revealed that the morphology of its sub-au infrared emission encompasses the terminal sublimation front of dust grains, referred to as the inner rim, but also extends into the (supposedly) dust-free region within it. Here, we present a set of radiative hydrostatic simulations of the inner rim in order to assess how much the rim alone can contribute to the observed interferometric visibilities $V$, half-light radii $R_{\mathrm{hl}}$, and fractional disk fluxes $\mathcal{F}$ in the wavelength range $1.5$--$13\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. In our set of models, we regulate the cooling efficiency of the disk via the boundary condition for radiation diffusion and we also modify the shape of the sublimation front. We find that when the cooling efficiency is reduced, the infrared photosphere at the rim becomes hotter, leading to an increase of $R_{\mathrm{hl}}$ sufficient to match the observations. However, the near-infrared disk flux is typically too low ($\mathcal{F}\simeq0.25$ at $1.5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$), resulting in H-band visibility curves located above the observed data. We show that the match to the H-band observations up to moderate baselines can be improved when a wall-shaped rather than curved sublimation front is considered. Nevertheless, our model visibilities always exhibit a bounce at long baselines, which is not observed, confirming the need for additional emission interior to the rim. In summary, our study illustrates how the temperature structure and geometry of the inner rim needs to change in order to boost the rim's infrared emission.

 - **Abstract**
 W43-main is a massive molecular complex located at the interaction of the Scutum arm and the Galactic bar undergoing starburst activities. We aim to investigate the gas dynamics, in particular, the prevailing shock signatures from the cloud to clump scale and assess the impact of shocks on the formation of dense gas and early-stage cores. We have carried out NOEMA and IRAM-30m observations at 3 mm with an angular resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc towards five massive clumps in W43 main. We use CH$_{3}$CCH and H$_{2}$CS lines to trace the extended gas temperature and CH$_{3}$OH lines to probe the volume density of the dense gas ($\gtrsim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$). The emission of SiO (2-1) is extensive across the region ($\sim$4 pc) and is mostly contained within a low-velocity regime, hinting at a large-scale origin of the shocks. The position-velocity maps of multiple tracers show systematic spatio-kinematic offsets supporting the cloud-cloud collision/merging scenario. We identify an additional extended velocity component in CCH emission, which coincides with one of the velocity components of the larger scale $^{13}$CO (2-1) emission, likely representing an outer, less dense gas layer in the cloud merging process. We find that the V-shaped, asymmetric SiO wings are tightly correlated with localised gas density enhancements, which is direct evidence of dense gas formation and accumulation in shocks. We resolve two categories of NH$_{2}$D cores: ones exhibiting only subsonic to transonic velocity dispersion, and the others with an additional supersonic velocity dispersion. The centroid velocities of the latter cores are correlated with the shock front seen by SiO. The kinematics of the $\sim$0.1 pc NH$_{2}$D cores are heavily imprinted by shock activities, and may represent a population of early-stage cores forming around the shock interface.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary broadening function (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of `sketching' (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of synchrotron X-ray emission from the shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006, multiple observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton have shown that many young SNRs produce synchrotron emission in X-rays. Among those, a few peculiar SNRs have their X-ray emission largely dominated by synchrotron radiation, showing no or only faint traces of thermal emission. In this paper, we report our mapping of the thermal emission in three emblematic synchrotron-dominated SNRs: G330.2+1.0, 3C58, and RX J1713.7-3946. We used a blind source separation method able to retrieve faint components from X-ray data in the form of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. The thermal candidates disentangled by the algorithm were then used to select regions of extraction. We then analyzed the extracted spectra to assess their physical nature. We conclude that the components retrieved by the algorithm indeed represent the spatial distribution of the thermal emission in G330.2+1.0 and 3C58, and a likely thermal candidate in RX J1713.7-3946. Our findings confirm and expand on past studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simeis~147 nebula (S147), particularly well known for a spectacular net of ${\rm H}_\alpha$-emitting filaments, is often considered one of the largest and oldest known supernova remnants in the Milky Way. Here, and in a companion paper, we present studies of X-ray emission from the S147 nebula using the data of SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations. In this paper, we argue that many inferred properties of the X-ray emitting gas are broadly consistent with a scenario of the supernova explosion in a low-density cavity, e.g. a wind-blown-bubble. This scenario assumes that a $\sim 20\,{\rm M_\odot}$ progenitor star has had small velocity with respect to the ambient ISM, so it stayed close to the center of a dense shell created during its Main Sequence evolution till the moment of the core-collapse explosion. The ejecta first propagate through the low-density cavity until they collide with the dense shell, and only then the reverse shock goes deeper into the ejecta and powers the observed X-ray emission of the nebula. The part of the remnant inside the dense shell remains non-radiative till now and, plausibly, in a state with $T_e<T_i$ and Non-Equilibrium Ionization (NEI). On the contrary, the forward shock becomes radiative immediately after entering the dense shell, and, being subject to instabilities, creates a characteristic "foamy" appearance of the nebula in ${\rm H}_\alpha$ and radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate production of non-thermal dark matter particle and heavy sterile neutrino from inflaton during the reheating era which is preceded by a slow-roll inflationary epoch with a quartic potential and non-minimal coupling ($\xi$) between the inflaton and the gravity. We compare our analysis between metric and Palatini formalism. For the latter with $\xi=0.5$ and number of $e$-folds $\sim 60$, $r$ can be as small as $\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$ which may be validated at $1-\sigma$ CL of prospective future reaches of upcoming CMB observation such as CMB-S4~etc. We identify that permissible range of Yukawa coupling $y_\chi$ between inflaton and fermionic DM $\chi$, to be ${\cal O}\left(10^{-3.5}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-20}\right)$ for metric formalism and ${\cal O}\left(10^{-4}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-11}\right)$ for Palatini formalism which is consistent with current PLANCK data and also be within the reach of future CMB experiments. For the scenario of leptogenesis via the decay of sterile neutrino produced from inflaton decay, we also investigate the parameter space of heavy neutrino mass $m_{N_1}$ and Yukawa coupling $y_{N_1}$ of sterile neutrino with inflaton, which are consistent with current CMB data and successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis. In contrast to metric formalism, in the case of Palatini formalism for successful leptogenesis to occur we find that $y_{N_1}$ has a very narrow allowable range and is severely constrained from the consistency with CMB predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the first X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1) performed by the eROSITA instrument onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission on X-ray emitting red giants and supergiants. Focussing on stars positioned at high galactic latitudes above 20 deg, we construct a complete sample of such objects using the Gaia DR3 catalog and identify a sample 96 stars appearing as bona fide entries in the eRASS1 source catalog. Restricting again the sample to objects nearer than 1300~pc and eliminating all catalog entries which are due to optical contamination, we end up with a sample of 16 genuine red giant/supergiant X-ray sources, which represent -- with the exception of one source (CL~Hyi) -- new X-ray detections. We furthermore present a low SNR X-ray spectrum of the nearby low activity giant Arcturus obtained from a pointed observation with the XMM-Newton satellite and give a detailed account of our data analysis. We show that Arcturus-like X-ray emission cannot be the explanation for the X-ray emissions observed by eROSITA and provide a discussion of the possible nature of the detected X-ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: During the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/ eROSITA all-sky surveys, X-ray sources close to the South Ecliptic Pole (SEP) are observed almost every 4 hours. We aim to identify the sources exhibiting the most significant long-term X-ray variability within 3 degrees of the SEP in the first three surveys, and investigate their properties. Methods: We determined the variability significance of all sources observed by eROSITA within 3 degrees of the SEP by using thresholds on the Bayesian excess variance (SCATT_LO) and the maximum amplitude deviation (AMPL_SIG). Sources exhibiting a variability significance above $3\sigma$ were subdivided into likely Galactic and extragalactic sources, by using spectral and photometric information of their optical counterparts. We quantified the X-ray normalised excess variances of all variable sources, and also calculated the periodograms of the brightest ones. Results: Out of more than $10^4$ X-ray sources detected by eROSITA within 3 degrees of the SEP, we identified 453 that exhibit significant X-ray variability. SCATT_LO is significantly more sensitive to detecting variable sources in this field, but AMPL_SIG helps provide a more complete variability sample. Of those variable sources, 168 were classified as likely extragalactic, and 235 as likely Galactic. The periodograms of most bright and variable extragalactic sources are approximately described by an aliased power law ($P\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$) with an index of $\alpha\approx 1$. We identified a potential tidal disruption event, and long-term transient sources. The stellar X-ray variability was predominantly caused by bright X-ray flares from coronally active stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the hydrogen density distribution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) using the X-ray absorption technique. Hydrogen column densities were precisely measured by fitting X-ray spectra from coronal sources observed during the initial {\it eROSITA} all-sky survey (eRASS1). Accurate distance measurements were obtained through cross-matching Galactic sources with the {\it Gaia} third data release (DR3). Despite the absence of a discernible correlation between column densities and distances or Galactic longitude, a robust correlation with Galactic latitude was identified. This suggests a decrease in ISM material density along the vertical direction away from the Galactic plane. To further investigate, we employed multiple density laws to fit the measured column densities, revealing constraints on height scale values ($8 < h_{z} < 30$~pc). Unfortunately, radial scales and central density remain unconstrained due to the scarcity of sources near the Galactic center. Subsequently, a 3D density map of the ISM was computed using a Gaussian processing approach, inferring hydrogen density distribution from hydrogen column densities. The results unveiled the presence of multiple beams and clouds of various sizes, indicative of small-scale structures. Large density regions were identified at approximately 100~pc, consistent with findings in dust reddening studies, potentially associated with the Galactic Perseus arm. Moreover, high-density regions were pinpointed in proximity to the Orion star-forming region and the Chamaeleon molecular complex, enriching our understanding of the intricate structure of the local interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Although flux variability is one of the defining properties of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes, its dependence on physical parameters such as the mass of the compact object and the Eddington ratio remain under discussion. In this paper we address this issue using the structure function statistic to measure the variability at X-ray wavelengths of a sample of optically selected QSOs with available black hole masses and Eddington ratios. We present a new Bayesian methodology for estimating the structure function tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray data. This is applied to 15,548 SDSS DRQ16 QSOs with repeat observations in the XMM-Newton archive and/or the SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey. The X-ray structure function monotonically increases to time intervals of about 10-15 years, suggesting a preference for scenarios in which instabilities of the accretion disk contribute to the X-ray variability on long timescales. Additionally, there is evidence that the amplitude of the stochastic X-ray flux variations rises with decreasing black hole mass and Eddington ratio. This finding imposes stringent constraints on empirical models of Active Galactic Nuclei variability derived from local samples, emphasizing the significance of high-redshift population studies for comprehending the stochastic flux variations in active black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We study variability through simultaneous optical and X-ray observations for the first time in a statistical sample of 256 M dwarfs. Such observations are required to constrain the flare frequency and energetics and to understand the physics of flares. Using light curves from extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we identify 256 M dwarfs with simultaneous detections. The 25 brightest or most variable in X-rays are selected. Stellar parameters are obtained from Gaia and 2MASS, while X-ray fluxes are derived from eROSITA count rates. Proximity (<100 pc), fast rotation (P_rot < 9 d), and high flare frequency characterize our sample. Optical and X-ray duty cycles correlate positively, with faster rotators exhibiting more variability. Stars with frequent X-ray flares often coincide with optical flares. Analyzing individual X-ray flares is hindered by eROSITA's low cadence, mitigated by leveraging TESS optical flares and solar flare knowledge. An exponential fit to 21 X-ray light curves post-optical flares reveals a correlation between X-ray and optical flare energies. Despite uncertainties due to poor eROSITA sampling, our study underscores the significance of simultaneous all-sky surveys in diverse wavelengths for unprecedented insights into stellar variability.
#### A new understanding of the Gemini-Monoceros X-ray enhancement from  discoveries with eROSITA

 - **Abstract**
 The Gemini-Monoceros X-ray enhancement is a rich field for studying diffuse X-ray emission and supernova remnants (SNRs). With the launch of eROSITA onboard the SRG platform in 2019, we are now able to fully study these sources. Many of the SNRs in the vicinity are suspected to be very old remnants, which are severely understudied in X-rays due to numerous observational challenges. In addition, identification of new faint large SNRs might help to solve the long-standing discrepancy of observed and expected number of Galactic SNRs. We performed a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the entire diffuse structure and a detailed background analysis of the vicinity. We also made use of multi-wavelength data to better understand the morphology and to constrain the distances to the different sources. We estimated the plasma properties of the sources and calculated a grid of model SNRs to determine the individual SNR properties. Most of the diffuse plasma of the Monogem Ring SNR is well described by a single non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) component with an average temperature of $kT = 0.14\pm 0.03$ keV. We obtain an age of $\approx 1.2\cdot 10^5$ yr - consistent with PSR B0656+14 - for the Monogem Ring. In the south-east, we found evidence for a hotter second plasma component and a possible new SNR candidate at $\approx 300$ pc, with the new candidate having an age of $\approx 50,000$ yr. We were also able to improve on previous studies on the more distant Monoceros Loop and PKS 0646+06 SNRs. We obtained significantly higher temperatures than previous studies, and for PKS 0646+06 a much lower estimated age of the SNR. We also found a new SNR candidate G190.4+12.5 which most likely is located at $D > 1.5 $ kpc, expanding into a low density medium at a high distance from the Galactic plane, with an estimated age of $40,000-60,000$ yr.

 - **Abstract**
 A dozen of patches of polarized radio emission spanning tens of degrees in the form of coherent and stationary loops are observed at radio frequencies across the sky. Their origin is usually associated to nearby shocks, possibly arising from close supernovae explosions. The origin of the radio Loop XII remains so far unknown. We report an anti-correlation of the radio polarized emission of loop XII with a large patch of soft X-ray emission found with SRG/eROSITA in excess of the background surface brightness, in the same region. The soft X-ray seemingly coherent patch in excess of the background emission, which we dub as the Goat Horn complex, extends over a remarkable area of $\sim 1000$ deg$^2$ and includes an arc-shaped enhancement potentially tracing a cold front. An anti-correlation of the X-ray intensity with the temperature of the plasma responsible for the X-ray emission is also observed. The X-ray bright arc seems to anticipate the radio loop XII by some degrees on the sky. This behavior can be recast in terms of a correlation between X-ray surface brightness and radio depolarization. We explore and discuss different possible scenarios for the source of the diffuse emission in the Goat Horn complex: a large supernova remnant; an outflow from active star formation regions in nearby Galactic spiral arms; a hot atmosphere around the Large Magellanic Cloud. In order to probe these scenarios further, a more detailed characterization on the velocity of the hot gas is required.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. During four all-sky surveys (eRASS1--4), eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument aboard Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) detected a new supersoft X-ray source, eRASSU J060839.5-704014, in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods. We arranged follow-up observations in the X-ray and optical wavelengths and further searched in archival observations to reveal the nature of the object. Results. We discover pulsations at ~374 s with a pulse profile consistent with 100% modulation. We identify two other periodicities in the eROSITA data, which we establish as aliases due to the sampling of the eROSITA light curve. We identify a multi-wavelength counterpart to the X-ray source in UVW1 and g, r, i, and z images obtained by the optical/UV monitor on XMM-Newton and the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The timing and spectral characteristics of the source are consistent with a double degenerate ultra-compact binary system in the foreground of the LMC. eRASSU J060839.5-704014 belongs to a rare class of AM CVns, which are important to study in the context of progenitors of SN Ia and for persistent gravitational wave detection. Conclusions. We identify eRASSU J060839.5-704014 as a new double degenerate ultra-compact binary located in the foreground of the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting a supernova remnant (SNR) along the Galactic plane can be quite challenging. Any new detection reduces the discrepancy between the expected and known number of remnants. In this paper, we present results from a large selection of radio and X-ray data that cover the position of G321.3-3.9. We identified G321.3-3.9 as a new SNR using data collected by several radio surveys spanning a frequency range from 200 MHz to 2300 MHz. Stacked eROSITA data from four consecutive all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) provide spectro-imaging information in the energy band 0.2-8.0 keV. G321.3-3.9 has an elliptical shape with major and minor axes of about 1.7 deg x 1.1 deg. From CHIPASS and S-PASS data, we calculate a spectral index -0.8 +- 0.4, consistent with synchrotron emission from an expanding shell in the Sedov Taylor phase. The eROSITA data show an X-ray diffuse structure filling almost the entire radio shell. Depending on the tested spectral model, a plasma temperature between 0.2 keV (VAPEC) and 0.7 keV (NEI) can be fit. The X-ray spectral analysis allowed us to estimate the column absorption towards G321.3-3.9, which suggests a remnant distance of about 1 kpc by comparison with optical extinction maps.
#### Searching for X-ray counterparts of unassociated Fermi-LAT sources and  rotation-powered pulsars with SRG/eROSITA

 - **Abstract**
 The latest source catalog of the Fermi-LAT telescope contains more than 7000 $\gamma$-ray sources at GeV energies, with the two dominant source classes thought to be blazars and rotation-powered pulsars. Our target is the identification of possible (young and recycled) pulsar candidates in the sample of 2600 unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources, via their characteristic X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission. To achieve this, we cross-match the Fermi-LAT catalog with the catalog of X-ray sources in the western Galactic hemisphere from the first four all-sky surveys of SRG/eROSITA. We complement this by identifying X-ray counterparts of known pulsars detected at $\gamma$-ray and radio energies in the eROSITA data. We use a Bayesian cross-matching scheme to construct a probabilistic catalog of possible pulsar-type X-ray counterparts to Fermi-LAT sources. Our method combines the overlap of X-ray and $\gamma$-ray source positions with a probabilistic classification (into pulsar and blazar candidates) of each source based on its $\gamma$-ray properties and a prediction on the X-ray flux of pulsar- or blazar-type counterparts. We provide a catalog of our prior $\gamma$-ray-based classifications of all 2600 unassociated sources in the Fermi-LAT catalog, with around equal numbers of pulsar and blazar candidates. Our final list of candidate X-ray pulsar counterparts, cleaned for spurious detections and sources with obvious non-pulsar counterparts, contains around 900 X-ray sources. We predict between 30 and 40 new pulsars among our top 200 candidates, with around equal expected numbers of young and recycled pulsars. This candidate list may serve as input to future follow-up campaigns, looking directly for pulsations or for the orbital modulation of possible binary companions. We furthermore detect the X-ray counterparts of 15 known rotation-powered pulsars, which were not seen in X-rays before.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cataclysmic variables with degenerate donors which have evolved past the period minimum, also known as period-bouncers, are predicted to make up a great portion of the cataclysmic variable population, between 40 and 70 percent. However, either due to shortcomings in the models or due to the intrinsic faintness of these strongly evolved systems, only a few have been confidently identified so far. Aims. We have compiled a multi-wavelength catalog of period-bouncers and cataclysmic variables around the period minimum from the literature in order to provide an in-depth characterization of the elusive subclass of period-bounce CVs that will help in the identification of new candidates. Methods. In this study we combine published or archival multi-wavelength data with new X-ray observations from the all-sky surveys carried out with the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) onboard the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). Our catalog comprises 192 cataclysmic variables around the period minimum that were chosen as likely period bounce candidates based on reported short orbital periods and low donor mass. This sample helped us establish specific selection parameters that have been used to compile a scorecard which rates a systems likelihood of being a period-bouncer. Results. Our scorecard correctly assigns high scores to the already confirmed period-bouncers in our literature catalog and it identifies 80 additional strong period-bounce candidates present in the literature that have not been classified as such. We established two selection cuts based on the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and the typical X-ray luminosity observed from the 8 already confirmed period-bouncers with eROSITA data. These X-ray selection cuts led to the categorization of 5 systems as new period-bouncers, increasing their population number to 22 systems.

We aim to fully characterize a unique triple system, LTT 1445, with three known rocky exoplanets around LTT 1445A. The X-ray irradiation and flaring of this system are studied through a new 50 ks Chandra observation, which is divided into 10 ks, 10 ks, and 30 ks segments conducted two days apart, and two months apart, respectively. This is complemented by an archival Chandra observation approximately one year earlier and repeated observations with eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, enabling the investigation of X-ray flux behavior across multiple time scales. The flux data acquired from these observations serve as a basis for estimating the photo-evaporation mass loss of the individual exoplanets with their host stars. To gain deeper insights into the environmental context influenced by XUV flux and to better understand the anticipated atmospheric conditions of the planets orbiting the A component, we integrate the use of the planet modeling package, VPLanet. Our findings indicate that LTT 1445C is the primary contributor to X-ray emissions, with additional input from LTT 1445B. Moreover, our study confirms that LTT1445A, recognized as a slowly-rotating star, exhibits no significant flare activity in the observed dataset. The observed results also suggest that the X-ray emissions from the LTT 1445BC components do not pose a greater threat to the planets orbiting LTT 1445A than the emissions from A itself. According to simulation results, LTT 1445Ad might have the capacity to retain its water surface.

 The soft X-ray instrument eROSITA on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory has successfully completed four of the eight planned all-sky surveys, detecting almost one million X-ray sources during the first survey (eRASS1). The catalog of this survey will be released as part of the first eROSITA data release (DR1). Based on X-ray aperture photometry, we provide flux upper limits for eRASS1 in several energy bands. We cover galactic longitudes between $180^{\circ}\lesssim l \lesssim 360^{\circ}$ (eROSITA-DE). These data are crucial for studying the X-ray properties of variable and transient objects, as well as non-detected sources in the eROSITA all-sky survey data. We performed aperture photometry on every pixel of the SRG/eROSITA standard pipeline data products for all available sky tiles in the single detection band ($0.2 - 2.3$ keV). Simultaneously, we performed the same analysis in the three-band detection at soft ($0.2-0.6$ keV), medium ($0.6-2.3$ keV), and hard ($2.3-5.0$ keV) energy bands. Based on the combination of products for the individual bands, we are also able to provide aperture photometry products and flux upper limits for the $0.2 - 5.0$ keV energy band. The upper limits were calculated based on a Bayesian approach that utilizes detected counts and background within the circular aperture. The final data products consist of tables with the aperture photometry products (detected counts, background counts, and exposure time), a close-neighbor flag, and the upper flux limit based on an absorbed power-law spectral model ($\Gamma=2.0, \; N_{\rm H}=3\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$). The upper limits are calculated using the one-sided $3\sigma$ confidence interval (CL) of a normal distribution, representing CL = 99.87\%. The aperture photometry products allow for an easy computation of upper limits at any other confidence interval and spectral model. ...

 [abridged] Hot plasma plays a crucial role in regulating the baryon cycle within the Milky Way, flowing from the energetic sources in the Galactic center and disc, to the corona and the halo Taking advantage of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA first all-sky survey, in this work we aim to provide a panoramic view of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. The energy resolution of eROSITA enables us to map, for the first time, the sky within the narrow energy bands characteristic of soft X-ray emission lines. We present the eROSITA eRASS1 half sky maps in narrow energy bands corresponding to the most prominent soft X-ray lines: O VII and O VIII, which allow us to constrain the distribution of the hot plasma within and surrounding the Milky Way. We removed the expected contribution associated with the cosmic X-ray background, the time-variable solar wind charge exchange, the local hot bubble and foreground absorption. We use the line ratio of the oxygen lines as a proxy to constrain the temperature of the warm-hot CGM and we define a pseudo-temperature $\mathcal{T}$ map. The map highlights how different regions are dominated by different thermal components. Towards the outer halo, the temperature distribution of the CGM is consistent with being constant ($\Delta \mathcal{T} / \langle \mathcal{T}\rangle) \leq 4\%$) on angular scales of 2-20 deg, while significant variations $\sim 12\%$ are observed on many tens of degrees scales, when comparing the northern and southern hemisphere. The pseudo-temperature map shows significant variations across the borders of the eROSITA bubbles, therefore suggesting temperature variations, possibly linked to shocks, between the interior of the Galactic outflow and the unperturbed CGM. In particular, a "shell" of colder material appears to be present close to the edge of the eROSITA bubbles.
#### X-ray counterpart detection and gamma-ray analysis of the SNR  G279.0+01.1 with eROSITA and Fermi-LAT

 - **Abstract**
 A thorough inspection of known Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs) along the Galactic plane with SRG/eROSITA yielded the detection of the X-ray counterpart of the SNR G279.0+01.1. The SNR is located just 1.5 deg above the Galactic plane. Its X-ray emission emerges as an incomplete, partial shell of $\sim$3 deg angular extension. It is strongly correlated to the fragmented shell-type morphology of its radio continuum emission. The X-ray spatial morphology of the SNR seems to be linked to the presence of dust clouds in the surroundings. The majority of its X-ray emission is soft (exhibiting strong O, Ne and Mg lines), and occurs in a narrow range of energies between 0.3 and 1.5 keV. Above 2.0 keV the remnant remains undetected. The remnant's X-ray spectrum is of purely thermal nature. Constraining the X-ray absorption column to values which are consistent with optical extinction data from the remnant's location favours non-equilibrium over equilibrium models. A non-equilibrium two-temperature plasma model of $\mathrm{kT}\sim0.3$~keV and $\mathrm{kT}\sim0.6$~keV, and an absorption column density of $\mathrm{N_{H}}\sim0.3~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ describes the spectrum of the entire remnant well. Significant temperature variations across the remnant have been detected. Employing 14.5 years of Fermi-LAT data, we carried out a comprehensive study of the extended GeV source 4FGL J1000.0-5312e. By refining and properly modeling the GeV excess originating from the location of the remnant, we conclude that the emission is likely related to the remnant itself rather than being co-located by chance. We also discuss implications of the new X-ray data to the estimates of the distance and age of the remnant.
