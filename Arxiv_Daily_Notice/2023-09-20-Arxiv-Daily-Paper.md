#### The Progenitor Star of SN 2023ixf: A Massive Red Supergiant with  Enhanced, Episodic Pre-Supernova Mass Loss

 - **Abstract**
 We identify the progenitor star of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy Messier 101 using Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging and pre-explosion HST/ACS images. The supernova position, localized with diffraction-spike pattern and high precision relative astrometry, unambiguously coincides with a single progenitor candidate of m_F814W=24.96(-0.04)(+0.05). Forced photometry further recovers 2-sigma detections in the F673N and F675W bands and imposes robust flux limits on the bluer bands. Given the reported infrared excess and semi-regular variability of the progenitor, we fit a time-dependent spectral energy distribution (SED) model of a dusty red supergiant (RSG) to a combined dataset of HST photometry, as well as ground-based near-infrared and Spitzer/IRAC [3.6], [4.5] photometry from the literature. The progenitor closely resembles a RSG of T_eff=3343+/-27 K and logL=5.10+/-0.02, with a 0.11+/-0.01 dex (25.2+/-1.7 per cent) variation over the mean luminosity at a period of P=1128.3+/-6.5 days, heavily obscured by a dust envelope with an optical depth of tau=2.83+/-0.03 at 1 micron (or A_V=10.28+/-0.11 mag). Such observed signatures match a post-main sequence star of 18.1(-1.2)(+0.7) Msun, close to the most massive SN II progenitor, with a pulsation-enhanced mass-loss rate of M_dot=(3.58+/-0.15) x 10^(-4) Msun/yr. The dense and confined circumstellar material is likely ejected during the last episode of radial pulsation before the explosion. Notably, we find strong evidence for periodic variation of tau (or both T_eff and tau) along with luminosity, a necessary assumption to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the variability, which implies dust sublimation and condensation during radial pulsations. Given the observed SED, partial dust obscuration remains a possible scenario, but any unobstructed binary companion over 7.1 Msun can be ruled out.
#### Cosmological parameters derived from the final (PR4) Planck data release

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on cosmological parameters using maps from the last Planck data release (PR4). In particular, we detail an upgraded version of the cosmic microwave background likelihood, HiLLiPoP, based on angular power spectra and relying on a physical modelling of the foreground residuals in the spectral domain. This new version of the likelihood retains a larger sky fraction (up to 75%) and uses an extended multipole range. Using this likelihood, along with low-l measurements from LoLLiPoP, we derive constraints on $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are in good agreement with previous Planck 2018 results, but with 10% to 20% smaller uncertainties. We demonstrate that the foregrounds can be accurately described in spectra domain with only negligible impact on $\Lambda$CDM parameters. We also derive constraints on single-parameter extensions to $\Lambda$CDM including $A_L$, $\Omega_K$, $N_{eff}$, and $\sum m_{\nu}$. Noteworthy results from this updated analysis include a lensing amplitude value of $A_L = 1.036 \pm 0.051$, which aligns more closely with theoretical expectations within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Additionally, our curvature measurement, $\Omega_K = -0.012 \pm 0.010$, now demonstrates complete consistency with a flat universe, and our measurement of $S_8$ is closer to the measurements derived from large-scale structure surveys (at the 1.6$\sigma$ level).

 - **Abstract**
 The disruption of a star by the tidal forces of a spinning black hole causes the stellar stream to precess, which affects the conditions for triggering the tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we study the effect of the precession of the tidal stream on TDE light curves, as a result of the interaction of the wind and luminosity of the event with the stellar stream wrapped around the black hole. We perform two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations using the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code JET with its recently developed radiation treatment module. The model considers an isotropic wind and irradiation following the analytical fallback rate of a stellar polytrope, and their interaction with the remnant of the precessed stream. We study the effect of the black hole mass, the accretion efficiency, and the inclination between the orbital and spin planes on the observed light curves along different lines of sight. From our results, we were able to identify two extreme behaviours depending on the properties of the event: i) models with low-mass black holes ($\sim10^6~M_{\odot}$), low inclination ($\sim0$), and low accretion efficiency ($\sim0.01$) show light curves with a short early peak caused by the interaction of the wind with the inner edge of the stream. The line of sight has little effect on the light curves, since the stream covers only a small fraction of the solid angle, due to the precession occurring in the orbital plane; ii) models with high-mass black holes ($>10^7~M_{\odot}$), high inclination ($\sim90^{\circ}$), and high accretion efficiency ($\sim0.1$) produce light curves with luminosity peaks that can be delayed by up to 50-100~d as the stream blocks the radiation in the early phase of the event. Our results show that black hole spin and misalignment do not imprint a recognisable feature on the light curves but rather can add complications to their analysis.
#### NICER observations of thermonuclear bursts from 4U 1728-34: Detection of  oscillations prior to the onset of two bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present temporal and time-resolved spectral analyses of all the thermonuclear X-ray bursts observed from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 1728-34 with NICER from June 2017 to September 2019. In total, we detected 11 X-ray bursts from the source and performed time-resolved spectroscopy. Unlike some of the earlier results for other bursting sources from NICER, our spectral results indicate that the use of a scaling factor for the persistent emission is not statistically necessary. This is primarily a result of the strong interstellar absorption in the line of sight towards 4U 1728-34, which causes the count rates to be significantly lower at low energies. We also searched for burst oscillations and detected modulations in six different bursts at around the previously known burst oscillation frequency of 363 Hz. Finally, we report the detection of oscillations prior to two bursts at 356 and 359 Hz, respectively. This is the first time in the literature where burst oscillations are detected before the rapid rise in X-ray flux, from any known burster. These oscillations disappear as soon as the burst rise starts and occur at a somewhat lower frequency than the oscillations we detect during the bursts.
#### Strong Carbon Features and a Red Early Color in the Underluminous Type  Ia SN 2022xkq

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical, infrared, ultraviolet, and radio observations of SN 2022xkq, an underluminous fast-declining type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 1784 ($\mathrm{D}\approx31$ Mpc), from $<1$ to 180 days after explosion. The high-cadence observations of SN 2022xkq, a photometrically transitional and spectroscopically 91bg-like SN Ia, cover the first days and weeks following explosion which are critical to distinguishing between explosion scenarios. The early light curve of SN 2022xkq has a red early color and exhibits a flux excess which is more prominent in redder bands; this is the first time such a feature has been seen in a transitional/91bg-like SN Ia. We also present 92 optical and 19 near-infrared (NIR) spectra, beginning 0.4 days after explosion in the optical and 2.6 days after explosion in the NIR. SN 2022xkq exhibits a long-lived C I 1.0693 $\mu$m feature which persists until 5 days post-maximum. We also detect C II $\lambda$6580 in the pre-maximum optical spectra. These lines are evidence for unburnt carbon that is difficult to reconcile with the double detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. No existing explosion model can fully explain the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of SN 2022xkq, but the considerable breadth of the observations is ideal for furthering our understanding of the processes which produce faint SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization is a unique tool to study the properties of dust grains of protoplanetary disks and detail the initial conditions of planet formation. Polarization around HL Tau was previously imaged using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Bands 3 (3.1 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), and 7 (0.87 mm), showing that the polarization orientation changes across wavelength $\lambda$. The polarization morphology at Band 7 is predominantly parallel to the disk minor axis but appears azimuthally oriented at Band 3, with the morphology at Band 6 in between the two. We present new ~0.2" (29 au) polarization observations at Q-Band (7.0 mm) using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and at Bands 4 (2.1 mm), 5 (1.5 mm), and 7 using ALMA, consolidating HL Tau's position as the protoplanetary disk with the most complete wavelength coverage in dust polarization. The polarization patterns at Bands 4 and 5 continue to follow the morphological transition with wavelength previously identified in Bands 3, 6, and 7. Based on the azimuthal variation, we decompose the polarization into contributions from scattering ($s$) and thermal emission ($t$). We find that $s$ decreases slowly with increasing $\lambda$, and $t$ increases more rapidly with $\lambda$ which are expected from optical depth effects of toroidally aligned, scattering prolate grains. The relatively weak $\lambda$ dependence of $s$ is consistent with large, porous grains. The sparse polarization detections from the Q-band image are also consistent with toroidally aligned prolate grains.
#### Tracing the Galactic Disk with Planetary Nebulae using Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 We study the population of Galactic planetary Nebulae (PNe) and their central stars (CSs) through the analysis of their heliocentric distances and Galactic distribution. Distances are obtained by means of a revised statistical scale, based on an astrometrically-defined sample of CSs parallaxes from Gaia DR3 as calibrators. The statistical scale is applied to infer distances of a significant number (~850) of Galactic PNe, for which we deliver a new catalog of PN distances. By adopting a circular velocity curve of the Galaxy, we also derive 3D peculiar velocities from DR3 proper motions and published radial velocities of a large sample (~300) of PN CSs. We date PN progenitors based both on the best chemical abundances culled from the literature and on CS kinematic properties, finding a confirmation of the first method with the second. The slope of the radial oxygen gradient of the Galactic Disk traced by the complete PNe sample amounts to -0.0144 +/- 0.00385 [dex/kpc]. Furthermore, by distinguishing between PNe with old (> 7.5 Gyr) and young (< 1 Gyr) progenitors, we estimate the gradient to be respectively -0.0121 +/- 0.00465 and -0.022 +/- 0.00758 [dex/kpc], thus disclosing a mild steepening since Galaxy formation, with a slope change of 0.01 dex. These results are in broad agreement with previous PN studies, but now based on DR3 Gaia analysis, and also in agreement with what traced by most other Galactic probes.

 - **Abstract**
 The 450th anniversary of the discovery of the SN 1572 supernova event was celebrated in 2022. A closer look at the historical development of the field of supernova astronomy reveals the scientific importance of Tycho Brahe's 1572 observations of this "new star". In their quest to learn more about the new type of stellar explosion and subsequent evolution, the initial protagonists in this field (Baader and Zwicky among others) gradually turned their attention to the final remnant state of these supernova events. Since the remnant object thought to be associated with the extragalactic supernova event was found to be very dim, the focus quickly shifted toward nearby galactic events. It is at this point where Tycho Brahe's observations played an important and often overlooked role in the context of the development of stellar evolution as a scientific field. Tycho Brahe's meticulous and detailed recordings of the change in brightness of the new star not only allowed modern astronomers to classify SN 1572 as a supernova event but also helped them pinpoint the exact astrometric location of SN 1572. These findings helped to empirically link extragalactic supernova events to nearby past supernova remnants in the Milky Way. This enabled subsequent observations allowing further characterization. Transforming the historical recordings to a standardized photometric system also allowed the classification of SN 1572 as a type I supernova event.
#### Don't miss the forest for the trees: the Lyman alpha forest power  spectrum in effective field theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10133
 - **Abstract**
 We derive an effective field theory (EFT) for cosmological Lyman alpha forest fluctuations valid for the power spectrum at the one-loop order. The ``bottom-up'' EFT expansion at the level of the transmitted flux is identical to the line-of-sight dependent bias model first derived by Desjacques et al. We confirm this result by a ``top-down'' derivation based on the exponential map of the optical depth field. Specifically, we show that the combination of the exponential map and conditions of renormalizability generates the same EFT expansion as the ``bottom-up'' approach. In passing, we point out inconsistencies of the tree-level perturbative expansion of the exponential map without counterterms. To facilitate practical applications, we generalize the FFTLog method for efficient calculations of one-loop integrals from new line-of-sight dependent operators. Finally, we compare the one-loop EFT model against data from the Sherwood hydrodynamic simulation. The theory fits the data with sub percent accuracy up to $k= $ 3 $h$Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z= 2.8$ for both 3D and 1D correlations. Our model can be readily used for cosmological full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha forest data.
#### HdC and EHe stars through the prism of Gaia DR3: Evolution of RV  amplitude and dust formation rate with effective temperature

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia DR3 release includes heliocentric radial velocity measurements and velocity variability indices for tens of millions of stars observed over 34 months. In this study, we utilise these indices to investigate the intrinsic radial velocity variations of Hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) stars and Extreme Helium (EHe) stars across their large ranges of temperature and brightness. Taking advantage of the newly defined HdC temperature classes, we examine the evolution of the total velocity amplitude with effective temperature. Additionally, we analyse the variation in dust production rate in R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars with temperature, using two different proxies for RCB stars' photometric state: one from Gaia and another from the 2MASS survey. Furthermore, we provide a list of heliocentric radial velocities and associated errors for targets not observed by Gaia DR3. Some of these velocities were obtained from our 2.3m/WiFeS survey, while others were retrieved from the literature. Our observations reveal an interesting trend in the evolution of the maximum radial velocity amplitude across each HdC temperature class, indicating possibly that the helium shell-burning giant stage starts with strong atmospheric motions that decrease in strength, up to $\sim$6000 K, before picking up again as the HdC star atmosphere shrink further in size and reach warmer temperature. We also observe a correlation between stellar temperature and the dust production rate. The dust formation rate appears to be much higher in colder RCB stars compared to warmer ones.
#### HdC and EHe stars through the prism of Gaia DR3: 3D distribution and  Gaia's chromatic PSF effects

 - **Abstract**
 Upon its release the Gaia DR3 catalogue has led to tremendous progress in multiple fields of astronomy by providing the complete astrometric solution for nearly 1.5 billion sources. We analysed the photometric and astrometric results for Hydrogen-deficient (HdC), Extreme Helium (EHe), and DYPer type stars to identify any potential biases. This analysis aimed to select stars suitable for kinematic and spatial distribution studies. We investigated the information obtained from the Gaia IPD process, which was cross-matched with Gaia light curves. One main objective was to understand the impact of photometric declines in R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars on Gaia astrometry. Based on the evidence gathered, we have reached the conclusion that the astrometric fits for numerous RCB stars are not valid due to the Gaia PSF chromaticity effect in both shape and centroid. The astrometric results of all stars with significant time-dependent colour variation should be similarly affected. RCB stars might thus be promising sources to correct this effect in future Gaia releases. Furthermore, after validating the Gaia astrometric results for 92 stars, we observed that the majority of HdC and EHe stars are distributed across the three old stellar structures, the thick disk, the bulge and the halo. However, we have also uncovered evidence indicating that some HdC and EHe stars exhibit orbits characteristic of the thin disk. This is also particularly true for all DYPer type stars under study. Finally, we have provided a list of star memberships for each Galactic substructure. We are beginning to observe a relationship between kinematics, stellar population, and metallicity in RCB and EHe stars. That relation can be explained, within the double degenerate scenario, by the large range in the delay time distribution expected from population synthesis simulations, particularly through the HybCO merger channel.
#### Automatic detection of plateau phases in light curves of variable stars

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astronomical surveys produce millions of light curves of variable sources. These massive data sets challenge the community to create automatic light-curve processing methods for detection, classification, and characterisation of variable stars. In this paper, we present a novel method for extracting the variable components of a light curve based on Otsu's thresholding method. To validate the effectiveness of this method, we apply it to the light curves of detached eclipsing binaries and dwarf novae, sourced from OGLE catalogues.
#### Atmospheric Retrieval of L Dwarfs: Benchmarking Results and  Characterizing the Young Planetary Mass Companion HD 106906 b in the  Near-Infrared

 - **Abstract**
 We present model constraints on the atmospheric structure of HD 106906 b, a planetary-mass companion orbiting at a ~700 AU projected separation around a 15 Myr-old stellar binary, using the APOLLO retrieval code on spectral data spanning 1.1-2.5 $\mu$m. C/O ratios can provide evidence for companion formation pathways, as such pathways are ambiguous both at wide separations and at star-to-companion mass ratios in the overlap between the distributions of planets and brown dwarfs. We benchmark our code against an existing retrieval of the field L dwarf 2M2224-0158, returning a C/O ratio consistent with previous fits to the same JHKs data, but disagreeing in the thermal structure, cloud properties, and atmospheric scale height. For HD 106906 b, we retrieve C/O $=0.53^{+0.15}_{-0.25}$, consistent with the C/O ratios expected for HD 106906's stellar association and therefore consistent with a stellar-like formation for the companion. We find abundances of H$_2$O and CO near chemical equilibrium values for a solar metallicity, but a surface gravity lower than expected, as well as a thermal profile with sharp transitions in the temperature gradient. Despite high signal-to-noise and spectral resolution, more accurate constraints necessitate data across a broader wavelength range. This work serves as preparation for subsequent retrievals in the era of JWST, as JWST's spectral range provides a promising opportunity to resolve difficulties in fitting low-gravity L dwarfs, and also underscores the need for simultaneous comparative retrievals on L dwarf companions with multiple retrieval codes.
#### Star Clusters in Tidal Debris

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UBVI-band study of star clusters in tidal tails, using new WFC3 and ACS imaging to complement existing WFPC2 data. We survey 12 tidal tails across seven merging systems, deriving ages and masses for 425 star cluster candidates (SCCs). The stacked mass distribution across all systems follows a power law of the form $dN/dM \propto M^{\beta}$, with $\beta = -2.02 \pm 0.15$, consistent with what is seen in other star forming environments. GALEX and Swift UV imaging provide star formation rates (SFRs) for our tidal tails, which when compared with ages and masses of our SCCs, allows for a determination of the cluster formation efficiency (CFE). We find the CFE increases with increasing SFR surface density, matching the theoretical model. We confirm this fit down at SFR densities lower than previously measured (log $\Sigma_\text{SFR} \: (\text{M}_\odot \: \text{yr}^{-1} \: \text{kpc}^{-2}) \approx -4.2$), as related to the CFE. We determine the half-light radii for a refined sample of 57 SCCs with our HST WFC3 and ACS imaging, and calculate their dynamical age, finding the majority of them to be gravitationally bound. We also provide evidence of only low-mass ($< 10^4 \: \text{M}_\odot$) cluster formation in our nearest galaxy, NGC 1487, consistent with the theory that this system is a dwarf merger.
#### Hybrid SBI or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learn the Likelihood

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new framework for the analysis of current and future cosmological surveys, which combines perturbative methods (PT) on large scales with conditional simulation-based implicit inference (SBI) on small scales. This enables modeling of a wide range of statistics across all scales using only small-volume simulations, drastically reducing computational costs, and avoids the assumption of an explicit small-scale likelihood. As a proof-of-principle for this hybrid simulation-based inference (HySBI) approach, we apply it to dark matter density fields and constrain cosmological parameters using both the power spectrum and wavelet coefficients, finding promising results that significantly outperform classical PT methods. We additionally lay out a roadmap for the next steps necessary to implement HySBI on actual survey data, including consideration of bias, systematics, and customized simulations. Our approach provides a realistic way to scale SBI to future survey volumes, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes a repository for ontologies of astronomy, astronautics, and other space-related topics. It may be called AstroPortal (or SpacePortal), AstroHub (or SpaceHub), etc. The creation of this repository will be applicable to academic, research and other data-intensive sectors. It is relevant for space sciences (including astronomy), Earth science, and astronautics (spaceflight), among other data-intensive disciplines. The repository should provide a centralized platform to search, review and create ontologies for astro-related topics. It thereby can decrease research time, while also providing a user-friendly means to study and compare knowledge organization systems or semantic resources of the target domains. With no apparent repository available on the target domain, this paper also expresses a novel concept.
#### Constraining Thermal Emission of Pluto's Haze From Infrared Rotational  Lightcurves

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational lightcurves of the Pluto-Charon system were previously believed to be solely attributed to their surfaces. However, a proposed scenario of haze cooling \citep{2017Natur.551..352Z} suggests that the atmospheric haze of Pluto could significantly contribute to mid-infrared emission, which calls for a revisit of previous analyses. In this study, we employ a Bayesian retrieval approach to constrain the haze emission from the rotational lightcurves of the Pluto-Charon system. The lightcurves were observed by the Spitzer and Herschel telescopes at 24 and 70 $\mu$m, and were combined with the latest surface albedo maps of Pluto and Charon from the New Horizons spacecraft. Our results show that including the haze emission is consistent with all current observations, with the best-fit haze flux around 1.63 mJy. This is in agreement with the composition of Titan-like tholins. However, the ``surface only" scenario, which excludes the haze contribution, can still explain the observations. We conclude that the current data at 24 $\mu$m cannot constrain Pluto's haze emission due to the degeneracy with Charon's surface emission. Regardless, some surface properties of Pluto are well constrained by the shape of the lightcurves, with a thermal inertia of approximately 8--10 MKS and a relatively low CH$_4$ emissivity of 0.3--0.5. We suggest that observations by the JWST telescope at 18 $\mu$m, which can resolve Pluto from Charon, could directly probe the haze emission of Pluto due to the low surface emission at that wavelength.

 - **Abstract**
 Using Gaia DR3 data and the wavelet transformation technique, we study the substructures of the Hercules moving group (HMG): Hercules 1 (H1) and Hercules 2 (H2). Spectroscopic survey data from LAMOST, APOGEE, and GALAH are used to obtain metallicities and ages of stars belonging to the HMG. Our analysis leads to several key findings as follows: ($a$) the HMG is on average richer in metallicity than the Galactic disk, with H2 being metal richer than H1; ($b$) the HMG likely has a radial metallicity gradient distinct from that of the disk; ($c$) the HMG is on average older than the disk, with H2 being older than H1; ($d$) the HMG likely has a radial age gradient distinct from that of the disk; and ($e$) the metallicity and age distributions of the HMG depend mainly on the Galactic radius but show no dependence on the azimuthal velocity. Taken all together, we conclude that the HMG is composed primarily of stars undergoing radial migration. We suggest that the HMG is associated with a higher-order dynamical resonance of the bar of the Galaxy.

 Many theories of BSM physics predict the existence of large or infinite towers of decaying states. In a previous paper (arXiv:2111.04753) we pointed out that this can give rise to a surprising cosmological phenomenon that we dubbed "stasis" during which the relative abundances of matter and radiation remain constant across extended cosmological eras even though the universe is expanding. Indeed, such stasis epochs are universal attractors, with the universe necessarily entering (and later exiting) such epochs for a wide variety of initial conditions. Matter/radiation stasis is therefore an important and potentially unavoidable feature of many BSM cosmologies. In this paper we extend our arguments to universes containing significant amounts of vacuum energy, and demonstrate that such universes also give rise to various forms of stasis between vacuum energy and either matter or radiation. We also demonstrate the existence of several forms of "triple stasis" during which the abundances of matter, radiation, and vacuum energy all simultaneously remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. We further describe several close variants of stasis which we call "quasi-stasis" and "oscillatory stasis" and discuss the circumstances under which each of these can arise. Finally, we develop a general formalism for understanding the emergence of stasis within BSM cosmologies irrespective of the number or type of different energy components involved. Taken together, these results greatly expand the range of theoretical and phenomenological possibilities for the physics of the early universe, introducing new types of cosmological eras which may play an intrinsic and potentially inevitable role within numerous BSM cosmologies.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted a blind search in 49 consecutive days of interplanetary scintillation observations made by the Murchison Widefield Array from mid-2019, with overlapping daily observations approximately East and South-East of the Sun at an elongation of $\sim$30 degrees and a field of view of 30 degrees. These observations detect an unprecedented density of sources. In spite of these observations being taken at sunspot minimum, this search has revealed several interesting transitory features characterised by elevated scintillation levels. One solar wind enhancement is captured in two observations several hours apart, allowing its radial movement away from the Sun to be measured. We present here a methodology for measuring the plane-of-sky velocity for the moving heliospheric structure. The plane-of-sky velocity was inferred as $0.66\pm0.147\,^{\text{o}}\text{hr}^{-1}$, or $480\pm106\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming a distance of 1AU. After cross-referencing our observed structure with multiple catalogues of heliospheric events, we propose that the likely source of our observed structure is a stream-interaction region originating from a low-latitude coronal hole. This work demonstrates the power of widefield interplanetary scintillation observations to capture detailed features in the heliosphere which are otherwise unresolvable and go undetected.

 - **Abstract**
 The CH$_3$O and CH$_2$OH radicals can be important precursors of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar dust. The COMs presumably originating from these radicals were abundantly found in various astronomical objects. Because each radical leads to different types of COMs, determining the abundance ratio of CH$_3$O to CH$_2$OH is crucial for a better understanding of the chemical evolution to various COMs. Recent work suggested that the reaction between CH$_3$OH and OH on ice dust plays an important role in forming CH$_3$O and CH$_2$OH radicals. However, quantitative details on the abundance of these radicals have not been presented to date. Herein, we experimentally determined the branching ratio (CH$_3$O/CH$_2$OH) resulting from the CH$_3$OH + OH reaction on the water ice surface at 10 K to be 4.3 $\pm$ 0.6. Furthermore, the CH$_3$O product in the reaction would participate in subsequent diffusive reactions even at a temperature as low as 10 K. This fact should provide critical information for COMs formation models in cold molecular clouds.

 We present new JVLA and VLBA observations tracing the HI in the central region of 3C84 (Perseus A). This radio source is hosted by the bright cluster galaxy NGC 1275 in the centre of the iconic Perseus cluster. With the JVLA, we detected broad (FWHM~500 km/s) HI absorption at arcsecond resolution (~300 pc) centred at the systemic velocity of NGC 1275 against the bright radio continuum, suggesting that the detected gas is very close to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). However, we did not detect any absorption in the higher-resolution VLBA data against the parsec-scale radio core and jet. Based on a comparison of the properties of the HI absorption with those of the molecular circum-nuclear disc (CND) known to be present in NGC 1275, we argue that the HI seen in absorption arises from HI in this fast-rotating CND, and that neutral atomic hydrogen is present as close as ~20 pc from the SMBH. The radio continuum providing the background for absorption arises from non-thermal synchrotron emission from the star formation activity in the CND, whose presence has been reported by earlier VLBA studies. We did not detect any signature that the HI gas is affected by an interaction with the radio jet. Thus, at this stage of the evolution of the source, the impact of the radio jet on the gas in NGC 1275 mainly creates cavities on much larger galaxy scales. Overall, the properties of the CND in Perseus A present strong similarities with Mrk 231, suggesting that, unlike often assumed, HI absorption can arise against the radio emission from star formation in a CND. With the JVLA, we serendipitously detected a new, faint absorbing system that is redshifted by ~2660 km/s, in addition to the already known high-velocity absorption system that is redshifted 2850 km/s with respect to NGC 1275. We identify this new system as gas that is stripped from a foreground galaxy falling into the Perseus cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We study and compare the warm (>100 K) and cold (<100 K) material toward the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 (IRAS 23385 hereafter) combining high angular resolution observations in the mid-infrared (MIR) with the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) project and with the NOEMA at mm wavelengths at angular resolutions of 0.2"-1". The spatial morphology of atomic and molecular species is investigated by line integrated intensity maps. The temperature and column density of different gas components is estimated using H2 transitions (warm and hot component) and a series of CH3CN transitions as well as 3 mm continuum emission (cold component). Toward the central dense core in IRAS 23385 the material consists of relatively cold gas and dust (~50 K), while multiple outflows create heated and/or shocked H2 and show enhanced temperatures (~400 K) along the outflow structures. An energetic outflow with enhanced emission knots of [Fe II] and [Ni II] hints at J-type shocks, while two other outflows have enhanced emission of only H2 and [S I] caused by C-type shocks. The latter two outflows are also more prominent in molecular line emission at mm wavelengths (e.g., SiO, SO, H2CO, and CH3OH). Even higher angular resolution data are needed to unambiguously identify the outflow driving sources given the clustered nature of IRAS 23385. While most of the forbidden fine structure transitions are blueshifted, [Ne II] and [Ne III] peak at the source velocity toward the MIR source A/mmA2 suggesting that the emission is originating from closer to the protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent improvements in the performance of the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) made them attractive options as photo sensors of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). In fact, they are already adopted in some IACTs such as FACT and the Small-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). However, the application to the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of CTA requires additional studies. As the pixel size of LSTs is larger than the nominal size of SiPMs, the signal from multiple sensors must be summed up. Also, the high detection efficiency of the night sky background (NSB) photons may degrade the telescope performance. To overcome this, the pulse width must be as small as 3 ns and the detection efficiency for NSB photons must be suppressed as much as possible. Heat generation and gain stabilization are also issues. We studied different types of SiPMs from Hamamatsu photonics and characterized them for the LST application, addressing the previous points. Also, to prove the SiPM performance in LST, we are developing a SiPM module which can be installed in the exisiting LST camera. Here we present the results of this evaluation and the status of the test bench module development.
#### Exoplanet imaging with ELTs: exploring a second-stage AO with a Zernike  wavefront sensor on the ESO/GHOST testbed

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to explore a cascade extreme Adaptive optics (ExAO) approach with a second stage based on a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) for exoplanet imaging and spectroscopy. Most exoplanet imagers currently use a single-stage ExAO to correct for the effects of atmospheric turbulence and produce high-Strehl images of observed stars in the near-infrared. While such systems enable the observation of warm gaseous companions around nearby stars, adding a second-stage AO enables to push the wavefront correction further and possibly observe colder or smaller planets. This approach is currently investigated in different exoplanet imagers (VLT/SPHERE, Mag-AOX, Subaru/SCExAO) by considering a Pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) in the second arm to measure the residual atmospheric turbulence left from the first stage. Since these aberrations are expected to be very small (a few tens of nm in the near-infrared domain), we propose to investigate an alternative approach based on the ZWFS. This sensor is a promising concept with a small capture range to estimate residual wavefront errors thanks to its large sensitivity, simple phase reconstruction and easiness of implementation. In this contribution, we perform preliminary tests on the GHOST testbed at ESO to validate this approach experimentally. Additional experiments with petalling effects are also showed, giving promising wavefront correction results. Finally, we briefly discuss a first comparison between PWFS-based and ZWFS-based second-stage AO to draw preliminary conclusions on the interests of both schemes for exoplanet imaging and spectroscopy with the upgrade of the current exoplanet imagers and the envisioned ExAO instruments for ELTs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative study of the effect of low-temperature opacities on stellar models up to the Red Giant branch (RGB), computed with the GARching STellar Evolution Code. We have used two sets of low-temperature opacities; {\AE}SOPUS ({\AE}) from the University of Padova and those from the Wichita State University group (F05). In the relevant range of temperatures for this study, log \k{appa}{\AE} < log \k{appa}F 05. Therefore, to compare stellar evolutionary tracks, we performed a solar calibration of the {\alpha}mlt, for each set of low-temperature opacities. After carrying such a calibration, we find that stellar evolutionary tracks are almost unaffected by the choice of low-temperature opacities, with largest variations of 25-30 K at the latest evolutionary stages of the RGB phase.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we consider the possible presence of a large population of millisecond pulsars in the Galactic Centre. Their direct detection would be challenging due to severe pulse broadening caused by scattering of radiation. We propose a new method to constrain their population with neutrino imaging of the Galactic Centre. Millisecond pulsars are proposed cosmic-ray accelerators. The high-energy protons they produce will collide with the baryonic matter in the central molecular zone to create charged and neutral pions that decay into neutrinos and $\gamma$-rays, respectively. The specific neutrino and $\gamma$-ray fluxes must be below their corresponding observed values, allowing us to put a conservative upper limit on the millisecond pulsar population of N_MSP < 10,000 within a galacto-centric radius of 20 pc. This upper limit is sensitive to the proton acceleration efficiency of the pulsars, but is less dependent on the particle injection spectral index and the choice of mass tracers. The population will be better constrained when high resolution neutrino observations of the Galactic Centre become available. The presence of these millisecond pulsars can account for the $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission in the MeV-GeV range from explosive cosmic events is of invaluable relevance to understanding physical processes related to the formation of neutron stars and black holes. Here we report on the detection by the AGILE satellite in the MeV-GeV energy range of the remarkable long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. The AGILE onboard detectors have good exposure to GRB 221009A during its initial crucial phases. Hard X-ray/MeV emission in the prompt phase lasted hundreds of seconds, with the brightest radiation being emitted between 200 and 300 seconds after the initial trigger. Very intense GeV gamma-ray emission is detected by AGILE in the prompt and early afterglow phase up to 10,000 seconds. Time-resolved spectral analysis shows time-variable MeV-peaked emission simultaneous with intense power-law GeV radiation that persists in the afterglow phase. The coexistence during the prompt phase of very intense MeV emission together with highly non-thermal and hardening GeV radiation is a remarkable feature of GRB 221009A. During the prompt phase, the event shows spectrally different MeV and GeV emissions that are most likely generated by physical mechanisms occurring in different locations. AGILE observations provide crucial flux and spectral gamma-ray information regarding the early phases of GRB 221009A during which emission in the TeV range was reported.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance of primordial black holes changes in the presence of local non-Gaussianity. A positive non-linear parameter $f_{NL}$ increases the abundance while a negative one reduces it. We show that in non-attractor single-field models of inflation which enhance the curvature power spectrum and may give rise to primordial black holes, $f_{NL}$ is always positive, when computed in correspondence of the peak of the curvature power spectrum where the primordial black hole abundance has its maximum. This implies that the interpretation of the recent pulsar timing arrays data from scalar-induced gravitational waves generated at primordial black hole formation may not be supported by invoking non-Gaussianity within non-attractor single-field models.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a particular k-essence scalar field model for the late-time cosmic acceleration in which the sound speed, parametrized as $c_s$ is constant. We compute the relevant background and perturbation quantities corresponding to the observables like cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the $f\sigma_8$. We put constraints on the $c_s^2$ parameter from these observations along with other parameters. We find lower values of $c_s^2$ which are close to zero are tightly constrained. Particularly, we find mean value of $\log_{\rm 10} (c_s^2)$ to be $-0.61$ and $c_s^2 \leq 10^{-3}$ is more than 3$\sigma$ away from this mean value. This means these observations favor a homogeneous dark energy component compared to the clustering one.

 - **Abstract**
 The conventional background solution for the evolution of a single canonical inflaton field performs admirably in extreme scenarios such as the slow-roll phase (where the slow-roll parameter is much less than one) and deep reheating era (where the Hubble parameter is much smaller than the effective mass of the potential and the field oscillates around the minimum of the potential), but fails to accurately depict the dynamics of the Universe near the end of inflation and the initial oscillatory phases. This article proposes a single, unified, model-independent analytical solution for such a model that bridges the gap between these extremes, providing a comprehensive description of the evolution of the Universe. This novel strategy has the potential to substantially enhance both quantitative and qualitative cosmological observational predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of the atmospheres of closely separated, directly imaged gas giant exoplanets is challenging due to the presence of stellar speckles that pollute their spectrum. To remedy this, the analysis of medium- to high-resolution spectroscopic data via cross-correlation with spectral templates (cross-correlation spectroscopy) is emerging as a leading technique. We aim to define a robust Bayesian framework combining, for the first time, three widespread direct-imaging techniques, namely photometry, low-resolution spectroscopy, and medium-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy in order to derive the atmospheric properties of close-in directly imaged exoplanets. Our framework CROCODILE (cross-correlation retrievals of directly imaged self-luminous exoplanets) naturally combines the three techniques by adopting adequate likelihood functions. To validate our routine, we simulated observations of gas giants similar to the well-studied $\beta$~Pictoris~b planet and we explored the parameter space of their atmospheres to search for potential biases. We obtain more accurate measurements of atmospheric properties when combining photometry, low- and medium-resolution spectroscopy into atmospheric retrievals than when using the techniques separately as is usually done in the literature. We find that medium-resolution ($R \approx 4000$) K-band cross-correlation spectroscopy alone is not suitable to constrain the atmospheric properties of our synthetic datasets; however, this problem disappears when simultaneously fitting photometry and low-resolution ($R \approx 60$) spectroscopy between the Y and M bands. Our framework allows the atmospheric characterisation of directly imaged exoplanets using the high-quality spectral data that will be provided by the new generation of instruments such as VLT/ERIS, JWST/MIRI, and ELT/METIS.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore how to classify asteroids in co-orbital motion with a given planet using Machine Learning. We consider four different kinds of motion in mean motion resonance with the planet, nominally Tadpole, Horseshoe and Quasi-satellite, building 3 datasets defined as Real (taking the ephemerides of real asteroids from the JPL Horizons system), Ideal and Perturbed (both simulated, obtained by propagating initial conditions considering two different dynamical systems) for training and testing the Machine Learning algorithms in different conditions. The time series of the variable theta (angle related to the resonance) are studied with a data analysis pipeline defined ad hoc for the problem and composed by: data creation and annotation, time series features extraction thanks to the tsfresh package (potentially followed by selection and standardization) and the application of Machine Learning algorithms for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification. Such approach, based on features extracted from the time series, allows to work with a smaller number of data with respect to Deep Learning algorithms, also allowing to define a ranking of the importance of the features. Physical Interpretability of the features is another key point of this approach. In addition, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations for Explainability technique. Different training and test sets are used, in order to understand the power and the limits of our approach. The results show how the algorithms are able to identify and classify correctly the time series, with a high degree of performance.
#### To clump or not to clump The impact of wind inhomogeneities on the  optical and NIR spectroscopic analysis of massive OB stars

 - **Abstract**
 Winds of massive stars have density inhomogeneities (clumping) that may affect the formation of spectral lines in different ways, depending on their formation region. Most of previous and current spectroscopic analyses have been performed in the optical or ultraviolet domain. However, massive stars are often hidden behind dense clouds rendering near-infrared observations necessary. Our objective is to investigate whether a spectroscopic analysis using either optical or infrared observations results in the same stellar parameters with comparable accuracy, and whether clumping affects them in different ways. We analyzed optical and near-infrared observations of a set of massive O stars with spectral types O4-O9.5 and all luminosity classes. We obtain similar stellar parameters in the optical and the infrared, although with larger uncertainties in the near-infrared, both with and without clumping, albeit with some individual deviating cases. We find that the inclusion of clumping improves the fit to H$_\alpha$ or HeII 4686 in the optical for supergiants, as well as that of Br$_\gamma$ in the near-infrared, but it sometimes worsens the fit to HeII 2.18$\mu$m. Globally, there are no significant differences when using the clumping laws tested in this work. The infrared can be used for spectroscopic analyses, giving similar parameters as from the optical, though with larger uncertainties. The best fits to different lines are obtained with different (linear) clumping laws, indicating that the wind structure may be more complex than adopted in the present work. No clumping law results in a better global fit, or improves the consistency between optical and infrared stellar parameters. Our work shows that the optical and infrared lines are not sufficient to break the dichotomy between the mass-loss rate and clumping factor.

 Mini-EUSO is a telescope observing the Earth in the ultraviolet band (290-430 nm) since 2019, through a nadir-facing UV-transparent window in the Russian Zvezda module of the International Space Station. The main camera has an optical system composed of two 25 cm diameter Fresnel lenses and a focal surface consisting of 36 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, 64 pixels each, for a total of 2304 channels. The instrument has a square field of view with a side of 44 degrees, a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km on the Earth surface and a sampling time of 2.5 microseconds. Mini- EUSO has also two cameras in the near infrared and visible ranges and silicon photomultiplier sensors to complement the UV observations. Mini-EUSO has been designed as a small-size version of the original JEM-EUSO space telescope to demonstrate its observational principle. Mini-EUSO is in fact potentially capable of observing extensive air showers generated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with an energy above 10 21 eV and of detecting artificial showers generated with lasers from the ground. Other main scientific objectives of the mission are the study of atmospheric phenomena (transient luminous events such as ELVES and sprites), the observation of meteors and among them the search for interstellar meteors and nuclearites such as strange quark matter. Moreover, Mini-EUSO can map night-time UV Earth emissions, both anthropogenic and natural. In this work, we will discuss results and performance of the telescope during its first four years of activity.

 - **Abstract**
 In-order to understand the results of recent observations of exoplanets, models have become increasingly complex. Unfortunately this increases both the computational cost and output size of said models. We intend to explore if AI-image-recognition can alleviate this burden. We used DYNAMICO to run a series of HD209458-like models with different orbital-radii. Training data for a number of features of interest was selected from the initial outputs of these models. This was used to train a pair of multi-categorisation convolutional-neural-networks (CNN), which we applied to our outer-atmosphere-equilibrated models. The features detected by our CNNs revealed that our models fall into two regimes: models with a shorter orbital-radii exhibit significant global mixing which shapes the entire atmospheres dynamics. Whereas, models with longer orbital-radii exhibit negligible mixing except at mid-pressures. Here, the initial non-detection of any trained features revealed a surprise: a night-side hot-spot. Analysis suggests that this occurs when rotational influence is sufficiently weak that divergent flows from the day-side to the night-side dominate over rotational-driven transport, such as the equatorial jet. We suggest that image-classification may play an important role in future, computational, atmospheric studies. However special care must be paid to the data feed into the model, from the colourmap, to training the CNN on features with enough breadth and complexity that the CNN can learn to detect them. However, by using preliminary-studies and prior-models, this should be more than achievable for future exascale calculations, allowing for a significant reduction in future workloads and computational resources.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals in the primordial disc may have experienced a collisional cascade. If so, the comet nuclei later placed in the Kuiper belt, scattered disc, and Oort Cloud would primarily be fragments and collisional rubble piles from that cascade. However, the heating associated with the collisions cannot have been strong enough to remove the hypervolatiles that are trapped within more durable ices, because comet nuclei are rich in hypervolatiles. This places constraints on the diameter of the largest bodies allowed to participate in collisional cascades, and limits the primordial disc lifetime or population size. In this paper, the thermophysical code NIMBUS is used to study the thermal evolution of planetesimals before, during, and after catastrophic collisions. The loss of CO during segregation of $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ mixtures and during crystallisation of amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ is calculated, as well as mobilisation and internal relocation of $\mathrm{CO_2}$. If an amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ host existed, and was protected by a $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ heat sink, only diameter $D<20\,\mathrm{km}$ (inner disc) and $D<64\,\mathrm{km}$ (outer disc) bodies could have been involved in a collisional cascade. If $\mathrm{CO_2}$ was the only CO host, the critical diameters drop to $D<20$-$32\mathrm{km}$. Avoiding disruption of larger bodies requires a primordial disc lifetime of $<9\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $15\,\mathrm{au}$ and $<50$-$70\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $30\,\mathrm{au}$. Alternatively, if a $450\,\mathrm{Myr}$ disc lifetime is required to associate the primordial disc disruption with the Late Heavy Bombardment, the disc population size must have been 6-60 times below current estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Formed at an early stage of gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry, hydrides -- molecules containing a heavy element covalently bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms -- play an important role in interstellar chemistry as they are the progenitors of larger and more complex species in the interstellar medium. In recent years, the careful analysis of the spectral signatures of hydrides have led to their use as tracers of different constituents, and phases of the interstellar medium and in particular the more diffuse environments. Diffuse clouds form an essential link in the stellar gas life-cycle as they connect both the late and early stages of stellar evolution. As a result, diffuse clouds are continuously replenished by material which makes them reservoirs for heavy elements and hence ideal laboratories for the study of astrochemistry. This review will journey through a renaissance of hydride observations detailing puzzling hydride discoveries and chemical mysteries with special focus carbon-bearing hydrides to demonstrate the big impact of these small molecules and ending with remarks on the future of their studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Warps have often been used to explain disc properties, but well characterised examples are important due to their role in disc evolution. Scattered light images of discs with central gaps have revealed sharp warps, such that the outer rings are shadowed by tilted inner discs. The near-IR intensity drops along the ring around TTauri star DoAr44 have been interpreted in terms of a central warp. We report new ALMA observations of DoAr44 in the continuum at 230 GHz and 350 GHz (at ~10 au), along with a new epoch of SPHERE/IRDIS differential polarised imaging taken during excellent weather conditions. The ALMA observations resolve the ring and confirm the decrements proposed from deconvolution of coarse 336 GHz data. The scattered light image constrains the dips, which correspond to a misaligned inner disc with a relative inclination $\xi$ = 21.4 $^{+6.7}_{-8.3}$ deg. The SPHERE intensity profile shows a morphological change compared to a previous epoch that may be interpreted as a variable orientation of the inner disc, from $\xi$ ~30 deg to $\xi$ ~20 deg. The intensity dips probably correspond to temperature decrements, as their mm-spectral index, $\alpha^{230 GHz}_{350 GHz}$ ~2.0 $\pm$ 0.1, is indicative of optically thick emission. The azimuth of the two temperature decrements are leading clockwise relative to the IR-dips, by $\eta$ = 14.95 deg and $\eta$ = 7.92 deg. For a retrograde disc, such shifts are expected from a thermal lag and imply gas surface densities of $\Sigma_g$ = 117 $\pm$ 10 g/cm$^2$ and $\Sigma_g$ = 48 $\pm$ 10 g/cm$^2$. A lopsided disc, with contrast ratio $f_r$=2.4 $\pm$ 0.5, is also consistent with the large continuum crescent.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations by recent space missions reported the detection of Rossby waves (r-modes) in light curves of many stars (mostly A, B, and F spectral types) with outer radiative envelope. This paper aims to study the theoretical dynamics of Rossby-type waves in such stars. Hydrodynamic equations in a rotating frame were split into horizontal and vertical parts connected by a separation constant (or an equivalent depth). Vertical equations were solved analytically for a linear temperature profile and the equivalent depth was derived through free surface boundary condition. It is found that the vertical modes are concentrated in the near-surface layer with a thickness of several tens of surface density scale height. Then with the equivalent width, horizontal structure equations were solved, and the corresponding dispersion relation for Rossby, Rossby-gravity, and inertia-gravity waves was obtained. The solutions were found to be confined around the equator leading to the equatorially trapped waves. It was shown that the wave frequency depends on the vertical temperature gradient as well as on stellar rotation. Therefore, observations of wave frequency in light curves of stars with known parameters (radius, surface gravity, rotation period) could be used to estimate the temperature gradient in stellar outer layers. Consequently, the Rossby mode may be considered as an additional tool in asteroseismology apart from acoustic and gravity modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous simulations indicate that a large number of subhalos should be hosted by the Milky Way. The potential existence of a nearby subhalo could have important implications for our understanding of dark matter (DM) annihilation. In this study, we investigate the hypothetical presence of a nearby subhalo and set the upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section by analyzing the cosmic-ray antiproton spectrum. By presenting the ratios of annihilation cross section limits for scenarios with and without a nearby subhalo, we can quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of the nearby subhalo on the limits of the DM annihilation cross section. The impacts of the concentration model and the subhalo probability distribution have been considered. We explore the antiproton contribution of the potential nearby DM subhalo accounting for the DAMPE $e^\pm$ spectrum at $\sim 1.4$ TeV and find that the current AMS-02 antiproton results do not place the constraint on this contribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence plays a crucial role in shaping the structure of the interstellar medium. The ratio of the three-dimensional density contrast ($\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$) to the turbulent sonic Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$) of an isothermal, compressible gas describes the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the turbulent acceleration field of the gas, and is parameterised by the turbulence driving parameter: $b=\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}/\mathcal{M}$. The turbulence driving parameter ranges from $b=1/3$ (purely solenoidal) to $b=1$ (purely compressive), with $b=0.38$ characterising the natural mixture (1/3~compressive, 2/3~solenoidal) of the two driving modes. Here we present a new method for recovering $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$, $\mathcal{M}$, and $b$, from observations on galactic scales, using a roving kernel to produce maps of these quantities from column density and centroid velocity maps. We apply our method to high-resolution HI emission observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from the GASKAP-HI survey. We find that the turbulence driving parameter varies between $b\sim 0.3$ and $b\sim 1.0$ within the main body of the SMC, but the median value converges to $b\sim0.51$, suggesting that the turbulence is overall driven more compressively ($b>0.38$). We observe no correlation between the $b$ parameter and HI or H$\alpha$ intensity, indicating that compressive driving of HI turbulence cannot be determined solely by observing HI or H$\alpha$ emission density, and that velocity information must also be considered. Further investigation is required to link our findings to potential driving mechanisms such as star-formation feedback, gravitational collapse, or cloud-cloud collisions.
#### Thorne-Żytkow objects with mirror neutron star cores?

 - **Abstract**
 A Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow object can be formed when a neutron star is absorbed by the envelope of its giant companion star, spirals toward the center of the giant star due to the drag from the surrounding envelope, and merges with the star's core. During in-spiral, dynamical friction is the main drag force acting on a neutron star inside the star envelope. However, dynamical friction is caused by the neutron star's gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake. Therefore, exactly the same gravitational drag force will act on a mirror neutron star, and if a significant part of the dark matter is in the form of mirror matter, then we expect the formation of Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects with a mirror neutron star inside.
#### Chemical abundances of the young inner-disk open cluster NGC 6705  observed by APOGEE: sodium-rich and not $α$-enhanced

 - **Abstract**
 Previous results in the literature have found the young inner-disk open cluster NGC 6705 to be mildly $\alpha$-enhanced. We examined this possibility via an independent chemical abundance analysis for 11 red-giant members of NGC 6705. The analysis is based on near-infrared APOGEE spectra and relies on LTE calculations using spherical model atmospheres and radiative transfer. We find a mean cluster metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = +0.13 \pm 0.04$, indicating that NGC 6705 is metal-rich, as may be expected for a young inner-disk cluster. The mean $\alpha$-element abundance relative to iron is $\rm \langle [\alpha/Fe]\rangle =-0.03 \pm 0.05$, which is not at odds with expectations from general Galactic abundance trends. NGC 6705 also provides important probes for studying stellar mixing, given its turn-off mass of M$\sim$3.3 M$_\odot$. Its red giants have low $^{12}$C abundances ([$^{12}$C/Fe]=$-$0.16) and enhanced $^{14}$N abundances ([$^{14}$N/Fe]=+0.51), which are key signatures of the first dredge-up on the red giant branch. An additional signature of dredge-up was found in the Na abundances, which are enhanced by [Na/Fe]=+0.29, with a very small non-LTE correction. The $^{16}$O and Al abundances are found to be near-solar. All of the derived mixing-sensitive abundances are in agreement with stellar models of approximately 3.3 M$_{\odot}$ evolving along the red giant branch and onto the red clump. As found in young open clusters with similar metallicities, NGC 6705 exhibits a mild excess in the s-process element cerium, with $\rm [Ce/Fe] = +0.13\pm0.07$.

 - **Abstract**
 We are investigating the possible origin of small-scale anomalies, like the annual stratospheric temperature anomalies. Unexpectedly within known physics, their observed planetary "dependency", does not match concurrent solar activity, whose impact on the atmosphere is unequivocal; this points at an additional energy source of exo-solar origin. A viable concept behind such observations is based on possible gravitational focusing by the Sun and its planets towards the Earth of low-speed invisible streaming matter; its influx towards the Earth gets temporally enhanced. Only a somehow "strongly" interacting invisible streaming matter with the small upper atmospheric screening can be behind the observed temperature excursions. Ordinary dark matter (DM) candidates like axions or WIMPs, cannot have any noticeable impact. The associated energy deposition is $\mathcal{O}(\sim 1000\, \mathrm{GeV}/{{\mathrm{cm}}^2}/\mathrm{sec})$. The atmosphere has been uninterruptedly monitored for decades. Therefore, the upper atmosphere can serve as a novel (low-threshold) detector for the dark Universe, with built-in spatiotemporal resolution while the solar system gravity acts temporally as a signal amplifier. Interestingly, the anomalous ionosphere shows a relationship with the inner earth activity like earthquakes. Similarly investigating the transient sudden stratospheric warmings within the same reasoning, the nature of the assumed "invisible streams" could be deciphered.
#### Probing the spatial and velocity anisotropies in stellar halos from the  Aquarius simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the spatial anisotropy and the velocity anisotropy in a set of mock stellar halos from the Aquarius simulations. The spatial anisotropy in each mock stellar halo rises progressively with the increasing distance from the halo centre, eventually reaching a maximum near the periphery. Excluding the bound satellites leads to a significant reduction of the spatial anisotropy in each halo. We compare the measured anisotropy in the mock stellar halos with that from their sphericalized versions where all the shape and substructure induced anisotropies are erased. The growth of spatial anisotropy persists throughout the entire halo when the bound satellites are present but remains limited within the inner halo ($<60 \, h^{-1}\, {\rm kpc}$) after their exclusion. This indicates that the spatial anisotropy in the inner halo is induced by the diffuse substructures and the halo shape whereas the outer halo anisotropy is dominated by the bound satellites. We find that the outer parts of the stellar halo are kinematically colder than the inner regions. The stellar orbits are predominantly radial but they become rotationally dominated at certain radii that are marked by the prominent $\beta$ dips. Most of the $\beta$ dips disappear after the removal of the satellites. A few shallow and broad $\beta$ dips arise occasionally due to the presence of diffuse streams and clouds. Our analysis suggests that a combined study of the spatial and velocity anisotropies can reveal the structure and the assembly history of the stellar halos.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarization is a powerful tool to investigate the geometry of accreting material around black holes, allowing independent measurements of the black hole spin and orientation of the innermost parts of the accretion disk. We perform the X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of an X-ray binary system in the Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC X-3, that hosts a stellar-mass black hole, known to be persistently accreting since its discovery. We report the first detection of the X-ray polarization in LMC X-3 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, and find the average polarization degree of 3.2% +- 0.6% and a constant polarization angle -42 deg +- 6 deg over the 2-8 keV range. Using accompanying spectroscopic observations by NICER, NuSTAR, and the Neil Gehrels Swift observatories, we confirm previous measurements of the black hole spin via the X-ray continuum method, a ~ 0.2. From polarization analysis only, we found consistent results with low black-hole spin, with an upper limit of a < 0.7 at a 90% confidence level. A slight increase of the polarization degree with energy, similar to other black-hole X-ray binaries in the soft state, is suggested from the data but with a low statistical significance.
