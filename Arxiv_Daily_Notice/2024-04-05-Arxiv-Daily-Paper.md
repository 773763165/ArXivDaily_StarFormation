 - **Abstract**
 This STScI Working Group (WG) was charged with soliciting community feedback and evaluating the strategic planning for exoplanet science with JWST and HST given the high quality of exoplanet observations, the significantly lengthened mission lifetime for JWST, and the pronounced expansion of the field over the last decade. We were charged with identifying key science themes, providing recommendations on issues associated with optimal timing and scale of resources, as well as providing a recommended DDT concept achievable with 500 hours of JWST time. We recommend a DDT concept to survey the atmospheres of rocky-M dwarf exoplanets. It is critical to quickly survey a wide sample of such targets to ascertain if they indeed host significant atmospheres, i.e., define the cosmic shoreline, and to identify high priority targets for future follow-up. It is important for this effort to occur early in the mission lifetime. In the context of strategic planning of exoplanet observations, it is useful to estimate the expected exoplanet observational commitment over JWST's lifetime. Given the current usage associated with exoplanets, extended over 20 cycles, it is anticipated that JWST will dedicate $\approx$30,000 hours to exoplanet observations. We recommend efforts to support GO-driven programs that will contribute to this unprecedented data product of JWST. Of the $\approx$30,000 hours of anticipated JWST full-mission time dedicated to exoplanets, we expect that 1/3 of it could, and perhaps inevitably would, form a comprehensive, high S/N, panchromatic, 10$^4$ hour atmospheric survey of planets. Such an observational sample would be a legacy archive that would address a broad range of science questions across various populations of planets. It would also bridge the direct imaging and transit communities and involve a multitude of techniques to detect and characterize exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 In the cold dark matter paradigm, our Galaxy is predicted to contain >10000 dark matter subhaloes in the $10^5-10^8M_\odot$ range which should be completely devoid of stars. Stellar streams are sensitive to the presence of these subhaloes, which can create small-scale features in streams if they pass closely enough. Modelling these encounters can therefore, potentially recover the subhalo's properties. In this work, we demonstrate this for streams generated in numerical simulations, modelled on eccentric orbits in a realistic Milky Way potential, which includes the Large Magellanic Cloud and the subhalo itself. We focus on a mock model of the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream and inject a $10^7 M_\odot$ subhalo, creating a similar discontinuous morphology to current observations. We then explore how well subhalo properties are recovered using mock stream observations, consisting of no observational errors, as well as assuming realistic observational setups. These setups include present day style observations, and what will be possible with 4MOST and Gaia DR5 in the future. We show that we can recover all parameters describing the impact even with uncertainties matching existing data, including subhalo positions, velocities, mass and scale radius. Modelling the subhalo on an orbit instead of assuming an impulse approximation, we greatly reduce the degeneracy between subhalo mass and velocity seen in previous works. However, we find a slight bias in the subhalo mass (~0.1 dex). This demonstrates that we should be able to reliably extract the properties of subhaloes with stellar streams in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar discs are mostly modelled as circular structures of gas and dust orbiting a protostar. However, a number of physical mechanisms, e.g. the presence of a (sub)stellar companion or initial axial asymmetry, can cause the gas and dust orbital motion to become eccentric. Theoretical studies have revealed that, when present, disc eccentricity is expected to occur with predictable profiles that can be long-lasting and potentially observable in protostellar systems. We construct an analytical model predicting the typical features of the kinematics and morphology of eccentric protostellar discs, with the final goal of characterising the observational appearance of eccentricity in discs. We validate the model using a numerical simulation of a circumbinary disc (where the binary makes the disc eccentric). We finally post-process the simulation with Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer to study how eccentric features would appear through the "eyes" of ALMA. Besides the motion of the material on eccentric Keplerian orbits in the disc orbital plane, the most characteristic eccentric feature emerging from the analytical model is strong vertical motion with a typical anti-symmetric pattern (with respect to the disc line of pericentres). A circumbinary disc with a $\approx 40$ au eccentric cavity ($e_{\rm cav}=0.2$), carved by an $a_{\rm bin}=15$ au binary, placed at a distance $d=130$ pc, is expected to host in its upper emission surface vertical oscillations up to $v_{z}\sim 400\, {\rm ms}^{-1}$ close to the cavity edge, i.e. well within ALMA spectral and spatial resolution capabilities. A residual spiral pattern in the vertical velocity $\Delta v_{z}\sim 150\, {\rm ms}^{-1}$ of the simulation cannot be captured by the theoretical model, we speculate it to be possibly linked to the presence of a companion in the system.
#### Towards early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: III.  Physical properties of the O-type eclipsing binary OGLE LMC-ECL-21568 in a  quadruple system

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from a complex study of an eclipsing O-type binary (Aa+Ab) with the orbital period $P_{A}=3.2254367$ days, that forms part of a higher-order multiple system in a configuration (A+B)+C. We derived masses of the Aa+Ab binary $M_{1}= 19.02 \pm 0.12 \,M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 17.50 \pm 0.13 \,M_\odot$, radii $R_{1}= 7.70 \pm 0.05 \,R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 6.64 \pm 0.06 \,R_\odot$, and temperatures $T_1 = 34250 \pm 500 $ K, $T_2 = 33750 \pm 500 $ K. From the analysis of radial velocities, we found a spectroscopic orbit of A in the outer A+B system with $P_{A+B}=195.8$ days ($P_{A+B}/P_{A}\approx 61$). In the O-C analysis, we confirmed this orbit and found another component orbiting the A+B system with $P_{AB+C}=2550$ days ($P_{AB+C}\,/P_{A+B}\approx 13$). From the total mass of the inner binary and its outer orbit, we estimated the mass of the third object, $M_B \gtrsim 10.7 M_\odot$. From the light-travel time effect fit to the O-C data, we obtained the limit for the mass of the fourth component, $M_C \gtrsim 7.3 M_\odot$. These extra components contribute to about 20% to 30% (increasing with wavelength) of the total system light. From the comparison of model spectra with the multiband photometry, we derived a distance modulus of 18.59 $\pm$ 0.06 mag, a reddening of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.02 mag, and an $R_V$ of $3.2$. This work is part of our ongoing project, which aims to calibrate the surface brightness-color relation for early-type stars.
#### NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b: An 1 Gyr old 98-day transiting warm Jupiter

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period transiting exoplanets bridge the gap between the bulk of transit- and Doppler-based exoplanet discoveries, providing key insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The wider separation between these planets and their host stars results in the exoplanets typically experiencing less radiation from their host stars; hence, they should maintain more of their original atmospheres, which can be probed during transit via transmission spectroscopy. Although the known population of long-period transiting exoplanets is relatively sparse, surveys performed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) are now discovering new exoplanets to fill in this crucial region of the exoplanetary parameter space. This study presents the detection and characterisation of NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b, a new long-period transiting exoplanet detected by following up on a single-transit candidate found in the TESS mission. Through monitoring using a combination of photometric instruments (TESS, NGTS, and EulerCam) and spectroscopic instruments (CORALIE, FEROS, HARPS, and PFS), NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b was found to be a long-period (P = 98.29838 day) Jupiter-sized (0.928 RJ; 0.960 MJ) planet transiting a 1.1 Gyr old G-type star. With a moderate eccentricity of 0.294, its equilibrium temperature could be expected to vary from 274 K to 500 K over the course of its orbit. Through interior modelling, NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b was found to have a heavy element mass fraction of 0.23 and a heavy element enrichment (Zp/Z_star) of 20, making it metal-enriched compared to its host star. NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b is one of the youngest well-characterised long-period exoplanets found to date and will therefore be important in the quest to understanding the formation and evolution of exoplanets across the full range of orbital separations and ages.
#### Detecting New Visual Binaries in Gaia DR3 with Gaia and Two Micron All  Sky Survey (2MASS) Photometry II. Speckle Observations of 16 Low-Separation  Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present speckle observations of 16 low-separation ($s<30$ AU) high probability candidate binaries from the catalog by Medan et al., where secondaries typically lack astrometric solutions in Gaia. From these speckle observations, we find a second component is always detected within the field of view. To determine if the detection is consistent with a physical companion or a chance alignment with a background source, we utilize a statistic from Tokovinin & Kiyaeva that compares the apparent motion of the systems to the expected orbital motion ($\mu^\prime$). Using simulated binary orbits, we construct likelihood distributions of $\mu^\prime$ assuming various total errors on the measurements. With the hypothesis that the system is a true binary, we show that large measurement errors can result in $\mu^\prime$ values higher than expected for bound systems. Using simulated chance alignments, we also create similar likelihoods to test this alternative hypothesis. By combining likelihoods of both true binaries and chance alignments, we find that 15 of the 16 candidates are physical systems regardless of the level of measurement error. Our findings also accommodate all 16 as physical systems if the average, relative measurement error on the binary separations and position angles is $\sim4.3\%$, which is consistent with our knowledge of the Gaia and Gemini speckle pipelines. Importantly, beyond assessing the likelihood of a true binary vs. chance alignment, this quantitative assessment of the true average measurement error will allow more robust error estimates of mass determinations from short separation binaries with Gaia and/or Gemini speckle data.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical turbulence modelling and simulation are crucial for developing astronomical ground-based instruments, laser communication, laser metrology, or any application where light propagates through a turbulent medium. In the context of spectrum-based optical turbulence Monte-Carlo simulations, we present an alternative approach to the methods based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using a quasi-random frequency sampling heuristic. This approach provides complete control over the spectral information expressed in the simulated measurable, without the drawbacks encountered with FFT-based methods such as high-frequency aliasing, low-frequency under-sampling, and static sampling statistics. The method's heuristics, implementation, and an application example from the study of differential piston fluctuations are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest of high-redshift quasars with the first-year dataset of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis uses over $420\,000$ Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra and their correlation with the spatial distribution of more than $700\,000$ quasars. An essential facet of this work is the development of a new analysis methodology on a blinded dataset. We conducted rigorous tests using synthetic data to ensure the reliability of our methodology and findings before unblinding. Additionally, we conducted multiple data splits to assess the consistency of the results and scrutinized various analysis approaches to confirm their robustness. For a given value of the sound horizon ($r_d$), we measure the expansion at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$ with 2\% precision, $H(z_{\rm eff}) = (239.2 \pm 4.8) (147.09~{\rm Mpc} /r_d)$ km/s/Mpc. Similarly, we present a 2.4\% measurement of the transverse comoving distance to the same redshift, $D_M(z_{\rm eff}) = (5.84 \pm 0.14) (r_d/147.09~{\rm Mpc})$ Gpc. Together with other DESI BAO measurements at lower redshifts, these results are used in a companion paper to constrain cosmological parameters.
#### DESI 2024 VI: Cosmological Constraints from the Measurements of Baryon  Acoustic Oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift range $0.1<z<4.2$. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with a matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.295\pm 0.015$. Paired with a BBN prior and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the CMB, DESI requires $H_0=(68.52\pm0.62)$ km/s/Mpc. In conjunction with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from Planck and ACT, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.307\pm 0.005$ and $H_0=(67.97\pm0.38)$ km/s/Mpc. Extending the baseline model with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, DESI BAO alone require $w=-0.99^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, combinations of DESI with CMB or with SN~Ia individually prefer $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$. This preference is 2.6$\sigma$ for the DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when SN~Ia are added in, giving results discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the $2.5\sigma$, $3.5\sigma$ or $3.9\sigma$ levels for the addition of Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the sum of neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit $\sum m_\nu < 0.072$ $(0.113)$ eV at 95% confidence for a $\sum m_\nu>0$ $(\sum m_\nu>0.059)$ eV prior. These neutrino-mass constraints are substantially relaxed in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. [Abridged.]
#### Characterization of contaminants in the Lyman-alpha forest  auto-correlation with DESI

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations can be measured with sub-percent precision above redshift two with the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. This is one of the key goals of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which started its main survey in May 2021. We present in this paper a study of the contaminants to the lyman-alpha forest which are mainly caused by correlated signals introduced by the spectroscopic data processing pipeline as well as astrophysical contaminants due to foreground absorption in the intergalactic medium. Notably, an excess signal caused by the sky background subtraction noise is present in the lyman-alpha auto-correlation in the first line-of-sight separation bin. We use synthetic data to isolate this contribution, we also characterize the effect of spectro-photometric calibration noise, and propose a simple model to account for both effects in the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest. We then measure the auto-correlation of the quasar flux transmission fraction of low redshift quasars, where there is no lyman-alpha forest absorption but only its contaminants. We demonstrate that we can interpret the data with a two-component model: data processing noise and triply ionized Silicon and Carbon auto-correlations. This result can be used to improve the modeling of the lyman-alpha auto-correlation function measured with DESI.

 - **Abstract**
 The first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) contains the largest set of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest spectra ever observed. This data, collected in the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) sample, has been used to measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature at redshift $z=2.33$. In this work, we use a set of 150 synthetic realizations of DESI DR1 to validate the DESI 2024 Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO measurement. The synthetic data sets are based on Gaussian random fields using the log-normal approximation. We produce realistic synthetic DESI spectra that include all major contaminants affecting the Ly$\alpha$ forest. The synthetic data sets span a redshift range $1.8<z<3.8$, and are analysed using the same framework and pipeline used for the DESI 2024 Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO measurement. To measure BAO, we use both the Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. We use the mean of correlation functions from the set of DESI DR1 realizations to show that our model is able to recover unbiased measurements of the BAO position. We also fit each mock individually and study the population of BAO fits in order to validate BAO uncertainties and test our method for estimating the covariance matrix of the Ly$\alpha$ forest correlation functions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results and identify the needs for the next generation of Ly$\alpha$ forest synthetic data sets, with the top priority being to simulate the effect of BAO broadening due to non-linear evolution.

 We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (<~ 5% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, in particular, relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared emission features probe the properties of ionized gas, and hot or warm molecular gas. The Orion Bar is a frequently studied photodissociation region (PDR) containing large amounts of gas under these conditions, and was observed with the MIRI IFU aboard JWST as part of the "PDRs4All" program. The resulting IR spectroscopic images of high angular resolution (0.2") reveal a rich observational inventory of mid-IR emission lines, and spatially resolve the substructure of the PDR, with a mosaic cutting perpendicularly across the ionization front and three dissociation fronts. We extracted five spectra that represent the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas layers, and measured the most prominent gas emission lines. An initial analysis summarizes the physical conditions of the gas and the potential of these data. We identified around 100 lines, report an additional 18 lines that remain unidentified, and measured the line intensities and central wavelengths. The H I recombination lines originating from the ionized gas layer bordering the PDR, have intensity ratios that are well matched by emissivity coefficients from H recombination theory, but deviate up to 10% due contamination by He I lines. We report the observed emission lines of various ionization stages of Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar, Fe, and Ni, and show how certain line ratios vary between the five regions. We observe the pure-rotational H$_2$ lines in the vibrational ground state from 0-0 S(1) to 0-0 S(8), and in the first vibrationally excited state from 1-1 S(5) to 1-1 S(9). We derive H$_2$ excitation diagrams, and approximate the excitation with one thermal (~700 K) component representative of an average gas temperature, and one non-thermal component (~2700 K) probing the effect of UV pumping. We compare these results to an existing model for the Orion Bar PDR and highlight the differences with the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are characterized by O II lines around 4,000 - 4,500 A in pre-/near-maximum spectra, so-called W-shaped O II lines. As these lines are from relatively high excitation levels, they have been considered a sign of non-thermal processes, which may give a hint of power sources of SLSNe-I. However, the conditions for these lines to appear have not been understood well. In this work, we systematically calculate synthetic spectra to reproduce observed spectra of eight SLSNe-I, parameterizing departure coefficients from the nebular approximation in the SN ejecta (expressed as b_neb). We find that most of the observed spectra can be reproduced well with b_neb ~< 10, which means that no strong departure is necessary for the formation of the W-shaped O II lines. We also show that the appearance of the W-shaped O II lines is sensitive to temperature; only spectra with temperatures T ~ 14,000 - 16,000 K can produce the W-shaped O II lines without large departures. Based on this, we constrain the non-thermal ionization rate near the photosphere. Our results suggest that spectral features of SLSNe-I can give independent constraints on the power source through the non-thermal ionization rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysically motivated population models for binary black hole observables are often insufficient to capture the imprints of multiple formation channels. This is mainly due to the strongly parametrized nature of such investigations. Using a non-parametric model for the joint population-level distributions of binary black hole component masses and effective inspiral spins, we find hints of multiple subpopulations in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass-spectrum without any feature at the $30-40M_{\odot}$, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pile up due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near $50M_{\odot}$ or higher. The other sub-population with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at $30-40M_{\odot}$ and is consistent with binary black holes formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around $30M_{\odot}$. We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels. We validate our results by checking their robustness against variations of several model configurations and by analyzing large simulated catalogs with the same model.
#### Relation between the keV-MeV and TeV emission of GRB 221009A and its  implications

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to launch relativistic jets, which generate prompt emission by their internal processes and drive external shocks into surrounding medium, accounting for the long-lasting afterglow emission. However, how the jet powers the external shock is an open question. The unprecedented observations of the keV-MeV emission with GECAM and the TeV emission with LHAASO of so far the brightest burst, GRB 221009A, offer a great opportunity to study the prompt-to-afterglow transition and the early dynamical evolution of the external shock. In this letter, we find that the cumulative light curve of keV-MeV emission could well fit the rising stage of the TeV light curve of GRB 221009A, with a time delay of $4.45^{+0.26}_{-0.26}$\,s for TeV emission. Moreover, both the rapid increase in the initial stage and the excess from about \T+260\,s to 270\,s in the TeV light curve could be interpreted by inverse Compton (IC) scatterings of the inner-coming photons by the energetic electrons in external shock. Our results not only reveal a close relation between the keV-MeV and TeV emission, but also indicate a continuous, rather than impulsive, energy injection to the external shock. Assuming an energy injection rate proportional to the keV-MeV flux, we build a continuous energy injection model which well fits the TeV light curve of GRB 221009A, and provides an estimate of the Lorentz factor of the jet.
#### Scale-dependent local primordial non-Gaussianity as a solution to the  $S_8$ tension

 - **Abstract**
 For the last decade, several probes have pointed to a cosmological tension between the amplitude of density fluctuations extrapolated from the cosmic microwave background within the standard cosmological model and the one encapsulated by the $S_8$ parameter from large scale structure. The origin of this $S_8$ tension has not yet been elucidated and may hint at systematics in the data, unaccounted effects from baryonic physics, or new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology. Baryonic physics may in principle provide a nonlinear solution to the tension by suppressing the matter power spectrum more strongly on nonlinear scales than is traditionally assumed. Such a solution would not worsen the Hubble tension, contrary to many other proposed solutions to the $S_8$ tension. However, no realistic baryonic feedback in hydrodynamical simulations provides the needed suppression as a function of redshift. Here, we point out that a scale-dependence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), with significant PNG at scales of a few Mpc, can provide the needed suppression, since such PNG can suppress the power spectrum at slightly larger scales than baryons do. We demonstrate this by devising collisionless numerical simulations of structure formation in boxes of 0.5 Gpc/h with scale-dependent local-type PNG. Our simple models show that, as a proof of principle, scale-dependent PNG, with a Gaussian random field for primodial density fluctuations on large scales and $f_{\rm NL} \simeq -300$ at $\lesssim 10$ Mpc scales, together with state-of-the-art baryonification of the matter power spectrum, can in principle solve the $S_8$ tension. The $S_8$ tension would then be a smoking-gun of non-trivial inflationary physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to the precise astrometric measurements of proper motions by the Gaia mission, a new tidal stellar stream has been discovered in the northern hemisphere. The distribution of star count shows that the stream is approximately $80$ degrees long and $1.70$ degrees wide. Observations of $21$ member stars, including 14 RR Lyrae stars, indicate that the stream has an eccentric and retrograde orbit with $e=0.58$. The low metallicity, high total energy, and large angular momentum suggest that it is associated with the merging event Sequoia. This discovery suggests the possibility of finding more substructures with high eccentricity orbits, even in the inner halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption line spectroscopy using background quasars can provide strong constraints on galactic outflows. In this paper, we investigate possible scaling relations between outflow properties, namely outflow velocity \Vout, the mass ejection rate $\dot M_{\rm out}$, and the mass loading factor $\eta$ and the host galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density, redshift, and stellar mass using galactic outflows probed by background quasars from MEGAFLOW and other surveys. We find that $V_{\rm out}$ ($\eta$) is (anti-)correlated with SFR and SFR surface density. We extend the formalism of momentum-driven outflows of Heckman et al. to show that it applies not only to down the barrel studies but also to winds probed by background quasars, suggesting a possible universal wind formalism. Under this formalism, we find a clear distinction between ``strong'' and ``weak'' outflows where ``strong'' outflows seem to have tighter correlations with galaxy properties (SFR or galaxy stellar mass) than ``weak'' outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 HAT-P-67 b is one of the lowest-density gas giants known to date, making it an excellent target for atmospheric characterization through the transmission spectroscopy technique. In the framework of the GAPS large programme, we collected four transit events, with the aim of studying the exoplanet atmosphere and deriving the orbital projected obliquity. We exploited the high-precision GIARPS observing mode of the TNG, along with additional archival TESS photometry, to explore the activity level of the host star. We performed transmission spectroscopy, both in the VIS and in the nIR wavelength range, and analysed the RML effect both fitting the RVs and the Doppler shadow. Based on the TESS photometry, we redetermined the transit parameters of HAT-P-67 b. By modelling the RML effect, we derived a sky-projected obliquity of ($2.2\pm0.4$){\deg} indicating an aligned planetary orbit. The chromospheric activity index $\log\,R^{\prime}_{\rm HK}$, the CCF profile, and the variability in the transmission spectrum of the H$\alpha$ line suggest that the host star shows signatures of stellar activity and/or pulsations. We found no evidence of atomic or molecular species in the VIS transmission spectra, with the exception of pseudo-signals corresponding to Cr I, Fe I, H$\alpha$, Na I, and Ti I. In the nIR range, we found an absorption signal of the He I triplet of 5.56$^{+0.29}_{-0.30}$%(19.0$\sigma$), corresponding to an effective planetary radius of $\sim$3$R_p$ (where $R_p\sim$2$R_J$) which extends beyond the planet's Roche Lobe radius. Owing to the stellar variability, together with the high uncertainty of the model, we could not confirm the planetary origin of the signals found in the optical transmission spectrum. On the other hand, we confirmed previous detections of the infrared He I triplet, providing a 19.0$\sigma$ detection. Our finding indicates that the planet's atmosphere is evaporating.

 - **Abstract**
 In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute $3.54^{+7.66}_{-2.82}\times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.

 - **Abstract**
 The planet's mass loss is important for the planet's formation and evolution. The radius valley (RV) is believed to be triggered by evaporation-induced mass loss. As an alternative mechanism for the RV, the mass loss of post-impact planets is thoroughly investigated in this work. The impact energy is converted to the planet's internal energy, enhancing its core energy and accelerating mass loss and orbital migration. As the host star changes from K-type to F-type, the planet's mass loss and orbital migration increase. When the initial gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) is small, the migration efficiency for planets around K-type stars will increase, which helps to suppress mass loss and retain the planet's mass and radius within a specific range. On the contrary, planets around more massive F-type stars experience more substantial mass loss, potentially leading to complete mass loss, and migrate to orbits with longer periods. Our calculation shows that planets around different spectral types of host stars give rise to an RV ranging from 1.3-2.0 $R_{\oplus}$, consistent with the observed range of 1.3-2.6 $R_{\oplus}$. Despite the presence of uncertain parameters, the planetesimal impact can promote the RV establishment for planets around host stars of different spectral types.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of $N$-cyanomethanimine (H$_2$CNCN), the stable dimer of HCN of highest energy, and the most complex organic molecule identified in space containing the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone. We have identified a plethora of $a$-type rotational transitions with 3 $\leq J_\text{up} \leq$ 11 and $K_\text{a} \leq$ 2 that belong to this species towards the Galactic Center G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three cyanomethanimine isomers (including the $Z$- and $E$- isomers of $C$-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for H$_2$CNCN of (2.9$\, \pm \,$0.1)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which translates into a total molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of (2.1$\, \pm \,$0.3)$\times$10$^{-11}$. We have also revisited the previous detection of $E$- and $Z$-HNCHCN, and found a total $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of 31.8$\, \pm \,$1.8 and a $Z/E$-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5$\, \pm \,$0.2. While the latter can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH$_2$NH) and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we introduce an innovative parametric representation of the Hubble parameter, providing a model-independent means to explore the dynamics of an accelerating cosmos. The model's parameters are rigorously constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, leveraging a comprehensive dataset consisting of 31 data points from cosmic chronometers (CC), 1701 updated observations of Pantheon supernovae type Ia (SNeIa), and 6 data points from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). Our analysis delves into the behavior of various cosmological parameters within the model, including the transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one, as well as the density parameters and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The outcomes of our investigation reveal that the equation of state parameter aligns with characteristics reminiscent of the phantom model, supporting the prevailing understanding of our universe's current state of acceleration. This research contributes valuable insights into the ongoing cosmic expansion and underscores the utility of our novel parametric approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In recent years, the R-Process Alliance (RPA) has conducted a successful search for stars enhanced in elements produced by the rapid neutron-capture (r-)process. In particular, the RPA has uncovered a number of stars strongly enriched in light r-process elements, such as Sr, Y and Zr, the so-called limited-r stars, in order to investigate the astrophysical production site(s) of these elements. Aims. With this paper, we aim to investigate the possible formation sites for light neutron-capture elements, by deriving detailed abundances for neutron-capture elements from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of three limited-r stars. Methods. We conducted a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectroscopic abundance analysis of three stars, as well as a kinematic analysis. Further, we calculated the lanthanide mass fraction (XLa) of our stars and of limited-r stars from the literature. Results. We found that the neutron-capture element abundance pattern of limited-r stars behaves differently depending on their [Ba/Eu]] ratios, and suggest that this should be taken into account in future investigations of their abundances. Furthermore, we found that the XLa of limited-r stars is lower than that of the kilonova AT2017gfo. The latter seems to be in the transition zone between limited-r XLa and that of r-I, r-II stars. Finally, we found that, unlike r-I and r-II stars, the current sample of limited-r stars are largely born in the Galaxy rather than being accreted.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive characterization of 26 CME-driven compressive waves known as Coronal Bright Fronts (CBFs) observed in the low solar corona between 2010 and 2017. These CBFs have been found to be associated with SEP events near Earth, indicating their importance in understanding space weather phenomena. The aim of this study is to analyze and describe the early dynamics of CBFs using a physics-based heliospheric SEP forecasting system known as the SPREAdFAST framework. This framework utilizes a chain of data-driven analytic and numerical models to predict SEP fluxes at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere by considering their acceleration at CMEs near the Sun and subsequent interplanetary transport. To estimate the time-dependent plasma and compression parameters of the CBFs, we utilized sequences of base-difference images obtained from the AIA instrument on board the SDO satellite, and measurements of the height-time profiles of the CMEs obtained from the LASCO instrument on board the SOHO satellite. We employed kinematic measurements and plasma model results to derive these parameters. The SPREAdFAST framework facilitated the analysis and correlation of these observations with SEP events near Earth. Our analysis yielded statistical relations and distributions for both the shocks and plasma parameters associated with the 26 CBFs investigated. By combining the observations from the AIA and LASCO instruments, as well as the data products from the SPREAdFAST framework, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the early dynamics of CBFs, including their temporal evolution, plasma properties, and compressional characteristics. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field and have implications for space weather forecasting and the study of SEP events.

 - **Abstract**
 Hyperspectral images are data cubes with two spatial dimensions and a third spectral dimension, providing a spectrum for each pixel, and thus allow the mapping of extended sources' physical properties. In this article, we present the Semi-blind Unmixing with Sparsity for Hyperspectral Images (SUSHI), an algorithm for non-stationary unmixing of hyperspectral images with spatial regularization of spectral parameters. The method allows for the disentangling of physical components without the assumption of a unique spectrum for each component. Thus, unlike most source separation methods used in astrophysics, all physical components obtained by SUSHI vary in spectral shape and in amplitude across the data cube. Non-stationary source separation is an ill-posed inverse problem that needs to be constrained. We achieve this by training a spectral model and applying a spatial regularization constraint on its parameters. For the spectral model, we used an Interpolatory Auto-Encoder, a generative model that can be trained with limited samples. For spatial regularization, we applied a sparsity constraint on the wavelet transform of the model parameter maps. We applied SUSHI to a toy model meant to resemble supernova remnants in X-ray astrophysics, though the method may be used on any extended source with any hyperspectral instrument. We compared this result to the one obtained by a classic 1D fit on each individual pixel. We find that SUSHI obtains more accurate results, particularly when it comes to reconstructing physical parameters. We applied SUSHI to real X-ray data from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A and to the Crab Nebula. The results obtained are realistic and in accordance with past findings but have a much better spatial resolution. Thanks to spatial regularization, SUSHI can obtain reliable physical parameters at fine scales that are out of reach for pixel-by-pixel methods.

 - **Abstract**
 More than a century ago, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of gravitation (GR) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. One of the predictions of the theory is that not only particles and objects with mass, but also the quanta of light, photons, are tied to the curvature of space-time, and thus to gravity. There must be a critical mass density, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took fifty years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another fifty years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to 10^10 times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe. Three very different experimental techniques, but all based on Michelson interferometry or Fourier-inversion spatial interferometry have enabled the critical experimental breakthroughs. It has now become possible to investigate the space-time structure in the vicinity of the event horizons of BHs. We briefly summarize these interferometric techniques, and discuss the spectacular recent improvements achieved with all three techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of microwave sky signals, such as the cosmic microwave background, often requires component separation with multi-frequency methods, where different signals are isolated by their frequency behaviors. Many so-called "blind" methods, such as the internal linear combination (ILC), make minimal assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data that $\textit{do not contain the signal}$, and combine the resulting ML-predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices, to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.
