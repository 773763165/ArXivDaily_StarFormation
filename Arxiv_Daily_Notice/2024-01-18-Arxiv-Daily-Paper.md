#### Beyond GWTC-3: Analysing and verifying new gravitational-wave events  from the 4-OGC Catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 The Fourth Open Gravitational-wave Catalogue (4-OGC) presented parameter estimation analyses for a number of gravitational wave triggers which had not previously been presented in catalogues published by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (LVK). In this paper we present an analysis of these new triggers using the same analysis workflow which was used to generate the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 catalogues published by the LVK, using a comparable analysis configuration. We do not find any significant differences between our analysis and that previously presented by 4-OGC, providing a reassuring cross-check between two differing analysis techniques. We provide our parameter estimation results in a format comparable to those of the GWTC-3 data release.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed radiative transfer calculations and observing simulations to reproduce the 1.3-mm dust-continuum and C$^{18}$O (2-1) images in the Class I protostar R CrA IRS7B-a, observed with the ALMA Large Program ``Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)". We found that the dust disk model passively heated by the central protostar cannot reproduce the observed peak brightness temperature of the 1.3-mm continuum emission ($\sim$195 K), regardless of the assumptions about the dust opacity. Our calculation suggests that viscous accretion heating in the disk is required to reproduce the observed high brightness temperature. The observed intensity profile of the 1.3-mm dust-continuum emission along the disk minor axis is skewed toward the disk far side. Our modeling reveals that such an asymmetric intensity distribution requires flaring of the dust along the disk's vertical direction with the scale-height following $h/r \sim r^{0.3}$ as function of radius. These results are in sharp contrast to those of Class II disks, which show geometrically flat dust distributions and lower dust temperatures. From our modeling of the C$^{18}$O (2-1) emission, the outermost radius of the gas disk is estimated to be $\sim$80 au, larger than that of the dust disk ($\sim$62 au), to reproduce the observed distribution of the C$^{18}$O (2-1) emission in IRS 7B-a. Our modeling unveils a hot and thick dust disk plus a larger gas disk around one of the eDisk targets, which could be applicable to other protostellar sources in contrast to more evolved sources.
#### Are James Webb Space Telescope observations consistent with warm dark  matter?

 - **Abstract**
 We compare observed with predicted distributions of galaxy stellar masses $M_*$ and galaxy rest-frame ultra-violet luminosities per unit bandwidth $L_{UV}$, in the redshift range $z = 2$ to 13. The comparison is presented as a function of the comoving warm dark matter free-streaming cut-off wavenumber $k_{fs}$. For this comparison the theory is a minimal extension of the Press-Schechter formalism with only two parameters: the star formation efficiency, and a proportionality factor between the star formation rate per galaxy and $L_{UV}$. These two parameters are fixed to their values obtained prior to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data. The purpose of this comparison is to identify if, and where, detailed astrophysical evolution is needed to account for the new JWST observations.
#### A two-dimensional perspective of the rotational evolution of rapidly  rotating intermediate-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the first successful attempt at computing stellar models in two dimensions has been presented with models that include the centrifugal deformation and self-consistently compute the velocity field. This paper aims at studying the rotational evolution of 2D models of stars rotating at a significant fraction of their critical angular velocity. From the predictions of these models, we aim to improve our understanding of the formation of single Be stars. Using the ESTER code that solves the stellar structure of a rotating star in two dimensions with time evolution, we have computed evolution tracks of stars between 4 and 10Msun for initial rotation rates ranging between 60 and 90% the critical rotation rate. A minimum initial rotation rate at the start of the main sequence is needed to spin up the star to critical rotation within its main sequence lifetime. This threshold depends on the stellar mass, and increases with increasing mass. The models do not predict any stars above 8Msun to reach (near) critical rotation during the main sequence. Furthermore, we find the minimum threshold of initial angular velocity is lower for SMC metallicity compared to Galactic metallicity, which is in agreement with the increased fraction in the number of observed Be stars in lower metallicity environments. Self-consistent 2D stellar evolution provide more insight into the rotational evolution of intermediate-mass stars, and our predictions are consistent with observations of velocity distributions and fraction of Be stars amongst B-type stars. We find that stars with a mass above 8Msun do not increase their fraction of critical rotation during the main sequence. Since a fraction of stars above 8Msun have been observed to display the Be phenomenon, other processes or formation channels must be at play, or critical rotation is not required for the Be phenomenon above this mass.

 - **Abstract**
 The second data release of ESA's $Gaia$ mission revealed numerous signatures of disequilibrium in the Milky Way's disc. These signatures are seen in the planar kinematics of stars, which manifest as ridges and ripples in $R-v_{\phi}$, and in vertical kinematics, where a prominent spiral is seen in the $z-v_z$ phase space. In this work, we show an equivalent $\Delta R-v_{\mathrm{R}}$ phase spiral forms following a perturbation to the disc. We demonstrate the behaviour of the $\Delta R-v_{\mathrm{R}}$ phase spirals in both a toy model and a high resolution $N$-body simulation of a satellite interaction. We then confront these models with the data, where we find partial $\Delta R-v_{\mathrm{R}}$ phase spirals in the Solar neighborhood using the most recent data from $Gaia$ DR3. This structure indicates ongoing radial phase mixing in the Galactic disc, suggesting a history of recent perturbations, either through internal or external (e.g., satellite) processes. Future work modelling the $z-v_z$ and $\Delta R-v_{\mathrm{R}}$ phase spirals in tandem may help break degeneracy's between possible origins of the perturbation.
#### Observations of type Ia supernova SN 2020nlb up to 600 days after  explosion, and the distance to M85

 - **Abstract**
 The type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020nlb was discovered in the Virgo Cluster galaxy M85 shortly after explosion. Here we present observations that include one of the earliest high-quality spectra and some of the earliest multi-colour photometry of a SN Ia to date. We calculated that SN 2020nlb faded 1.28+/-0.02 mag in the B band in the first 15d after maximum brightness. We independently fitted a power-law rise to the early flux in each filter, and found that the optical filters all give a consistent first light date estimate. In contrast to the earliest spectra of SN 2011fe, those of SN 2020nlb show strong absorption features from singly ionised metals, including Fe II and Ti II, indicating lower-excitation ejecta at the earliest times. The spectra of SN 2020nlb then evolve to become hotter and more similar to SN 2011fe as it brightens towards peak. We also obtained a sequence of nebular spectra that extend up to 594 days after maximum light, a phase out to which SNe Ia are rarely followed. The [Fe III]/[Fe II] flux ratio (as measured from emission lines in the optical spectra) begins to fall around 300 days after peak; by the +594d spectrum, the ionisation balance of the emitting region of the ejecta has shifted dramatically, with [Fe III] by then being completely absent. The final spectrum is almost identical to SN 2011fe at a similar epoch, and in sharp contrast to a late nebular spectrum of SN 1994D, which still displayed strong [Fe III] emission at these late times. Comparing our data to other SN Ia nebular spectra, there is a possible trend where SNe that were more luminous at peak tend to have a higher [Fe III]/[Fe II] flux ratio in the nebular phase, but there are also notable outliers. Finally, using light-curve fitting on our data, we estimate the distance modulus for M85 to be 30.99+/-0.19 mag, corresponding to a distance of 15.8^{+1.4}_{-1.3} Mpc.
#### The weird and the wonderful in our Solar System: Searching for  serendipity in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method for anomaly detection in Solar System object data, in preparation for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We train a deep autoencoder for anomaly detection and use the learned latent space to search for other interesting objects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the autoencoder approach by finding interesting examples, such as interstellar objects, and show that using the autoencoder, further examples of interesting classes can be found. We also investigate the limits of classic unsupervised approaches to anomaly detection through the generation of synthetic anomalies and evaluate the feasibility of using a supervised learning approach. Future work should consider expanding the feature space to increase the variety of anomalies that can be uncovered during the survey using an autoencoder.
#### A Bigger Cloud 9? New HI Observations of the RELHIC Candidate M94-Cloud  9

 - **Abstract**
 We present new HI observations of the REionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC) candidate, M94-CL9, detected around M94 by Zhou et al. using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). M94-CL9's HI properties as detected by FAST are consistent with a RELHIC as noted by Benitez-Llambay & Navarro. Our observations with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) detect greater HI emission in M94-CL9 and result in HI properties that are larger (corrected velocity width, $W_{50,c,t}=35.7\pm0.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$; and integrated flux, $\int\mathrm{Sdv}=0.28\pm0.04\,\mathrm{Jy}\cdot\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) than those found by Zhou et al. but that match those from the FAST All-Sky HI (FASHI) survey. These larger properties do not preclude M94-CL9 from being a RELHIC, but the wider spectral extent and spectral asymmetry reported here may be in tension with predictions of RELHIC properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding stellar evolution and its effect on planetary systems is crucial for correctly interpreting the chemical constraints of exo-planetary material that can be given to us by white dwarfs. This article will describe how asteroids, moons, and comets, as well as boulders, pebbles and dust, evolve into eventual targets for chemical spectroscopy, and how planets and companion stars play a vital role in reshaping system architectures for this purpose.
#### Two-dimensional kinematics and dynamical modelling of the 'Jackpot'  gravitational lens from deep MUSE observations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08771
 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the first spatially resolved kinematic and dynamical modelling analysis of the unique SDSSJ0946+1006 ('Jackpot') triple-source lens system, where a single massive foreground $z\,=\,0.222$ galaxy multiple-images three background sources at different redshifts. Deep IFU spectroscopic data were obtained using the MUSE instrument on the VLT, which, compared to previous single-slit observations, provides full azimuthal area coverage, high sensitivity (5 hour integration) and high angular resolution ($0.5\,$arcsec FWHM). To account for the strong continuum contributions from the $z\,=\,0.609$ source, a multiple-component stellar template fitting technique is adopted to fit to the spectra of both the lens galaxy and the bright lensed background arc simultaneously. Through this, we robustly measure the first and second moments of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics out to about $10\,$kpc from the centre of the lens, as well as resolving the inner profile inwards to $\sim1\,$kpc. The two-dimensional kinematic maps show a steep velocity dispersion gradient and a clear rotational component. We constrain the characteristic properties of the stellar and dark matter (DM) mass components with a sufficiently flexible parameterised dynamical model and an imposed lensing mass and find a DM density slope of $\gamma\,=\,1.73\substack{+0.17 \\ -0.26}$, i.e. significantly steeper than an unmodified NFW profile ($\gamma\,=\,1$) and consistent with a contracted DM halo. Our fitted models have a lensing-equivalent density slope of $\eta\,=\,0.96\pm0.02$, and thus we confirm most pure lensing results in finding a near isothermal profile for this galaxy.
#### Orbital Stability and Secular Dynamics of the Proxima Centauri Planetary  System

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08773
 - **Abstract**
 The two innermost planets of the Proxima Centauri system are separated by just 0.02 au, inducing strong gravitational interactions between them. We assess this interaction by leveraging fast orbital stability indicators and find that orbital stability is very likely if the initial eccentricities of planets b and d are less than $\sim 0.2$, but cannot confirm stability at larger values. We find that stability is not strongly affected by the true masses of the planets or by the distant planet c. However, mutual inclinations between 95$^\circ$ and 142$^\circ$ often result in unstable motion. We further explore the long-term evolution of the orbits in these stable regions of parameter space and find that circularization can take over 5 Gyr. This tidal evolution could support surface energy fluxes in excess of 1 W m$^{-2}$ for over 1 Gyr, possibly affecting planet b's habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the 2023 season data from high-cadence microlensing surveys with the aim of detecting partially covered short-term signals and revealing their underlying astrophysical origins. Through this analysis, we ascertain that the signals observed in the lensing events KMT-2023-BLG-0416, KMT-2023-BLG-1454, and KMT-2023-BLG-1642 are of planetary origin. Considering the potential degeneracy caused by the partial coverage of signals, we thoroughly investigate the lensing-parameter plane. In the case of KMT-2023-BLG-0416, we have identified two solution sets, one with a planet-to-host mass ratio of $q\sim 10^{-2}$ and the other with $q\sim 6\times 10^{-5}$, within each of which there are two local solutions emerging due to the inner-outer degeneracy. For KMT-2023-BLG-1454, we discern four local solutions featuring mass ratios of $q\sim (1.7-4.3)\times 10^{-3}$. When it comes to KMT-2023-BLG-1642, we identified two locals with $q\sim (6-10)\times 10^{-3}$ resulting from the inner-outer degeneracy. We estimate the physical lens parameters by conducting Bayesian analyses based on the event time scale and Einstein radius. For KMT-2023-BLG-0416L, the host mass is $\sim 0.6~M_\odot$, and the planet mass is $\sim (6.1-6.7)~M_{\rm J}$ according to one set of solutions and $\sim 0.04~M_{\rm J}$ according to the other set of solutions. KMT-2023-BLG-1454Lb has a mass roughly half that of Jupiter, while KMT-2023-BLG-1646Lb has a mass in the range of between 1.1 to 1.3 times that of Jupiter, classifying them both as giant planets orbiting mid M-dwarf host stars with masses ranging from 0.13 to 0.17 solar masses.
#### A blind search for intraday gamma-ray transients with Fermi-LAT:  detections of GRB and solar emissions

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08946
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08946
 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for intraday transient gamma-ray signals using 15 years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope data. The search is based on a recently developed variable-size sliding-time-window (VSSTW) analysis and aimed at studying variable gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts and the Sun. We refined the algorithm for searches for transient sources in order to solve the search problem within a reasonable amount of CPU time. These refinements allowed us to increase the number of gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, and quiescent solar events detected with the VSSTW technique by several times compared to the previous VSSTW search. The current search revealed a new gamma-ray signal recorded with Fermi-LAT on 2018 January 12. This signal is probably from a GRB and deserves an exploration of the existing archival multi-wavelength observations in order to identify it in an unambiguous way. We furthermore report a gamma-ray signal from the solar flare on 2023 December 31 which occurred during the 25th solar cycle.
#### An Automatic Approach for Grouping Sunspots and Calculating Relative  Sunspot Number on SDO/HMI Continuum Images

 - **Abstract**
 Relative Sunspot Number is one of the major parameters for the study of long-term solar activity. The automatic calculation of the Relative Sunspot Number is more stable and accurate as compared to manual methods. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can detect sunspots and divide them into groups, to automatically calculate the Relative Sunspot Number. Mathematical Morphology was adopted to detect sunspots then group them. The dataset used were the continuum images from SDO/HMI. The process was carried out on the overall HMI data available on the timespan from January 2022 to May 2023 with a time cadence of one day. The experimental results indicated that the method achieved high accuracy of 85.3\%. It was well fitted with the international Relative Sunspot Number provided by Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC) (CC=0.91). We calculated the conversion factor K value of SDO/HMI for calculating the Relative Sunspots Number(K=1.03).

#### The First Polarimetric View on Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in a Black  Hole X-ray Binary

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first polarimetric analysis of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) in a black hole binary utilizing \textit{IXPE} data. Our study focuses on Swift J1727.8--1613, which experienced a massive outburst that was observed by various telescopes across different wavelengths. The \textit{IXPE} observation we studied was conducted during the Hard-Intermediate state. The polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) were measured at 4.28$\pm$0.20\% and $1.9^{\circ}\pm1.4^{\circ}$, respectively. Remarkably, significant QPO signals were detected during this observation, with a QPO frequency of approximately 1.34 Hz and a fractional root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of about 12.3\%. Furthermore, we conducted a phase-resolved analysis of the QPO using the Hilbert-Huang transform technique. The photon index showed a strong modulation with respect to the QPO phase. In contrast, the PD and PA exhibit no modulations in relation to the QPO phase, which is inconsistent with the expectation of the Lense-Thirring precession of the inner flow. Further theoretical studies are needed to conform with the observational results.
#### The Influence of Stellar Rotation in Binary Systems on Core-Collapse  Supernova Progenitors and Multi-messenger Signals

 - **Abstract**
 The detailed structure of core-collapse supernova progenitors is crucial for studying supernova explosion engines and the corresponding multimessenger signals. In this paper, we investigate the influence of stellar rotation on binary systems consisting of a 30 solar mass donor star and a 20 solar mass accretor using the MESA stellar evolution code. We find that through mass transfer in binary systems, fast-rotating red- and blue-supergiant progenitors can be formed within a certain range of initial orbital periods, albeit the correlation is not linear. We also find that even with the same initial mass ratio of the binary system, the resulting final masses of the collapsars, the iron core masses, the compactness parameters, and the final rotational rates can vary widely and are sensitive to the initial orbital periods. For instance, the progenitors with strong convection form a thinner Si-shell and a wider O-shell compared to those in single-star systems. In addition, we conduct two-dimensional self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations with neutrino transport for these rotating progenitors derived from binary stellar evolution. We find that the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures of these binary progenitors could exhibit significant variations. Progenitors with larger compactness parameters produce more massive proto-neutron stars, have higher mass-accretion rates, and emit brighter neutrino luminosity and louder gravitational emissions. Finally, we observe stellar-mass black hole formation in some of our failed exploding models.
#### Whither or wither the Sulfur Anomaly in Planetary Nebulae?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09020
 - **Abstract**
 We present a thorough investigation of the long standing sulfur anomaly enigma. Our analysis uses chemical abundances from the most extensive dataset available for 126 planetary nebulae (PNe) with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainties from a 10x10 degree Galactic bulge region. By using argon as a superior PNe metallicity indicator, the anomaly is significantly reduced and better constrained. For the first time in PNe we show sulfur alpha-element lock-step with both oxygen and argon. We dispel hypotheses that the anomaly originates from underestimation of higher sulfur ionization stages. Using a machine learning approach, we show that earlier ionization correction factor (ICFs) schemes contributed significantly to the anomaly. We find a correlation between the sulfur anomaly and the age/mass of PNe progenitors, with the anomaly either absent or significantly reduced in PNe with young progenitors. Despite inherent challenges and uncertainties, we link this to PNe dust chemistry, noting those with carbon-dust chemistry show a more pronounced anomaly. By integrating these findings, we provide a plausible explanation for the residual, reduced sulfur anomaly and propose its potential as an indicator of relative galaxy age compositions based on PNe.

 - **Abstract**
 In several B-type supergiants photometric and spectroscopic variabilities together with episodes of enhanced mass-loss have been observed. Here we present the preliminary results of linear stability analysis followed by nonlinear numerical simulations in two B-type supergiants MWC 137 and MWC 314. All the considered models of MWC 137 having mass in the range of 30 M$_{\odot}$ to 70 M$_{\odot}$ are unstable while for the case of MWC 314 models with mass below 31 M$_{\odot}$ are unstable. The instabilities have been followed into nonlinear regime for selected models of these two supergiants. During the nonlinear numerical simulations, instabilities lead to finite amplitude pulsation with a well defined saturation level in the considered models of MWC 137 with mass greater than 42 M$_{\odot}$. The model of MWC 314 with mass of 40 M$_{\odot}$ - the suggested mass for the primary star - does not show any instabilities both in linear stability analysis and nonlinear numerical simulations. Velocity amplitude reaches to 10$^7$ cm/s in the nonlinear regime for the model of MWC 314 with mass of 30 M$_{\odot}$. Further extensive numerical simulations and observations are required to understand the origin of the observed variabilities in these stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the implementation of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methodologies, particularly the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), in prioritizing technosignatures (TSs) for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). By incorporating expert opinions and weighted criteria based on the established Axes of Merit, our analysis offers insights into the relative importance of various TSs. Notably, radio and optical communications are emphasized, in contrast to dark side illumination and starshades in transit. We introduce a new axis, Scale Sensitivity, designed to assess the variability of TS metrics. A sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach. Our findings, especially the highlighted significance of artifacts orbiting Earth, the Moon, or the Sun, indicate a need to broaden evaluative criteria within SETI research. This suggests an enhancement of the Axes of Merit, with a focus on addressing the plausibility of TSs. As the quest to resolve the profound question of our solitude in the cosmos continues, SETI efforts would benefit from exploring innovative prioritization methodologies that effectively quantify TS search strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 We aimed to measure the CMF in the evolved W33-Main star-forming protocluster to compare it with CMF recently obtained in other Galactic star-forming regions, including the ones included in the ALMA-IMF program. We used observations from the ALMA-IMF large program: 2'x2' maps of emission from the continuum and selected lines at 1.3mm and 3mm observed by the ALMA 12m only antennas. Our angular resolution was typically 1'', that is 2400au at a distance of 2.4kpc. The lines we analysed are CO(2-1), SiO(5-4), N2H+(1-0), H41alpha as well as He41alpha blended with C41alpha. We built a census of dense cores in the region, and we measured the associated CMF based on a core-dependent temperature value. We confirmed the 'evolved' status of W33-Main by identifiying three HII regions within the field, and to a lesser extent based on the number and extension of N2H+ filaments. We produced a filtered core catalog of 94 candidates, that we refined to take into account the contamination of the continuum by free-free and line emission, obtaining 80 cores with masses that range from 0.03 to 13.2Msun. We fitted the resulting high-mass end of the CMF with a single power law of the form N(log(M)) ~ M^alpha, obtaining alpha = -1.44(+0.16)(-0.22), slightly steeper but consistent with the Salpeter index. We categorized our cores in pre- and protostellar, mostly based on outlow activity and hot core nature. We found the prestellar CMF to be steeper than a Salpeter-like distribution, and the protostellar CMF to be slightly top heavy. We found a higher proportion of cores within the HII regions and their surroundings than in the rest of the field. We also found that the cores' masses were rather low (maximum mass of 13Msun).

 - **Abstract**
 Classical barium stars are red giants that received from their evolved binary companions material exposed to the \textit{slow} neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, i.e., the $s$-process. Such a mechanism is expected to have taken place in the interiors of Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars. As post-interacting binaries, barium stars figure as powerful tracers of the $s$-process nucleosynthesis, evolution of binary systems, and mechanisms of mass transfer. The present study is the fourth in a series of high-resolution spectroscopic analyses on a sample of 180 barium stars, for which we report tungsten (W, $Z=74$) abundances. The abundances were derived from synthetic spectrum computations of the W\,{\sc i} absorption features at 4\,843.8~\AA\ and 5\,224.7~\AA. We were able to extract abundances for 94 stars; the measured [W/Fe] ratios range from $\sim0.0$ to $2.0$ dex, increasing with decreasing of metallicity. We noticed that in the plane [W/Fe] versus [$s$/Fe] barium stars follow the same trend observed in post-AGB stars. The observational data were also compared with predictions of the {\sc fruity} and Monash AGB nucleosynthesis models. These expect values between $-0.20$ and $+0.10$ dex for the [W/hs] ratios, whereas a larger spread is observed in the program stars, with [W/hs] ranging from $-0.40$ to $+0.60$ dex. The stars with high [W/hs] ratios may represent evidence for the operation of the intermediate neuron-capture process at metallicities close to solar.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on recent progress in the development of Laue lenses for applications in hard X/soft gamma-ray astronomy. Here we focus on the realization of a sector of such a lens made of 11 bent Germanium crystals and describe the technological challenges involved in their positioning and alignment with adhesive-based bonding techniques. The accurate alignment and the uniformity of the curvature of the crystals are critical for achieving optimal X-ray focusing capabilities. We have assessed how the errors of misalignment with respect to the main orientation angles of the crystals affect the point spread function (PSF) of the image diffracted by a single sector. We have corroborated these results with simulations carried out with our physical model of the lens, based on a Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique, adopting the geometrical configuration of the Laue sector, the observed assembly accuracy and the measured curvatures of the crystals. An extrapolation of the performances achieved on a single sector to an entire Laue lens based on this model has shown that a PSF with half-power-diameter of 4.8 arcmin can be achieved with current technology. This has the potential to lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity of spectroscopic and polarimetric observations in the 50-600 keV band

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed chemical composition of stars is of prime interest for a range of topics in modern stellar astrophysics, such as the chemical evolution of the Galaxy or the formation, composition, and structure of exoplanets. In this work, we derive the C and O abundances and update Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances considering hyperfine structure effects (HFS) and correcting for non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) for a sample of 196 late-F, G-, and early-K stars with wide resolved M-dwarf companions. We accomplished this by employing the equivalent width (EW) method and high-resolution spectroscopic data. Furthermore, we investigated the distributions of [X/Fe] ratios and [C/O] as a function of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and kinematic population. The observed trends are consistent with previous findings reported in the literature. Additionally, we searched for confirmed exoplanets around our primary stars in the literature and found 24 exoplanets in 17 systems, while none of the M-dwarf companions in our sample presented confirmed exoplanets. In conclusion, our study provides homogeneous abundances from high-resolution spectra for a large sample of FGK primary stars, paving the way for further research on stellar abundances of the M secondaries and exoplanetary science.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore binary asteroid formation by spin-up and rotational disruption considering the NASA DART mission's encounter with the Didymos-Dimorphos binary, which was the first small binary visited by a spacecraft. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations, we follow the gravitational accumulation of a satellite from meter-sized particles following a mass-shedding event from a rapidly rotating primary. The satellite's formation is chaotic, as it undergoes a series of collisions, mergers, and close gravitational encounters with other moonlets, leading to a wide range of outcomes in terms of the satellite's mass, shape, orbit, and rotation state. We find that a Dimorphos-like satellite can form rapidly, in a matter of days, following a realistic mass-shedding event in which only ${\sim}2-3\%$ of the primary's mass is shed. Satellites can form in synchronous rotation due to their formation near the Roche limit. There is a strong preference for forming prolate (elongated) satellites, although some simulations result in oblate spheroids like Dimorphos. The distribution of simulated secondary shapes is broadly consistent with other binary systems, measured through radar or lightcurves. Unless Dimorphos's shape is an outlier, and considering the observational bias against lightcurve-based determination of secondary elongations for oblate bodies, we suggest there could be a significant population of oblate secondaries. If these satellites initially form with elongated shapes, a yet-unidentified pathway is needed to explain how they become oblate. Finally, we show that this chaotic formation pathway occasionally forms asteroid pairs and stable triples, including co-orbital satellites and satellites in mean motion resonances.
#### AT2021lwx: Another Neutrino-Coincident Tidal Disruption Event with a  Strong Dust Echo?

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the possible association of an astrophysical neutrino (IC220405B) with the recently reported, extremely energetic tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, aka ``Scary Barbie'') at redshift $z=0.995$. Although the TDE is about $2.6^\circ$ off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (${outside}$ the 90% C.L. localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so far reported neutrino-TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the SMBH frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs. Since data are only available up to 300 days post-peak in the SMBH frame, significant uncertainties exist in the dust echo interpretation, and therefore in the predicted number of neutrinos detected, $\mathcal N_{\nu}\simeq3.0\times10^{-3}-0.012$. We recommend further follow-up on this object for an extended period, and suggest refining the reconstruction the neutrino arrival direction in this particular case.
#### The Role of Drag and Gravity on Dust Concentration in a Gravitationally  Unstable Disc

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the role of gravitational and drag forces on the concentration of large dust grains (St > 1) in the spiral arms of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs, and the resulting implications for planet formation. We find that both drag and gravity play an important role in the evolution of large dust grains. If we include both, grains that would otherwise be partially decoupled will become well coupled and trace the spirals. For the dust grains most influenced by drag (with Stokes numbers near unity), the dust disc quickly becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly forms clumps with masses between 0.15 - 6 Earth masses. A large fraction of clumps are below the threshold where runaway gas accretion can occur. However, if dust self-gravity is neglected, the dust is unable to form clumps, despite still becoming trapped in the gas spirals. When large dust grains are unable to feel either gas gravity or drag, the dust is unable to trace the gas spirals. Hence, full physics is needed to properly simulate dust in gravitationally unstable discs. Dust trapping of large grains in spiral arms of discs stable to gas fragmentation could explain planet formation in very young discs by a population of planetesimals formed due to the combined roles of drag and gravity in the earliest stages of a disc's evolution. Furthermore, it highlights that gravitationally unstable discs are not just important for forming gas giants quickly, it can also rapidly form Earth mass bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the standard model only and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and dark matter densities in the Universe, as well as the observed value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. In our scenario, large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally but without forming a black hole. This rapid process can lead to a maximal baryogenesis in those regions at the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) epoch at thermal temperatures between 20 MeV and 50 MeV. Compared to another mechanism relying on shock waves associated to the formation of PBHs, our mechanism instead applies to aborted PBHs. Using simulations in numerical relativity, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis and show that the baryon-to-photon ratio is generically between two and three times larger than the relative abundance of PBHs formed at those temperatures. Finally, we show that PBH formation models at the QCD epoch leading to an abundance comparable to the dark matter could have generated a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.
