          Exploring Dark Forces with Multimessenger Studies of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of dark sector interactions via gravitational waves (GWs) from binary inspirals has been a subject of recent interest. We study dark forces using extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), pointing out two issues of interest. Firstly, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the EMRI, which sets the characteristic length scale of the system and hence the dark force range to which it exhibits enhanced sensitivity, probes force mediator masses that complement those studied with supermassive black hole (SMBH) or neutron star binaries. The LISA mission (the proposed $\mu$Ares detector) will probe mediators with masses $m_V \sim 10^{-16}~{\rm eV}$ ($m_V \sim 10^{-18}~{\rm eV}$), corresponding to ISCOs of $10^6 M_\odot$ ($10^8 M_\odot$) central SMBHs. Secondly, while the sensitivity to dark couplings is typically limited by the uncertainty in the binary component masses, independent mass measurements of the central SMBH through reverberation mapping campaigns or the motion of dynamical tracers enable one to break this degeneracy. Our results, therefore, highlight the necessity for coordinated studies, loosely referred to as "multimessenger", between future $\mu{\rm Hz}-{\rm mHz}$ GW observatories and ongoing and forthcoming SMBH mass measurement campaigns, including OzDES-RM, SDSS-RM, and SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper.

          The satellite galaxy plane of NGC 4490 in light of {\Lambda}CDM - Sparsity of similarly extreme analogs and a possible role of satellite pairs

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy system around NGC4490 was recently highlighted to display a flattened, kinematically correlated structure reminiscent of satellite galaxy planes around other hosts. Since known satellite planes are in tension with $\Lambda$CDM expectations from cosmological simulations, we quantitatively assess for the first time the tension posed by the NGC4490 system. We measure the on-sky flattening as the major-to-minor axis ratio b/a of the satellite distribution and their line-of-sight kinematic correlation. Analogs are selected in the IllustrisTNG-50 simulation and their flattening and correlation are similarly measured. We confirm the strong kinematic coherence of all 12 observed objects with available line-of-sight velocities (of 14 in total): the northern ones approach and the southern ones recede relative to the host. The spatial distribution of all 14 objects is substantially flattened with b/a=0.38 (0.26 considering only the 12 objects with velocities). Such extreme arrangements are rare in the simulation at 0.21-0.35%. This would drop further if at least one of the two satellite objects without velocities is confirmed to follow the kinematic trend, and would become zero if both are rejected as non-members. We also identify a likely galaxy pair in the observed system, and find a similar pair in the best-matching simulated analog. Our findings establish NGC4490 as another strong example of a satellite plane in the Local Volume. This emphasizes that planes of satellites are a more general issue faced by $\Lambda$CDM also beyond the Local Group. The tension with typical systems in simulations suggests that the observed one requires a specific formation scenario, potentially connected to the larger-scale galaxy alignment in its vicinity. The presence of galaxy pairs in the observed and a simulated system hints at the importance such groupings may have to understand satellite planes.

          Effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud on the kinematics of Milky Way satellites and virial mass estimate

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study illustrating the effects of the passage of a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) mass satellite on the distance and velocity distributions of satellites in $\Lambda+$Cold Dark Matter simulations of Milky Way (MW) sized halos. In agreement with previous studies, we find that during such a passage the velocity distribution develops a high-velocity tail due to the reflex motion of the inner part of the halo, which can bias velocity-based virial halo mass estimates. When the velocity distribution of MW satellites is corrected for effects of the LMC passage, it is consistent with the distributions in halos of masses as low as $M_{\rm 200c}=8\times 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ and as high as $1.5\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$. We present a new halo mass estimator $M_{\rm 200c}=c\sigma^2_{\rm 3D}r_{\rm med}$, where $c$ is a constant calibrated using satellite systems in the simulated MW-sized halos, $\sigma^2_{\rm 3D}$ is the variance of 3D velocities taken with the sign of the radial velocity of each satellite, and $r_{\rm med}$ is the median halocentric distance of the satellites. We show that the estimator has only $s=8\%$ scatter around the median relation of the estimated and true halo masses and deviates by $<2s$ from the median during the pericentric passage of an LMC-like subhalo. This is because $\sigma^2_{\rm 3D}$ and $r_{\rm med}$ deviate in opposite directions during such passages. We apply the estimator to the MW satellite system and estimate the virial mass of the Milky Way of $M_{\rm 200c}=9.96\pm 1.45\times 10^{11}\, M_\odot$, in good agreement with several recent estimates using other methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry from {\it Gaia} DR3 has enabled the discovery of a sample of 3000+ binaries containing white dwarfs (WD) and main-sequence (MS) stars in relatively wide orbits, with orbital periods $P_{\rm orb} = (100-1000)$ d. This population was not predicted by binary population synthesis models before {\it Gaia} and -- if the {\it Gaia} orbits are robust -- likely requires very efficient envelope ejection during common envelope evolution (CEE). To assess the reliability of the {\it Gaia} solutions, we measured multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) of 31 WD+MS binary candidates with $P_{\rm orb} = (40-300)$ d and \texttt{AstroSpectroSB1} orbital solutions. We jointly fit the RVs and astrometry, allowing us to validate the {\it Gaia} solutions and tighten constraints on component masses. We find a high success rate for the {\it Gaia} solutions, with only 2 out of the 31 systems showing significant discrepancies between their {\it Gaia} orbital solutions and our RVs. Joint fitting of RVs and astrometry allows us to directly constrain the secondary-to-primary flux ratio $\mathcal{S}$, and we find $\mathcal{S}\lesssim 0.02$ for most objects, confirming the companions are indeed WDs. We tighten constraints on the binaries' eccentricities, finding a median $e\approx 0.1$. These eccentricities are much lower than those of normal MS+MS binaries at similar periods, but much higher than predicted for binaries formed via stable mass transfer. We present MESA single and binary evolution models to explore how the binaries may have formed. The orbits of most binaries in the sample can be produced through CEE that begins when the WD progenitor is an AGB star, corresponding to initial separations of $2-5$ au. Roughly 50\% of all post-common envelope binaries are predicted to have first interacted on the AGB, ending up in wide orbits like these systems.

          Supernova Explosions of the Lowest-Mass Massive Star Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the $^{56}$Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as $\sim$50\% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and $^{48}$Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQs) are actively accreting supermassive black holes that have strong outflows characterized by broad absorption lines in their rest-UV spectra. Variability in these absorption lines occurs over months to years depending on the source. WPVS 007, a low-redshift, low-luminosity Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) shows strong variability over shorter timescales, providing a unique opportunity to study the driving mechanism behind this variability that may mimic longer scale variability in much more massive quasars. We present the first variability study using {the} spectral synthesis code SimBAL, which provides velocity-resolved changes in physical conditions of the gas using constraints from multiple absorption lines. Overall, we find WPVS 007 to have a highly ionized outflow with a large mass-loss rate and kinetic luminosity. We determine the primary cause of the absorption-line variability in WPVS 007 to be a change in covering fraction of the continuum by the outflow. This study is the first SimBAL analysis where multiple epochs of observation were fit simultaneously, demonstrating the ability of SimBAL to use the time-domain as an additional constraint in spectral models.

 - **Abstract**
 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the horizon-scale emission around the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) favor accretion flow models with a jet component. However, this jet has not been conclusively detected. Using the "best-bet" models of Sgr A* from the EHT collaboration, we assess whether this non-detection is expected for current facilities and explore the prospects of detecting a jet with VLBI at four frequencies: 86, 115, 230, and 345 GHz. We produce synthetic image reconstructions for current and next-generation VLBI arrays at these frequencies that include the effects of interstellar scattering, optical depth, and time variability. We find that no existing VLBI arrays are expected to detect the jet in these best-bet models, consistent with observations to-date. We show that next-generation VLBI arrays at 86 and 115 GHz -- in particular, the EHT after upgrades through the ngEHT program and the ngVLA -- successfully capture the jet in our tests due to improvements in instrument sensitivity and (u,v) coverage at spatial scales critical to jet detection. These results highlight the potential of enhanced VLBI capabilities in the coming decade to reveal the crucial properties of Sgr A* and its interaction with the Galactic Center environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBHs) born from the evolution of Population III (Pop. III) stars are one of the main high-redshift targets for next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Their predicted initial mass function and lack of metals make them the ideal progenitors of black holes above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap, i.e. with a mass higher than $\approx{}134$ (241) M$_\odot$ for stars that become (do not become) chemically homogeneous during their evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of cluster dynamics on the mass function of BBHs born from Pop. III stars, by considering the main uncertainties on Pop. III star mass function, orbital properties of binary systems, star cluster's mass and disruption time. In our dynamical models, at least $\sim$5% and up to 100% BBH mergers in Pop. III star clusters have primary mass $m_1$ above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap. In contrast, only $\lesssim {} 3$% isolated BBH mergers have primary mass above the gap, unless their progenitors evolved as chemically homogeneous stars. The lack of systems with primary and/or secondary mass inside the gap defines a zone of avoidance with sharp boundaries in the primary mass - mass ratio plane. Finally, we estimate the merger rate density of BBHs and, in the most optimistic case, we find a maximum of $\mathcal{R}\approx200\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z\sim15$ for BBHs formed via dynamical capture. For comparison, the merger rate density of isolated Pop. III BBHs is $\mathcal{R}\leq{}10\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, for the same model of Pop. III star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 The convergence between astronomy and data sonification represents a significant advancement in the approach and analysis of cosmic information. By surpassing the visual exclusivity in data analysis in astronomy, innovative projects have developed software that goes beyond visual representation, transforming data into auditory and tactile displays. However, it has been evidenced that this novel technique requires specialized training, particularly for audio format data. This work describes the initial development of a platform aimed at providing training for data analysis in astronomy through sonification. The integration of these tools in astronomical education and research opens new horizons, facilitating a more inclusive and multisensory participation in the exploration of space science.

 - **Abstract**
 The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive-air-shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1~TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, $\mathcal{O}(0.1^{\circ})$ biases in highly inclined showers, as well as enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles ($> 37^{\circ}$) has improved by a factor of four at the highest energies ($> 70$~TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones, based on the resulting $\chi^{2}$ values, improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of four compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources ($E^{-2.63}$) with locations overhead to 30$^{\circ}$ zenith is comparable or less than 10\% of the Crab Nebula's flux between 2 and 50~TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic Center.

          Astrosat view of GX 339-4 during the peak of the recent outburst

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectral and timing analyses of \textit{AstroSat} observations of the Black Hole X-ray Binary GX 339-4 when the source was close the peak of the outburst in 2024. We find that both the spectral and timing variability of the source is indicative of it in its steep power law (SPL) state during the observations. We used phenomenological and physical models to understand the physics and geometry of accretion during this spectral state of the source. Spectral fits indicate the presence of an accretion disc with a temperature of $kT\sim$0.82 keV and a hot corona with a spectral index of $\sim$2.2 along with a significant contribution from iron line emission from the accretion disc. Strong QPOs were detected at $\sim$4.6 Hz in the Power Density Spectra of the source along with a harmonics feature. Time and phase lag at the QPO frequency are studied and we find a hard lag at the QPO frequency and at the same time a soft lag at the harmonic frequency. We estimate the spin of the black hole and it was found that $a = 0.99 \pm 0.003$. The height of the coronal region is estimated to be about 2.5 $R_{g}$, which is found to be similar to that observed during the previous outbursts of the source. We attempt to discuss the possible physical scenario for the observed spectral and timing features exhibited by the source.

 - **Abstract**
 The scientific study of the Solar System's minor bodies ultimately starts with a search for those bodies. This chapter presents a review of the use of machine learning techniques to find moving objects, both natural and artificial, in astronomical imagery. After a short review of the classical non-machine learning techniques that are historically used, I review the relatively nascent machine learning literature, which can broadly be summarized into three categories: streak detection, detection of moving point sources in image sequences, and detection of moving sources in shift and stack searches. In most cases, convolutional neural networks are utilized, which is the obvious choice given the imagery nature of the inputs. In this chapter I present two example networks: a Residual Network I designed which is in use in various shift and stack searches, and a convolutional neural network that was designed for prediction of source brightnesses and their uncertainties in those same shift-stacks. In discussion of the literature and example networks, I discuss various pitfalls with the use of machine learning techniques, including a discussion on the important issue of overfitting. I discuss various pitfall associated with the use of machine learning techniques, and what I consider best practices to follow in the application of machine learning to a new problem, including methods for the creation of robust training sets, validation, and training to avoid overfitting.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The abundances of the $\alpha$-elements are key for understanding the early chemical enrichment of the Galactic bulge. The elements of interest present lines in different wavelength regions, and some of them show lines only in part of the spectra. In the present work, the CNO trio, the alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, and odd-Z Na and Al are examined as measured from optical and H-band lines. Aims: The aim of this work is to carry out a detailed comparison of stellar parameters and abundances derived in the optical and near-infrared (H-band). We also inspect the best available lines for a list of bulge stars previously analyzed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) team in the H-band and by our group in the optical. This work is mainly of interest to spectroscopists. Methods: In the present work, we compared the stellar parameters and abundance results derived from APOGEE H-band spectra with optical analyses based on Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT/UVES) data for eight bulge stars. Results:We point out the most suitable wavelength region for each of the studied elements, and highlight difficulties in the derivation of stellar parameters both in the optical and H-band. The near-infrared will allow observations of a large number of stars in the near future given new instruments soon to be available. The identification of spectral lines in this spectral region and the investigation of their reliability are ongoing efforts worldwide. New instruments will also allow simultaneous observation of H-band and optical.

          Randomness and Retention: Using Weak Mean Motion Resonances to Constrain Neptune's Late-Stage Migration

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-planetesimal interactions cause a planet to migrate, manifesting as a random walk in semi-major axis. In models for Neptune's migration involving a gravitational upheaval, this planetesimal-driven migration is a side-effect of the dynamical friction required to damp Neptune's orbital eccentricitiy. This migration is noisy, potentially causing Trans Neptunian Objects (TNOs) in mean motion resonance to be lost. With Nbody simulations, we validate a previously-derived analytic model for resonance retention and determine unknown coefficients. We identify the impact of random-walk (noisy) migration on resonance retention for resonances up to fourth order lying between 39 au and 75 au. Using a population estimate for the weak 7:3 resonance from the well-characterized Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS), we rule out two cases: (1) a planetesimal disk distributed between 13.3 and 39.9 au with $\gtrsim$ 30 Earth masses in today's size distribution and $T_{\rm mig} \gtrsim$ 40Myr and (2) a top-heavy size distribution with $\gtrsim$ 2000 Pluto-sized TNOs and $T_{\rm mig} \gtrsim$ 10Myr, where $T_{\rm mig}$ is Neptune's migration timescale. We find that low-eccentricity TNOs in the heavily populated 5:2 resonance are easily lost due to noisy migration. Improved observations of the low-eccentricity region of the 5:2 resonance and of weak mean motion resonances with Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide better population estimates, allowing for comparison with our model's retention fractions and providing strong evidence for or against Neptune's random interactions with planetesimals.

 The study of the differences detected between the observed and the predicted positions of Uranus taking only the ancient planets into account led to the discovery of planet Neptune in 1846. This event remains one of the best accomplishments ever achieved in the history of Astronomy and Classical Mechanics. In this paper, we study the perturbations in the orbit of Uranus due to Neptune and its effects from a modern numerical point of view of the $N$-body problem. The effects induced by Pluto in the orbit of Neptune, as the historical search for a ninth planet in the Solar System (recently boostered again with the hypothesis of the so-called Planet Nine) back in the days was propelled by some supposed small inconsistencies in the orbit of the ice giants, are also analyzed.

          Phosphorus enrichment by ONe novae in the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have shown that [P/Fe] in the Galactic stars decreases with increasing [Fe/H] for [Fe/H] > -1 whereas it is almost subsolar for [Fe/H]< -2. These [P/Fe] trends with [Fe/H] have not been well reproduced by previous theoretical models incorporating phosphorus (P) enrichment only by core collapse supernoave. We here show, for the first time, that the trends can be naturally explained by our new models incorporating P enrichment by oxygen-neon (ONe) novae which occur at the surface of massive white dwarfs whose masses are larger than 1.25 M_sun with a metallicity-dependence rate. We also show that the observations can be better reproduced by the models by assuming that (i) the total mass of gaseous ejecta per ONe nov (M_ej) is as high as 4 * 10^{-5} M_sun and (ii) the number of such novae per unit mass (N_ONe) is as large as 0.01 at [Fe/H]~-3. The assumed M_ej is consistent with observations, and the high N_ONe is expected from recent theoretical models for ONe nova fractions. We predict that (i) [P/Fe] increases with increasing [Fe/H] for -2 < [Fe/H] < -1 and (ii) [P/Fe] and [Cl/Fe] trends with [Fe/H] are very similar with each other due to very large yields of P and Cl from ONe nova. It is thus worthwhile for future observations to assess the validity of the proposed P enrichment by ONe novae by confirming or ruling out these two predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 The imaging performance and sensitivity of an X-ray telescope when observing astrophysical sources are primarily governed by the optical design, geometrical uncertainties (figure errors, surface roughness, and mirror alignment inaccuracies), and the reflectivity properties of the X-ray reflecting mirror surface. To thoroughly evaluate the imaging performance of an X-ray telescope with an optical design similar to Wolter-1 optics, which comprises multiple shells with known geometrical uncertainties and mirror reflectivity properties, appropriate computational tools are essential. These tools are used to estimate the angular resolution and effective area for various source energies and locations and, more importantly, to assess the impact of figure errors on the telescope's imaging performance. Additionally, they can also be used to optimize optics geometry by modifying it in reference to the Wolter-1 optics, aiming to minimize the optical aberration associated with the Wolter-1 configuration. In this paper, we introduce DarsakX, a Python-based ray tracing computational tool specifically designed to estimate the imaging performance of a multi-shell X-ray telescope. DarsakX has the capability to simulate the impact of figure errors present in the axial direction of a mirror shell. The geometrical shape of the mirror shells can be defined as a combination of figure error with the base optics, such as Wolter-1 or Conical optics. Additionally, DarsakX allows the exploration of new optical designs involving two reflections similar to Wolter-1 optics but with an improved angular resolution for wide-field telescopes. Developed through an analytical approach, DarsakX ensures computational efficiency, enabling fast processing.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main goals of the NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission is the discovery of Earth-like planets around nearby M-dwarf stars. Here, we present the discovery and validation of three new short-period Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs: TOI- 5720b, TOI-6008b and TOI-6086b. We combined TESS data, ground-based multi-color light curves, ground-based optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, and Subaru/IRD RVs data to validate the planetary candidates and constrain the physical parameters of the systems. In addition, we used archival images, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation techniques to support the planetary validation. TOI-5720b is a planet with a radius of Rp=1.09 Re orbiting a nearby (23 pc) M2.5 host, with an orbital period of P=1.43 days. It has an equilibrium temperature of Teq=708 K and an incident flux of Sp=41.7 Se. TOI-6008b has a period of P=0.86 day, a radius of Rp=1.03 Re, an equilibrium temperature of Teq=707 K and an incident flux of Sp=41.5 Se. The host star (TOI-6008) is a nearby (36 pc) M5 with an effective temperature of Teff=3075 K. Based on the RV measurements collected with Subaru/IRD, we set a 3-sigma upper limit of Mp<4 M_Earth, thus ruling out a star or brown dwarf as the transiting companion. TOI-6086b orbits its nearby (31 pc) M3 host star (Teff=3200 K) every 1.39 days, and has a radius of Rp=1.18 Re, an equilibrium temperature of Teq=634 K and an incident flux of Sp=26.8 Se. Additional high precision radial velocity measurements are needed to derive the planetary masses and bulk densities, and to search for additional planets in the systems. Moreover, short-period earth-sized planets orbiting around nearby M-dwarfs are suitable targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) through transmission and emission spectroscopy, and phase curve photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct N-body simulations of black-hole-only clusters with up to $2 \cdot 10^4$ compact objects, zero natal spin and no primordial binaries as predicted by various primordial black hole (PBH) Dark Matter models. The clusters' evolution is computed using ${\tt NBODY6\!+\!+GPU}$, including the effects of the tidal field of the galaxy, the kicks of black hole mergers and orbit-averaged energy loss by gravitational radiation of binaries. We investigate clusters with four initial mass distributions, three of which attempt to model a generic PBH scenario using a lognormal mass distribution and a fourth one that can be directly linked to a monochromatic PBH scenario when accretion is considered. More specifically, we dive into the clusters' internal dynamics, describing their expansion and evaporation, along with the resultant binary black hole mergers. We also compare several simulations with and without black hole merger kicks and find modelling implications for the probability of hierarchical mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. Though the debates on the origin of QPEs have not completely settled down, more and more analyses favor the interpretation that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), one of the major targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. In this work, we extended the EMRI orbital analysis in Paper I arXiv:2401.11190 to all the known QPE sources with more than $6$ flares observed. Among all the analyzed 5 QPE sources, two distinct EMRI populations are identified: 4 EMRIs are of low orbital eccentricity (consistent with 0) which should be born in the wet EMRI formation channel, and 1 mildly eccentric EMRI (with $e= 0.25^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ at 2-$\sigma$ confidence level) is consistent with the predictions of both the dry loss-cone formation channel and the Hills mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Y Cam is classified as one of the oscillating Eclipsing Algol (oEA) systems, which feature a $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsating component alongside mass transfer phenomena. oEA systems are invaluable for probing the evolutionary processes and internal structures of binary components offering insights through their binary variations and oscillating. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of Y Cam utilizing high-quality photometric TESS data, and high-resolution ELODIE spectra. Through our analysis, we examined the radial velocity variation, performed binary modeling, and calculated the effective temperature values of binary components. The fundamental stellar parameters, such as mass and radius, were determined with an accuracy of $\sim$ $2-6$ %. Furthermore, we examined the orbital period variation to assess the amount of mass transfer using the available minima times of the system and three new minima times obtained from TESS light curves. Analyzing the pulsation structure of the system with the TESS data revealed the dominant pulsation period and amplitude of the pulsating component to be 0.066 d and 4.65 mmag, respectively. Notably, we observed frequency modulations with the orbital period's frequency, along with variations in the amplitude of the highest amplitude frequency across different orbital phases. Remarkably, the amplitude reaches its peak at phases 0.5 and 1. These findings indicate a candidate of a tidally tilted pulsator. Consequently, we investigated the evolutionary status of the binary components using MESA binary evolution models, determining the age of the system to be 3.28 $\pm$ 0.09 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. Each of the relevant reactions of solar and quiescent stellar hydrogen burning is reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.

          Bayesian Analysis of Molecular Emission and Dust Continuum of Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) probes the chemistry and dust mineralogy of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. The observed spectra are unprecedented in their detail, complicating interpretations which are mainly based on manual continuum subtraction and 0D slab models. We investigate the physical conditions under which the gas emits in protoplanetary disks. Based on MIRI spectra, we apply a full Bayesian analysis that provides the posterior distributions of dust and molecular properties. For doing so, we introduce the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG), a model describing the molecular line emission and the dust continuum simultaneously without large computational cost. The dust model is based on work by Juhasz et al. (2009, 2010). The molecular emission is based on LTE slab models, but with radial gradients in column densities and temperatures. The model is compared to observations using Bayesian analysis. We benchmark this model to a complex thermo-chemical ProDiMo model and fit the MIRI spectrum of GWLup. We find that the retrieved molecular conditions from DuCKLinG fall within the true values from ProDiMo. The column densities retrieved by Grant et al. (2023) fall within the retrieved ranges in this study for all examined molecules (CO2, H2O, HCN, and C2H2). Similar overlap is found for the temperatures with only the temperature range of HCN not including the previously found value. This discrepancy may be due to the simultaneous fitting of all molecules compared to the step-by-step fitting of the previous study. There is statistically significant evidence for radial temperature and column density gradients for H2O and CO2 compared to the constant temperature and column density assumed in the 0D slab models. Additionally, HCN and C2H2 emit from a small region with near constant conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. While Class II stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of pre-main- sequence (PMS) stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims. Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar IMF, we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of Class II disks, as well address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods. We study the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively-advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carry out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results. Gas accreting on Class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of Class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of Class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 90% success rate with only 2 min exposure time, if stars with accretion rates \dot{M} > 5e-10 Msol/yr and luminosity of L > 0.5 Lsol are selected.

 The main goal of the CRESST-III experiment is the direct detection of dark matter particles via their scattering off target nuclei in cryogenic detectors. In this work we present the results of a Silicon-On-Sapphire (SOS) detector with a mass of 0.6$\,$g and an energy threshold of (6.7$\, \pm \,$0.2)$\,$eV with a baseline energy resolution of (1.0$\, \pm \,$0.2)$\,$eV. This allowed for a calibration via the detection of single luminescence photons in the eV-range, which could be observed in CRESST for the first time. We present new exclusion limits on the spin-independent and spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross section that extend to dark matter particle masses of less than 100$\,$MeV/c$^{2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite-mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher temperatures and emission measures.

 - **Abstract**
 ExoplANETS-A is an EU Horizon-2020 project with the primary objective of establishing new knowledge on exoplanet atmospheres. Intimately related to this topic is the study of the host-stars radiative properties in order to understand the environment in which exoplanets lie. The aim of this work is to exploit archived data from space-based observatories and other public sources to produce uniform sets of stellar data that can establish new insight on the influence of the host star on the planetary atmosphere. We have compiled X-ray and UV luminosities, which affect the formation and the atmospheric properties of the planets, and stellar parameters, which impact the retrieval process of the planetary-atmosphere's properties and its errors. Our sample is formed of all transiting-exoplanet systems observed by HST or Spitzer. It includes 205 exoplanets and their 114 host-stars. We have built a catalogue with information extracted from public, online archives augmented by quantities derived by the Exoplanets-A work. With this catalogue we have implemented an online database which also includes X-ray and OHP spectra and TESS light curves. In addition, we have developed a tool, exoVOSA, which is able to fit the spectral energy distribution of exoplanets. We give an example of using the database to study the effects of the host-star high-energy emission on the exoplanet atmosphere. The sample has a planet radius valley which is located at 1.8 Earth radii, in agreement with previous studies. Multiplanet systems in our sample were used to test the photoevaporation model and we find that out of 14 systems, only one significant case poses a contradiction to it (K2-3). In summary, the exoplanet and stellar resources compiled and generated by ExoplANETS-A form a sound basis for current JWST observations and for future work in the era of Ariel.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles have a significant impact on the particle-induced background of X-ray observatories, and their flux exhibits substantial temporal variability, potentially influencing background levels. In this study, we present one-day binned high-energy reject rates derived from the Chandra-ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instruments, serving as proxies for GCR particle flux. We systematically analyze the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates and compare them with the AMS proton flux. Our analysis initially reveals robust correlations between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates when binned over 27-day intervals. However, a closer examination reveals substantial fluctuations within each 27-day bin, indicating shorter-term variability. Upon daily binning, we observe finer. temporal structures in the datasets, demonstrating the presence of recurrent variations with periods of $\sim$ 25 days and 23 days in ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively, spanning the years 2014 to 2018. Notably, during the 2016--2017 period, we additionally detect periodicities of $\sim$13.5 days and 9 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively. Intriguingly, we observe a time lag of $\sim$ 6 days between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates during the second half of 2016. This time lag is not visible before 2016 and aftern2017. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this time lag remain a subject of ongoing investigation.

          The Coupled Impacts of Atmospheric Composition and Obliquity on the Climate Dynamics of TRAPPIST-1e

 - **Abstract**
 Planets in multi-planet systems are expected to migrate inward as near-resonant chains, thus allowing them to undergo gravitational planet-planet interactions and possibly maintain a non-zero obliquity. The TRAPPIST-1 system is in such a near-resonant configuration, making it plausible that TRAPPIST-1e has a non-zero obliquity. In this work, we use the ExoCAM GCM to study the possible climates of TRAPPIST-1e at varying obliquities and atmospheric compositions. We vary obliquity from 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$ and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from 0.0004 bars (modern Earth-like) to 1 bar. We find that models with a higher obliquity are hotter overall and have a smaller day-night temperature contrast than the lower obliquity models, which is consistent with previous studies. Most significantly, the super-rotating high-altitude jet becomes sub-rotating at high obliquity, thus impacting cloud and surface temperature patterns. As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the climate of TRAPPIST-1e becomes hotter, cloudier, and less variable. From modeled thermal phase curves, we find that the impact of obliquity could potentially have observable consequences due to the effect of cloud coverage on the outgoing longwave radiation.

 In this work, we present independent determinations of cosmological parameters and new constraints on $f(T)$ cosmologies, employing two new catalogs related to HII galaxy Hubble and CMB distance priors, along with the local standard measurements, SNIa, $H(z)$ measurements, growth rate data (RSD), and BAO baselines. We found that the marginalised best-fit C.L. $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters within these cosmologies can relax the current cosmological tensions using HIIG data. This produces a larger range of admissible values for the current Hubble constant, and when all baselines are considered, the uncertainty bands for $H_0$ and the matter density parameter reduce significantly.
