 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) project, referred to as the LVM-DAP. We outline our methods for recovering both stellar and emission line components from the optical integral field spectroscopy, highlighting the developments and changes implemented to address specific challenges of the data set. The observations from the LVM project are unique because they cover a wide range of physical resolutions, from approximately 0.05 pc to 100 pc, depending on the distance to the targets. This, along with the varying number of stars sampled in each aperture (ranging from zero, just one of a few, to thousands), presents challenges in using previous spectral synthesis methods and interpreting the spectral fits. We provide a detailed explanation of how we model the stellar content and separate it from the ionized gas emission lines. To assess the accuracy of our results, we compare them with both idealized and more realistic simulations, highlighting the limitations of our methods. We find that the DAP robustly correct for stellar continuum features and recover emission line parameters (e.g. flux, equivalent width, systemtic velocity and velocity dispersion) with a precision and accuracy that fulfill the requirements of the primary goal of the analysis. In addition, the recovered stellar parameters are reliable for single stars, the recovery of integrated populations is less precise. We conclude with a description of the data products we provide, instructions for downloading and using our software, and a showcase illustrating the quality of the data and the analysis on a deep exposure taken on the Huygens region at the center of the Orion Nebula.

          Caught in the Act: Observations of the Double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo During the Disappearance of a Pulsation Mode

 - **Abstract**
 New results on the behavior of the double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo are presented. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed this star again in 2022, and an observing campaign of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) was completed after the TESS observations as a follow-up. We find that the first overtone pulsation mode in this star completely disappears during the TESS observing window. This mode reappears at the end of the TESS observations, and the AAVSO observing campaign shows that in the months that followed, the first overtone mode was not only present, but was the dominant mode of pulsation. This star, and potentially others like it, could hold the key to finally solving the mystery of the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae.

          Tidally distorted stars are triaxial pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in close binaries are tidally distorted, and this has a strong effect on their pulsation modes. We compute the mode frequencies and geometries of tidally distorted stars using perturbation theory, accounting for the effects of the Coriolis force and the coupling between different azimuthal orders $m$ of a multiplet induced by the tidal distortion. For tidally coupled dipole pressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the resulting pulsations are ``triaxial", with each of the three modes in a multiplet ``tidally tilted" to be aligned with the one of the three principal axes of the star. The observed amplitudes and phases of the dipole modes aligned orthogonal to the spin axis are modulated throughout the orbit, producing doublets in the power spectrum that are spaced by exactly twice the orbital frequency. Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex behavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification which can potentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators. Pressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to be tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the star's spin axis. We discuss applications to various types of pulsating stars, and the relationship between tidal tilting of pulsations and the ``single-sided" pulsations sometimes observed in very tidally distorted stars.

          Assessing the detection of the Yarkovsky effect using Gaia DR3 and FPR catalogues

 - **Abstract**
 The primary objective of this study was to utilize the newest Gaia FPR catalogue containing ultra-precise asteroid astrometry spanning over 66 months to detect the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational acceleration that affects the orbits of small asteroids. Moreover, this study examines close approaches of near-Earth asteroids by comparing orbits calculated using the Gaia data. We used the conventional least-squares orbit computation method available in the OrbFit software. We used the latest Gaia Focused Product Release, complemented by data from the Minor Planet Center and radar astrometry from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We fitted orbital parameters for 446 Near-Earth Asteroids, including the additional non-gravitational transverse acceleration to model the Yarkovsky effect. Furthermore, we compared the results obtained using different datasets: Gaia Focused Product Release and the previous Gaia Data Release 3. We detected a robust Yarkovsky effect in 43 NEAs. As expected, we found an improvement in the orbital elements uncertainty and in the signal-to-noise ratio of the Yarkovsky effect detections when using the current Gaia FPR with double the observing arc compared to the DR3 catalog. We also found nine additional reliable detections of the Yarkovsky effect when using the new Gaia FPR catalog. Including the Yarkovsky effect in the force model can be important to reliably estimate close approach distances of near-Earth asteroids. Several of the detected Yarkovsky drifts already have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, which is high enough for their Yarkovsky effect to be included in their reliable long-term orbital evolution, close approach, and Earth impact analysis. The final Gaia catalog may provide a much higher number of high signal-to-noise ratio detections of the Yarkovsky effect.

          The Exoplanet Edge: Planets Don't Induce Observable TTVs Faster than Half their Orbital Period

 - **Abstract**
 Transit timing variations (TTVs) are observed for exoplanets at a range of amplitudes and periods, yielding an ostensibly degenerate forest of possible explanations. We offer some clarity in this forest, showing that systems with a distant perturbing planet preferentially show TTVs with a dominant period equal to either the perturbing planet's period or half the perturbing planet's period. We demonstrate that planet induced TTVs are not expected with TTV periods below this exoplanet edge (lower period limit) and that systems with TTVs that fall below this limit likely contain additional mass in the system. We present an explanation for both of these periods, showing that both aliasing of the conjunction induced synodic period and the near $1:2$ resonance super-period and tidal effects induce TTVs at periods equal to either the perturber's orbit or half-orbit. We provide three examples of known systems for which the recovered TTV period induced by a distant perturbing planet is equal to the perturber's orbital period or half its orbital period. We then investigate $\textit{Kepler}$ two-planet systems with TTVs and identify 13 two-planet systems with TTVs below this TTV period lower limit -- thus potentially uncovering the gravitational influence of new planets and/or moons. We conclude by discussing how the exoplanet edge effects can be used to predict the presence of distance companion planets, in situations where TTVs are detected and where nearby companions can be ruled out by additional observations, such as radial velocity data.

          The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ then combines the resulting individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized (via median selection) light curve. Additionally, the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ inflates the uncertainties of each time-series data point using information from the median absolute deviation between the individually detrended light curve, propagating information into the final detrended light curve about the added uncertainty due to the correctness of the underlying models.

          Contemporaneous high-angular-resolution imaging of the AGB star W Hya in vibrationally excited H2O lines and visible polarized light with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL

 - **Abstract**
 We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with ALMA at a spatial resolution of 16 x 20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26 x 27 mas with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. ALMA's high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 6_5,2 - 7_4,3) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii), extending to ~60 mas (~2.9 stellar radii). Another H2O line (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 9_2,8 - 8_3,5) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHzH2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to ~15 km/s within 2--3 stellar radii, but outflows at up to ~8 km/s are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within ~2--3 stellar radii.

 - **Abstract**
 The Arecibo Message was a brief binary-encoded communication transmitted into space from the Arecibo Observatory on November 16, 1974, intended to demonstrate human technological prowess. In late 2018, to commemorate the 45th anniversary of this message, the Arecibo Observatory initiated the New Arecibo Message competition. Following a series of challenges, our Boriken Voyagers team was recognized as the winner of the competition in August 2020. Although the primary objective of the competition was to conceptualize rather than transmit a message, the collapse of the Arecibo Telescope in December 2020 precluded any subsequent transmission efforts. Therefore, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Arecibo Message, this paper presents the Last Arecibo Message, as originally developed for the Arecibo Telescope. If the original message says "we are a form of life reaching out to connect", our message says "we are ready to explore the universe together." The prospect of transmitting this or a similar message remains an open question.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last three decades, the ground-based technique of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has established itself as a powerful scientific discipline. About 250 very high gamma-ray sources of both galactic and extragalactic origin have been discovered, largely thanks to this technique. The study of these sources provides clues to many fundamental questions in astrophysics, astroparticle physics, cosmic ray physics and cosmology. The current generation of telescopes in operation offers solid performance. Further improvements in this technique led to the next generation large-scale instrument known as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In its final configuration, the sensitivity of CTA will be several times higher than that of the current best instruments VERITAS, H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. This article is devoted to presenting the technological developments that have shaped this technique and led to its current success.

          The effect of opacity on neutron star Type I X-ray burst quenching

 - **Abstract**
 One long standing tension between theory and observations of Type I X-ray burst is the accretion rate at which the burst disappear due to stabilization of the nuclear burning that powers them. This is observed to happen at roughly one third of the theoretical expectations. Various solutions have been proposed, the most notable of which is the addition of a yet unknown source of heat in the upper layers of the crust, below the burning envelope. In this paper we ran several simulations using the 1D code MESA to explore the impact of opacity on the threshold mass accretion rate after which the bursts disappear, finding that a higher than expected opacity in the less dense layers near the surface has a stabilizing effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km/s. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km/s, [0.1, 0.4] km/s, and [0.1, 1] km/s, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.

          The relation between the ADF and the ionized nebular mass in PNe

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we analyze the proposed relation between ADFs and ionized masses in planetary nebulae. For this, we have collected from the literature the ADFs and other parameters such as heliocentric distances, H$\beta$ luminosities, logarithmic reddening correction at H$\beta$, c(H$\beta$), electron densities and others and we calculated the ionized mass for a sample of 132 PNe, 27 of which possess a binary central star (14 are close binaries). In addition the distribution of these objects in the Galaxy is analyzed. The ionized masses were calculated considering two different electron densities, the one provided by the [S II] density sensitive lines ratio and the one provided by the [Cl III] lines ratio. No relation was found between ionized masses and ADFs for this sample, although it is confirmed than the PNe with the largest ADFs correspond in general to objects with a close binary central star, although it is important to say that about 20 percent of these objects have an ADF larger than 5 but smaller than 10. Therefore a PN having a close binary central star does not necessarily exhibit an extremely large ADF. We also have searched for possible relations between the ADFs and the stellar atmospheres, divided in H-rich and H-poor stars. No particular relation was found. Interestingly, several PNe with a [WR] H-poor CSPN present an ADF larger than 10, but so far they have not been reported as having a binary central star.

          The HI Mass Function of the Local Universe: Combining Measurements from HIPASS, ALFALFA and FASHI

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first HI mass function (HIMF) measurement for the recent FAST All Sky HI (FASHI) survey and the most complete measurements of HIMF in the local universe so far by combining the HI catalogues from HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS), Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) and FASHI surveys at redshift 0 < z < 0.05, covering 76% of the entire sky. We adopt the same methods to estimate distances, calculate sample completeness, and determine the HIMF for all three surveys. The best-fitting Schechter function for the total HIMF has a low-mass slope parameter alpha = -1.30 and a knee mass log(Ms) = 9.86 and a normalization phi_s = 0.00658. This gives the cosmic HI abundance omega_HI= 0.000454. We find that a double Schechter function with the same slope alpha better describes our HIMF, and the two different knee masses are log(Ms1) = 9.96 and log(Ms2) = 9.65. We verify that the measured HIMF is marginally affected by the choice of distance estimates. The effect of cosmic variance is significantly suppressed by combining the three surveys and it provides a unique opportunity to obtain an unbiased estimate of the HIMF in the local universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode $\sigma_e \simeq 0.30$. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to $10^3$days (possibly extending to tens of AU). This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of $\sigma_e \simeq \sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_*}$. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.

          A Non-Primordial Origin for the Widest Binaries in the Kuiper Belt

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly one-third of objects occupying the most circular, coplanar Kuiper belt orbits (the cold classical belt) are binary, and several percent of them are "ultra-wide" binaries (UWBs): 100-km-sized companions spaced by tens of thousands of km. UWBs are dynamically fragile, and their existence is thought to constrain early Solar System processes and conditions. However, we demonstrate that UWBs can instead attain their wide architectures well after the Solar System's earliest epochs, when Neptune's orbital migration implants the modern non-cold, or "dynamic", Kuiper belt population. During this implantation, cold classical belt binaries are likely to have close encounters with many planetesimals scattered across the region, which can efficiently dissociate any existing UWBs and widen a small fraction of tighter binaries into UWB-like arrangements. Thus, today's UWBs may not be primordial and cannot be used to constrain the early Solar System as directly as previously surmised.

          Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet's mass and the disk's viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk's surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planet-to-star mass ratio $q$. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and the planet is massive ($q \gtrsim 10^{-3}$). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs. Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy. Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria. Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| < 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| < 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.

 - **Abstract**
 A sharp step on a chaotic potential can enhance primordial curvature fluctuations on smaller scales to the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ to form primordial black holes (PBHs). The present study discusses an inflationary potential with a sharp step that results in the formation of PBHs in four distinct mass ranges. Also this inflationary model allows the separate consideration of observable parameters $n_s$ and $r$ on the CMB scale from the physics at small scales, where PBHs formation occur. In this work we computed the fractional abundance of PBHs ($f_{PBH}$) using the GLMS approximation of peak theory and also the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the two typical mass windows, $10^{-13}M_\odot$ and $10^{-11}M_\odot$, $f_{PBH}$ calculated using the GLMS approximation is nearly equal to 1 and that calculated via PS is of $10^{-3}$. In the other two mass windows $1M_\odot$ and $6M_\odot$, $f_{PBH}$ obtained using GLMS approximation is 0.01 and 0.001 respectively, while $f_{PBH}$ calculated via PS formalism yields $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-6}$. The results obtained via GLMS approximation are found to be consistent with observational constraints. A comparative analysis of $f_{PBH}$ obtained using the GLMS perspective and the PS formalism is also included.

 - **Abstract**
 Indirect dark matter detection methods are used to observe the products of dark matter annihilations or decays originating from astrophysical objects where large amounts of dark matter are thought to accumulate. With neutrino telescopes, an excess of neutrinos is searched for in nearby dark matter reservoirs, such as the Sun and the Galactic Centre, which could potentially produce a sizeable flux of Standard Model particles. The KM3NeT infrastructure, currently under construction, comprises the ARCA and ORCA undersea Čerenkov neutrino detectors located at two different sites in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore of Italy and France, respectively. The two detector configurations are optimised for the detection of neutrinos of different energies, enabling the search for dark matter particles with masses ranging from a few GeV/c$^2$ to hundreds of TeV/c$^2$. In this work, searches for dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with data samples taken with the first configurations of both detectors are presented. No significant excess over the expected background was found in either of the two analyses. Limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation cross section of dark matter particles are computed for five different primary annihilation channels in the Galactic Centre. For the Sun, limits on the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross sections of dark matter with nucleons are given for three annihilation channels.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the observations of a quiescent filament eruption and its deflection from the radial direction. The event occurred in the southern solar hemisphere on 2021 May 9 and was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), by the STEREO A Observatory and GONG. Part of the filament erupted in the west direction, while major part of the filament deviated towards east direction. LASCO observed a very weak CME towards the west direction where it faded quickly. Moreover, the eruption was associated with CME observed by STEREO A COR1 and COR2. Our observations provide the evidence that the filament eruption was highly non-radial in nature.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of beam chromaticity, i.e., the frequency dependence of the beam window function, on cosmological and astrophysical parameter constraints from CMB power spectrum observations. We show that for future high-resolution CMB measurements it is necessary to include a color-corrected beam for each sky component with a distinct spectral energy distribution. We introduce a formalism able to easily implement the beam chromaticity in CMB power spectrum likelihood analyses and run a case study using a Simons Observatory (SO) Large Aperture Telescope-like experimental setup and within the public SO software stack. To quantify the impact, we assume that beam chromaticity is present in simulated spectra but omitted in the likelihood analysis. We find that, for passbands of fractional width $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.2$, neglecting this effect leads to significant biases, with astrophysical foreground parameters shifting by more than $2\sigma$ and cosmological parameters by significant fractions of the error.

 We evaluate the consistency of hadronic interaction models in the CORSIKA simulation package with publicly available fluorescence telescope data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. By comparing the first few central moments of the extended air shower depth maximum distributions, as extracted from measured events, to those predicted by the best-fit inferred compositions, we derive a statistical measure of the consistency of a given hadronic model with data. To mitigate possible systematic biases, we include all primaries up to iron, compensate for the differences between the measured and simulated energy spectra of cosmic rays and account for other known systematic effects. Additionally, we study the effects of including higher central moments in the fit and project our results to larger statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 X-Ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful thermonuclear events on the surface of accreting neutron stars (NSs), which can synthesize intermediate-mass elements. Although the high surface gravity prevents an explosive ejection, a small fraction of the envelope may be ejected by radiation-driven winds. In our previous works, we have developed a non-relativistic radiative wind model and coupled it to an XRB hydrodynamic simulation. We now apply this technique to another model featuring consecutive bursts. We determine the mass-loss and chemical composition of the wind ejecta. Results show that, for a representative XRB, about $0.1\%$ of the envelope mass is ejected per burst, at an average rate of $3.9 \times 10^{-12}\,M_\odot \texttt{yr}^{-1}$. Between $66\%$ and $76\%$ of the ejecta composition is $^{60}$Ni, $^{64}$Zn, $^{68}$Ge, $^{4}$He and $^{58}$Ni. We also report on the evolution of observational quantities during the wind phase and simulate NICER observations that resemble those of 4U 1820-40.

          A Survey of Cassini Images of Spokes in Saturn's Rings: Unusual Spoke Types and Seasonal Trends

 - **Abstract**
 Spokes are localized clouds of fine particles that appear over the outer part of Saturn's B ring. Over the course of the Cassini Mission, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) obtained over 20,000 images of the outer B ring, providing the most comprehensive data set for quantifying spoke properties currently available. Consistent with prior work, we find that spokes typically appear as dark features when the lit side of the rings are viewed at low phase angles, and as bright features when the rings are viewed at high phase angles or the dark side of the rings are observed. However, we also find examples of spokes on the dark side of the rings that transition between being brighter and darker than the background ring as they move around the planet. Most interestingly, we also identify spokes that appear to be darker than the background ring near their center and brighter than the background ring near their edges. These "mixed spokes" indicate that the particle size distribution can vary spatially within a spoke. In addition, we document seasonal variations in the overall spoke activity over the course of the Cassini mission using statistics derived from lit-side imaging sequences. These statistics demonstrate that while spokes can be detected over a wide range of solar elevation angles, spoke activity increases dramatically when the Sun is within 10 degrees of the ring plane.

          Self-Excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-Period Variables: the Transition from Small-Amplitude Red Giants to Semi-Regular Variables

 - **Abstract**
 We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with OGLE observations in the period-luminosity diagram we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the period-luminosity relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.

          First spectropolarimetric observation of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 3+1

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first simultaneous X-ray spectropolarimetric observation of the bright atoll neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 3+1, performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) joint with NICER and NuSTAR. The source does not exhibit significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy band, with an upper limit of 1.3% at a 99% confidence level on the polarization degree. The observed spectra can be well described by a combination of thermal disk emission, the hard Comptonization component, and reflected photons off the accretion disk. In particular, from the broad Fe K$\alpha$ line profile, we were able to determine the inclination of the system ($i \approx 36^\circ$), which is crucial for comparing the observed polarization with theoretical models. Both the spectral and polarization properties of GX 3+1 are consistent with those of other atoll sources observed by IXPE. Therefore, we may expect a similar geometrical configuration for the accreting system and the hot Comptonizing region. The low polarization is also consistent with the low inclination of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We study vertical resonant trapping and resonant heating of orbits. These two processes both lead to the growth of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge in a typical $N$-body model. For the first time, we study this by means of the action variables and resonant angles of the actual orbits that compose the model itself. We used the resonant angle instead of the frequency ratio, which allowed us to clearly distinguish between these two processes in numerical simulations. We show that trapping and heating occur simultaneously, at least at the stage of a mature bar, that is, some orbits quickly pass through vertical resonance while at the same time, a substantial number of orbits remains trapped into this stage for a long time. Half of all bar orbits spend more than 2.5 Gyr in vertical resonance over an interval of 4 Gyr. Half of the orbits trapped into the bar over the last 3 Gyr of simulation remain captured in vertical resonance for more than 2 Gyr. We conclude that in the later stages of the bar evolution, the process of vertical trapping dominates in the ongoing process that causes the boxy/peanut shape of a bar in a typical $N$-body model. This contradicts the results of several recent works.

          A Small Brown Dwarf in an Aligned Orbit around a Young, Fully-Convective M Star

 - **Abstract**
 A star's spin-orbit angle can give us insight into a system's formation and dynamical history. In this paper, we use MAROON-X observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect to measure the projected obliquity of the LP 261-75 (also known as TOI-1779) system, focusing on the fully-convective M dwarf LP 261-75A and the transiting brown dwarf LP 261-75C. This is the first obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf orbiting an M dwarf and the seventh obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf overall. We measure a projected obliquity of $5^{+11}_{-10}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $14^{+8}_{-7}$ degrees for the system, meaning that the system is well-aligned and that the star is rotating very nearly edge-on, with an inclination of $90^o\,\pm\,11^o$. The system thus follows along with the trends observed in transiting brown dwarfs around hotter stars, which typically have low obliquities. The tendency for brown dwarfs to be aligned may point to some enhanced obliquity damping in brown dwarf systems, but there is also a possibility that the LP 261-75 system was simply formed aligned. In addition, we note that the brown dwarf's radius ($R_C\,=\,0.9$ R$_J$) is not consistent with the youth of the system or radius trends observed in other brown dwarfs, indicating that LP 261-75C may have an unusual formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Millimeter-wave refracting telescopes targeting the degree-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have recently grown to diffraction-limited apertures of over 0.5 meters. These instruments are entirely housed in vacuum cryostats to support their sub-kelvin bolometric detectors and to minimize radiative loading from thermal emission due to absorption loss in their transmissive optical elements. The large vacuum window is the only optical element in the system at ambient temperature, and therefore minimizing loss in the window is crucial for maximizing detector sensitivity. This motivates the use of low-loss polymer materials and a window as thin as practicable. However, the window must simultaneously meet the requirement to keep sufficient vacuum, and therefore must limit gas permeation and remain mechanically robust against catastrophic failure under pressure. We report on the development of extremely thin composite polyethylene window technology that meets these goals. Two windows have been deployed for two full observing seasons on the BICEP3 and BA150 CMB telescopes at the South Pole. On BICEP3, the window has demonstrated a 6% improvement in detector sensitivity.
