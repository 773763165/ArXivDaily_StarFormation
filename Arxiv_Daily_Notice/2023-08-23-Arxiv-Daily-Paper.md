 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) 210726A, localized to a galaxy at a photometric redshift of $z\sim 2.4$. While radio observations commenced $\lesssim 1~$day after the burst, no radio emission was detected until $\sim11$~days. The radio afterglow subsequently brightened by a factor of $\sim 3$ in the span of a week, followed by a rapid decay (a ``radio flare''). We find that a forward shock afterglow model cannot self-consistently describe the multi-wavelength X-ray and radio data, and underpredicts the flux of the radio flare by a factor of $\approx 5$. We find that the addition of substantial energy injection, which increases the isotropic kinetic energy of the burst by a factor of $\approx 4$, or a reverse shock from a shell collision are viable solutions to match the broad-band behavior. At $z\sim 2.4$, GRB\,210726A is among the highest redshift short GRBs discovered to date as well as the most luminous in radio and X-rays. Combining and comparing all previous radio afterglow observations of short GRBs, we find that the majority of published radio searches conclude by $\lesssim 10~$days after the burst, potentially missing these late rising, luminous radio afterglows.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Context. To directly image rocky exoplanets in reflected (polarized) light, future space- and ground-based high-contrast imagers and telescopes aim to reach extreme contrasts at close separations from the star. However, the achievable contrast will be limited by reflection-induced polarization aberrations. While polarization aberrations can be modeled numerically, such computations provide little insight into the full range of effects, their origin and characteristics, and possible ways to mitigate them. Aims. We aim to understand polarization aberrations produced by reflection off flat metallic mirrors at the fundamental level. Methods. We used polarization ray tracing to numerically compute polarization aberrations and interpret the results in terms of the polarization-dependent spatial and angular Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Federov shifts of the beam of light as described with closed-form mathematical expressions in the physics literature. Results. We find that all four beam shifts are fully reproduced by polarization ray tracing and study the origin, characteristics, sizes, and directions of the shifts. Of the four beam shifts, only the spatial Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Federov shifts are relevant for high-contrast imagers and telescopes because these shifts are visible in the focal plane and create a polarization structure in the PSF that reduces the performance of coronagraphs and the polarimetric speckle suppression close to the star. Conclusions. The beam shifts in an optical system can be mitigated by keeping the f-numbers large and angles of incidence small. Most importantly, mirror coatings should not be optimized for maximum reflectivity, but should be designed to have a retardance close to 180{\deg}. The insights from our study can be applied to improve the performance of current and future high-contrast imagers, especially those in space and on the ELTs.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid strides are currently being made in the field of artificial intelligence using Transformer-based models like Large Language Models (LLMs). The potential of these methods for creating a single, large, versatile model in astronomy has not yet been explored. In this work, we propose a framework for data-driven astronomy that uses the same core techniques and architecture as used by LLMs. Using a variety of observations and labels of stars as an example, we build a Transformer-based model and train it in a self-supervised manner with cross-survey data sets to perform a variety of inference tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that a $\textit{single}$ model can perform both discriminative and generative tasks even if the model was not trained or fine-tuned to do any specific task. For example, on the discriminative task of deriving stellar parameters from Gaia XP spectra, we achieve an accuracy of 47 K in $T_\mathrm{eff}$, 0.11 dex in $\log{g}$, and 0.07 dex in $[\mathrm{M/H}]$, outperforming an expert $\texttt{XGBoost}$ model in the same setting. But the same model can also generate XP spectra from stellar parameters, inpaint unobserved spectral regions, extract empirical stellar loci, and even determine the interstellar extinction curve. Our framework demonstrates that building and training a $\textit{single}$ foundation model without fine-tuning using data and parameters from multiple surveys to predict unmeasured observations and parameters is well within reach. Such "Large Astronomy Models" trained on large quantities of observational data will play a large role in the analysis of current and future large surveys.
#### Looking for a needle in a haystack : how to measure the length of a  stellar bar?

 - **Abstract**
 One of the challenges related to stellar bars is to determine accurately the length of the bar in a disc galaxy. In past literature, a wide variety of methods has been employed to measure the extent of a bar. However, a systematic study on determining the robustness and accuracy of different bar length estimators is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the accuracy and the correlation (if any) between different bar length measurement methods while using an $N$-body model of a barred galaxy where the bar evolves self-consistently in presence of a live dark matter halo. We investigate the temporal evolution of the bar length, using different estimators (involving isophotal analysis of de-projected surface brightness distribution and Fourier decomposition of surface density), and study their robustness and accuracy. Further attempts have been made towards determining correlation between any two of these bar length estimators used here. In presence of spirals, the bar length estimators which only consider the amplitudes of different Fourier moments (and do not take into account the phase-angle of $m=2$ Fourier moment), systematically overestimate the length of the bar. The strength dark-gaps (produced by bars) correlates strongly with the bar length in early rapid growth phase, and is only weakly anti-correlated during subsequent quiescent phase of bar evolution. However, the location of dark-gaps correlates only weakly with the bar length, hence can not be used as a robust proxy for determining the bar length. In addition, the bar length estimators, obtained using isophotal analysis of de-projected surface brightness distribution, systematically overestimate the bar length. The implications of bar length over(under)estimation in the context of determining fast/slow bars are further discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) aims to be the premier next generation large diameter (50 meter) single dish observatory capable of observations across the millimeter/submillimeter spectrum, from 30~GHz to 1~THz. AtLAST will be sited in Chile at approximately 5100 meters above sea level, high in the Atacama Desert near Llano de Chajnantor. The novel rocking-chair telescope design allows for a unprecedentedly wide field of view (FoV) of 1-2$^\circ$ diameter, a large receiver cabin housing six major instruments, and high structural stability during fast scanning operations (up to $\sim 3^\circ$ per second in azimuth). Here we describe the current status of, and expected outcomes for, the antenna design study, which will be completed in 2024.
#### The Local Value of H$_0$

 - **Abstract**
 We review the local determination of the Hubble constant, H$_0$, focusing on recent measurements of a distance ladder constructed from geometry, Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We explain in some detail the components of the ladder: (1) geometry from Milky Way parallaxes, masers in NGC 4258 and detached eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud; (2) measurements of Cepheids with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in these anchors and in the hosts of 42 SNe Ia; and (3) SNe Ia in the Hubble flow. Great attention to negating systematic uncertainties through the use of differential measurements is reviewed. A wide array of tests are discussed. The measurements provide a strong indication of a discrepancy between the local measure of H$_0$ and its value predicted by $\Lambda$CDM theory, calibrated by the cosmic microwave background ($Planck$), a decade-long challenge known as the `Hubble Tension'. We present new measurements with the James Webb Space Telescope of $>$320 Cepheids on both rungs of the distance ladder, in a SN Ia host and the geometric calibrator NGC 4258, showing reduced noise and good agreement with the same as measured with HST. This provides strong evidence that systematic errors in HST Cepheid photometry do not play a significant role in the present Hubble Tension. Future measurements are expected to refine the local determination of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between the supersonic motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) is expected to result in a bow shock that leads the LMC's gaseous disk. In this letter, we use hydrodynamic simulations of the LMC's recent infall to predict the extent of this shock and its effect on the Milky Way's (MW) CGM. The simulations clearly predict the existence of an asymmetric shock with a present day stand-off radius of $\sim6.7$ kpc and a transverse diameter of $\sim30$ kpc. Over the past 500 Myr, $\sim8\%$ of the MW's CGM in the southern hemisphere should have interacted with the shock front. This interaction may have had the effect of smoothing over inhomogeneities and increasing mixing in the MW CGM. We find observational evidence of the existence of the bow shock in recent $H\alpha$ maps of the LMC, providing a potential explanation for the envelope of ionized gas surrounding the LMC. Furthermore, the interaction of the bow shock with the MW CGM may also explain observations of ionized gas surrounding the Magellanic Stream. Using recent orbital histories of MW satellites, we find that many satellites have likely interacted with the LMC shock. Additionally, the dwarf galaxy Ret2 is currently sitting inside the shock, which may impact the interpretation of reported gamma ray excess in Ret2. This work highlights bow shocks associated with infalling satellites are an under-explored, yet potentially very important dynamical mixing process in the circumgalactic and intracluster media.

 - **Abstract**
 TU Tau (= HD 38218 = HIP 27135) is a binary system consisting of a C-N carbon star primary and an A-type secondary. We report on new photometry and spectroscopy which tracked the recent disappearance of the A-star secondary. The dimming of the A-star was gradual and irregular, with one or more brief brightenings, implying the presence of nonhomogeneities in the carbon star outflow. We also present evidence that the A-star is actively accreting s-process enriched material from the carbon star and suggest that it will therefore eventually evolve into a Barium giant. This is an important system as well because the A-type star can serve as a probe of the outer atmosphere of the carbon star.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the physical processes that trigger solar flares is paramount to help with forecasting space weather and mitigating the effects on our technological infrastructure. A previously unknown phenomenon was recently identified in solar flares: the plasma temperature, derived from soft X-ray (SXR) data, at the onset of four flares, was revealed to be in the range 10-15 MK, without evidence of gradual heating. To investigate how common the hot-onset phenomenon may be, we extend this investigation to solar flares of B1.2- X6.9 classes recorded by the X-ray Sensor (XRS) on-board the GOES-14 and GOES-15 satellites between 2010 and 2011. For this statistical study, we employed the same methodology as in recent work, where the pre-flare SXR flux of each flare is obtained manually, and the temperature and emission measure values are obtained by the flux ratio of the two GOES/XRS channels using the standard software. From 3224 events listed in the GOES flare catalog for 2010-2011, we have selected and analyzed 745 events for which the flare heliographic location was provided in the list, to investigate center-to-limb effects of the hot-onset phenomenon. Our results show that 559 out of 745 flares (75%) exhibit an onset temperature above 8.6 MK (the first quartile), with respective log10 of the emission measure values between 46.0 - 47.25 cm-3, indicating that small amounts of plasma are quickly heated to high temperatures. These results suggest that the hot-onset phenomenon is very common in solar flares.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical algorithm for predicting the [CII] emission from Herschel and Spitzer continuum images using probability density functions between the [CII] emission and continuum emission. The [CII] emission at 158 $\mu$m is a critical tracer in studying the life cycle of interstellar medium and galaxy evolution. Unfortunately, its frequency is in the far infrared (FIR), which is opaque through the troposphere and cannot be observed from the ground except for highly red-shifted sources (z $\gtrsim$ 2). Typically [CII] observations of closer regions have been carried out using suborbital or space observatories. Given the high cost of these facilities and limited time availability, it is important to have highly efficient observations/operations in terms of maximizing science returns. This requires accurate prediction of the strength of emission lines and, therefore, the time required for their observation. However, [CII] emission has been hard to predict due to a lack of strong correlations with other observables. Here we adopt a new approach to making accurate predictions of [CII] emission by relating this emission simultaneously to several tracers of dust emission in the same region. This is done using a statistical methodology utilizing probability density functions (PDFs) among [CII] emission and Spitzer IRAC and Herschel PACS/SPIRE images. Our test result toward a star-forming region, RCW 120, demonstrates that our methodology delivers high-quality predictions with less than 30\% uncertainties over 80\% of the entire observation area, which is more than sufficient to test observation feasibility and maximize science return. The {\it pickle} dump files storing the PDFs and trained neural network module are accessible upon request and will support future far-infrared missions, for example, GUSTO and FIR Probe.
#### The Closest View of a Fast Coronal Mass Ejection: How Faulty Assumptions  near Perihelion Lead to Unrealistic Interpretations of PSP/WISPR Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the closest view of a coronal mass ejection observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP)/Wide-field Imager for {Parker} Solar PRobe (WISPR) instrument on September 05, 2022, when PSP was traversing from a distance of 15.3~to~13.5~R$_\odot$ from the Sun. The CME leading edge and an arc-shaped {\emph{concave-up} structure near the core} was tracked in WISPR~field of view using the polar coordinate system, for the first time. Using the impact distance on Thomson surface, we measured average speeds of CME leading edge and concave-up structure as $\approx$2500~$\pm$~270\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and $\approx$400~$\pm$~70\,km\,s$^{-1}$ with a deceleration of $\approx$20~m~s$^{-2}$ for the later. {The use of the plane-of-sky approach yielded an unrealistic speed of more than three times of this estimate.} We also used single viewpoint STEREO/COR-2A images to fit the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the CME while incorporating the source region location from EUI of Solar Orbiter and estimated a 3D speed of $\approx$2700\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We conclude that this CME exhibits the highest speed during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25. This places it in the category of extreme speed CMEs, which account for only 0.15\% of all CMEs listed in the CDAW CME catalog.
#### Radial Distribution of Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects Points to Sun's  Formation in a Stellar Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 The Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs) are a population of trans-Neptunian bodies with semimajor axes $50< a \lesssim 1000$ au and perihelion distances $q \gtrsim 30$ au. The detached SDOs with orbits beyond the reach of Neptune (roughly $q>35$~au) are of special interest here as an important constraint on the early evolution of the outer Solar System. The semimajor axis profile of detached SDOs at 50--500~au, as characterized from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), is radially extended, but previous dynamical models of Neptune's early migration produce a relatively compact profile. This problem is most likely related to Sun's birth environment in a stellar cluster. We perform new dynamical simulations that account for cluster effects and show that the orbital distribution of SDOs can be explained if a particularly close stellar encounter occurred early on (e.g., M dwarf with the mass $\simeq 0.2$ $M_\odot$ approaching the Sun at $\simeq 200$ au). For such an encounter to happen with a reasonably high probability the Sun must have formed in a stellar cluster with $\eta T \gtrsim 10^4$ Myr pc$^{-3}$, where $\eta$ is the stellar number density and $T$ is the Sun's residence time in the cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 By analyzing data from the Gaia Space Observatory, we have obtained precise basic characteristics of the collective motion of stars in a part of our galaxy. Our research is based on a statistical analysis of the motion of $33~146~122$ selected stars at a distance $\lesssim6$ kpc from the Sun. Up to this distance, Gaia provides high statistics of stars with well-measured proper motion and parallax needed to determine the corresponding transverse velocity with sufficient precision. We obtained the velocity of the Sun $\left( U_{\odot},V_{\odot},W_{\odot}\right) =(10.5\pm1,22.5\pm3,7.5\pm0.5)$ relative to a set of nearby stars and the rotation velocity of the galaxy at different radii. For the radius of the Sun's orbit, we obtained the velocity$\ V_{0}\approx225$ km/s. We have shown that the various kinematic characteristics and distributions, which depend on the position in the galaxy, can be very well described in the studied region by a simple Monte-Carlo simulation model based on five parameters in the galactocentric reference frame. The optimal values of these parameters were determined by comparison with the data.
#### Spectral Features of the Solar Transition Region and Chromospheric Lines  at Flare Ribbons Observed with IRIS

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the spectral features of the Si IV 1402.77 \AA, C II 1334.53 \AA, and Mg II h or k lines, formed in the layers from the transition region to the chromosphere, in three two-ribbon flares (with X-, M-, and C-class) observed with IRIS. All the three lines show significant redshifts within the main flare ribbons, which mainly originate from the chromospheric condensation during the flares. The average redshift velocities of the Si IV line within the main ribbons are 56.6, 25.6, and 10.5 km s$^{-1}$ for the X-, M-, and C-class flares, respectively, which show a decreasing tendency with the flare class. The C II and Mg II lines show a similar tendency but with smaller velocities compared to the Si IV line. Additionally, the Mg II h or k line shows a blue-wing enhancement in the three flares in particular at the flare ribbon fronts, which is supposed to be caused by an upflow in the upper chromosphere due to the heating of the atmosphere. Moreover, the Mg II h or k line exhibits a central reversal at the flare ribbons, but turns to pure emission shortly after 1--4 minutes. Correspondingly, the C II line also shows a central reversal but in a smaller region. However, for the Si IV line, the central reversal is only found in the X-class flare, but not in the other two flares. As usual, the central reversal of these lines can be caused by the opacity effect. This implies that in addition to the optically thick lines (C II and Mg II lines), the Si IV line can become optically thick in a strong flare, which is likely related to the nonthermal electron beam heating.
#### The disk reverberation mapping of X-ray weak quasars: a case study of  SDSS J153913.47+395423.4

 - **Abstract**
 The widely adopted ``lamppost'' thermal reprocessing model, in which the variable UV/optical emission is a result of the accretion disk reprocessing of the highly fluctuating X-ray emission, can be tested by measuring inter-band time lags in quasars spanning a range of X-ray power. This work reports the inter-band time lag in an apparently X-ray weak quasar, SDSS J153913.47+395423.4. A significant cross-correlation with a time delay of $\sim 33$ days (observed-frame) is detected in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) $g$ and $r$ light curves of SDSS J153913.47+395423.4. The observed X-ray power seems to be too weak to account for the observed inter-band cross-correlation with time delay. Hence the X-ray weak quasar SDSS J153913.47+395423.4 is either intrinsically X-ray normal (but observationally X-ray weak), or the X-ray emission is not the only mechanism to drive UV/optical variability. In the former case, the required X-ray power is at least 19 times stronger than observed, which requires either an exceptionally anisotropic corona or Compton-thick obscuration. Alternatively, the Corona-heated Accretion disk Reprocessing (CHAR) or the EUV torus models may account for the observed time lags.
#### Quasi-periodic oscillation detected in $γ$-rays in blazar PKS  0346-27

 - **Abstract**
 We present a variability study of the blazar PKS 0346-27 from December 2018 to January 2022 in its archival $\gamma$-ray observation by Fermi-LAT. We use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the weighted wavelet transform methods in order to detect the presence of periodicity/quasi-periodicity and localize this feature in time and frequency space. The significance of the periodicity feature has been estimated using the Monte-Carlo simulation approach. We have also determined the global significance of the periodicity to test the robustness of our claim. To explore the most probable scenario, we modeled the light curve with both a straight jet and a curved jet model. We detect a periodicity feature of $\sim$ 100 days duration for the entire period of observation with a statistical significance of $3\sigma$, which amounts to a 99.7\% confidence level. The global significance of this feature is found to be 96.96\%. Based on the Akaike Information Criteria, the most probable explanation is that the observed emission is enhanced due to the helical motion of a blob within a curved jet. The origin of this QPO is very likely a region of enhanced emission moving helically inside a curved jet. This work presents strong evidence for jet curvature in the source and an independent (albeit a little serendipitous) procedure to estimate the curvature in blazar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to understand the origin and evolution of comets, one must decipher the processes that formed and processed cometary ice and dust. Cometary materials have diverse physical and chemical properties and are mixed in various ways. Laboratory experiments are capable of producing simple to complex analogues of comet-like materials, measuring their properties, and simulating the processes by which their compositions and structures may evolve. The results of laboratory experiments are essential for the interpretations of comet observations and complement theoretical models. They are also necessary for planning future missions to comets. This chapter presents an overview of past and ongoing laboratory experiments exploring how comets were formed and transformed, from the nucleus interior and surface, to the coma. Throughout these sections, the pending questions are highlighted, and the perspectives and prospects for future experiments are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results for orbital period analysis of 9 contact binaries (CBs). The photometric data analyzed in this work is collected using ARIES 1-m and 1.3-m telescopes as well as many ground and space-based photometric surveys. The precise orbital periods of the binary systems are studied using the long temporal baseline of data acquired over the last 12-15 years. The changes in the times of minimum brightness are calculated using (O-C) diagram. Out of these 9 CBs, four systems show no change in the orbital period with time while the remaining five systems show non-linear (O-C) variations with time. We derive mass transfer rates for these five CBs which suggests mass is being transferred from secondary to primary components in three systems while it is from primary to secondary components in the other two systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the physical parameters of an eclipsing binary system EPIC 211982753 derived through photometric and radial velocity data modeling. We make use of photometric data from NASA's K2 mission, ASAS-SN, and 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) while spectroscopic data have been acquired from the HERMES spectrograph at the 1.2-m Mercator telescope. The linear ephemeris for the system is updated using the K2 mission data. The synthetic light curve and radial velocity curves are generated with the help of eclipsing binary modeling package PHOEBE 1.0. The masses of primary and secondary components are determined as 1.64 $\pm$0.02 and 1.55 $\pm$0.01 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The radius for primary and secondary components are estimated as 1.73 $\pm$0.02 and 1.47 $\pm$0.02 $R_{\odot}$, respectively. The distance of the system is calculated as 238 $\pm$ 4 pc. The eclipsing binary is found to be a total eclipsing system with a high mass ratio of q=0.94.

 - **Abstract**
 The TOI-178 system consists of a nearby late K-dwarf transited by six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regime, with orbital periods between 1.9 and 20.7 days. All planets but the innermost one form a chain of Laplace resonances. Mass estimates derived from a preliminary radial velocity (RV) dataset suggest that the planetary densities do not decrease in a monotonic way with the orbital distance to the star, contrary to what one would expect based on simple formation and evolution models. To improve the characterisation of this key system and prepare for future studies (in particular with JWST), we perform a detailed photometric study based on 40 new CHEOPS visits, one new TESS sector, as well as previously published CHEOPS, TESS, and NGTS data. First we perform a global analysis of the 100 transits contained in our data to refine the transit parameters of the six planets and study their transit timing variations (TTVs). We then use our extensive dataset to place constraints on the radii and orbital periods of potential additional transiting planets in the system. Our analysis significantly refines the transit parameters of the six planets, most notably their radii, for which we now obtain relative precisions $\lesssim$3%, with the exception of the smallest planet $b$ for which the precision is 5.1%. Combined with the RV mass estimates, the measured TTVs allow us to constrain the eccentricities of planets $c$ to $g$, which are found to be all below 0.02, as expected from stability requirements. Taken alone, the TTVs also suggest a higher mass for planet $d$ than the one estimated from the RVs, which had been found to yield a surprisingly low density for this planet. However, the masses derived from the current TTV dataset are very prior-dependent and further observations, over a longer temporal baseline, are needed to deepen our understanding of this iconic planetary system.

 - **Abstract**
 VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) is the current-generation array comprising four 12-meter optical ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Its primary goal is to indirectly observe gamma-ray emissions from the most violent astrophysical sources in the universe. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have sparked interest in utilizing neural networks (NNs) to directly infer properties from IACT images. However, the current training data for these NNs is generated through computationally expensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methods. This study presents a simulation method that employs conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to synthesize additional VERITAS data to facilitate training future NNs. In this test-of-concept study, we condition the GANs on five classes of simulated camera images consisting of circular muon showers and gamma-ray shower images in the first, second, third, and fourth quadrants of the camera. Our results demonstrate that by casting training data as time series, cGANs can 1) replicate shower morphologies based on the input class vectors and 2) generalize additional signals through interpolation in both the class and latent spaces. Leveraging GPUs strength, our method can synthesize novel signals at an impressive speed, generating over $10^6$ shower events in less than a minute.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the gravitational wave frequencies of the fundamental ($f$-) and 1st pressure ($p_1$-) modes excited in the neutron star models constructed with the quark-hadron crossover (QHC) type equations of state (EOS). We find that the $f$-mode frequencies with QHC EOS basically are smaller and the $p_1$-mode frequencies with QHC EOS are larger than those with hadronic EOS, focusing on the neutron star model with a fixed mass. We also find that the universality in the $f$-mode frequencies multiplied by the stellar mass as a function of the stellar compactness or as a function of the dimensionless tidal deformability, which is derived with various hadronic EOSs, can keep even with QHC EOS. That is, using these universal relations, one cannot distinguish QHC EOS from hadronic EOSs. Instead, using the relations one can extract the stellar radii whose evolution from low to high mass neutron stars can differentiate QHC from hadronic EOSs. On the other hand, we find that the $p_1$-mode frequencies multiplied by the stellar mass with QHC EOS significantly deviate in a certain mass range from the corresponding empirical relations derived with various hadronic EOSs, with which one may distinguish QHC EOS from hadronic EOSs.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) changes CMB statistics in a nontrivial way, allowing for reconstruction of the lensing potential and the use of these reconstructed maps in determining cosmological parameters that affect the formation of intervening large-scale structures. Although in principle there are correlations between the primary CMB and the reconstructed lensing potential due to the lensing procedure itself, in practice CMB analyses treat these as negligible when combining these band powers in likelihoods. In this paper we quantify explicitly the impact on parameter constraints due to these cross-covariances between the lensed CMB and reconstructed lensing power, and we compare to the effect of including all lensing-induced non-Gaussian covariances, which have previously shown to impact parameter constraints on the order of 10%. We perform our analysis for a range of experimental setups, scanning over instrumental noise levels of 0.5 to 10.0 $\mu$K-arcmin in temperature assuming fully polarized detectors, and using a fixed beam size of 1.4 arcmin. When the correlations between the lensed CMB and lensing power are neglected, we find that forecasted constraints shift by at most 3% of the error bar for a 6-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model, and for the noise levels considered in this paper. For some of the $\Lambda$CDM extensions considered here, however, these correlations have a nontrivial impact, in some cases more than 10% of the error bar, even for current experimental noise levels.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of gravitational lensing over 1500 deg$^2$ of the Southern sky using SPT-3G temperature data at 95 and 150 GHz taken in 2018. The lensing amplitude relative to a fiducial Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is found to be $1.020\pm0.060$, excluding instrumental and astrophysical systematic uncertainties. We conduct extensive systematic and null tests to check the robustness of the lensing measurements, and report a minimum-variance combined lensing power spectrum over angular multipoles of $50<L<2000$, which we use to constrain cosmological models. When analyzed alone and jointly with primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra within the $\Lambda$CDM model, our lensing amplitude measurements are consistent with measurements from SPT-SZ, SPTpol, ACT, and Planck. Incorporating loose priors on the baryon density and other parameters including uncertainties on a foreground bias template, we obtain a $1\sigma$ constraint on $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.25}=0.595 \pm 0.026$ using the SPT-3G 2018 lensing data alone, where $\sigma_8$ is a common measure of the amplitude of structure today and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ is the matter density parameter. Combining SPT-3G 2018 lensing measurements with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, we derive parameter constraints of $\sigma_8 = 0.810 \pm 0.033$, $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}= 0.836 \pm 0.039$, and Hubble constant $H_0 =68.8^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Using CMB anisotropy and lensing measurements from SPT-3G only, we provide independent constraints on the spatial curvature of $\Omega_{K} = 0.014^{+0.023}_{-0.026}$ (95% C.L.) and the dark energy density of $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.722^{+0.031}_{-0.026}$ (68% C.L.). When combining SPT-3G lensing data with SPT-3G CMB anisotropy and BAO data, we find an upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of $\sum m_{\nu}< 0.30$ eV (95% C.L.).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the the structure of the Local Group flocculent spiral galaxy M33, as measured using the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey. Leveraging the multiwavelength coverage of PHATTER, we find that the oldest populations are dominated by a smooth exponential disk with two distinct spiral arms and a classical central bar $-$ completely distinct from what is seen in broadband optical imaging, and the first-ever confirmation of a bar in M33. We estimate a bar extent of $\sim$1 kpc. The two spiral arms are asymmetric in orientation and strength, and likely represent the innermost impact of the recent tidal interaction responsible for M33's warp at larger scales. The flocculent multi-armed morphology for which M33 is known is only visible in the young upper main sequence population, which closely tracks the morphology of the ISM. We investigate the stability of M33's disk, finding $Q{\sim}1$ over the majority of the disk. We fit multiple components to the old stellar density distribution and find that, when considering recent stellar kinematics, M33's bulk structure favors the inclusion of an accreted halo component, modeled as a broken power-law. The best-fit halo model has an outer power-law index of $-$3 and accurately describes observational evidence of M33's stellar halo from both resolved stellar spectroscopy in the disk and its stellar populations at large radius. Integrating this profile yields a total halo stellar mass of ${\sim}5{\times}10^8\ M_{\odot}$, giving a total stellar halo mass fraction of 16%, most of which resides in the innermost 2.5 kpc.
