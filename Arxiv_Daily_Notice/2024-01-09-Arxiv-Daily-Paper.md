 - **Abstract**
 We aim to investigate the nature of time-variable X-ray sources detected in the {\it XMM-Newton} serendipitous survey. The X-ray light curves of objects in the {\it XMM-Newton} serendipitous survey were searched for variability and coincident serendipitous sources observed by {\it Chandra} were also investigated. Subsequent infrared spectroscopy of the counterparts to the X-ray objects that were identified using UKIDSS was carried out using {\it ISAAC} on the VLT. We found that the object 4XMM~J182531.5--144036 detected in the {\it XMM-Newton} serendipitous survey in April 2008 was also detected by {\it Chandra} as CXOU~J182531.4--144036 in July 2004. Both observations reveal a hard X-ray source displaying a coherent X-ray pulsation at a period of 781~s. The source position is coincident with a $K=14$ mag infrared object whose spectrum exhibits strong HeI and Br$\gamma$ emission lines and an infrared excess above that of early B-type dwarf or giant stars. We conclude that 4XMM~J182531.5--144036 is a Be/X-ray binary pulsar exhibiting persistent X-ray emission and is likely in a long period, low eccentricity orbit, similar to X Per.

 - **Abstract**
 Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) display chemical enrichment in a phenomenon called multiple stellar populations (MSPs). While the enrichment mechanism is not fully understood, there is a correlation between a cluster's mass and the fraction of enriched stars found therein. However, present-day GC masses are often smaller than their masses at the time of formation due to dynamical mass loss. In this work, we explore the relationship between mass and MSPs using the stellar stream 300S. We present the chemical abundances of eight red giant branch member stars in 300S with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/MIKE. We identify one enriched star characteristic of MSPs and no detectable metallicity dispersion, confirming that the progenitor of 300S was a globular cluster. The fraction of enriched stars (12.5\%) observed in our 300S stars is less than the 50\% of stars found enriched in Milky Way GCs of comparable present-day mass ($\sim10^{4.5}$\msun). We calculate the mass of 300S's progenitor and compare it to the initial masses of intact GCs, finding that 300S aligns well with the trend between the system mass at formation and enrichment. 300S's progenitor may straddle the critical mass threshold for the formation of MSPs and can therefore serve as a benchmark for the stellar enrichment process. Additionally, we identify a CH star, with high abundances of \textit{s}-process elements, probably accreted from a binary companion. The rarity of such binaries in intact GCs may imply stellar streams permit the survival of binaries that would otherwise be disrupted.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains an enduring mystery, with leading explanations being annihilating dark matter or an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars. Analyzing the morphology of the GCE provides critical clues to identify its exact origin. We investigate the robustness of the inferred GCE morphology against the effects of masking, an important step in the analysis where the gamma-ray emission from point sources and the galactic disk are excluded. Using different masks constructed from Fermi point source catalogs and a wavelet method, we find that the GCE morphology, particularly its ellipticity and cuspiness, is relatively independent of the choice of mask for energies above 2-3 GeV. The GCE morphology systematically favors an approximately spherical shape, as expected for dark matter annihilation. Compared to various stellar bulge profiles, a spherical dark matter annihilation profile better fits the data across different masks and galactic diffuse emission backgrounds, except for the stellar bulge profile from Coleman et al. (2020), which provides a similar fit to the data. Modeling the GCE with two components, one from dark matter annihilation and one tracing the Coleman Bulge, we find this two-component model outperforms any single component or combinations of dark matter annihilation and other stellar bulge profiles. Uncertainty remains about the exact fraction contributed by each component across different background models and masks. However, when the Coleman Bulge dominates, its corresponding spectrum lacks characteristics typically associated with millisecond pulsars, suggesting that it mostly models the emission from other sources instead of the GCE that is still present and spherically symmetric.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars formed with initial mass over 50 Msun are very rare today, but they are thought to be more common in the early universe. The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early followup of SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early universe. J0931+0038 has relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.13) but an extreme odd-even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass > 50 Msun, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions. Though rare, more examples of unusual early nucleosynthesis in metal-poor stars should be found in upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Henize 2-10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a $\sim10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central $\sim100$ pc of the galaxy. Here we present ALMA continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1-0, 3-2), HCN (1-0, 3-2), and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0, 3-2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating cm-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to~340 GHz with a spectral index of $\alpha\approx-0.5$. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is $\approx130~{\rm pc}\times30$ pc and the molecular gas mass is $\sim10^{6}~M_{\odot}$. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially-resolved line ratio between CO J=3-2 and J=1-0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores core-collapse supernovae as crucial targets for neutrino telescopes, addressing uncertainties in their simulation results. We comprehensively analyze eighteen modern simulations and discriminate among supernova models using realistic detectors and interactions. A significant correlation between the total neutrino energy and cumulative counts, driven by massive lepton neutrinos and oscillations, is identified, particularly noticeable with the DUNE detector. Bayesian techniques indicate strong potential for model differentiation during a Galactic supernova event, with HK excelling in distinguishing models based on equation of state, progenitor mass, and mixing scheme.

 More than 36 years have passed since the discovery of the infrared excess from circumstellar dust orbiting the white dwarf G29-38, which at 17.5 pc it is the nearest and brightest of its class. The precise morphology of the orbiting dust remains only marginally constrained by existing data, subject to model-dependent inferences, and thus fundamental questions of its dynamical origin and evolution persist. This study presents a means to constrain the geometric distribution of the emitting dust using stellar pulsations measured at optical wavelengths as a variable illumination source of the dust, which re-radiates primarily in the infrared. By combining optical photometry from the Whole Earth Telescope with 0.7-2.5 micron spectroscopy obtained with SpeX at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, we detect luminosity variations at all observed wavelengths, with variations at most wavelengths corresponding to the behavior of the pulsating stellar photosphere, but towards the longest wavelengths the light curves probe the corresponding time-variability of the circumstellar dust. In addition to developing methodology, we find pulsation amplitudes decrease with increasing wavelength for principal pulsation modes, yet increase beyond approximately 2 microns for nonlinear combination frequencies. We interpret these results as combination modes deriving from principal modes of identical l values and discuss the implications for the morphology of the warm dust. We also draw attention to some discrepancies between our findings and theoretical expectations for the results of the non-linearity imposed by the surface convection zone on mode--mode interactions and on the behavior of the first harmonic of the highest-amplitude pulsation mode.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar deformations play a significant role in the dynamical evolution of stars in binary systems, impacting the tidal dissipation and the outcomes of mass transfer processes. The prevalent method for modelling the deformations and tidal interactions of celestial bodies solely relies on the perturbative approach, which assumes that stellar deformations are minor perturbations to the spherical symmetry. An observable consequence of stellar deformations is the apsidal motion in eccentric systems. Our objective is to assert the reliability of the perturbative approach when applied to close and strongly deformed binary systems. We have developed a non-perturbative 3D modelling method designed to account for high stellar deformations to explore the limitations of the perturbative models. Our research highlights that the perturbative model becomes imprecise and underestimates the tidal force and rate of apsidal motion at a short orbital separation. This discrepancy primarily results from the first-order treatment in the perturbative approach, and cannot be rectified using straightforward mathematical corrections due to the strong non-linearity and numerous parameters of the problem. We have determined that our methodology affects the modelling of approximately 42% of observed binary systems with measured apsidal motion, introducing a discrepancy greater than 2% when the normalised orbital separation verifies q^(-1/5)a(1-e^2)/R1 < 6.5. The perturbative approach underestimates tidal interactions between bodies up to ~40% for close low-mass binaries. All the subsequent modelling is impacted by our findings, in particular, the tidal dissipation is significantly underestimated. As a result, all binary stellar models are imprecise when applied to systems with a low orbital separation, and the outcomes of these models are also affected by these inaccuracies.
#### Chondrule survivability in the solar nebula

 - **Abstract**
 The lifetime of mm size dust grains, such as chondrules, in the nominal solar nebula model is limited to $\sim 10^{5}$ yr due to an inward drift driven by gas drag. However, isotopic and petrological studies on primitive meteorites indicate a discrepancy of $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ yr between the formation time of chondrules and that of chondritic parent bodies. Therefore chondrules should survive for $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ yr in the solar nebula against the inward drift without subsequent growth (i.e., planetesimal formation). Here we investigate the conditions of the solar nebula that are suitable for the long lifetime of chondrule-sized dust particles. We take the turbulent strength, the radial pressure gradient force, and the disk metallicity of the solar nebula as free parameters. For 1 mm-radius-chondrules to survive and keep their size for $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ yr, the suitable condition is a weak turbulence ($\alpha \sim 10^{-6}$), a flat radial profile ($\eta \lesssim 10^{-3}$), and a high metallicity ($Z\sim 0.1$). This condition is qualitatively consistent with the characteristics of protoplanetary disks suggested by recent observations. We eventually propose that planetesimal formation may be induced by the disk evolution, e.g., the inside-out dispersal of the gas component due to the disk wind.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of high-resolution spectra of RS Canum Venaticorum (RS CVn), a prototype of active binary systems. Our data were obtained from 1998 to 2017 using different telescopes. We analyze the chromospheric activity indicators Ca II IRT, H$_{\alpha}$, Na I D$_{1}$, D$_{2}$ doublet, He I D$_{3}$, and H$_{\beta}$ using a spectral subtraction technique. The chromospheric emission stems mainly from the K2 IV primary star, while the F5 V secondary star only shows weak emission features in a few of our spectra. We find excess absorption features in the subtracted H$_{\alpha}$ lines and other activity indicators from spectra taken near primary eclipse, which we ascribe to prominence-like material associated with the primary star. We estimate size limits of these tentative prominences based on the geometry of the binary system, and investigate the physical properties of the strongest prominence. An optical flare, characterized by He I D$_{3}$ line emission, together with stronger emission in other activity lines, was detected. The flare energy is roughly comparable to strong flares observed on other RS CVn-type stars. The chromospherically active longitudes of RS CVn most frequently appear near the two quadratures of the system and display changes between observing runs, which indicates an ongoing evolution of its active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 It is currently unknown how matter behaves at the extreme densities found within the cores of neutron stars. Measurements of the neutron star equation of state probe nuclear physics that is otherwise inaccessible in a laboratory setting. Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers encode details about this physics, allowing the equation of state to be inferred. Planned third-generation gravitational-wave observatories, having vastly improved sensitivity, are expected to provide tight constraints on the neutron star equation of state. We combine simulated observations of binary neutron star mergers by the third-generation observatories Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope to determine future constraints on the equation of state across a plausible neutron star mass range. In one year of operation, a network consisting of one Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope is expected to detect $\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ binary neutron star mergers. By considering only the 75 loudest events, we show that such a network will be able to constrain the neutron star radius to at least $\lesssim 200$ m (90% credibility) in the mass range $1-1.97$ $M_{\odot}$ -- about ten times better than current constraints from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and NICER. The constraint is $\lesssim 75$ m (90% credibility) near $1.4-1.6$ $M_{\odot}$ where we assume the the binary neutron star mass distribution is peaked. This constraint is driven primarily from the loudest $\sim 20$ events.
#### Stability of Hydrides in Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Thick Hydrogen-Rich  Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Many sub-Neptune exoplanets have been believed to be composed of a thick hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and a high-temperature heavier-element-dominant core. From an assumption that there is no chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicates/metals at the atmosphere-interior boundary, the cores of sub-Neptunes have been modeled with molten silicates and metals (magma) in previous studies. In large sub-Neptunes, pressure at the atmosphere-magma boundary can reach tens of gigapascals where hydrogen is a dense liquid. A recent experiment showed that hydrogen can induce the reduction of Fe$^{2+}$ in (Mg,Fe)O to Fe$^0$ metal at the pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the atmosphere-interior boundary. However, it is unclear if Mg, one of the abundant heavy elements in the planetary interiors, remains oxidized or can be reduced by H. Our experiments in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell found that heating of MgO + Fe to 3500-4900 K (close to or above their melting temperatures) in a H medium leads to the formation of Mg$_2$FeH$_6$ and H$_2$O at 8-13 GPa. At 26-29 GPa, the behavior of the system changes, and Mg-H in an H fluid and H$_2$O were detected with separate FeH$_x$. The observations indicate the dissociation of the Mg-O bond by H and subsequent production of hydride and water. Therefore, the atmosphere-magma interaction can lead to a fundamentally different mineralogy for sub-Neptune exoplanets compared with rocky planets. The change in the chemical reaction at the higher pressures can also affect the size demographics (i.e., "radius cliff") and the atmosphere chemistry of sub-Neptune exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric photochemistry on Titan continuously transforms methane and nitrogen gases into various organic compounds. This study explores the fate of these molecules when they land on Titan's surface. Our analytical exploration reveals that most simple organics found in Titan's atmosphere, including all nitriles, triple-bonded hydrocarbons, and benzene, land as solids. Only a few compounds are in the liquid phase, while only ethylene remains gaseous. For the simple organics that land as solids, we further examine their interactions with Titan's lake liquids. Utilizing principles of buoyancy, we found that flotation can be achieved via porosity-induced (25-60% porosity) or capillary force-induced buoyancy for HCN ices on ethane-rich lakes. Otherwise, these ices would sink and become lakebed sediments. By evaluating the timescale of flotation, our findings suggest that porosity-induced flotation of millimeter-sized and larger sediments is the only plausible mechanism for floating solids to explain the transient "magic islands" phenomena on Titan's lakes.

 - **Abstract**
 30$\%$--50$\%$ of the luminous pulsating red-giant stars show light variations of a longer period than the pulsation periods. Those periods are called long secondary periods (LSP). There has been debated for many years but the origin of the LSP is still unknown. To explain the LSP variations, there have been many approaches in not only observations but also theoretical studies. However, the invariance of the length of the LSPs has been investigated little. Thus, we studied the temporal variations of the period by performing the weighted wavelet-Z-transform analysis. Using the OGLE-III database, the $I$-band light curves of 6904 and 1945 LSP candidates in the Large/Small Magellanic Clouds, respectively, were analyzed. Most of our sample stars indicated that the period corresponding to the LSP was constant during the observation term. However, 101 and 44 LSP stars in the LMC and SMC, respectively, showed the signature of the temporal variations of the LSPs. There were diversities of the period modulations i.e. monotonic increase or decrease, or constant until the middle and then increase, etc. The comet-like companion is one of the possible explanations for the LSP variations, but this hypothesis cannot explain the period modulations because the LSP is determined by the orbital period.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we constrain the density of the interstellar medium (ISM) around the hadronic PeVatron candidate, supernova remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7, based on X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations. The purpose of this investigation is to understand the influence of the gaseous environment on this SNR as a proton PeVatron candidate. By modelling the self-regulated propagation of the CRs injected from the SNR, we calculate the $\gamma$-ray emission of CRs via the hadronuclear interactions with the molecular cloud and the ISM, and use the measured $\gamma$-ray flux to constrain the ISM density around the SNR. Our results support the picture that the SNR is expanding into a low-density ($n<0.05 cm^{-3}$) cavity, enabling the SNR to be a potential proton PeVatron despite that it presently is not in the very early phase.
#### Correlated spectro-polarimetric study along the Z track in XTE J1701-462  puts constraints on its coronal geometry

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In September 2022, the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 went into a new outburst. Aims. The objective of this work is to examine the evolution of the accretion geometry of XTE J1701-462 by studying the spectro-polarimetric properties along the Z track of this source. The simultaneous observations archived by the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) give us the opportunity. Methods. We present a comprehensive X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of XTE J1701-462, using simultaneous observations from IXPE, Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR. For IXPE observations, two methods are employed to measure the polarization: a model-independent measurement with PCUBE and a model-dependent polarization-spectral analysis with XSPEC. The corresponding spectra from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR are studied with two configurations that correspond to a slab-like corona and a spherical shell-like corona, respectively. Results. Significant polarization characteristics are detected in XTE J1701-462. The polarization degree shows a decreasing trend along the Z track, reducing from (4.84 $\pm$ 0.37)% to (3.76 $\pm$ 0.43)% on the horizontal branch and jumping to less than 1% on the normal branch. The simultaneous spectral analysis from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR suggests that the redistribution between the thermal and Comptonized emission could be the reason for the PD evolution along the Z track. Based on the correlated spectro-polarimetric properties, we propose that this source likely has a slab coronal geometry and the size/thickness of the corona decreases along the Z track.

 - **Abstract**
 The colliding-wind region in binary systems made of massive stars allows us to investigate various aspects of shock physics, including particle acceleration. Particle accelerators of this kind are tagged as Particle-Accelerating Colliding-Wind Binaries, and are mainly identified thanks to their synchrotron radio emission. Our objective is first to validate the idea that obtaining snapshot high-resolution radio images of massive binaries constitutes a relevant approach to unambiguously identify particle accelerators. Second, we intend to exploit these images to characterize the synchrotron emission of two specific targets, HD167971 and HD168112, known as particle accelerators. We traced the radio emission from the two targets at 1.6 GHz with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network, with an angular resolution of a few milli-arcseconds. Our measurements allowed us to obtain images for both targets. For HD167971, our observation occurs close to apastron, at an orbital phase where the synchrotron emission is minimum. For HD168112, we resolved for the very first time the synchrotron emission region. The emission region appears slightly elongated, in agreement with expectation for a colliding-wind region. In both cases the measured emission is significantly stronger than the expected thermal emission from the stellar winds, lending strong support for a non-thermal nature. Our study brings a significant contribution to the still poorly addressed question of high angular resolution radio imaging of colliding-wind binaries. We show that snapshot Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements constitute an efficient approach to investigate these objects, with promising results in terms of identification of additional particle accelerators, on top of being promising as well to reveal long period binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The Enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission is a space mission to be launched in the late 2020s that is currently in development led by China in international collaboration with European partners. Here we provide a progress report on the Czech contribution to the eXTP science. We report on our simulation results performed in Opava (Institute of Physics of the Silesian University in Opava) and Prague (Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences), where the advanced timing capabilities of the satellite have been assessed for bright X-ray binaries that contain an accreting neutron star (NS) and exhibit the quasi-periodic oscillations. Measurements of X-ray variability originating in oscillations of fluid in the innermost parts of the accretion region determined by general relativity, such as the radial or Lense-Thirring precession, can serve for sensitive tests enabling us to distinguish between the signatures of different viable dense matter equations of state. We have developed formulae describing non-geodesic oscillations of accreted fluid and their simplified practical forms that allow for an expeditious application of the universal relations determining the NS properties. These relations, along with our software tools for studying the propagation of light in strong gravity and neutron star models, can be used for precise modeling of the X-ray variability while focusing on properties of the intended Large Area Detector (LAD). We update the status of our program and set up an electronic repository that will provide simulation results and gradual updates as the mission specifications progress toward their final formulation.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged). We explore the fraction of radio loud quasars in the eHAQ+GAIA23 sample, which contains quasars from the High A(V) Quasar (HAQ) Survey, the Extended High A(V) Quasar (eHAQ) Survey, and the Gaia quasar survey. All quasars in this sample have been found using a near-infrared color selection of target candidates that have otherwise been missed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We implemented a redshift-dependent color cut in g-i to select red quasars in the sample and divided them into redshift bins, while using a nearest-neighbors algorithm to control for luminosity and redshift differences between our red quasar sample and a selected blue sample from the SDSS. Within each bin, we cross-matched the quasars to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) survey and determined the radio-detection fraction. We find similar radio-detection fractions for red and blue quasars within 1 sigma, independent of redshift. This disagrees with what has been found in the literature for red quasars in SDSS. It should be noted that the fraction of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars in red SDSS quasars is about five times lower than in our sample. BAL quasars have been observed to be more frequently radio quiet than other quasars, therefore the difference in BAL fractions could explain the difference in radio-detection fraction. The observed higher proportion of BAL quasars in our dataset relative to the SDSS sample, along with the higher rate of radio detections, indicates an association of the redness of quasars and the inherent BAL fraction within the overall quasar population. This finding highlights the need to explore the underlying factors contributing to both the redness and the frequency of BAL quasars, as they appear to be interconnected phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffusion of water molecules through mesoporous dust of amorphous carbon (a-C) is a key process in the evolution of prestellar, protostellar, and protoplanetary dust, as well as in that of comets. It also plays a role in the formation of planets. Given the absence of data on this process, we experimentally studied the isothermal diffusion of water molecules desorbing from water ice buried at the bottom of a mesoporous layer of aggregated a-C nanoparticles, a material analogous to protostellar and cometary dust. We used infrared spectroscopy to monitor diffusion in low temperature (160 to 170 K) and pressure (6 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ to 8 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ Pa) conditions. Fick's first law of diffusion allowed us to derive diffusivity values on the order of 10$^{-2}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which we linked to Knudsen diffusion. Water vapor molecular fluxes ranged from 5 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ to 3 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for thicknesses of the ice-free porous layer ranging from 60 to 1900 nm. Assimilating the layers of nanoparticles to assemblies of spheres, we attributed to this cosmic dust analog of porosity 0.80-0.90 a geometry correction factor, similar to the tortuosity factor of tubular pore systems, between 0.94 and 2.85. Applying the method to ices and refractory particles of other compositions will provides us with other useful data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRCam F187N, F200W, F405N and F410M direct imaging data of the disk surrounding SAO 206462. Previous images show a very structured disk, with a pair of spiral arms thought to be launched by one or more external perturbers. The spiral features are visible in three of the four filters, with the non-detection in F410M due to the large detector saturation radius. We detect with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.4 a companion candidate (CC1) that, if on a coplanar circular orbit, would orbit SAO 206462 at a separation of $\sim300$ au, $2.25\sigma$ away from the predicted separation for the driver of the eastern spiral. According to the BEX models, CC1 has a mass of $M_\mathrm{CC1}=0.8\pm0.3~M_\mathrm{J}$. No other companion candidates were detected. At the location predicted by simulations of both spirals generated by a single massive companion, the NIRCam data exclude objects more massive than $\sim2.2~M_\mathrm{J}$ assuming the BEX evolutionary models. In terms of temperatures, the data are sensitive to objects with $T_{\text{eff}}\sim650-850$ K, when assuming planets emit like blackbodies ($R_\mathrm{p}$ between 1 and $3 R_\mathrm{J}$). From these results, we conclude that if the spirals are driven by gas giants, these must be either cold or embedded in circumplanetary material. In addition, the NIRCam data provide tight constraints on ongoing accretion processes. In the low extinction scenario we are sensitive to mass accretion rates of the order $\dot{M}\sim10^{-9} M_\mathrm{J}$ yr$^{-1}$. Thanks to the longer wavelengths used to search for emission lines, we reach unprecedented sensitivities to processes with $\dot{M}\sim10^{-7} M_\mathrm{J}$ yr$^{-1}$ even towards highly extincted environments ($A_\mathrm{V}\approx50$~mag).
#### A new timestep criterion for N-body simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a new criterion for estimating characteristic dynamical timescales in N-body simulations. The criterion uses the second, third, and fourth derivatives of particle positions: acceleration, jerk, and snap. It can be used for choosing timesteps in integrators with adaptive step size control. For any two-body problem the criterion is guaranteed to determine the orbital period and pericenter timescale regardless of eccentricity. We discuss why our criterion is the simplest derivative-based expression for choosing adaptive timesteps with the above properties and show its superior performance over existing criteria in numerical tests. Because our criterion uses lower order derivatives, it is less susceptible to rounding errors caused by finite floating point precision. This significantly decreases the volume of phase space where an adaptive integrator fails or gets stuck due to unphysical timestep estimates. For example, our new criterion can accurately estimate timesteps for orbits around a 50m sized Solar System object located at 40AU from the coordinate origin when using double floating point precision. Previous methods where limited to objects larger than 10km. We implement our new criterion in the high order IAS15 integrator which is part of the freely available N-body package REBOUND.

 - **Abstract**
 The isolated globule B335 contains a single, low luminosity Class 0 protostar associated with a bipolar nebula and outflow system seen nearly perpendicular to its axis. We observed the innermost regions of this outflow as part of JWST/NIRCam GTO program 1187, primarily intended for wide-field slitless spectroscopy of background stars behind the globule. We find a system of expanding shock fronts with kinematic ages of only a few decades emerging symmetrically from the position of the embedded protostar, which is not directly detected at NIRCam wavelengths. The innermost and youngest of the shock fronts studied here shows strong emission from CO. The next older shock front shows less CO and the third shock front shows only H_2 emission in our data. This third and most distant of these inner shock fronts shows substantial evolution of its shape since it was last observed with high spatial resolution in 1996 with Keck/NIRC. This may be evidence of a faster internal shock catching up with a slower one and of the two shocks merging.
#### Dynamical mass of the Ophiuchus intermediate-mass stellar system S1 with  DYNAMO-VLBA

 - **Abstract**
 We report dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region, the young tight binary system S1. We combine 28 archival datasets with seven recent, proprietary VLBA observations obtained as part of the \textit{Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA} project (DYNAMO--VLBA), to constrain the astrometric and orbital parameters of the system, and recover high accuracy dynamical masses. The primary component, S1A, is found to have a mass of 4.11$\pm$0.10~M$_\odot$, significantly less than the typical value, $\sim$~6~M$_\odot$ previously reported in the literature. We show that the spectral energy distribution of S1A can be reproduced by a reddened blackbody with a temperature between roughly 14,000~K and 17,000~K. According to evolutionary models, this temperature range corresponds to stellar masses between 4~M$_\odot$ and 6~M$_\odot$ so the SED is not a priori inconsistent with the dynamical mass of S1A. The luminosity of S1 derived from SED-fitting, however, is only consistent with models for stellar masses above 5~M$_\odot$. Thus, we cannot reconcile the evolutionary models with the dynamical mass measurement of S1A: the models consistent with the location of S1A in the HR diagram correspond to masses at least 25\% higher than the dynamical mass. For the secondary component, S1B, a mass of 0.831~$\pm$~0.014~M$_\odot $ is determined, consistent with a low-mass young star. While the radio flux of S1A remains roughly constant throughout the orbit, the flux of S1B is found to be higher near the apastron.

 - **Abstract**
 The HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) Pathfinder mission aims to develop a constellation of nanosatellites to study astronomical transient sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, in the X and soft $\gamma$ energy range, exploiting a novel inorganic scintillator. This study presents the results obtained describing, with an empirical model, the unusually intense and long-lasting residual emission of the GAGG:Ce scintillating crystal after irradiating it with high energy protons (70 MeV) and ultraviolet light ($\sim$ 300 nm). From the model so derived, the consequences of this residual luminescence for the detector performance in operational conditions has been analyzed. It was demonstrated that the current generated by the residual emission peaks at 1-2 pA, thus ascertaining the complete compatibility of this detector with the HERMES Pathfinder nanosatellites.
#### Searching for Bumps in the Cosmological Road: Do Type Ia Supernovae with  Early Excesses Have Biased Hubble Residuals?

 - **Abstract**
 Flux excesses in the early time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) are predicted by multiple theoretical models and have been observed in a number of nearby SNe\,Ia over the last decade. However, the astrophysical processes that cause these excesses may affect their use as standardizable candles for cosmological parameter measurements. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for early-time excesses in SNe\,Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to study whether SNe\,Ia with these excesses yield systematically different Hubble residuals. We analyze two compilations of ZTF SN\,Ia light curves from its first year of operations: 127 high-cadence light curves from \citet{Yao19} and 305 light curves from the ZTF cosmology data release of \citet{Dhawan22}. We detect significant early-time excesses for 17 SNe\,Ia in these samples and find that the excesses have an average $g-r$ color of $0.06\pm0.09$~mag; we do not find a clear preference for blue excesses as predicted by several models. Using the SALT3 model, we measure Hubble residuals for these two samples and find that excess-having SNe\,Ia may have lower Hubble residuals (HR) after correcting for shape, color, and host-galaxy mass, at $\sim$2-3$\sigma$ significance; our baseline result is $\Delta HR = -0.056 \pm 0.026$~mag ($2.2 \sigma$). We compare the host-galaxy masses of excess-having and no-excess SNe\,Ia and find they are consistent, though at marginal significance excess-having SNe\,Ia may prefer lower-mass hosts. Additional discoveries of early excess SNe\,Ia will be a powerful way to understand potential biases in SN\,Ia cosmology and probe the physics of SN\,Ia progenitors.
