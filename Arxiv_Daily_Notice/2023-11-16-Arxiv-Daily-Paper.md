 - **Abstract**
 Water vapour atmospheres with content equivalent to the Earth's oceans, resulting from impacts or a high insolation, were found to yield a surface magma ocean. This was, however, a consequence of assuming a fully convective structure. Here we report, using a consistent climate model, that pure steam atmospheres are commonly shaped by radiative layers, making their thermal structure strongly dependent on the stellar spectrum and internal heat flow. Yhe surface cooler when an adiabatic profile is not imposed: melting Earth's crust requires an insolation several times higher than today, which will not happen during the main-sequence of the Sun. Venus' surface can solidify before the steam atmosphere escapes, which is opposite to previous works. Around the reddest stars ($T_{eff}<$3000K), surface magma oceans cannot form by stellar forcing alone, whatever the water content. These findings affect observable signatures of steam atmospheres and exoplanet mass-radius relationships, drastically changing current constraints on the water content of Trappist-1 planets. Unlike adiabatic structures, radiative-convective profiles are sensitive to opacities. New measurements of poorly constrained high-pressure opacities, in particular far from the H$_2$O absorption bands, are thus necessary to refine models of steam atmospheres, which are important stages in terrestrial planet evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The full, radio to $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles is shown to be consistent with standard strong-shock electron acceleration at the bubble edge, without ad-hoc energy cutoffs, if the ambient interstellar radiation is strong; the $\gamma$-ray cooling break should then have a microwave counterpart, undetected until now. Indeed, a broadband bubble-edge analysis uncovers a pronounced downstream dust component, which masked the anticipated $\sim35$ GHz spectral break, and the same overall radio softening consistent with Kraichnan diffusion previously reported in $\gamma$-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Some stars are known to explode at the end of their lives, called supernovae (SNe). The substantial amount of matter and energy that SNe release provides significant feedback to star formation and gas dynamics in a galaxy. SNe release a substantial amount of matter and energy to the interstellar medium, resulting in significant feedback to star formation and gas dynamics in a galaxy. While such feedback has a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution, in simulations of galaxy formation, it has only been implemented using simple {\it sub-grid models} instead of numerically solving the evolution of gas elements around SNe in detail due to a lack of resolution. We develop a method combining machine learning and Gibbs sampling to predict how a supernova (SN) affects the surrounding gas. The fidelity of our model in the thermal energy and momentum distribution outperforms the low-resolution SN simulations. Our method can replace the SN sub-grid models and help properly simulate un-resolved SN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. We find that employing our new approach reduces the necessary computational cost to $\sim$ 1 percent compared to directly resolving SN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide binaries, with separations between two stars from a few AU to more than several thousand AU, are valuable objects for various research topics in Galactic astronomy. As the number of newly reported wide binaries continues to increase, studying the chemical abundances of their component stars becomes more important. We conducted high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for six pairs of wide binary candidates using the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) at the Gemini-South telescope. One pair was excluded from the wide binary samples due to a significant difference in radial velocity between its component stars, while the remaining five pairs exhibited homogeneous properties in 3D motion and chemical composition among the pair stars. The differences in [Fe/H] ranged from 0.00 to 0.07 dex for these wide binary pairs. The abundance differences between components are comparable to the previous results from optical spectroscopy for other samples. In addition, when combining our data with literature data, it appears that the variation of abundance differences increases in wide binaries with larger separations. However, the SVO2324 and SVO3206 showed minimal differences in most elements despite their large separation, supporting the concept of multiple formation mechanisms depending on each wide binary. This study is the first approach to the chemical properties of wide binaries based on NIR spectroscopy. Our results further highlight that NIR spectroscopy is an effective tool for stellar chemical studies based on equivalent measurements of chemical abundances from the two stars in each wide binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 The most metal-poor stars (e.g. [Fe/H] $\leq-2.5$) are the ancient fossils from the early assembly epoch of our Galaxy, very likely before the formation of the thick disc. Recent studies have shown that a non-negligible fraction of them have prograde planar orbits, which makes their origin a puzzle. It has been suggested that a later-formed rotating bar could have driven these old stars from the inner Galaxy outward, and transformed their orbits to be more rotation-dominated. However, it is not clear if this mechanism can explain these stars as observed in the solar neighborhood. In this paper, we explore the possibility of this scenario by tracing these stars backwards in an axisymmetric Milky Way potential with a bar perturber. We integrate their orbits backward for 6 Gyr under two bar models: one with a constant pattern speed and another one with a decelerating speed. Our experiments show that, under the constantly-rotating bar model, the stars of interest are little affected by the bar and cannot have been shepherded from a spheroidal inner Milky Way to their current orbits. In the extreme case of a rapidly decelerating bar, some of the very metal-poor stars on planar and prograde orbits can be brought from the inner Milky Way, but $\sim90\%$ of them were nevertheless already rotation-dominated ($J_{\phi}$ $\geq$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ kpc) 6 Gyr ago. The chance of these stars having started with spheroid-like orbits with small rotation ($J_{\phi}$ $\lesssim$ 600 km s$^{-1}$ kpc) is very low ($<$ 3$\%$). We therefore conclude that, within the solar neighborhood, the bar is unlikely to have shepherded a significant fraction of inner Galaxy spheroid stars to produce the overdensity of stars on prograde, planar orbits that is observed today.
#### Evidence for a black hole in the historical X-ray transient A 1524-61  (=KY TrA)

 - **Abstract**
 We present VLT spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging and time-resolved photometry of KY TrA, the optical counterpart to the X-ray binary A 1524-61. We perform a refined astrometry of the field, yielding improved coordinates for KY TrA and the field star interloper of similar optical brightness that we locate $0.64 \pm 0.04$ arcsec SE. From the spectroscopy, we refine the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to $K_2 = 501 \pm 52$ km s$^{-1}$ by employing the correlation between this parameter and the full-width at half-maximum of the H$\alpha$ emission line. The $r$-band light curve shows an ellipsoidal-like modulation with a likely orbital period of $0.26 \pm 0.01$ d ($6.24 \pm 0.24$ h). These numbers imply a mass function $f(M_1) = 3.2 \pm 1.0$ M$_\odot$. The KY TrA de-reddened quiescent colour $(r-i)_0 = 0.27 \pm 0.08$ is consistent with a donor star of spectral type K2 or later, in case of significant accretion disc light contribution to the optical continuum. The colour allows us to place a very conservative upper limit on the companion star mass, $M_2 \leq 0.94$ M$_\odot$, and, in turn, on the binary mass ratio, $q = M_2/M_1 \leq 0.31$. By exploiting the correlation between the binary inclination and the depth of the H$\alpha$ line trough, we establish $i = 57 \pm 13$ deg. All these values lead to a compact object and donor mass of $M_1 = 5.8^{+3.0}_{-2.4}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.5 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$, respectively, thus confirming the black hole nature of the accreting object. In addition, we estimate a distance toward the system of $8.0 \pm 0.9$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar multiplicity is correlated with many stellar properties, yet multiplicity measurements have proven difficult for the M dwarfs -- the most common type of star in our galaxy -- due to their faintness and the fact that a reasonably-complete inventory of later M dwarfs did not exist until recently. We have therefore carried out the Pervasive Overview of "Kompanions" of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) survey, which made use of the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument on the 4.3-meter Lowell Discovery Telescope, along with the NN-EXPLORE Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope. The POKEMON sample is volume-limited from M0V through M9V out to 15 pc, with additional brighter targets at larger distances. In total, 1124 targets were observed. New discoveries were presented in the first paper in the series. In this second paper in the series, we present all detected companions, gauge our astrometric and photometric precision, and compare our filtered and filterless speckle observations. We find that the majority (58.9%) of the companions we detect in our speckle images are not resolved in Gaia, demonstrating the need for high-resolution imaging in addition to long-term astrometric monitoring. Additionally, we find that the majority (73.2%) of simulated stellar companions would be detectable by our speckle observations. Specifically within 100 au, we find that 70.2% of simulated companions are recovered. Finally, we discuss future directions of the POKEMON survey.

 - **Abstract**
 In April to May 2023, the superBIT telescope was lifted to the Earth's stratosphere by a helium-filled super-pressure balloon, to acquire astronomical imaging from above (99.5% of) the Earth's atmosphere. It was launched from New Zealand then, for 40 days, circumnavigated the globe five times at a latitude 40 to 50 degrees South. Attached to the telescope were four 'DRS' (Data Recovery System) capsules containing 5 TB solid state data storage, plus a GNSS receiver, Iridium transmitter, and parachute. Data from the telescope were copied to these, and two were dropped over Argentina. They drifted 61 km horizontally while they descended 32 km, but we predicted their descent vectors within 2.4 km: in this location, the discrepancy appears irreducible below 2 km because of high speed, gusty winds and local topography. The capsules then reported their own locations to within a few metres. We recovered the capsules and successfully retrieved all of superBIT's data - despite the telescope itself being later destroyed on landing.

 - **Abstract**
 Halite (NaCl mineral) has exhibited the potential to preserve microorganisms for millions of years on Earth. This mineral was also identified on Mars and in meteorites. In this study, we investigated the potential of halite crystals to protect microbial life forms on the surface of an airless body (e.g., meteorite), for instance, during a lithopanspermia process (interplanetary travel step) in the early Solar System. To investigate the effect of the radiation of the young Sun on microorganisms, we performed extensive simulation experiments by employing a synchrotron facility. We focused on two exposure conditions: vacuum (low Earth orbit, 10^{-4}Pa) and vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) radiation (range 57.6 - 124 nm, flux 7.14 W m^{-2}), with the latter representing an extreme scenario with high VUV fluxes comparable to the amount of radiation of a stellar superflare from the young Sun. The stellar VUV parameters were estimated by using the very well-studied solar analog of the young Sun, k^{1}Cet. To evaluate the protective effects of halite, we entrapped a halophilic archaeon (Haloferax volcanii) and a non-halophilic bacterium (Deinococcus radiodurans) in laboratory-grown halite. Control groups were cells entrapped in salt crystals (mixtures of different salts and NaCl) and non-trapped (naked) cells, respectively. All groups were exposed either to vacuum alone or to vacuum plus VUV. Our results demonstrate that halite can serve as protection against vacuum and VUV radiation, regardless of the type of microorganism. In addition, we found that the protection is higher than provided by crystals obtained from mixtures of salts. This extends the protective effects of halite documented in previous studies and reinforces the possibility to consider the crystals of this mineral as potential preservation structures in airless bodies or as vehicles for the interplanetary transfer of microorganisms.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an overview of the QUARKS survey, which stands for `Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures'. The QUARKS survey is observing 139 massive clumps covered by 156 pointings at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). In conjunction with data obtained from the ALMA-ATOMS survey at Band 3 ($\lambda\sim$ 3 mm), QUARKS aims to carry out an unbiased statistical investigation of massive star formation process within protoclusters down to a scale of 1000 au. This overview paper describes the observations and data reduction of the QUARKS survey, and gives a first look at an exemplar source, the mini-starburst Sgr B2(M). The wide-bandwidth (7.5 GHz) and high-angular-resolution (~0.3 arcsec) observations of the QUARKS survey allow to resolve much more compact cores than could be done by the ATOMS survey, and to detect previously unrevealed fainter filamentary structures. The spectral windows cover transitions of species including CO, SO, N$_2$D$^+$, SiO, H$_{30}\alpha$, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$CN and many other complex organic molecules, tracing gas components with different temperatures and spatial extents. QUARKS aims to deepen our understanding of several scientific topics of massive star formation, such as the mass transport within protoclusters by (hub-)filamentary structures, the existence of massive starless cores, the physical and chemical properties of dense cores within protoclusters, and the feedback from already formed high-mass young protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 Anisotropy properties -- halo spin, shape, position offset, velocity offset, and orientation -- are an important family of dark matter halo properties that indicate the level of directional variation of the internal structures of haloes. These properties reflect the dynamical state of haloes, which in turn depends on the mass assembly history. In this work, we study the evolution of anisotropy properties in response to merger activity using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We find that the response trajectories of the anisotropy properties significantly deviate from secular evolution. These trajectories have the same qualitative features and timescales across a wide range of merger and host properties. We propose explanations for the behaviour of these properties and connect their evolution to the relevant stages of merger dynamics. We measure the relevant dynamical timescales. We also explore the dependence of the strength of the response on time of merger, merger ratio, and mass of the main halo. These results provide insight into the physics of halo mergers and their effects on the statistical behaviour of halo properties. This study paves the way towards a physical understanding of scaling relations, particularly to how systematics in their scatter are connected to the mass assembly histories of haloes.
#### First Sagittarius A* Event Horizon Telescope Results. II. EHT and  Multi-wavelength Observations, Data Processing, and Calibration

 - **Abstract**
 We present Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 1.3 mm measurements of the radio source located at the position of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), collected during the 2017 April 5--11 campaign. The observations were carried out with eight facilities at six locations across the globe. Novel calibration methods are employed to account for Sgr A*'s flux variability. The majority of the 1.3 mm emission arises from horizon scales, where intrinsic structural source variability is detected on timescales of minutes to hours. The effects of interstellar scattering on the image and its variability are found to be subdominant to intrinsic source structure. The calibrated visibility amplitudes, particularly the locations of the visibility minima, are broadly consistent with a blurred ring with a diameter of $\sim$50 $\mu$as, as determined in later works in this series. Contemporaneous multi-wavelength monitoring of Sgr A* was performed at 22, 43, and 86 GHz and at near infrared and X-ray wavelengths. Several X-ray flares from Sgr A* are detected by Chandra, one at low significance jointly with Swift on 2017 April 7 and the other at higher significance jointly with NuSTAR on 2017 April 11. The brighter April 11 flare is not observed simultaneously by the EHT but is followed by a significant increase in millimeter flux variability immediately after the X-ray outburst, indicating a likely connection in the emission physics near the event horizon. We compare Sgr A*'s broadband flux during the EHT campaign to its historical spectral energy distribution and find both the quiescent and flare emission are consistent with its long-term behaviour.
#### The black widow pulsar J1641+8049 in the optical, radio and X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1641+8049 is a 2 ms black widow pulsar with the 2.2 h orbital period detected in the radio and $\gamma$-rays. We performed new phase-resolved multi-band photometry of PSR J1641+8049 using the OSIRIS instrument at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. The obtained data were analysed together with the new radio-timing observations from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), the X-ray data from the Spectrum-RG/eROSITA all-sky survey, and all available optical photometric observations. An updated timing solution based on CHIME data is presented, which accounts for secular and periodic modulations in pulse dispersion. The system parameters obtained through the light curve analysis, including the distance to the source 4.6-4.8 kpc and the orbital inclination 56-59 deg, are found to be consistent with previous studies. However, the optical flux of the source at the maximum brightness phase faded by a factor of $\sim$2 as compared to previous observations. Nevertheless, the face of the J1641+8049 companion remains one of the most heated (8000-9500 K) by a pulsar among the known black widow pulsars. We also report a new estimation on the pulsar proper motion of $\approx$2 mas yr$^{-1}$, which yields a spin down luminosity of $\approx$4.87$\times 10^{34}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ and a corresponding heating efficiency of the companion by the pulsar of 0.3-0.7. The pulsar was not detected in X-rays implying its X-ray-luminosity was <3 $\times$ 10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the date of observations.
#### Multi-wavelength variability and broadband SED modeling of BL Lac during  a bright flaring period MJD 59000-59943

 - **Abstract**
 We carried a detailed temporal and spectral study of the BL\,Lac by using the long-term \emph{Fermi}-LAT and \emph{Swift}-XRT/UVOT observations, during the period MJD\,59000-59943. The daily-binned $\gamma$-ray light curve displays a maximum flux of $1.74\pm 0.09\times 10^{-5} \rm ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ on MJD\,59868, which is the highest daily $\gamma$-ray flux observed from BL\,Lac. The $\gamma$-ray variability is characterised by power-spectral-density (PSD), r.m.s-flux relation and flux-distribution study. We find that power-law model fits the PSD with index $\sim 1$, which suggest for long memory process at work. The observed r.m.s.-flux relation exhibits a linear trend, which indicates that the $\gamma$-ray flux distribution follows a log-normal distribution. The skewness/Anderson-Darling test and histogram-fit reject the normality of flux distribution, and instead suggest that the flux distribution is log-normal distribution. The fractional-variability amplitude shows that source is more variable in X-ray band than in optical/UV/$\gamma$-ray bands. In order to obtain an insight into the underlying physical process, we extracted broadband spectra from different time periods of the lightcurve. The broadband spectra are statistically fitted with the convolved one-zone leptonic model with different forms of the particle energy distribution. We found that spectral energy distribution during different flux states can be reproduced well with the synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton and external-Compton emissions from a broken power-law electron distribution, ensuring equipartition condition. A comparison between the best fit physical parameters show that the variation in different flux-states are mostly related to increase in the bulk-Lorentz factor and spectral hardening of the particle distribution.
#### Discovery of A New Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsator in the SkyMapper DR2:  SMSS J184506.82-300804.7

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a new Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsator, SMSS J184506-300804 (SMSS-BLAP-1) in Data Release 2 of the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey. We conduct high-cadence photometric observations in the $u$ band to confirm a periodic modulation of the lightcurve. SMSS-BLAP-1 has a ~19-min pulsation period with an amplitude of 0.2 mag in u band, and is similar to the classical BLAPs found by OGLE. From spectroscopic observations with the Wide-Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope, we confirm it as a low-gravity BLAP: best-fit parameters from our spectral model grid are estimated as $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 27,000 K and $\log g$ (cm s$^{-2}$) = 4.4. Remarkably, we find evidence of a periodic signal in the residual lightcurve that could hint at a non-radial pulsation mode, and an excess of Ca II K and Na I D absorption from potential circumstellar material.

 - **Abstract**
 The post-inflationary Universe can pass through a long epoch of effective matter-dominated expansion. This era may allow for both the parametric amplification of initial fluctuations and the gravitational collapse of inflaton perturbations. We perform first-of-their-kind high-resolution simulations that span the resonant phase and the subsequent gravitational collapse of the inflaton field by seguing from a full Klein-Gordon treatment of resonance to a computationally efficient Schr\"odinger-Poisson description that accurately captures the gravitational dynamics when most quanta are nonrelativistic. We consider a representative example in which resonance generates $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ overdensities and gravitational collapse follows promptly as resonance ends. We observe the formation of solitonic cores inside inflaton halos and complex gravitational dynamics on scales of $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{m}$, greatly extending the possible scope of nonlinear post-inflationary gravitational dynamics.

 The gas giant Kepler-1658b has been inferred to be spiralling into its sub-giant F-type host star Kepler-1658a (KOI-4). The measured rate of change of its orbital period is $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}=-131^{+20}_{-22}\mathrm{ms/yr}$, which can be explained by tidal dissipation in the star if its modified tidal quality factor is as low as $Q^{\,\prime}\approx 2.50\times {10}^{4}$. We explore whether this could plausibly be consistent with theoretical predictions based on applying up-to-date tidal theory in stellar models (varying stellar mass, age, and metallicity) consistent with our newly-derived observational constraints. In most of our models matching the combined constraints on the stellar effective temperature and radius, the dissipation in the star is far too weak, capable of providing $Q^{\,\prime}\gtrsim 10^9$, hence contributing negligibly to orbital evolution. Using only constraints on the stellar radius, efficient tidal dissipation sufficient to explain observations is possible due to inertial waves in the convective envelope during the sub-giant phase, providing $Q^{\,\prime}\sim 10^4$, but this period in the evolution is very short-lived (shorter than $10^2$ yrs in our models). We show that dissipation in the planet is capable of explaining the observed $\dot{P}_\mathrm{orb}$ only if the planet rotates non-synchronously. Tidally-induced pericentre precession is a viable explanation if the periastron argument is near $3\pi/2$ and the quadrupolar Love number is above 0.26. Further observations constraining the stellar and planetary properties in this system have the exciting potential to test tidal theories in stars and planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The tremendous tidal force that is linked to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our galaxy is expected to strongly subdue star formation in its vicinity. Stars within 1" from the SMBH thus likely formed further from the SMBH and migrated to their current positions. In this study, spectroscopic observations of the star S0-6/S10, one of the closest (projected distance from the SMBH of about 0.3") late-type stars were conducted. Using metal absorption lines in the spectra of S0-6, the radial velocity of S0-6 from 2014 to 2021 was measured, and a marginal acceleration was detected, which indicated that S0-6 is close to the SMBH. The S0-6 spectra were employed to determine its stellar parameters including temperature, chemical abundances ([M/H], [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe]), and age. As suggested by the results of this study, S0-6 is very old (> ~10 Gyr) and has an origin different from that of stars born in the central pc region.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic processes in our Universe and are crucial for the understanding of the formation and chemical composition of the Universe. The precise measurement of the neutrino light curve from CCSNe is crucial to understanding the hydrodynamics and fundamental processes that drive CCSNe. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has mass-independent sensitivity within the Milky Way and some sensitivity to the higher mass CCSNe in the Large and Small Magellanic clouds. The envisaged large-scale extension of the IceCube detector, IceCube-Gen2, opens the possibility for new sensor design and trigger concepts that could increase the number of neutrinos detected from a CCSNe burst compared to IceCube. In this contribution, we study how wavelength-shifting technology can be used in IceCube-Gen2 to measure the fast modulations of the neutrino signal due to standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI).

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a catalogue of atmospheric parameters for 1,806,921 cool dwarfs from Gaia DR3 which lie within the range covered by LAMOST cool dwarf spectroscopic parameters: 3200 K < T_{eff}< 4300 K, -0.8 < [M/H] < 0.2 dex, and 4.5 <log{g} < 5.5 dex. Our values are derived based on Machine Learning models trained with multi-band photometry corrected for dust. The photometric data comprises of optical from SDSS r, i, z bands, near-infrared from 2MASS J, H, K and mid-infrared from ALLWISE W1, W2. We used both random forest and LightGBM machine learning models and found similar results from both with an error dispersion of 68 K, 0.22 dex, and 0.05 dex for T_{eff}, [M/H], and log {g}, respectively. Assessment of the relative feature importance of different photometric colors indicated W1 -- W2 as most sensitive to both T_{eff} and log{g}, with J -- H most sensitive to [M/H]. We find that our values show a good agreement with APOGEE, but are significantly different to those provided as part of Gaia DR3.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is one of the largest international astronomy organizations. We present demographic data based on surveys of its members from 2014, 2015 and 2016, during the fourth phase of SDSS (SDSS-IV). We find about half of SDSS-IV collaboration members were based in North America, a quarter in Europe, and the remainder in Asia and Central and South America. Overall, 26-36% are women (from 2014 to 2016), up to 2% report non-binary genders. 11-14% report that they are racial or ethnic minorities where they live. The fraction of women drops with seniority, and is also lower among collaboration leadership. Men in SDSS-IV were more likely to report being in a leadership role, and for the role to be funded and formally recognized. SDSS-IV collaboration members are twice as likely to have a parent with a college degree, than the general population, and are ten times more likely to have a parent with a PhD. This trend is slightly enhanced for female collaboration members. Despite this, the fraction of first generation college students (FGCS) is significant (31%). This fraction increased among collaboration members who are racial or ethnic minorities (40-50%), and decreased among women (15-25%). SDSS-IV implemented many inclusive policies and established a dedicated committee, the Committee on INclusiveness in SDSS (COINS). More than 60% of the collaboration agree that the collaboration is inclusive; however, collaboration leadership more strongly agree with this than the general membership. In this paper, we explain these results in full, including the history of inclusive efforts in SDSS-IV. We conclude with a list of suggested recommendations based on our findings, which can be used to improve equity and inclusion in large astronomical collaborations, which we argue is not only moral, but will also optimize their scientific output.

 - **Abstract**
 The proliferation of space debris in LEO has become a major concern for the space industry. With the growing interest in space exploration, the prediction of potential collisions between objects in orbit has become a crucial issue. It is estimated that, in orbit, there are millions of fragments a few millimeters in size and thousands of inoperative satellites and discarded rocket stages. Given the high speeds that these fragments can reach, even fragments a few millimeters in size can cause fractures in a satellite's hull or put a serious crack in the window of a space shuttle. The conventional method proposed by Akella and Alfriend in 2000 remains widely used to estimate the probability of collision in short-term encounters. Given the small period of time, it is assumed that, during the encounter: (1) trajectories are represented by straight lines with constant velocity; (2) there is no velocity uncertainty and the position exhibits a stationary distribution throughout the encounter; and (3) position uncertainties are independent and represented by Gaussian distributions. This study introduces a novel derivation based on first principles that naturally allows for tight and fast upper and lower bounds for the probability of collision. We tested implementations of both probability and bound computations with the original and our formulation on a real CDM dataset used in ESA's Collision Avoidance Challenge. Our approach reduces the calculation of the probability to two one-dimensional integrals and has the potential to significantly reduce the processing time compared to the traditional method, from 80% to nearly real-time.

 - **Abstract**
 The synergy between high-resolution rotational spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations is essential for exploring future detection of molecules, especially when spectroscopy parameters are not available yet. By using highly correlated ab initio quartic force fields (QFFs) from explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory, a complete set of rotational constants and centrifugal distortion constants for D$_2$CS and cis/trans-DCSD isomers have been produced. Comparing our new ab initio results for D$_2$CS with new rotational spectroscopy laboratory data for the same species, the accuracy of the computed B and C rotational constants is within 0.1% while the A constant is only slightly higher. Additionally, quantum chemical vibrational frequencies are also provided, and these spectral reference data and new experimental rotational lines will provide additional references for potential observation of these deuterated sulfur species with either ground-based radio telescopes or space-based infrared observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical undestanding of stellar convection has recently been put under doubt due to helioseismic results and global 3D convection simulations. This "convective conundrum" is manifested by much higher velocity amplitudes in simulations at large scales in comparison to helioseismic results, and the difficulty in reproducing the solar differential rotation and dynamo with global 3D simulations. Here some aspects of this conundrum are discussed from the viewpoint of hydrodynamic Cartesian 3D simulations targeted at testing the rotational influence and surface forcing on deep convection. More specifically, the dominant scale of convection and the depths of the convection zone and the weakly subadiabatic -- yet convecting -- Deardorff zone are discussed in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 We study scatter-like interactions between neutrinos and dark matter in light of different combinations of temperature, polarization and lensing data released by three independent CMB experiments - the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) - in conjunction with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We apply two different statistical methodologies. Alongside the usual marginalization technique, we cross-check all the results through a Profile Likelihood analysis. As a first step, working under the assumption of massless neutrinos, we perform a comprehensive (re-)analysis aimed at assessing the validity of some recent results hinting at a mild preference for non-vanishing interactions from small-scale CMB data. We find compelling resilience in the results already documented in the literature, confirming that interactions with a strength $u_{\nu\rm{DM}} \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ appear to be globally favored by ACT (both alone and in combination with Planck). This result is corroborated by the inclusion of additional data, such as the recent ACT-DR6 lensing likelihood, as well as by the Profile Likelihood analysis. Interestingly, a fully consistent preference for interactions emerges from SPT, as well, although it is weaker than the one obtained from ACT. As a second step, we repeat the same analysis considering neutrinos as massive particles. Despite the larger parameter space, all the hints pointing towards interactions are confirmed also in this more realistic case. In addition, we report a very mild preference for interactions in Planck+BAO alone (not found in the massless case) which aligns with small-scale data. While this latter result is not fully confirmed by the Profile Likelihood analysis, the profile distribution does confirm that interactions are not disfavoured by Planck.
