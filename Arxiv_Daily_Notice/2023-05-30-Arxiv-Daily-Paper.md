 - **Abstract**
 Convective cores are the hydrogen reservoirs of main sequence stars that are more massive than around 1.2 solar masses. The characteristics of the cores have a strong impact on the evolution and structure of the star. However, such results rely on stellar evolution codes in which simplistic assumptions are often made on the physics in the core. Indeed, the mixing is commonly considered to be instantaneous and the most basic nuclear networks assume beryllium at its equilibrium abundance. Those assumptions lead to significant differences in the central composition of the elements for which the timescale to reach nuclear equilibrium is lower than the convective timescale. In this work, we show that those discrepancies impact the nuclear energy production and therefore the size of convective cores in models computed with overshoot. We find that cores computed with instantaneous mixing are up to 30% bigger than those computed with diffusive mixing. Similar differences are found when using basic nuclear networks. Additionally, we observe an extension of the duration of the main sequence due to those core size differences. We then investigate the impact of those structural differences on the seismic modeling of solar-like oscillators. Modeling two stars observed by Kepler, we find that the overshoot parameter of the best models computed with a basic nuclear network is significantly lower compared to models computed with a full nuclear network. This work is a necessary step for a better modeling of convective cores which is key to determine accurate ages in the framework of future space missions such as Plato.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a suite of 3D hydrodynamic models of supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding against the circumstellar medium (CSM). We study the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) forming at the expansion interface by calculating an angular power spectrum for each of these models. The power spectra of young SNRs is seen to exhibit a dominant angular mode, which is a diagnostic of their ejecta density profile as found by previous studies. The steep scaling of power at smaller modes and the time evolution of the spectra is indicative of absence of a turbulent cascade. Instead, as the time evolution of the spectra suggests, they may be governed by an angular mode dependent net growth rate. We also study the impact of anisotropies in the ejecta as well as in the CSM on the power spectra of velocity and density. We confirm that perturbations in the density field (whether imposed on the ejecta or the CSM) do not influence the anisotropy of the remnant significantly unless they have a very large amplitude and form large-scale coherent structures. In any case, these clumps can only affect structures on large angular scales. The power spectra on small angular scales is completely independent of the initial clumpiness and only governed by the growth and saturation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.
#### Two-element interferometer for millimeter-wave solar flare observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a two-element interferometer working in the millimeter wave band (39.5 GHz - 40 GHz) for observing solar radio emissions through nulling interference. The system is composed of two 50 cm aperture Cassegrain antennas mounted on a common equatorial mount, with a separation of 230 wavelengths. The cross-correlation of the received signals effectively cancels the quiet solar component of the large flux density (~3000 sfu) that reduces the detection limit due to atmospheric fluctuations. The system performance is obtained as follows: the noise factor of the AFE in the observation band is less than 2.1 dB, system sensitivity is approximately 12.4 K (~34 sfu) with an integration time constant of 0.1 ms (default), the frequency resolution is 153 kHz, and the dynamic range is larger than 30 dB. Through actual testing, the nulling interferometer observes a quiet sun with a low level of output fluctuations (of up to 50 sfu) and has a significantly lower radiation flux variability (of up to 190 sfu) than an equivalent single-antenna system, even under thick cloud cover. As a result, this new design can effectively improve observation sensitivity by reducing the impact of atmospheric and system fluctuations during observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopy is an important tool for providing insights into the structure of core-collapse supernova explosions. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS to compute synthetic spectra and light curves based on a two-dimensional explosion model of an ultra-stripped supernova. These calculations are designed both to identify observable fingerprints of ultra-stripped supernovae and as a proof-of-principle for using synthetic spectroscopy to constrain the nature of stripped-envelope supernovae more broadly. We predict very characteristic spectral and photometric features for our ultra-stripped explosion model, but find that these do not match observed ultra-stripped supernova candidates like SN 2005ek. With a peak bolometric luminosity of $6.8\times10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, a peak magnitude of $-15.9\,\mathrm{mag}$ in R-band, and $\Delta m_{15,\mathrm{R}}=3.50$, the model is even fainter and evolves even faster than SN 2005ek as the closest possible analogue in photometric properties. The predicted spectra are extremely unusual. The most prominent features are Mg II lines at 2,800 Angstrom and 4,500 Angstrom and the infrared Ca triplet at late times. The Mg lines are sensitive to the multi-dimensional structure of the model and are viewing-angle dependent. They disappear due to line blanketing by Fe group elements in a spherically averaged model with additional microscopic mixing. In future studies, multi-D radiative transfer calculations need to be applied to a broader range of models to elucidate the nature of observed Type Ib/c supernovae.
#### The membership of stars, density profile and mass segregation in open  clusters using a new machine learning-based method

 - **Abstract**
 A combination of two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, DBSCAN and GMM are used to find members with a high probability of twelve open clusters, M38, NGC2099, Coma Ber, NGC752, M67, NGC2243, Alessi01, Bochum04, M34, M35, M41, and M48, based on Gaia DR3. These clusters have different ages, distances, and numbers of members which makes a suitable cover of these parameters situation to analyze this method. We have identified 752, 1725, 116, 269, 1422, 936, 43, 38, 743, 1114, 783, and 452, probable and possible members with a higher probability than 0.8 for M38, NGC2099, Coma Ber, NGC752, M67, NGC2243, Alessi01, Bochum04, M34, M35, M41, and M48, respectively. Moreover, we obtained the tidal radius, core radius, and clear evidence of mass segregation in ten clusters. From an examination of the high-quality color-magnitude data of the cluster, we obtained one white dwarf for each of NGC752, Coma Ber and M67. In the young open cluster M38, we found all members inside the tidal radius however in the older clusters we found some members outside of the tidal radius, indicating that the young open clusters had not enough time to form clear tidal tails. It is seen that mass segregation occurs at a higher rate in older clusters than the younger ones.
#### Molecular Clouds in the Galactic Plane from $l$ = [59.75$^\circ$,  74.75$^\circ$] and $b$ = [$-$5.25$^\circ$, +5.25$^\circ$]

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the distribution of molecular gas in the Milky Way Galactic plane from $l$ = [59.75, 74.75]$^{\circ}$ and $b$ = [${-}$5.25, +5.25]$^{\circ}$, using the MWISP $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO/$\rm {C}^{18}{O}$ emission line data. The molecular gas in this region can be mainly attributed to the Local spur, Local arm, Perseus arm, and Outer arm. Statistics of the physical properties of the molecular gas in each arm, such as excitation temperature, optical depth, and column density, are presented. Using the DBSCAN algorithm, we identified 15 extremely distant molecular clouds with kinematic distances of 14.72$-$17.77 kpc and masses of 363$-$520 M$_{\odot}$, which we find could be part of the Outer Scutum-Centaurus (OSC) arm identified by \cite{2011ApJ...734L..24D} and \cite{2015ApJ...798L..27S}. It is also possible that, 12 of these 15 extremely distant molecular clouds constitute an independent structure between the Outer and the OSC arms or a spur. There exist two Gaussian components in the vertical distribution of the molecular gas in the Perseus spiral arm. These two Gaussian components correspond to two giant filaments parallel to the Galactic plane. We find an upward warping of the molecular gas in the Outer spiral arm with a displacement of around 270 pc with respect to the Galactic mid-plane.
#### Nitrogen fractionation in ammonia and its insights on nitrogen chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Observations of $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ in the interstellar medium are becoming more frequent thanks to the increased telescope capabilities. However, interpreting these data is still puzzling. In particular, measurements of $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ in diazenylium revealed high levels of anti-fractionation in cold cores. Aims. Furuya & Aikawa (2018), using astrophysical simulations coupled with a gas-grain chemical code, concluded that the $^{15}$N-depletion in prestellar cores could be inherited from the initial stages, when $\rm ^{14}N^{15}N$ is selectively photodissociated and 15N atoms deplete onto the dust grain, forming ammonia ices. We aim to test this hypothesis. Methods. We targeted three sources (the prestellar core L1544, the protostellar envelope IRAS4A, and the shocked region L1157-B1) with distinct degrees of desorption or sputtering of the ammonia ices. We observed the NH3 isotopologues with the GBT, and we inferred the $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ via a spectral fitting of the observed inversion transitions. Results. $^{15}$NH3(1,1) is detected in L1544 and IRAS4A, whilst only upper limits are deduced in L1157-B1. The NH3 isotopic ratio is significantly lower towards the protostar than at the centre of L1544, where it is consistent with the elemental value. We also present the first spatially resolved map of NH3 nitrogen isotopic ratio towards L1544. Conclusions. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that ammonia ices are enriched in $^{15}$N, leading to a decrease of the $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ ratio when the ices are sublimated into the gas phase for instance due to the temperature rise in protostellar envelopes. The ammonia $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ value at the centre of L1544 is a factor of 2 lower than that of N2H+, suggesting that the dominant formation pathway is hydrogenation of N atoms on dust grains, followed by non-thermal desorption.
