 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of two detached black hole-star (BH-star) binaries from Gaia's third data release has sparkled interest in understanding the formation mechanisms of these systems. We investigate the formation of these systems by dynamical processes in young open star clusters (SCs) and via isolated binary (IB) evolution, using a combination of direct $N$-body models and population synthesis simulations. By comparing dynamical and isolated systems created using the same model of binary stellar evolution, we find that dynamical formation in SCs is nearly 40 times as efficient per unit of star formation at producing BH-star binaries compared to IB evolution. We expand this analysis to the full Milky Way (MW) using a FIRE-2 hydrodynamical simulation of a MW-mass galaxy. Even assuming that only $10\%$ of star formation produces SCs with masses $> 1000\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, we find that the MW contains $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ BH-star systems, with approximately 4 out of every 5 systems being formed dynamically. Many of these dynamically-formed systems have larger orbital periods, eccentricities, and black hole masses than their isolated counterparts. For binaries older than 100 Myr, we show that any detectable system with $e\gtrsim0.5$ or $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can only be formed through dynamical processes. Our MW model predicts between 61 and 210 such detections from the complete DR4 Gaia catalog, with the majority of systems being dynamically formed in massive and metal-rich SCs. Finally, we compare our populations to the recently discovered Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2, and conclude that the dynamical scenario is the most favorable formation pathway for both systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey (GUAPOS) project targets the hot molecular core (HMC) G31.41+0.31 (G31), to unveil the complex chemistry of one of the most chemically rich high-mass star-forming regions outside the Galactic Center (GC). In the third paper of the project, we present a study of nine O-bearing (CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_3^{18}$OH, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$COCH$_3$ , C$_2$H$_5$OH, aGg'-(CH$_2$OH)$_2$, and gGg'-(CH$_2$OH)$_2$) and six N-bearing (CH$_3$CN, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN, CH$_3^{13}$CN, C$_2$H$_3$CN, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and C$_2$H$_5^{13}$CN) complex organic molecules toward G31. The aim of this work is to characterize the abundances in one of the most chemically-rich hot molecular cores outside the GC and to search for a possible chemical segregation between O-bearing and N-bearing species in G31, which hosts four compact sources as seen with higher angular resolution data. Observations were carried out with the interferometer ALMA and covered the entire Band 3 from 84 to 116 GHz ($\sim 32$ GHz bandwidth) with an angular resolution of $1.2''$ ($\sim4400\,\mathrm{au}$). The spectrum has been analyzed with the tool SLIM of MADCUBA to determine the physical parameters of the emitting gas. Moreover, we have analyzed the morphology of the emission of the molecular species. We have compared the abundances w.r.t methanol of COMs in G31 with other twenty-seven sources, including other hot molecular cores inside and outside the Galactic Center, hot corinos, shocked regions, envelopes around young stellar objects, and quiescent molecular clouds, and with chemical models. Different species peak at slightly different positions, and this, together with the different central velocities of the lines obtained from the spectral fitting, point to chemical differentiation of selected O-bearing species.
