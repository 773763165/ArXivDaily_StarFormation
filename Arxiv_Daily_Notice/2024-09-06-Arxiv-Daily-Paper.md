#### Title:
          Cavitating bubbles in condensing gas as a means of forming clumps, chondrites, and planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 Vaporized metal, silicates, and ices on the verge of re-condensing into solid or liquid particles appear in many contexts: behind shocks, in impact ejecta, and within the atmospheres and outflows of stars, disks, planets, and minor bodies. We speculate that a condensing gas might fragment, forming overdensities within relative voids, from a radiation-condensation instability. Seeded with small thermal fluctuations, a condensible gas will exhibit spatial variations in the density of particle condensates. Regions of higher particle density may radiate more, cooling faster. Faster cooling leads to still more condensation, lowering the local pressure. Regions undergoing runaway condensation may collapse under the pressure of their less condensed surroundings. Particle condensates will compactify with collapsing regions, into overdense clumps or macroscopic solids (planetesimals). As a first step toward realizing this hypothetical instability, we calculate the evolution of a small volume of condensing silicate vapor -- a spherical test "bubble" embedded in a background medium whose pressure and radiation field are assumed fixed for simplicity. Such a bubble condenses and collapses upon radiating its latent heat to the background, assuming its energy loss is not stopped by background irradiation. Collapse speeds can range up to sonic, similar to cavitation in terrestrial settings. Adding a non-condensible gas like hydrogen to the bubble stalls the collapse. We discuss whether cavitation can provide a way for mm-sized chondrules and refractory solids to assemble into meteorite parent bodies, focusing on CB/CH chondrites whose constituents likely condensed from silicate/metal vapor released from the most energetic asteroid collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 K2-24 is a planetary system composed of two transiting low-density Neptunians locked in an almost perfect 2:1 resonance and showing large TTVs, i.e., an excellent laboratory to search for signatures of planetary migration. Previous studies performed with K2, Spitzer and RV data tentatively claimed a significant non-zero eccentricity for one or both planets, possibly high enough to challenge the scenario of pure disk migration through resonant capture. With 13 new CHEOPS light curves (seven of planet -b, six of planet -c), we carried out a global photometric and dynamical (RV+TTV) re-analysis by including all the available literature data as well. We got the most accurate set of planetary parameters to date for the K2-24 system, including radii and masses at 1% and 5% precision (now essentially limited by the uncertainty on stellar parameters) and non-zero eccentricities $e_b=0.0498_{-0.0018}^{+0.0011}$, $e_c=0.0282_{-0.0007}^{+0.0003}$ detected at very high significance for both planets. Such relatively large values imply the need for an additional physical mechanism of eccentricity excitation during or after the migration stage. Also, while the accuracy of the previous TTV model had drifted by up to 0.5 days at the current time, we constrained the orbital solution firmly enough to predict the forthcoming transits for the next ~15 years, thus enabling an efficient follow-up with top-level facilities such as JWST or ESPRESSO.

          Disruption of exo-asteroids around white dwarfs and the release of dust particles in debris rings in co-orbital motion

 - **Abstract**
 Close to the Roche radius of a white dwarf (WD), an asteroid on a circular orbit sheds material that then adopts a very similar orbit. Observations of the resulting debris show a periodic behavior and changes in flux on short timescales, implying ongoing dynamical activity. Additional encounters from other minor planets may then yield co-orbital rings of debris at different inclinations. The structure, dynamics, and lifetime of these debris discs remains highly uncertain, but is important for understanding WD planetary systems. We aim to identify and quantify the locations of co-orbitals in WD-asteroid-dust particle 3-body systems by exploring the influence of 1:1 resonant periodic orbits. We begin this exploration with co-planar and inclined orbits in the circular restricted 3-body problem (CRTBP) and model the dynamical evolution of these exosystems over observable timescales. The mass ratio parameter for this class of systems ($~2\times 10^{-11}$) is one of the lowest ever explored in this dynamical configuration. We computed the periodic orbits, deduced their linear stability, and suitably seeded the dynamical stability maps. We carried out a limited suite of N-body simulations to provide direct comparisons with the maps. We derive novel results for this extreme mass ratio in the CRTBP, including new unstable 3D families. We illustrate through the maps and N-body simulations where dust can exist in a stable configuration over observable timescales across a wide expanse of parameter space in the absence of strong external forces. Over a timescale of 10 yr, the maximum orbital period deviations of stable debris due to the co-orbital perturbations of the asteroid is about a few seconds. Unstable debris in a close encounter with the asteroid typically deviates from the co-orbital configuration by more than about 20 km and is on a near-circular orbit with an eccentricity lower than ~0.01.

          Cosmological constraints on anisotropic Thurston geometries

 - **Abstract**
 Much of modern cosmology relies on the Cosmological Principle, the assumption that the Universe is isotropic and homogeneous on sufficiently large scales, but it remains worthwhile to examine cosmological models that violate this principle slightly. We examine a class of such spacetimes that maintain homogeneity but break isotropy through their underlying local spatial geometries. These spacetimes are endowed with one of five anisotropic model geometries of Thurston's geometrization theorem, and their evolution is sourced with perfect fluid dust and cosmological constant. We show that the background evolution of these spacetimes induces fluctuations in the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature with amplitudes coupled to the curvature parameter $\Omega_K$. In order for these fluctuations to be compatible with the observed CMB angular power spectrum, we find $|\Omega_K| \lesssim 10^{-5}$ is required in all five geometries, with two geometries requiring $|\Omega_K| \lesssim 10^{-10}$. This strongly limits the cosmological consequences of these models.

          A New IW And-Type Star: Karachurin 12 with Tilted Disks and Diverse cycles

 - **Abstract**
 The IW And phenomenon in cataclysmic variables presents a significant challenge to the accretion disk instability model. Using photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we identify Karachurin 12 as a new IW And-type object with a cycle period of 35.69(3) days. We also report for the first time that Karachurin 12 is a negative superhump (NSH) system featuring a precessing tilted disk, with precession, orbital, and NSH periods of 4.9588(2) days, 0.3168895(13) days, and 0.2979861(8) days, respectively. Our analysis, using dips as indexes and NSHs as probes, reveals diverse cycle patterns in Karachurin 12, with NSH amplitude varying throughout the cycle. Analyses of NSH behaviour using multiple methods shows that the amplitude decreases with increasing outbursts and increases with weakening outbursts, which we suggest is related to changes in the radius of the accretion disk. The mass transfer outburst model fails to explain the observed NSH amplitude variations, whereas the tilted thermally unstable disk model accounts for most of the observed cycles and dip patterns, particularly the disappearance of the IW And phenomenon when NSHs become undetectable. However, no significant changes in the NSH period were observed. These findings suggest a potential link between the IW And phenomenon and a tilted disk. Further improvements in simulations are needed to better understand the detailed dynamics of these cycles.

          Resolving Twin Jets and Twin Disks with JWST and ALMA: The Young WL 20 Multiple System

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of jets emanating from pre-main-sequence objects exclusively at mid-infrared wavelengths, enabled by the superb sensitivity of JWST's Mid-InfraRed Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI MRS) instrument. These jets are observed only in lines of [NiII], [FeII], [ArII], and [NeII]. The H$_2$ emission, imaged in eight distinct transitions, has a completely different morphology, exhibiting a wide-angled, biconical shape, symmetrically distributed about the jet axes. Synergistic high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations resolve a pair of side-by-side edge-on accretion disks lying at the origin of the twin mid-infrared jets. Assuming coevality of the components of the young multiple system under investigation, the system age is at least (2 $-$ 2.5) $\times$ 10$^6$ yr, despite the discrepantly younger age inferred from the spectral energy distribution of the combined edge-on disk sources. The later system evolutionary stage is corroborated by ALMA observations of CO(2$-$1), $^{13}$CO(2$-1$), and C$^{18}$O(2$-$1), which show no traces of molecular outflows or remnant cavity walls. Consequently, the observed H$_2$ structures must have their origins in wide-angled disk winds, in the absence of any ambient, swept-up gas. In the context of recent studies of protostars, we propose an outflow evolutionary scenario in which the molecular gas component dominates in the youngest sources, whereas the fast, ionized jets dominate in the oldest sources, as is the case for the twin jets discovered in the WL 20 system.

 - **Abstract**
 GEO 600, Kagra, LIGO, and Virgo were built to observe gravitational waves at frequencies in the audio band, where the highest event rates combined with the largest signal to noise ratios had been predicted. Currently, hypothetical sources of cosmological origin that could have produced signals at higher frequencies are under discussion. What is not widely known is that current interferometric GW observatories have a frequency comb of high optical sensitivity that encompasses these high frequencies. Here we calculate the high-frequency noise spectral densities of operating GW observatories under the justified assumption that photon shot noise is the dominant noise source. We explain the underlying physics of why high sensitivity is achieved for all integer multiples of the free spectral ranges of the observatory's resonators when an interferometer arm is not orientated perpendicular to the propagation direction of the GW. Proposals for new concepts of high-frequency GW detectors must be compared with the high-frequency sensitivities presented here.

 - **Abstract**
 In physics, accurately modeling large-scale phenomena such as core-collapse supernovae, (CCSN), and neutron star mergers are computationally challenging and require solving large sets of partial and ordinary differential equations. Traditional methods used widely in the scientific community are predominantly implicit, which are approximations that often require drastic simplifications and can be computationally inefficient. This thesis presents results on a new software suite titled "Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks" or "FENN", that introduces a suite of algebraically stabilized explicit methods known as explicit asymptotic for modeling Neutrino Electron Scattering, (NES), presenting a novel approach that combines the stability of traditional methods with enhanced computational efficiency. Initial results show that FENN can deliver accurate solutions for neutrino networks at improved computational speeds. This thesis further covers new results for scaled networks beyond the constraints of standard energy groupings, as well as the dynamics of neutrino interactions such as the scattering of various neutrino flavors -- electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$), electron anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$), and muon/tau neutrinos ($\nu_{\mu,\tau}$) as well as their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}$) -- off electrons.

          Relative evolution of eclipsing binaries: A tool to measure globular cluster ages and He abundances

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest objects in the Universe for which an age can be directly measured, thus playing an important cosmological role. This age, on the other hand, depends sensitively on the He abundance, which cannot be reliably measured from spectroscopy in GC stars. Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) near the turnoff (TO) point may play an important role in this regard. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility that, by working with differential measurements of stars that comprise a TO binary system, and assuming both stars have the same age and He abundance, one can achieve tighter, more robust, and less model-dependent constraints on the latter two quantities than otherwise possible by working with the absolute parameters of the stars. We compare both absolute and differential parameters of the stars in V69, a TO DEB pair in the GC 47 Tuc, with two different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, making use of a Monte Carlo technique to estimate its He abundance and age, along with their uncertainties. We find that the relative approach can produce age and He abundance estimates that are in good agreement with those from the literature. We show that our estimates are also less model-dependent, less sensitive to [Fe/H], and more robust to inherent model systematics than those obtained with an absolute approach. On the other hand, the relative analysis finds larger statistical uncertainties than does its absolute counterpart, at least in the case of V69, where both stars have very similar properties. For binary pairs in which one of the components is less evolved than the other, the statistical uncertainty can be reduced. Our study suggests that the method proposed in this work may be useful to robustly constrain the He abundance and ages of GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Generating low-thrust transfer trajectories between Earth and the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), that is selected for NASA's Gateway, can be challenging due to the low control authority available from the propulsion system and the important operational constraint that the duration of all eclipses has to be less than a prescribed 90-minute threshold. We present a method for generating eclipse-feasible, minimum-time solutions to the aforementioned trajectory design problem using a Lyapunov control law. Coasting is enforced during solar eclipses due to both the Earth and Moon. We used particle swarm optimization to optimize the NRHO insertion date, time of flight, and control law parameters according to a cost function that prioritizes 1) convergence to the target orbit, 2) satisfaction of eclipse-duration constraints, and 3) minimization of time of flight. Trajectories can serve as initial guesses for NASA's high-fidelity trajectory design tools such as Copernicus and GMAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense cores inherit turbulent motions from the interstellar medium in which they form. As a tool for comparison to both simulations and observations, it is valuable to construct theoretical core models that can relate their internal density and velocity structure while predicting their stability to gravitational collapse. To this end, we solve the angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics under two assumptions: 1) the system is in a quasi-steady equilibrium; 2) the velocity field consists of radial bulk motion plus isotropic turbulence, with turbulent dispersion increasing as a power-law in the radius. The resulting turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES) solutions form a two-parameter family, characterized by the sonic radius $r_s$ and the power-law index $p$. The TES is equivalent to the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere when $r_s\to \infty$. The density profile in outer regions of the TES is slightly shallower than the BE sphere, but is steeper than the logotropic model. Stability analysis shows that the TESs with size exceeding a certain critical radius are unstable to radial perturbations. The center-to-edge density contrast, mass, and radius of the marginally stable TES all increase with increasing average velocity dispersion. The FWHM of the column density profile is always smaller than the critical radius, by a larger factor at higher velocity dispersion, suggesting that observations need to probe beyond the FWHM to capture the full extent of turbulent cores. When applied to the highly turbulent regime typical of cluster-forming clumps, the critical mass and radius of the TES intriguingly resembles the typical mass and radius of observed star clusters.

          The star formation histories, star formation efficiencies and ionizing sources of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions

 - **Abstract**
 1226 ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions were matched with radio sources in the CORNISH-North/South surveys, and 392 of them have corresponding radio sources. We determined the stellar luminosity according to the Lyman continuum flux. When the bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps is less than $\approx$ 10$^{3.7}$ L$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a clump mass $\approx$ 10$^{2.55}$ M$_{\odot}$, the stellar luminosities derived from the Lyman continuum flux overestimate the actual stellar luminosities, because the accretion onto the protostars contributes significantly to the radio emission. After subtracting the accretion luminosity, we obtained reasonable estimates of the stellar luminosity. Using the 0.5 Myr isochrone, we calculated the stellar masses according to the stellar luminosities, and found that they roughly follow the $m_{\rm max}-M_{\rm ecl}$ relation of embedded clusters, consistent with the ionizing sources representing the most massive stars in the embedded clusters of HII-clumps. We also studied the contribution of the possible flaring activity to the observed stellar luminosity and found that they can be neglected. We further studied the change of SFE with the clump mass. According to the derived mass of the most massive star in each HII-clump, using the theoretical $m_{\rm max}-M_{\rm ecl}$ relation, we calculated the mass of the corresponding embedded cluster and then the SFE of the clump. The SFE decreases with increasing clump mass, with a median value of $\approx$0.3. We also independently derived the SFE for each HII-clump based on the model developed in our previous work. The SFEs of HII-clumps derived from the observation and the model are in good agreement. Concerning the star formation histories of the ATLASGAL clumps, low-mass clumps may reach the peak of star formation earlier than high-mass clumps, consistent with the shorter free-fall time of low-mass clumps.

          A Stochastic Approach to Reconstructing the Speed of Light in Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 The Varying Speed of Light (VSL) model describes how the speed of light in a vacuum changes with cosmological redshift. Despite numerous models, there is little observational evidence for this variation. While the speed of light can be accurately measured by physical means, cosmological methods are rarely used. Previous studies quantified the speed of light at specific redshifts using Gaussian processes and reconstructed the redshift-dependent function $c(z)$. It is crucial to quantify the speed of light across varying redshifts. We use the latest data on angular diameter distances $D_A(z)$ and Hubble parameters $H(z)$ from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic chronometer measurements in the redshift interval $z\in[0.07,1.965]$. The speed of light $c(z)$ is determined using Gaussian and deep Gaussian processes to reconstruct $H(z)$, $D_A(z)$, and $D^{\prime}_A(z)$. Furthermore, we conduct comparisons across three distinct models, encompassing two renowned VSL models. We get the result of the parameters constraints in the models (1) for the ``$c$-c" model, $c_0=29492.6 \pm^{6.2}_{5.3} \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. (2) For the ``$c$-cl" model, $c_0=29665.5 \pm^{11.2}_{11.4}\mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $n=0.05535 \pm^{0.00008}_{0.00007}$. (3) For the ``$c$-CPL" model, $c_0=29555.7 \pm^{13.3}_{13.2} \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $n=-0.0607 \pm 0.0001$. Based on our findings, it may be inferred that Barrow's classical VSL model is not a suitable fit for our data. In contrast, the widely recognized Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) VSL model, under some circumstances, as well as the universal ``c is constant" model, demonstrate a satisfactory ability to account for our findings.

          Asking Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) for More than Reionization History

 - **Abstract**
 We propose different estimators to probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) intergalactic medium (IGM) using the dispersion measure (${\rm DM}$) of the FRBs. We consider three different reionization histories which we can distinguish with a total of $\lesssim 1000$ ${\rm DM}$ measurements during EoR if their redshifts are known. We note that the redshift derivatives of ${\rm DM}$ are also directly sensitive to the reionization history. The major point of this work is exploring the variance in the ${\rm DM}$ measurements and the information encoded in them. We find that the all-sky average $\overline{\rm DM}(z)$ gets biased from the LoS fluctuations in the ${\rm DM}$ measurements introduced by the ionization of IGM during EoR. We find that the ratio $\sigma_{\rm DM}/\overline{\rm DM}$ depends directly on the ionization bubble sizes as well as the reionization history. On the other hand, we also find that angular variance (coined as $structure$ $function$) of ${\rm DM}$ encodes the information about the duration of reionization and the typical bubble sizes as well. We establish the usefulness of variances in ${\rm DM}$ using toy models of reionization and later verify it with the realistic reionization simulations.

          A Potential Dynamical Origin of The Galactic Disk Warp: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Major Merger

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have revealed that the Galactic warp is a long-lived, nonsteady, and asymmetric structure. There is a need for a model that accounts for the warp's long-term evolution. Given that this structure has persisted for over 5 Gyrs, its timeline may coincide with the completion of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Recent studies indicate that the GSE, the significant merger of our Galaxy, was likely a gas-rich merger and the large amount of gas introduced could have created a profound impact on the Galactic morphology. This study utilizes GIZMO simulation code to construct a gas-rich GSE merger. By reconstructing the observed characteristics of the GSE, we successfully reproduce the disk warp and capture nearly all of its documented features that aligns closely with observational data from both stellar and gas disks. This simulation demonstrates the possibility that the single major merger could generate the Galactic warp amplitude and precession. Furthermore, the analysis of the warp's long-term evolution may offer more clues into the formation history of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Unlike the Solar System planets, thousands of smaller bodies beyond Neptune orbit the Sun on eccentric ($e >$ 0.1) and ($i>$ 3$^\circ$) orbits. While migration of the giant planets during the early stages of Solar System evolution can induce substantial scattering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNO), this process cannot account for the small number of distant TNOs ($r_p >$ 60 au) outside the planets' reach. The alternative scenario of the close flyby of another star can instead produce all these TNO features simultaneously, but the possible parameter space for such an encounter is vast. Here, we compare observed TNO properties with thousands of flyby simulations to determine the specific properties of a flyby that reproduces all the different dynamical TNO populations, their location and their relative abundance and find that a 0.8$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ $M_{\odot}$ star passing at a distance of $ r_p =$ 110 $\mathbf{\pm}$ 10 au, inclined by $i$ = 70$^\circ$ $^{+5}_{-10}$ gives a near-perfect match. This flyby also replicates the retrograde TNO population, which has proved difficult to explain. Such a flyby is reasonably frequent; at least 140 million solar-type stars in the Milky Way are likely to have experienced a similar one. In light of these results, we predict that the upcoming Vera Rubin telescope will reveal that distant and retrograde TNOs are relatively common.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia/DR3 has provided a large sample of new g-mode pulsators, among which~11,600 are Gam Dor stars. This work present the spectroscopic parameters of these Gam Dor pulsators estimated by the GSP-spec module that analysed millions of Gaia spectra. The Galactic positions, kinematics, and orbital properties of these new Gaia pulsators were examined in order to define a sub-sample belonging to the Milky Way thin disc, in which these young stars should preferentially be found. The stellar luminosities, radii, and astrometric surface gravities were estimated without adopting any priors from uncertain stellar evolution models. These parameters, combined with the GSP-spec effective temperatures, spectroscopic gravities, and metallicities were then validated by comparison with recent literature studies. Most stars are found to belong to the Galactic thin disc, as expected. It is also found that the derived luminosities, radii, and astrometric surface gravities are of high quality and have values typical of genuine Gam Dor pulsators. Moreover, we have shown that Teff and [M/H] of pulsators with high enough SNR spectra or slow to moderate rotation rates are robust. This allowed to define a sub-sample of genuine slow-rotating Gaia Gam Dor pulsators. Their Teff are found between ~6500 and ~7800K, log(g) around 4.2 and luminosities and stellar radii peak at ~5Lsun and ~1.7Rsun. [M/H] is close to the Solar value, although 0.5dex more metal-poor and metal-rich Gam Dor are identified. The [alpha/Fe] content is fully consistent with the chemical properties of the Galactic disc. Gaia/DR3 spectroscopic properties of Gam Dor stars therefore confirm the nature of these pulsators and allow to chemo-physically parametrise a new large sample of such stars. Moreover, future Gaia DR should drastically increase the number of Gam Dor stars with good-precision spectroscopically derived parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 With the expanding integration of infrared instruments in astronomical missions, accurate per-pixel flux estimation for near-infrared hybrid detectors has become critical to the success of these missions. Based on CPPM's involvement in both SVOM/Colibri and Euclid missions, this study introduces universally applicable methods and framework for characterizing IR hybrid detectors and decorrelating their intrinsic properties. The characterization framework, applied to the ALFA detector and \Euclid's H2RG, not only validates the proposed methods but also points out subtle behaviors inherent to each detector.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star (NS) has many extreme physical conditions, and one may obtain some important informations about NS via accreting neutron star binary (ANSB) systems. The upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) provides an opportunity to search for a large sample of ANSB candidates. Our goal is to check the completeness of the potential ANSB samples from CSST data. In this paper, we generate some ANSBs and normal binaries under CSST photometric system by binary evolution and binary population synthesis method and use a machine learning method to train a classification model. Although the Precision ($94.56~ \%$) of our machine learning model is as high as before study, the Recall is only about $63.29~ \%$. The Precision/Recall is mainly determined by the mass transfer rate between the NSs and their companions. In addition, we also find that the completeness of ANSB samples from CSST photometric data by the machine learning method also depends on the companion mass and the age of the system. ANSB candidates with low initial mass companion star ($0.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $1~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have a relatively high Precision ($94.94~ \%$) and high Recall ($86.32~ \%$), whereas ANSB candidates with higher initial mass companion star ($1.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $3~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have similar Precision ($93.88~ \%$) and quite low Recall ($42.67~ \%$). Our results indicate that although the machine learning method may obtain a relative pure sample of ANSBs, a completeness correction is necessary for one to obtain a complete sample.

          Mid-order wavefront control for exoplanet imaging: preliminary characterization of the segmented deformable mirror and Zernike wavefront sensor on HiCAT

 - **Abstract**
 We study a mid-order wavefront sensor (MOWFS) to address fine cophasing errors in exoplanet imaging with future large segmented aperture space telescopes. Observing Earth analogs around Sun-like stars requires contrasts down to $10^{-10}$ in visible light. One promising solution consists of producing a high-contrast dark zone in the image of an observed star. In a space observatory, this dark region will be altered by several effects, and among them, the small misalignments of the telescope mirror segments due to fine thermo-mechanical drifts. To correct for these errors in real time, we investigate a wavefront control loop based on a MOWFS with a Zernike sensor. Such a MOWFS was installed on the high-contrast imager for complex aperture telescopes (HiCAT) testbed in Baltimore in June 2023. The bench uses a 37-segment Iris-AO deformable mirror to mimic telescope segmentation and some wavefront control strategies to produce a dark zone with such an aperture. In this contribution, we first use the MOWFS to characterize the Iris-AO segment discretization steps. For the central segment, we find a minimal step of 125\,$\pm$31\,pm. This result will help us to assess the contribution of the Iris-AO DM on the contrast in HiCAT. We then determine the detection limits of the MOWFS, estimating wavefront error amplitudes of 119 and 102\,pm for 10\,s and 1\,min exposure time with a SNR of 3. These values inform us about the measurement capabilities of our wavefront sensor on the testbed. These preliminary results will be useful to provide insights on metrology and stability for exo-Earth observations with the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on the study of the AME, an important emission mechanism between 10 and 60 GHz whose polarization properties are not yet fully understood, and is therefore a potential contaminant for future CMB polarization observations. We use new QUIJOTE-MFI maps 11, 13, 17 and 19 GHz, together with other public ancillary data including WMAP and Planck, to study the polarization properties of the AME in three Galactic regions: rho-Ophiuchi, Perseus and W43. We have obtained the SEDs for those three regions over the frequency range 0.4-3000 GHz, both in intensity and polarization. The intensity SEDs are well described by a combination of free-free emission, thermal dust, AME and CMB anisotropies. In polarization, we extracted the flux densities using all available data between 11 and 353 GHz. We implemented an improved intensity-to-polarization leakage correction that has allowed for the first time to derive reliable polarization constraints well below the 1% level from Planck-LFI data. A frequency stacking of maps in the range 10-60 GHz has allowed us to reduce the statistical noise and to push the upper limits on the AME polarization level. We have obtained upper limits on the AME polarization fraction of order <1% (95% confidence level) for the three regions. In particular we get Pi_AME < 1.1% (at 28.4 GHz), Pi_AME < 1.1% (at 22.8 GHz) and Pi_AME < 0.28% (at 33 GHz) in rho-Ophiuchi, Perseus and W43 respectively. At the QUIJOTE 17 GHz frequency band, we get Pi_AME< 5.1% for rho-Ophiuchi, Pi_AME< 3.5% for Perseus and Pi_AME< 0.85% for W43. Our final upper limits derived using the stacking procedure are Pi_AME < 0.58% for rho-Ophiuchi, Pi_AME < 1.64% for Perseus and Pi_AME < 0.31% for W43. Altogether, these are the most stringent constraints to date on the AME polarization fraction of these three star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of our study is to characterise the spin states of the members of the Athor and Zita collisional families and test whether these members have a spin distribution consistent with a common origin from the break up of their respective family parent asteroids. Our method is based on the asteroid family evolution, which indicates that there should be a statistical predominance of retrograde-rotating asteroids on the inward side of family's V-shape, and prograde-rotating asteroids on the outward side. We used photometric data from our campaign and the literature in order to reveal the spin states of the asteroids belonging to these families. We combined dense and sparse photometric data in order to construct lightcurves; we performed the lightcurve inversion method to estimate the sidereal period, spin axis and convex shape of several family members. We obtained 34 new asteroid models for Athor family members and 17 for Zita family members. Along with the literature and revised models, the Athor family contains 60% of retrograde asteroids on the inward side and, 76% of prograde asteroids on the outward side. We also found that the Zita family exhibits 80% of retrograde asteroids on the inward side and an equal amount of prograde and retrograde rotators on the outward side. However, when we applied Kernel density estimation, we also found a clear peak for prograde asteroids on the outward side, as expected from the theory. The spin states of these asteroids validate the existence of both families, with the Athor family exhibiting a stronger signature for the presence of retrograde-rotating and prograde-rotating asteroids on the inner and outer side of the family, respectively. Our work provides an independent confirmation and characterisation of these very old families, whose presence and characteristics offer constraints for theories and models of the Solar System's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The complex dynamics of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and the resulting stellar winds have a significant impact on the measurements of stellar parameters and amplify their uncertainties. Three-dimensional (3D) radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of convection suggest that convection-related structures at the surface of AGB star affect the photocentre displacement and the parallax uncertainty measured by Gaia. Aims. We explore the impact of the convection on the photocentre variability and aim to establish analytical laws between the photocentre displacement and stellar parameters to retrieve such parameters from the parallax uncertainty. Methods. We used a selection of 31 RHD simulations with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code Optim3D to compute intensity maps in the Gaia G band [320-1050 nm]. From these maps, we calculated the photocentre position and temporal fluctuations. We then compared the synthetic standard deviation to the parallax uncertainty of a sample of 53 Mira stars observed with Gaia. Results. The simulations show a displacement of the photocentre across the surface ranging from 4 to 13 % of the corresponding stellar radius, in agreement with previous studies. We provide an analytical law relating the pulsation period of the simulations and the photocentre displacement as well as the pulsation period and stellar parameters. By combining these laws, we retrieve the surface gravity, the effective temperature, and the radius for the stars in our sample. Conclusions. Our analysis highlights an original procedure to retrieve stellar parameters by using both state-of-the-art 3D numerical simulations of AGB stellar convection and parallax observations of AGB stars. This will help us refine our understanding of these giants.

 - **Abstract**
 Most domains of science are experiencing a paradigm shift due to the advent of a new generation of instruments and detectors which produce data and data streams at an unprecedented rate. The scientific exploitation of these data, namely Data Driven Discovery, requires interoperability, massive and optimal use of Artificial Intelligence methods in all steps of the data acquisition, processing and analysis, the access to large and distributed computing HPC facilities, the implementation and access to large simulations and interdisciplinary skills that usually are not provided by standard academic curricula. Furthermore, to cope with this data deluge, most communities have leveraged solutions and tools originally developed by large corporations for purposes other than scientific research and accepted compromises to adapt them to their specific needs. Through the presentation of several astrophysical use cases, we show how the Data Driven based solutions could represent the optimal playground to achieve the multi-disciplinary methodological approach.

 - **Abstract**
 In an attempt to further characterise the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population we present 38 new light-curves acquired between September 2020 and November 2023 for NEAs (7335) 1989 JA, (7822) 1991 CS, (154244) 2002 KL6 and (159402) 1999 AP10, obtained from observations taken at the Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Spain). With these new observations along with archival data, we computed their first shape models and spin solutions by applying the light curve inversion method. The obtained rotation periods are in good agreement with those reported in previous works, with improved uncertainties. Additionally, besides the constant period models for (7335) 1989 JA, (7822) 1991 CS and (159402) 1999 AP10, our results for (154244) 2002 KL6 suggest that it could be affected by a Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack acceleration with a value of $\upsilon \simeq -7 \times 10^{-9}$ rad d$^{-2}$. This would be one of the first detections of this effect slowing down an asteroid.

 - **Abstract**
 To prepare for the analyses of the future PLATO light curves, we develop a deep learning model, Panopticon, to detect transits in high precision photometric light curves. Since PLATO's main objective is the detection of temperate Earth-size planets around solar-type stars, the code is designed to detect individual transit events. The filtering step, required by conventional detection methods, can affect the transit, which could be an issue for long and shallow transits. To protect transit shape and depth, the code is also designed to work on unfiltered light curves. We trained the model on a set of simulated PLATO light curves in which we injected, at pixel level, either planetary, eclipsing binary, or background eclipsing binary signals. We also include a variety of noises in our data, such as granulation, stellar spots or cosmic rays. The approach is able to recover 90% of our test population, including more than 25% of the Earth-analogs, even in the unfiltered light curves. The model also recovers the transits irrespective of the orbital period, and is able to retrieve transits on a unique event basis. These figures are obtained when accepting a false alarm rate of 1%. When keeping the false alarm rate low (<0.01%), it is still able to recover more than 85% of the transit signals. Any transit deeper than 180ppm is essentially guaranteed to be recovered. This method is able to recover transits on a unique event basis, and does so with a low false alarm rate. Thanks to light curves being one-dimensional, model training is fast, on the order of a few hours per model. This speed in training and inference, coupled to the recovery effectiveness and precision of the model make it an ideal tool to complement, or be used ahead of, classical approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Integrated optics are used to achieve astronomical interferometry inside robust and compact materials, improving the instrument's stability and sensitivity. In order to perform differential phase measurements at the H$\alpha$ line (656.3 nm) with the 600-800 nm spectro-interferometer FIRST, a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) is being developed in collaboration with TEEM Photonics. This PIC performs the interferometric combination of the beams coming from sub-apertures selected in the telescope pupil, thus implementing the pupil remapping technique to restore the diffraction limit of the telescope. In this work, we report on the latest developments carried out within the FIRST project to produce a high performance visible PIC. The PICs are manufactured by TEEM Photonics, using their technology based on $K_+:Na_+$ ion exchange in glass. The first part of the study consists in the experimental characterization of the fundamental properties of the waveguides, in order to build an accurate model, which is the basis for the design of more complex functions. In the second part, theoretical designs and their optimization for three types of combiner architectures are presented: symmetric directional coupler, asymmetric directional couplers and ABCD cells including achromatic phase shifters.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explored the fundamental contrast limit of NIRCam coronagraphy observations, representing the achievable performance with post-processing techniques. This limit is influenced by photon noise and readout noise, with complex noise propagation through post-processing methods like principal component analysis. We employed two approaches: developing a formula based on simplified scenarios and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, assuming Gaussian noise properties and uncorrelated pixel noise. Tested on datasets HIP\,65426, AF\,Lep, and HD\,114174, the MCMC method provided accurate but computationally intensive estimates. The analytical approach offered quick, reliable estimates closely matching MCMC results in simpler scenarios. Our findings showed the fundamental contrast curve is significantly deeper than the current achievable contrast limit obtained with post-processing techniques at shorter separations, being 10 times deeper at $0.5''$ and 4 times deeper at $1''$. At greater separations, increased exposure time improves sensitivity, with the transition between photon and readout noise dominance occurring between $2''$ and $3''$. We conclude the analytical approach is a reliable estimate of the fundamental contrast limit, offering a faster alternative to MCMC. These results emphasize the potential for greater sensitivity at shorter separations, highlighting the need for improved or new post-processing techniques to enhance JWST NIRCam sensitivity or contrast curve.

 - **Abstract**
 To constrain models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, the development of the Euclid analysis pipeline requires simulations that capture the nonlinear phenomenology of such models. We present an overview of numerical methods and $N$-body simulation codes developed to study the nonlinear regime of structure formation in alternative dark energy and modified gravity theories. We review a variety of numerical techniques and approximations employed in cosmological $N$-body simulations to model the complex phenomenology of scenarios beyond $\Lambda$CDM. This includes discussions on solving nonlinear field equations, accounting for fifth forces, and implementing screening mechanisms. Furthermore, we conduct a code comparison exercise to assess the reliability and convergence of different simulation codes across a range of models. Our analysis demonstrates a high degree of agreement among the outputs of different simulation codes, providing confidence in current numerical methods for modelling cosmic structure formation beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We highlight recent advances made in simulating the nonlinear scales of structure formation, which are essential for leveraging the full scientific potential of the forthcoming observational data from the Euclid mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid mission will measure cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. To distinguish between cosmological models, it is essential to generate realistic mock observables from cosmological simulations that were run in both the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm and in many non-standard models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We present the scientific results from a suite of cosmological N-body simulations using non-standard models including dynamical dark energy, k-essence, interacting dark energy, modified gravity, massive neutrinos, and primordial non-Gaussianities. We investigate how these models affect the large-scale-structure formation and evolution in addition to providing synthetic observables that can be used to test and constrain these models with Euclid data. We developed a custom pipeline based on the Rockstar halo finder and the nbodykit large-scale structure toolkit to analyse the particle output of non-standard simulations and generate mock observables such as halo and void catalogues, mass density fields, and power spectra in a consistent way. We compare these observables with those from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and quantify the deviations. We find that non-standard cosmological models can leave significant imprints on the synthetic observables that we have generated. Our results demonstrate that non-standard cosmological N-body simulations provide valuable insights into the physics of dark energy and dark matter, which is essential to maximising the scientific return of Euclid.

          Irregular moons possibly injected from the outer solar system by a stellar flyby

 - **Abstract**
 The irregular moons orbit the giant planets on distant, inclined, and eccentric trajectories, in sharp contrast with the coplanar and quasicircular orbits of the regular moons. The origin of these irregular moons is still an open question, but these moons have a lot in common with the objects beyond Neptune (trans-Neptunian objects -- TNOs), suggestive of a common origin. Here, we show that the close flyby of a star may be the connecting element. A stellar flyby can simultaneously reproduce the complex TNO dynamics quantitatively while explaining the origin of the irregular moons and the colour distributions of both populations. This flyby would have catapulted 7.2% of the original TNO population into the region of the planets, many on retrograde orbits. Most injected TNOs would have been subsequently ejected from the solar system (85%). However, a considerable fraction would have had the potential to be captured by the planets. The exclusively distant origin of the injected TNOs may also explain the lack of very red irregular moons.

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2023ixf is one of the most well-observed core-collapse supernova in recent decades, yet there is inconsistency in the inferred zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ of its progenitor. Direct observations of the pre-SN red supergiant (RSG) estimate $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ spanning widely from 11 to 18 $M_{\rm \odot}$. Additional constraints, including host environment and the pulsation of its progenitor RSG, suggest a massive progenitor with $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ > 17 $M_{\rm \odot}$. However, the analysis of the properties of supernova, from light curve modeling to late phase spectroscopy, favor a relatively low mass scenario ($M_{\rm ZAMS}$ < 15 $M_{\rm \odot}$). In this work, we conduct systematic analysis of SN 2023ixf, from the RSG progenitor, plateau phase light curve to late phase spectroscopy. Using MESA+STELLA to simulate the RSG progenitor and their explosions, we find that, despite the ZAMS mass of the RSG models being varied from 12.0 to 17.5 $M_{\rm \odot}$, they can produce light curves that well match with SN 2023ixf if the envelope mass and the explosion energy are allowed to vary. Using late phase spectroscopy as independent measurement, the oxygen emission line [O I] suggests the ZAMS is intermediate massive (~16.0 $M_{\rm \odot}$), and the relatively weak H$\alpha$ emission line indicates the hydrogen envelope has been partially removed before the explosion. By incorporating the velocity structure derived from the light curve modeling into an axisymmetric model, we successfully generated [O I] line profiles that are consistent with the [O I] line observed in late phase spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf. Bringing these analyses together, we conclude that SN 2023ixf is the aspherical explosion of an intermediate massive star ($M_{\rm ZAMS}$ = 15-16 $M_{\rm \odot}$) with the hydrogen envelope being partially stripped to 4-5 $M_{\rm \odot}$ prior to its explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over the uncertainties in pulsar noise priors. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.

          Polar Neptunes are Stable to Tides

 - **Abstract**
 There is an intriguing and growing population of Neptune-sized planets with stellar obliquities near $\sim90^{\circ}$. One previously proposed formation pathway is a disk-driven resonance, which can take place at the end stages of planet formation in a system containing an inner Neptune, outer cold Jupiter, and protoplanetary disk. This mechanism occurs within the first $\sim10$ Myr, but most of the polar Neptunes we see today are $\sim$Gyrs old. Up until now, there has not been an extensive analysis of whether the polar orbits are stable over $\sim$Gyr timescales. Tidal realignment mechanisms are known to operate in other systems, and if they are active here, this would cause theoretical tension with a primordial misalignment story. In this paper, we explore the effects of tidal evolution on the disk-driven resonance theory. We use both $N$-body and secular simulations to study tidal effects on both the initial resonant encounter and long-term evolution. We find that the polar orbits are remarkably stable on $\sim$Gyr timescales. Inclination damping does not occur for the polar cases, although we do identify sub-polar cases where it is important. We consider two case study polar Neptunes, WASP-107 b and HAT-P-11 b, and study them in the context of this theory, finding consistency with present-day properties if their tidal quality factors are $Q \gtrsim 10^4$ and $Q \gtrsim 10^5$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we report the detection of dust depletion in a misaligned inner disk around UX Tau A using JWST MIRI spectra. Mid-infrared (MIR) continuum "seesaw" variability was detected in this disk by Spitzer and attributed to variable shadows cast on the outer disk by the inner disk. The JWST MIRI spectrum of UX Tau A also shows seesaw variability, but with a significant decrease of emission shortwards of 10 micron to nearly photospheric levels. We argue that UX Tau A's MIR continuum variability is due to depletion of dust in a misaligned inner disk. We speculate that this dust depletion occurs because the inner disk is misaligned from the outer disk, which can disrupt the replenishment of the inner disk from the outer disk. Using contemporaneous measurements of the mass accretion rate of UX Tau A and estimating the amount of dust necessary to produce the MIR excess in the Spitzer observations, we estimate a minimum dust depletion timescale of ~0.1 yr. These observations show that we can indirectly detect the signatures of misaligned inner disks through MIR continuum variability and that in some cases the inner disk may be significantly depleted of dust and become optically thin.

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Jovian desert is a region in the mass-period and radius-period parameter space, typically encompassing short-period ranges between super-Earths and hot Jupiters, that exhibits an intrinsic dearth of planets. This scarcity is likely shaped by photoevaporation caused by the stellar irradiation received by giant planets that have migrated inward. We report the detection and characterization of TOI-3568 b, a transiting super-Neptune with a mass of $26.4\pm1.0$ M$_\oplus$, a radius of $5.30\pm0.27$ R$_\oplus$, a bulk density of $0.98\pm0.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, and an orbital period of 4.417965(5) d situated in the vicinity of the sub-Jovian desert. This planet orbiting a K dwarf star with solar metallicity, was identified photometrically by TESS. It was characterized as a planet by our high-precision radial velocity monitoring program using MAROON-X at Gemini North, supplemented by additional observations from the SPICE large program with SPIRou at CFHT. We performed a Bayesian MCMC joint analysis of the TESS and ground-based photometry, MAROON-X and SPIRou radial velocities, to measure the orbit, radius, and mass of the planet, as well as a detailed analysis of the high-resolution flux and polarimetric spectra to determine the physical parameters and elemental abundances of the host star. Our results reveal TOI-3568 b as a hot super-Neptune, rich in hydrogen and helium with a core of heavier elements with a mass between 10 and 25 M$_\oplus$. We analyzed the photoevaporation status of TOI-3568 b and found that it experiences one of the highest EUV luminosities among planets with a mass M$_{\rm p}$ $<2$ M$_{\rm Nep}$, yet it has an evaporation lifetime exceeding 5 Gyr. Positioned in the transition between two significant populations of exoplanets on the mass-period and energy diagrams, this planet presents an opportunity to test theories concerning the origin of the sub-Jovian desert.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard cosmological framework, neutrinos begin to free-stream after the weak interaction phase ends in the early universe, at a temperature of approximately $T \sim 1 \, {\rm MeV}$. However, the onset of neutrino free-streaming can be delayed if additional interactions occur in the early universe, leaving imprints on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular power spectra and the large-scale structure (LSS) matter power spectra. We present a thorough analysis of early universe neutrino interactions with a fairly generalized parameterization of the interaction rates as a power law in neutrino temperature. In this (6+2) parameter scenario, we constrain the cosmological parameters along with the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass in presence of such interactions, with the help of full shape (FS) galaxy power spectra from BOSS Data Release 12. Our analysis reveals that a combined dataset of FS along with CMB and BAO offers improved constraints on the free-streaming redshift from present data, comparable to the forecast results from future CMB-S4 data. Additionally, we investigate the prospects of future galaxy surveys by forecasting on Euclid mission in combination with Planck and CMB-S4, and find significant improvement on both the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass than the existing constraints as well as than CMB-S4 alone.

          Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.
