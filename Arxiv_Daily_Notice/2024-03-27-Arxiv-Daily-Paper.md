 - **Abstract**
 The Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) project used dark-matter-only simulations to study the abundance and structure of dark matter haloes over the full mass range populated in the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology. Here we explore how baryonic effects modify these results for $z=0$ halo masses in the range $10^4$ to $10^7~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, below the threshold for galaxy formation. Our main study focuses on three simulations from identical initial conditions at $z=127$, one following dark matter only, one including non-radiative gas, and one additionally including the baryonic physics relevant in this halo mass range (cooling and photoheating). In the non-radiative simulation, above $10^{5.5}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, halo abundance and internal structure are very similar to the dark-matter-only simulation, and the baryon to dark matter ratio is everywhere close to the cosmic value. At lower mass, this ratio drops and haloes are less concentrated and less massive in the non-radiative case. Test simulations at higher resolution show this to be mainly a resolution effect; the expected drop in baryon content due to residual pressure effects only becomes substantial for $z=0$ haloes below $\sim 10^{2.7}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, gas is heated by reionization at $z=6$ in our ``full physics'' run, and this results in almost complete expulsion of gas from all haloes in our simulated mass range. This suppresses the halo mass function by $\sim 30 \%$, lowers halo concentration, and consequently weakens the dark matter annihilation signal by $\sim 40-60 \%$.

 - **Abstract**
 While the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) has been used as a distance indicator since the early 1990's, its application to measure the Hubble Constant as a primary distance indicator occurred only recently. The TRGB is also currently at an interesting crossroads as results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are beginning to emerge. In this chapter, we provide a review of the TRGB as it is used to measure the Hubble constant. First, we provide an essential review of the physical and observational basis of the TRGB as well as providing a summary for its use for measuring the Hubble Constant. More attention is then given is then given to recent, but still pre-JWST, developments, including new calibrations and developments with algorithms. We also address challenges that arise while measuring a TRGB-based Hubble Constant. We close by looking forward to the exciting prospects from telescopes such as JWST and Gaia.
#### AXES-SDSS: comparison of SDSS galaxy groups with All-sky X-ray Extended  Sources

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the picture of X-ray emission of groups through the study of systematic differences in the optical properties of groups with and without X-ray emission and study the effect of large-scale density field on scaling relations. We present the identification of X-ray galaxy groups using a combination of RASS and SDSS data. We include new X-ray reanalysis of RASS, to include very extended (up to a size of half a degree) sources and account for differences in the limiting sensitivity towards compact and very extended X-ray emission. X-ray groups exhibit less scatter in the scaling relations and selecting the groups based on the extended X-ray emission leads to an additional scatter reduction. Most of the scatter for the optical groups is associated with a small (6%) fraction of outliers, primarily associated with low optical luminosity groups found in dense regions of the cosmic web. These groups are the primary candidates for being the contaminants in the optical group catalogues. Removing those groups from the optical group sample using optically measured properties only, leads to a substantial reduction in the scatter in the most scaling relations of the optical groups. We find a density dependence of both the X-ray and optical luminosity of groups, which we associate with the assembly bias. Abridged.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of planetary systems beyond the solar system has revealed a diversity of architectures, most of which differ significantly from our system. The initial detection of an exoplanet is often followed by subsequent discoveries within the same system as observations continue, measurement precision is improved, or additional techniques are employed. The HD 104067 system is known to consist of a bright K dwarf host star and a giant planet in a $\sim$55 day period eccentric orbit. Here we report the discovery of an additional planet within the HD 104067 system, detected through the combined analysis of radial velocity data from the HIRES and HARPS instruments. The new planet has a mass similar to Uranus and is in an eccentric $\sim$14 day orbit. Our injection-recovery analysis of the radial velocity data exclude Saturn-mass and Jupiter-mass planets out to 3 AU and 8 AU, respectively. We further present TESS observations that reveal a terrestrial planet candidate ($R_p = 1.30\pm0.12$ $R_\oplus$) in a $\sim$2.2~day period orbit. Our dynamical analysis of the three planet model shows that the two outer planets produce significant eccentricity excitation of the inner planet, resulting in tidally induced surface temperatures as high as $\sim$2600 K for an emissivity of unity. The terrestrial planet candidate may therefore be caught in a tidal storm, potentially resulting in its surface radiating at optical wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. White-light stellar flares are proxies for some of the most energetic types of flares, but their triggering mechanism is still poorly understood. As they are associated with strong X and UV emission, their study is particularly relevant to estimate the amount of high-energy irradiation onto the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially those in their stars' habitable zone. Aims. We used the high-cadence, high-photometric capabilities of the CHEOPS and TESS space telescopes to study the detailed morphology of white-light flares occurring in a sample of 130 late-K and M stars, and compared our findings with results obtained at a lower cadence. We developed dedicated software for this purpose. Results. Multi-peak flares represent a significant percentage ($\gtrsim 30$\%) of the detected outburst events. Our findings suggest that high-impulse flares are more frequent than suspected from lower-cadence data, so that the most impactful flux levels that hit close-in exoplanets might be more time-limited than expected. We found significant differences in the duration distributions of single-peak and complex flare components, but not in their peak luminosity. A statistical analysis of the flare parameter distributions provides marginal support for their description with a log-normal instead of a power-law function, leaving the door open to several flare formation scenarios. We tentatively confirmed previous results about quasi-periodic pulsations in high-cadence photometry, report the possible detection of a pre-flare dip, and did not find hints of photometric variability due to an undetected flare background. Conclusions. The high-cadence study of stellar hosts might be crucial to evaluate the impact of their flares on close-in exoplanets, as their impulsive phase emission might otherwise be incorrectly estimated. Future telescopes such as PLATO and Ariel will help in this respect.
#### RIOJA. Complex Dusty Starbursts in a Major Merger B14-65666 at z=7.15

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system ($M_\text{UV}=-22.5$ mag) at $z=7.15$. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope ($\beta_\text{UV}=-2.2\pm0.1$). The flux excess, F356W$-$F444W, peaks at the E-core ($1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 \r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, $\simeq1$ dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty ($A_\text{V}=1.2\pm0.1$ mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature ($\ge63$-$68$ K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature ($\le27$-$33$ K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and $\beta_\text{UV}$ diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity ($\simeq0.2$ Z$_{\odot}$) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.
#### The Mass Density of Merging Binary Black Holes Over Cosmic Time

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and their stellar progenitors remains uncertain. Specifically, the fraction $\epsilon$ of stellar mass that ends up in BBH mergers and the delay time $\tau$ between star formation and BBH merger carry information about the astrophysical processes that give rise to merging BBHs. We model the BBH merger rate in terms of the cosmic star formation history, coupled with a metallicity-dependent efficiency $\epsilon$ and a distribution of delay times $\tau$, and infer these parameters with data from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We find that the progenitors to merging BBHs preferentially form in low metallicity environments with a low metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{<Z_t}=-3.99^{+0.68}_{-0.87}$ and a high metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{<Z_t}=-4.60^{+0.30}_{-0.34}$ at the 90% credible level. The data also prefer short delay times. For a power-law distribution $p(\tau)\propto \tau^\alpha$, we find $\tau_\text{min}<1.9 $ Gyr and $\alpha<-1.32$ at 90% credibility. Our model allows us to extrapolate the mass density in BBHs out to high redshifts. We cumulatively integrate our modelled density rate over cosmic time to get the total mass density of merging stellar mass BBHs as a function of redshift. Today, stellar-mass BBH mergers make up only $\sim 0.01\%$ of the total stellar mass density created by high-mass ($>10\,M_\odot$) progenitors. However, because massive stars are so short-lived, there may be more mass in merging BBHs than in living massive stars as early as $\sim 2.5$ Gyr ago. We also compare to the mass in supermassive BHs, finding that the mass densities were comparable $\sim 12.5$ Gyr ago, but the mass density in SMBHs quickly increased to $\sim 75$ times the mass density in merging stellar mass BBHs by $z\sim 1$.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4), and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km/s, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of non-compact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, as may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high v_r*sin(i) is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.
#### Black hole mass estimate in OJ 287 based on the bulk-motion  comptonization model

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-wavelength outburst activity in the BL Lacertae source OJ 287 has sparked a lot of controversy about whether the source contains one or two black holes (BHs) and what characteristics of this black hole binary would be. In this article we present the results of analysis of the X-ray flaring activity of OJ 287 using the data of Swift/XRT observations. We discovered that the energy spectra in all spectral states can be adequately fit with the XSPEC BMC model (the Comptonization one). As a result we found that the X-ray photon index of the BMC model, $\Gamma$ correlates with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$. We found the photon index $\Gamma$ to increase monotonically with accretion rate $\dot M$ from $\Gamma\sim 2$ in the intermediate state (IS) to $\Gamma\sim2.5$ the high/soft state (HSS) with subsequent saturation at $\Gamma\sim$ 2.6 level at higher luminosities. This type of behavior of the spectral index is remarkably similar to the pattern observed in a number of established stellar-mass black hole candidates. Assuming the universality of the observed pattern of the correlation between the photon index and mass accretion rate, we estimate the BH mass in OJ 287 to be around $2\times10^8$ solar masses, using the well studied BH binaries GX 339-4 and XTE J1859-226 to calibrate the model.
#### Robust integration of fast flavor conversions in classical neutrino  transport

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos in dense environments, such as the core-collapse supernovae or the neutron star mergers, can result in fast flavor conversion (FFC), presenting a significant challenge to achieving robust astrophysical modeling of these systems. Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions. In this Letter, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate excellent agreement between results obtained using this approach and those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations. In particular, this effective method can also precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere. Our work highlights that a robust integration of FFCs in classical neutrino transport used in astrophysical simulation can be feasible.
#### Vortex Fiber Nulling for Exoplanet Observations: First Direct Detection  of M Dwarf Companions around HIP 21543, HIP 94666, and HIP 50319

 - **Abstract**
 Vortex fiber nulling (VFN) is a technique for detecting and characterizing faint companions at small separations from their host star. A near-infrared ($\sim2.3 \mu$m) VFN demonstrator mode was deployed on the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) instrument at the Keck Observatory and presented earlier. In this paper, we present the first VFN companion detections. Three targets, HIP 21543 Ab, HIP 94666 Ab, and HIP 50319 B, were detected with host-companion flux ratios between 70 and 430 at and within one diffraction beamwidth ($\lambda/D$). We complement the spectra from KPIC VFN with flux ratio and position measurements from the CHARA Array to validate the VFN results and provide a more complete characterization of the targets. This paper reports the first direct detection of these three M dwarf companions, yielding their first spectra and flux ratios. Our observations provide measurements of bulk properties such as effective temperatures, radial velocities, and v$\sin{i}$, and verify the accuracy of the published orbits. These detections corroborate earlier predictions of the KPIC VFN performance, demonstrating that the instrument mode is ready for science observations.
#### Suzaku observation of an iron K-shell line in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946

 - **Abstract**
 An emission line at ~6.7 keV is attributable to a He-like iron K-shell transition, which indicates existence of a thin thermal plasma with a temperature of several keV. Using Suzaku archival data, we searched for the iron K-line from the spiral galaxy NGC 6946, and found the iron K-line at 6.68+/-0.07 keV at the 3.1 sigma level in the central r<2.'5 region. The iron line luminosity from the central region was estimated to be (2.3+/-1.2)x10^{37} erg s^{-1} at a distance of 5.5 Mpc. The origin of the iron emission line is discussed.
#### A possibly solar metallicity atmosphere escaping from HAT-P-32b revealed  by H$α$ and He absorption

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a hydrodynamic simulation that couples detailed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) calculations of the hydrogen and helium level populations to model the H$\alpha$ and He 10830 transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied to calculate the number of Ly$\alpha$ resonance scatterings, which is the main process for populating H(2). In the examined parameter space, only the models with H/He $\geq$ 99.5/0.5, $(0.5 \sim 3.0)$ times the fiducial value of $F_{\rm XUV}$, $\beta_m = 0.16\sim 0.3$, can explain the H$\alpha$ and He 10830 lines simultaneously. We find a mass-loss rate of $\sim (1.0\sim 3.1) \times 10^{13}$ g s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we find that the stellar Ly$\alpha$ flux should be as high as $4 \times 10^{5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, indicating high stellar activity during the observation epoch of the two absorption lines. Despite the fact that the metallicity in the lower atmosphere of HAT-P-32b may be super-solar, our simulations tentatively suggest it is close to solar in the upper atmosphere. The difference in metallicity between the lower and upper atmospheres is essential for future atmospheric characterisations.
#### Rotational Spectrum and First Interstellar Detection of 2-Methoxyethanol  Using ALMA Observations of NGC 6334I

 - **Abstract**
 We use both chirped-pulse Fourier transform and frequency modulated absorption spectroscopy to study the rotational spectrum of 2-methoxyethanol in several frequency regions ranging from 8.7-500 GHz. The resulting rotational parameters permitted a search for this molecule in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward the massive protocluster NGC 6334I as well as source B of the low-mass protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. 25 rotational transitions are observed in the ALMA Band 4 data toward NGC 6334I, resulting in the first interstellar detection of 2-methoxyethanol. A column density of $1.3_{-0.9}^{+1.4} \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ is derived at an excitation temperature of $143_{-39}^{+31}$ K. However, molecular signal is not observed in the Band 7 data toward IRAS 16293-2422B and an upper limit column density of $2.5 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is determined. Various possible formation pathways--including radical recombination and insertion reactions--are discussed. We also investigate physical differences between the two interstellar sources that could result in the observed abundance variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting. Their prediction depends on various factors including source eruptions. In the present work, we use the Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle (GSEP) data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We develop a framework using time series-based machine learning (ML) models with the aim of developing robust short-term forecasts by classifying SEP events. For this purpose, we introduce an ensemble learning approach that merges the results from univariate time series of three proton channels (10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long band X-ray flux channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) missions and analyze their performance. We consider three models, namely, time series forest (TSF), supervised time series forest (STSF) and bag of SFA symbols (BOSS). Our study also focuses on understanding and developing confidence in the predictive capabilities of our models. Therefore, we utilize multiple evaluation techniques and metrics. Based on that, we find STSF to perform well in all scenarios. The summary of metrics for the STSF model is as follows: AUC = 0.981; F1-score = 0.960; TSS = 0.919; HSS = 0.920; GSS = 0.852; and MCC = 0.920. The Brier score loss of the STSF model is 0.077. This work lays the foundation for building near-real-time (NRT) short-term SEP event predictions using robust ML methods.

 - **Abstract**
 No matter how fascinating and exotic other terrestrial planets are revealed to be, nothing generates more excitement than announcements regarding their habitability. From the observation of Mars to present-day efforts toward Venus and the characterization of exoplanets, the search for life, or at least environments that could accommodate life, has been a major drive for space exploration. So far, we have found no other unquestionably habitable world besides Earth. The conditions of the habitability of terrestrial planets have proved elusive, as surface conditions depend on the complex interplay of many processes throughout the evolution of a planet. Here, we review how the interior of a rocky planet can drive the evolution of surface conditions and the atmosphere. Instead of listing criteria assumed to be critical for life, we discuss how the bulk-silicate planet can affect the onset, continuation and cessation of habitability. We then consider how it can be observed and current efforts towards this end.

 We investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a tool for the study of Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in Large Scale Structure (LSS), and compare its performance with that achievable via a joint analysis with power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We consider the three main primordial bispectrum shapes - local, equilateral and orthogonal - and produce Fisher forecast for the corresponding fNL amplitude parameters, jointly with standard cosmological parameters. We analyze simulations from the publicly available "Quijote" and "Quijote-png" N-body suites, studying both the dark matter and halo fields. We find that the WST outperforms the power spectrum alone on all parameters, both on the fNL's and on cosmological ones. In particular, on fNL_loc for halos, the improvement is about 27%. When B is combined with P, halo constraints from WST are weaker for fNL_loc (at ~ 15% level), but stronger for fNL_eq (~ 25%) and fNL_ortho (~ 28%). Our results show that WST, both alone and in combination with P+B, can improve the extraction of information on PNG from LSS data over the one attainable by a standard P+B analysis. Moreover, we identify a class of WST in which the origin of the extra information on PNG can be cleanly isolated.

 We update the ephemerides of 16 transiting exoplanets using our ground-based observations, new TESS data, and previously published observations including those of amateur astronomers. All these light curves were modeled by making use of a set of quantitative criteria with the EXOFAST code to obtain mid-transit times. We searched for statistically significant secular and/or periodic trends in the mid-transit times. We found that the timing data are well modeled by a linear ephemeris for all systems except for XO-2 b, for which we detect an orbital decay with the rate of -12.95 $\pm$ 1.85 ms/yr that can be confirmed with future observations. We also detect a hint of potential periodic variations in the TTV data of HAT-P-13 b which also requires confirmation with further precise observations.

 In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation history of Jupiter has been of interest due to its ability to shape the solar system's history. Yet little attention has been paid to the formation and growth of Saturn and the other giant planets. Here, we explore the implications of the simplest disc and pebble accretion model with steady-state accretion on the formation of giant planets in the solar system through N-body simulations. We conducted a statistical survey of different disc parameters and initial conditions of the protoplanetary disc to establish which combination best reproduces the present outer solar system. We examined the effect of the initial planetesimal disc mass, the number of planetesimals and their size-frequency distribution slope, pebble accretion prescription, and sticking efficiency on the likelihood of forming gas giants and their orbital distribution. The results reveal that the accretion sticking efficiency is the most sensitive parameter for controlling the final masses and number of giant planets. We have been unable to replicate the formation of all three types of giant planets in the solar system in a single simulation. The probability distribution of the final location of the giant planets is approximately constant in $\log r$, suggesting there is a slight preference for formation closer to the Sun but no preference for more massive planets to form closer. The eccentricity distribution has a higher mean for more massive planets, indicating that systems with more massive planets are more violent. The formation timescales of the cores of the gas giants are distinct, suggesting that they formed sequentially.

 We report the discovery of ten new pulsars in the globular cluster Terzan 5 as part of the Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) Large Survey Project. We observed Terzan 5 at L-band (856--1712 MHz) with the MeerKAT radio telescope for four hours on two epochs, and performed acceleration searches of 45 out of 288 tied-array beams covering the core of the cluster. We obtained phase-connected timing solutions for nine discoveries, covering nearly two decades of archival observations from the Green Bank Telescope for all but one. Highlights include PSR J1748$-$2446ao which is an eccentric ($e = 0.32$) wide-orbit (orbital period $P_{\rm b} = 57.55$ d) system. We were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron ($\dot{\omega}$) for this system allowing us to determine a total mass of $3.17 \pm \, 0.02\, \rm M_{\odot}$. With a minimum companion mass ($M_{\rm c}$) of $\sim 0.8\, \rm M_{\odot}$, PSR J1748$-$2446ao is a candidate double neutron star (DNS) system. If confirmed to be a DNS, it would be the fastest spinning pulsar ($P = 2.27$ ms) and the longest orbital period measured for any known DNS system. PSR J1748$-$2446ap has the second highest eccentricity for any recycled pulsar ($e \sim 0.905$) and for this system we can measure the total mass ($1.997 \pm 0.006\, \rm M_{\odot}$) and also estimate the individual pulsar and companion masses. PSR J1748$-$2446ar is an eclipsing redback (minimum $M_{\rm c} \sim 0.34\, \rm M_{\odot}$) system whose properties confirm it to be the counterpart to a previously published source identified in radio and X-ray imaging. With these discoveries, the total number of confirmed pulsars in Terzan 5 is 49, the highest for any globular cluster so far. These discoveries further enhance the rich set of pulsars known in Terzan 5 and provide scope for a deeper understanding of binary stellar evolution, cluster dynamics and ensemble population studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We observe systematic profile changes in the visible pulsar of the compact double neutron star system PSR~J1946+2052 using observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The interpulse of PSR~J1946+2052 changed from single-peak to double-peak shape from 2018 to 2021. We attribute this evolution as the result of the relativistic spin precession of the pulsar. With the high sensitivity of FAST, we also measure significant polarization for the first time, allowing us to model this with the precessional rotating vector model. Assuming, to the first order, a circular hollow-cone-like emission beam pattern and taking the validity of general relativity, we derive the binary's orbital inclination angle (${63^\circ}^{+5^\circ}_{-3^\circ}$) and pulsar's spin geometry. Pulsar's spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector are found to be only slightly misaligned (${0.21^\circ}^{+0.28^\circ}_{-0.10^\circ}$).The quoted uncertainties do not reflect the systematic uncertainties introduced by our model assumptions. By simulating future observations of profile and polarization evolution, we estimate that we could constrain the precession rate within a $43\%$ uncertainty in 9 years. Hence, we suggest that the system's profile evolution could be combined with precise pulsar timing to test general relativity in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 In the fall of 2019, during the in-flight calibration phase of the SRG observatory, the onboard eROSITA and Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescopes carried out a series of observations of PG 1634+706 - one of the most luminous (an X-ray luminosity $\sim 10^{46}$ erg/s) quasars in the Universe at $z<2$. Approximately at the same dates this quasar was also observed by the XMM-Newton observatory. Although the object had already been repeatedly studied in X-rays previously, its new observations allowed its energy spectrum to be measured more accurately in the wide range $1-30$ keV (in the quasar rest frame). Its spectrum can be described by a two-component model that consists of a power-law continuum with a slope $\Gamma\approx 1.9$ and a broadened iron emission line at an energy of about 6.4 keV. The X-ray variability of the quasar was also investigated. On time scales of the order of several hours (here and below, in the source rest frame) the X-ray luminosity does not exhibit a statistically significant variability. However, it changed noticeably from observation to observation in the fall of 2019, having increased approximately by a factor of 1.5 in 25 days. A comparison of the new SRG and XMM-Newton measurements with the previous measurements of other X-ray observatories has shown that in the entire 17-year history of observations of the quasar PG 1634+706 its X-ray luminosity has varied by no more than a factor of 2.5, while the variations on time scales of several weeks and several years are comparable in amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.

 - **Abstract**
 Mutual gravitational interactions between the five major Uranian satellites raise small quasi-periodic fluctuations on their orbital elements. At the same time, tidal interactions between the satellites and the planet induce a slow outward drift of the orbits, while damping the eccentricities and the inclinations. In this paper, we revisit the current and near past evolution of this system using a N-body integrator, including spin evolution and tidal dissipation with the weak friction model. We update the secular eigenmodes of the system and show that it is unlikely that any of the main satellites were recently captured into a high obliquity Cassini state. We rather expect that the Uranian satellites are in a low obliquity Cassini state and compute their values. We also show that the current eccentricities of the satellites are not forced, and estimate the free eccentricities and inclinations. We constrain the quality factor of Uranus to be $Q_U = (8.6 \pm 2.9)\times10^3$, and that of the satellites to be $Q_S \sim 500$. We find that the system most likely encountered the 5/3 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel in the past, at about ($0.7\pm0.2$) Gyr ago. We additionally determine the eccentricities and inclinations of all satellites just after the resonance passage that comply with the current system. We finally show that, from the crossing of the 5/3 MMR to the present, the evolution of the system is mostly peaceful and dominated by tides raised on Uranus by the satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 At present, the main satellites of Uranus are not involved in any low order mean motion resonance (MMR). However, owing to tides raised in the planet, Ariel and Umbriel most likely crossed the 5/3 MMR in the past. Previous studies on this resonance passage relied on limited time-consuming N-body simulations or simplified models focusing solely on the effects of the eccentricity or the inclination. In this paper, we aim to provide a more comprehensive view on how the system evaded capture in the 5/3 MMR. For that purpose, we developed a secular resonant two-satellite model with low eccentricities and low inclinations, including tides using the weak friction model. By performing a large number of numerical simulations, we show that capture in the 5/3 MMR is certain if the initial eccentricities of Ariel, $e_1$, and Umbriel, $e_2$, are related through $(e_1^2 + e_2^2)^{1/2} < 0.007$. Moreover, we observe that the eccentricity of Ariel is the key variable to evade the 5/3 MMR with a high probability. We determine that for $e_1 > 0.015$ and $e_2 < 0.01$, the system avoids capture in at least 60\% of the cases. We also show that, to replicate the currently observed system, the initial inclinations of Ariel and Umbriel must lay within $I_1 \leq 0.05^{\circ}$ and $0.06^{\circ} \leq I_2 \leq 0.11^{\circ}$, respectively. We checked these results using a complete N-body model with the five main satellites and did not observe any significant differences.
#### Quasar Island - Three new $z\sim6$ quasars, including a lensed  candidate, identified with contrastive learning

 - **Abstract**
 Of the hundreds of $z\gtrsim6$ quasars discovered to date, only one is known to be gravitationally lensed, despite the high lensing optical depth expected at $z\gtrsim6$. High-redshift quasars are typically identified in large-scale surveys by applying strict photometric selection criteria, in particular by imposing non-detections in bands blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. Such procedures by design prohibit the discovery of lensed quasars, as the lensing foreground galaxy would contaminate the photometry of the quasar. We present a novel quasar selection methodology, applying contrastive learning (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to Dark Energy Survey imaging data. We describe the use of this technique to train a neural network which isolates an 'island' of 11 sources, of which 7 are known $z\sim6$ quasars. Of the remaining four, three are newly discovered quasars (J0109-5424, $z=6.07$; J0122-4609, $z=5.99$; J0603-3923, $z=5.94$), as confirmed by follow-up Gemini-South/GMOS and archival NTT/EFOSC2 spectroscopy, implying a 91 per cent efficiency for our novel selection method; the final object on the island is a brown dwarf. In one case (J0109-5424), emission below the Lyman limit unambiguously indicates the presence of a foreground source, though high-resolution optical/near-infrared imaging is still needed to confirm the quasar's lensed (multiply-imaged) nature. Detection in the g band has led this quasar to escape selection by traditional colour cuts. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning techniques can thus play a key role in unveiling populations of quasars missed by traditional methods.

 We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and 12 $\mu{\rm K-arcmin}$, respectively, in CMB temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ~1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level ~$\sqrt{\text{2}}$ times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential bandpowers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization bandpowers. We demonstrate the ability to test the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ~2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of $N$-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover $N$-body instability times. This points towards a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances (3BRs), generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances (MMRs), overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well-described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semi-major axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the $1/4$ power, rather than the frequently-adopted $1/3$ power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets' orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune mass planets must be spaced with period ratios $\mathcal{P} \gtrsim 1.35$ and that tightly-spaced systems ($\mathcal{P} \lesssim 1.5$) must possess very low eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.05$) to be stable for more than $10^9$ orbits.
