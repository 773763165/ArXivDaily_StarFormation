          X-ray spectro-polarimetric characterization of GX 340+0 in the horizontal branch: a highly inclined source?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of X-ray polarization in the horizontal branch for GX 340+0 as obtained by Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree of 4.3%$\pm$0.3% is obtained. This value is in agreement with the previous polarization measurements of Z-sources in the horizontal branch. Spectro-polarimetric analysis, performed using a broad-band spectral model obtained by NICER and NuSTAR quasi-simultaneous observations, allowed us to constrain the polarization for the soft and hard spectral components typical to these sources. The polarization angle for the two components differs by ${\sim}40°$. This result could be explained by a misalignment of the NS rotations axis with respect to the accretion disk axis. We provide a comparison of the results with polarization expected in different models. Theoretical expectations for the polarization of the disk and the Comptonization components favor an orbital inclination for GX 340+0 higher than 60°, as expected for Cyg-like sources, in contrast with results we report for the reflection component using broad-band spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of Aquarius III, an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy identified in the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey. Based on deeper follow-up imaging with DECam, we find that Aquarius III is a low-luminosity ($M_V = -2.5^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$; $L_V = 850^{+380}_{-260} \ L_{\odot}$), extended ($r_{1/2} = 41^{+9}_{-8}$ pc) stellar system located in the outer halo ($D_{\odot} = 85 \pm 4$ kpc). From medium-resolution Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, we identify 11 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric radial velocity of $v_{\rm sys} = -13.1^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$ for the system and place an upper limit of $\sigma_v < 3.5 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ ($\sigma_v < 1.6 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$) on its velocity dispersion at the 95% (68%) credible level. Based on Calcium-Triplet-based metallicities of the six brightest red giant members, we find that Aquarius III is very metal-poor ([Fe/H]$ = -2.61 \pm 0.21$) with a statistically-significant metallicity spread ($\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.46^{+0.26}_{-0.14}$ dex). We interpret this metallicity spread as strong evidence that the system is a dwarf galaxy as opposed to a star cluster. Combining our velocity measurement with $Gaia$ proper motions, we find that Aquarius III is currently situated near its orbital pericenter in the outer halo ($r_{\rm peri} = 78 \pm 7$ kpc) and that it is plausibly on first infall onto the Milky Way. This orbital history likely precludes significant tidal disruption from the Galactic disk, notably unlike other satellites with comparably low velocity dispersion limits in the literature. Thus, if further velocity measurements confirm that its velocity dispersion is truly below $\sigma_v \lesssim 2 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, Aquarius III may serve as a useful laboratory for probing galaxy formation physics in low-mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 SynCOM is a package of procedures written in IDL (Interactive Data Language) that simulates transient solar wind flows. Each function within SynCOM handles specific tasks, such as initializing parameters, generating synthetic profiles, creating Gaussian blobs to represent solar wind features, and producing high-resolution images of the solar corona. This modular design allows users to call or customize individual functions independently, providing flexibility to adjust simulations to different observational or solar wind conditions. The software architecture is designed to facilitate SynCOM, which effectively creates synthetic datasets for testing and verifying feature tracking algorithms. It also takes advantage of the robust capabilities of the IDL for high-performance scientific computing

 - **Abstract**
 It was recently shown that neural networks can be combined with the analytic method of scale-dependent bias to obtain a measurement of local primordial non-Gaussianity, which is optimal in the squeezed limit that dominates the signal-to-noise. The method is robust to non-linear physics, but also inherits the statistical precision offered by neural networks applied to very non-linear scales. In prior work, we assumed that the neural network has access to the full matter distribution. In this work, we apply our method to halos. We first describe a novel two-field formalism that is optimal even when the matter distribution is not observed. We show that any N halo fields can be compressed to two fields without losing information, and obtain optimal loss functions to learn these fields. We then apply the method to high-resolution AbacusSummit and AbacusPNG simulations. In the present work, the two neural networks observe the local population statistics, in particular the halo mass and concentration distribution in a patch of the sky. While the traditional mass-binned halo analysis is optimal in practice without further halo properties on AbacusPNG, our novel formalism easily allows to include additional halo properties such as the halo concentration, which can improve $f_{NL}$ constraints by a factor of a few. We also explore whether shot noise can be lowered with machine learning compared to a traditional reconstruction, finding no improvement for our simulation parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we explore the applicability of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the task of finding radio transients. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide huge volumes of data in which to detect rare transients; the challenge for astronomers is how to find them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms using 1.3 GHz light curves from the SKA precursor MeerKAT. We make use of three sets of descriptive parameters ('feature sets') as applied to two anomaly detection techniques in the Astronomaly package and analyse our performance by comparison with citizen science labels on the same dataset. By using transients found by volunteers as our ground truth, we demonstrate that anomaly detection techniques can recall over half of the radio transients in the 10 per cent of the data with the highest anomaly scores. We find that the choice of anomaly detection algorithm makes a minimal (sub-one per cent) level difference, but that feature set choice is crucial, especially when considering available resources for human inspection and/or follow-up. Active learning, where human labels are given for just 2 per cent of the data, improves recall by up to 10 percentage points, depending on the feature-model pair. The best performing feature-model pairs result in a factor of 5 times fewer sources requiring vetting by experts. This is the first effort to apply anomaly detection techniques to finding radio transients and shows great promise for application to other datasets, and as a real-time transient detection system for upcoming large surveys.

          Characterizing the Broadband Reflection Spectrum of MAXI J1803-298 During its 2021 Outburst with NuSTAR and NICER

 - **Abstract**
 MAXI J1803-298 is a transient black hole candidate discovered in May of 2021 during an outburst that lasted several months. Multiple X-ray observations reveal recurring "dipping" intervals in several of its light curves, particularly during the hard/intermediate states, with a typical recurrence period of $\sim7\,\mathrm{hours}$. We report analysis of four NuSTAR observations of the source, supplemented with NICER data where available, over the duration of the outburst evolution covering the hard, intermediate and the soft states. Reflection spectroscopy reveals the black hole to be rapidly spinning ($a_*=0.990\pm{0.001}$) with a near edge-on viewing angle ($i=70\pm{1}°$). Additionally, we show that the light-curve dips are caused by photo-electric absorption from a moderately ionized absorber whose origin is not fully understood, although it is likely linked to material from the companion star impacting the outer edges of the accretion disk. We further detect absorption lines in some of the spectra, potentially associated with Fe XXV and Fe XXVI, indicative of disk winds with moderate to extreme velocities. During the intermediate state and just before transitioning into the soft state, the source showed a sudden flux increase which we found to be dominated by soft disk photons and consistent with the filling of the inner accretion disk, at the onset of state transition. In the soft state, we show that models of disk self-irradiation provide a better fit and a preferred explanation to the broadband reflection spectrum, consistent with previous studies of other accreting sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Superfast rotators (SFRs) are small solar system objects that rotate faster than generally possible for a cohesionless rubble pile. Their rotational characteristics allow us to make inferences about their interior structure and composition. Here, we present the methods and results from a preliminary search for SFRs in the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP) data set. We find three SFRs from a sample of 686 main-belt asteroids, implying an occurrence rate of 0.4 -0.3/+0.1 percent - a higher incidence rate than has been measured by previous studies. We suggest that this high occurrence rate is due to the small sub-kilometer size regime to which DEEP has access: the objects searched here were as small as 500 m. We compute the minimum required cohesive strength for each of these SFRs and discuss the implications of these strengths in the context of likely evolution mechanisms. We find that all three of these SFRs require strengths that are more than that of weak regolith but consistent with many cohesive asteroid strengths reported in the literature. Across the full DEEP data set, we have identified ~70,000 Main-Belt Asteroids and expect ~300 SFRs - a result that will be assessed in a future paper.

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's atmosphere is comprised of turbulent layers that result in speckled and blurry images from ground-based visible and infrared observations. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are employed to measure the perturbed wavefront with a wavefront sensor (WFS) and correct for these distortions with a deformable mirror. Therefore, understanding and characterising the atmosphere is crucial for the design and functionality of AO systems. One parameter for characterizing the atmosphere is the atmospheric coherence time, which is a function of the effective wind velocity of the atmosphere. This parameter dictates how fast the AO system needs to correct for the atmosphere. If not fast enough, phenomena such as the wind butterfly effect can occur, hindering high-contrast coronographic imaging. This effect is a result of fast, strong, high-altitude turbulent layers. This paper presents two methods for estimating the effective wind velocity, using pseudo-open loop WFS slopes. The first method uses a spatial-temporal covariance map and the second uses the power spectral density of the defocus term. We show both simulated results and preliminary results from the Gemini Planet Imager AO telemetry.

 - **Abstract**
 The Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC) is a web-based tool designed for accessing and retrieving multiwavelength and multimessenger data from blazar this http URL facilitates the construction and interactive visualization of time-resolved multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars by integrating: \textit{(i)} archival data from over 80 catalogs and databases, \textit{(ii)} optical data from all-sky survey facilities such as ASAS-SN, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS, and \textit{(iii)} newly analyzed datasets in the optical/UV band from \textit{Swift}-UVOT, in the X-ray band from \textit{Swift}-XRT and NuSTAR observations, and the high-energy $\gamma$-ray band from \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations. MMDC distinguishes itself from other online platforms by the large quantity of available data. For instance, it includes data from all blazar observations by \textit{Swift} and NuSTAR, as well as the results of detailed spectral analysis in the $\gamma$-ray band during different emission states, covering the period from 2008 to 2023. Another important distinguishing feature of MMDC is its ability to enable precise, self-consistent theoretical modeling of the observed data using machine learning algorithms trained on leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, which consider the injection of particles and all relevant cooling processes. MMDC is an innovative tool which significantly enhances blazar research by providing a comprehensive framework for data accessibility, analysis, and theoretical interpretation, thereby advancing our understanding of blazar emissions and the underlying astrophysical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding solar wind flows is crucial for unraveling the dynamics of the Sun's corona and improving space weather forecasting. However, the complex nature of the solar wind and the absence of reliable ground-truth data present significant challenges to current tracking methods. To address this, the Flow Tracking Challenge was established, providing a platform for testing and refining flow tracking algorithms using synthetic images generated by the Synthetic Coronal Outflow Model (SynCOM). The challenge is divided into two phases: a preliminary phase focusing on simpler flow scenarios and a main phase featuring more complex synthetic images that mimic solar outflows. These phases allow researchers to evaluate their methods under various simulated conditions. SynCOM's synthetic data benchmark improves accuracy in velocity estimations. This paper presents the preliminary results of the Flow Tracking Challenge, where the synthetic images from SynCOM are used to test solar wind velocity tracking methods. Initial findings demonstrate SynCOM's value as a benchmark, guiding improvements for upcoming missions like PUNCH.

          NGC 7314: X-ray Study of the Evolving Accretion Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the timing and spectral properties of NGC 7314, a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy, using X-ray observations from {\it XMM-Newton}, {\it NuSTAR}, and {\it RXTE}/PCA. The timing analysis reveals significant variability across different energy bands, with fractional variability (F$_{\rm var}$) values consistent with previous studies. The highly variable soft photons and comparatively less variable high energy photons imply different origins of these two types. The soft energy photons come from a hot corona near the center, while the high-energy photons are produced by inverse Compton scattering of these primary X-ray photons in a hot plasma away from the central region. The spectral analysis employs various models to characterize the emission components. The results indicate the presence of a soft energy bump, Fe K$\alpha$ line emission, and a prominent reflection component. The long-term {\it RXTE}/PCA data analysis reveals temporal variations in the photon index ($\Gamma$) and power-law flux, suggesting evolving emission properties over time. The signature of both broad and narrow Fe~K$\alpha$ emission line features suggested the broad, variable one coming from the accretion disk ($\sim10^{-5}$~pc), while the non-evolving narrow line can not be well constrained. The absorption feature could originate in a highly ionized region, possibly closer to the broad-line region (BLR). The evolution of the inner accretion properties indicates that NGC 7314 could be a potential changing-state active galactic nuclei.

          Proposed importance of HOCO chemistry: Inefficient formation of CO$_2$ from CO and OH reactions on ice dust

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of JWST ice observations, dedicated studies on the formation reactions of detected molecules are becoming increasingly important. One of the most interesting molecules in interstellar ice is CO$_2$. Despite its simplicity, the main formation reaction considered, CO + OH -> CO$_2$ + H through the energetic HOCO* intermediate on ice dust, is subject to uncertainty because it directly competes with the stabilization of HOCO as a final product which is formed through energy dissipation of HOCO* to the water ice. When energy dissipation to the surface is effective during reaction, HOCO can be a dominant product. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the major product of the reaction is indeed not CO$_2$, but rather the highly reactive radical HOCO. The HOCO radical can later evolve into CO$_2$ through H-abstraction reactions, but these reactions compete with addition reactions, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Our results highlight the importance of HOCO chemistry and encourage further exploration of the chemistry of this radical.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our analysis of supernovae serendipitously found to be radio-bright several years after their optical discovery. We used recent observations from the Australian SKA Pathfinder taken as part of the pilot Variables and Slow Transients and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey programs. We identified 29 objects by cross-matching sources from these ASKAP observations with known core-collapse supernovae below a declination of $+40^{\circ}$ and with a redshift of $z\leq0.15$. Our results focus on eight cases that show potential late-time radio emission. These supernovae exhibit significantly greater amounts of radio emission than expected from the standard model of a single shockwave propagating through a spherical circumstellar medium, with a constant density structure produced by regular stellar mass-loss. We also discuss how we can learn from future ASKAP surveys about the circumstellar environments and emission mechanisms of supernovae that undergo late-time radio re-brightening. This pilot work tested and confirmed the potential of the Variables and Slow Transients survey to discover and study late-time supernova emission.

 - **Abstract**
 MISTRAL is a visible and near infrared imager and spectrograph working with the $1.93m$ telescope at L'Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The goal of the present project is to design and build one custom lens covering the entire working band 370-1000 nm with an enhanced throughput and resolution. The proposed design has the focal length of 100 mm with f/#=2 and consists of 5 lenses with 2 aspheres. It is capable to work in spectroscopy or direct imaging mode with the spectral resolving power up to R590-1675 or energy concentration of 84% within 1 pixel. The throughput varies from 79 to 98% in the main band of 400-1000 nm with a commercial AR coating and could be yet improved with a custom one. We also demonstrate that with this image quality can be maintained in a <10% margin with practically reachable tolerances.

 - **Abstract**
 The composition of a planet's atmosphere is intricately linked to the chemical makeup of the protoplanetary disk in which it formed. Determining the elemental abundances from key volatiles within disks is therefore essential for establishing connections between the composition of disks and planets. The disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 169142 is a compelling target for such a study due to its molecule-rich nature and the presence of a newly-forming planet between two prominent dust rings. In this work, we probe the chemistry of the HD 169142 disk at small spatial scales, drawing links between the composition of the disk and the planet-accreted gas. Using thermochemical models and archival data, we constrain the elemental abundances of volatile carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. Carbon and oxygen are only moderately depleted from the gas phase relative to their interstellar abundances, with the inner 60 au appearing enriched in volatile oxygen. The C/O ratio is approximately solar within the inner disk and rises above this in the outer disk, as expected across the H2O snowline. The gas-phase sulfur abundance is depleted by a factor of 1000, consistent with a number of other protoplanetary disks. Interestingly, the observed SiS emission near the HD 169142 b protoplanet vastly exceeds chemical model predictions, supporting previous hypotheses suggesting its origin in shocked gas or a localised outflow. We contextualise our findings in terms of the potential atmospheric composition of the embedded planet, and highlight the utility of sulfur-bearing molecules as probes of protoplanetary disk chemistry.

          Compact object populations over cosmic time II. Compact object merger rates and masses over redshift from varying initial conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a first study of the impact of varying two components of the initial conditions in binary population synthesis of compact binary mergers - the initial mass function, which is made metallicity- and star formation rate-dependent, and the orbital parameter (orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity) distributions, which are assumed to be correlated - within a larger grid of initial condition models also including alternatives for the primary mass-dependent binary fraction and the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history. We generate the initial populations with the sampling code BOSSA and evolve them with the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS. We find strong suggestions that the main role of initial conditions models is to set the relative weights of key features defined by the evolution models. In the two models we compare, black hole-black hole (BHBH) mergers are the most strongly affected, which we connect to a shift from the common envelope to the stable Roche lobe overflow formation channels with decreasing redshift. We also characterize variations in the black hole-neutron star (BHNS) and neutron star-neutron star (NSNS) final parameter distributions. We obtain the merger rate evolution for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS mergers up to $z=10$, and find a variation by a factor of $\sim50-60$ in the local BHBH and BHNS merger rates, suggesting a more important contribution from initial conditions than previously thought, and calling for a complete exploration of the initial conditions model permutations.

          Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we confront the bound on an ultraviolet cutoff (UV) of a quantum field theory (QFT) proposed by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN) with the latest results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The former relates the UV cutoff with an infrared (IR) cutoff of the theory, only using general entropy arguments. Identifying now the IR cutoff with the Hubble horizon yields a time-varying contribution of the vacuum energy to the dark energy density of the universe. At the same time the DESI results in combination with other cosmological data point towards a preference of time-varying dark energy models with regard to $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Pollux is a project of UV spectropolarimeter proposed as a European contribution for the planned NASA-led Habitable Worlds Observatory. In the present study we consider design options for four spectral channels. The two main channels operate in the range of 118-472 nm. We consider a few design options depending on the hosting telescope size and the approach to correct the aberrations in the camera part and show that the resolving power of R > 90 000 is reachable. In addition, we study 2 other channels: a visible and near infrared spectropolarimeter, which could reach up to 1050 nm or 1800 nm depending on the detector choice, and a far UV channel operating in the range of 100-120 nm. We also provide two design options with different resolution and main disperser type for these channels.

 - **Abstract**
 The MOND modified gravity paradigm, best known for its agreement with galactic rotation curve data, is difficult to devise laboratory tests for. MOND's predictions differ substantially from Newtonian gravity only in the case of very small accelerations ($a < a_0 = 1.2\times10^{-10}~\mathrm{m/s}^2 = 3.8~\mathrm{mm/s/y}$). In the solar system, radio and laser measurements of test bodies do permit acceleration measurements this precise; however, in at least some viable realizations, MOND has an "external field effect" (EFE) which essentially disables the MOND effects in the presence of the inner Milky Way's background gravitational field, invalidating Solar System limits. Can we do any measurement with Solar-System-like acceleration precision, but on a system many kiloparsecs away that avoids the EFE? In this paper, we show that MOND's non-$1/r^2$ gravitational acceleration has a unique and hard-to-fake effect: in contrast to the non-precessing elliptical orbits predicted by two-body Newtonian gravity, in the presence of MOND we expect apsidal precession in two-body systems. An extreme precision apsidal precession detection opportunity is available for eclipsing binaries, where, for some viewing geometries, apsidal precession causes transit time variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). If appropriate binaries can be found and measured, the presence or absence of timing variations may provide a definitive "solar-system-like" test of many EFE-bearing MOND theories like QUMOND.

 - **Abstract**
 An accreting neutron star is potentially the gravitational wave source. In this study, we examine the gravitational wave frequencies from such an object in the steady state, adopting the Cowling approximation. We can derive the empirical relations independently of the mass accretion rate for the frequencies of the fundamental and 1st pressure modes multiplied by the stellar mass as a function of the stellar compactness, together with those for the 1st and 2nd gravity mode frequencies. So, once one simultaneously observes the fundamental (or 1st pressure) and gravity mode frequencies, one could constrain the neutron star mass and radius. In addition, we find that the luminosity can be well characterized by the mass accretion rate independently of the stellar mass and equation of state, if the direct Urca does not work inside the star. Since the luminosity from the neutron star with the direct Urca can deviate from this characterization, one could identify whether the direct Urca process works or not inside the star by observing the luminosity. Both information obtained from the gravitational waves and luminosity help us to understand the equation of state for neutron star matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an adaptation of the exoplanet transit model code batman, in order to permit the generation of X-ray transits. Our underlying extended coronal model assumes an isothermal plasma that is radially symmetric. While this ignores the effect of bright, active regions, observations of transits in X-rays will require averaging across multiple epochs of data for the foreseeable future, significantly reducing the importance of more complex modelling. Our publicly available code successfully generates the predicted W-shaped transit profile in X-rays due to the optically thin nature of the emission, which concentrates the expected observational emission around the limb of the photospheric stellar disc. We provide some examples based on the best known X-ray transit target, HD 189733b, and examine the effect of varying the planet size, coronal temperature, and impact parameter on the resulting transit profile. We also derived scaling relationships for how the overall transit detectability is affected by changing these parameters. Over most of the parameter space, we find that the detectability scales linearly with the cross-sectional area of the planet in X-rays. The relationship with increasing coronal temperature is less fixed, but averages out to a power law with slope $-1/4$ except when the impact parameter is high. Indeed, varying impact parameter has little effect on detectability at all until it approaches unity.

 - **Abstract**
 HARMONI is the first light visible and near-IR integral field spectrograph for the ELT. It covers a large spectral range from 470nm to 2450nm with resolving powers from 3300 to 18000 and spatial sampling from 60mas to 4mas. It can operate in two Adaptive Optics modes - SCAO (including a High Contrast capability) and LTAO - or with NOAO. The project is preparing for Final Design Reviews. The integral field spectrograph is a key sub-system of HARMONI instrument, which forms the 2D spectral image and projects it onto the scientific detector. It has 40 operational modes with different platescales and gratings covering the band of 811-2450 nm with three resolution grades. In each of this configurations the as-built spectrograph wave-front error is strictly limited. We perform the sensitivity analysis for measurable and unknown errors and build the errors budget on this basis. Then we correct the values for the actual technological limits and perform a three-stage Monte-Carlo analysis combined with simulation of a few specific effect as the holographic grating wavefront error. Eventually, we show that it is possible to reach the target image quality in terms of the wavefront error and spectral resolution for the entire sub-system with practically feasible tolerances on design parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Kepler-51 is a $\lesssim 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$-old Sun-like star hosting three transiting planets with radii $\approx 6$-$9\,R_\oplus$ and orbital periods $\approx 45$-$130\,\mathrm{days}$. Transit timing variations (TTVs) measured with past Kepler and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations have been successfully modeled by considering gravitational interactions between the three transiting planets, yielding low masses and low mean densities ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$) for all three planets. However, the transit time of the outermost transiting planet Kepler-51d recently measured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 10 years after the Kepler observations is significantly discrepant from the prediction made by the three-planet TTV model, which we confirmed with ground-based and follow-up HST observations. We show that the departure from the three-planet model is explained by including a fourth outer planet, Kepler-51e, in the TTV model. A wide range of masses ($\lesssim M_\mathrm{Jup}$) and orbital periods ($\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{yr}$) are possible for Kepler-51e. Nevertheless, all the coplanar solutions found from our brute-force search imply masses $\lesssim 10\,M_\oplus$ for the inner transiting planets. Thus their densities remain low, though with larger uncertainties than previously estimated. Unlike other possible solutions, the one in which Kepler-51e is around the $2:1$ mean motion resonance with Kepler-51d implies low orbital eccentricities ($\lesssim 0.05$) and comparable masses ($\sim 5\,M_\oplus$) for all four planets, as is seen in other compact multi-planet systems. This work demonstrates the importance of long-term follow-up of TTV systems for probing longer period planets in a system.

 - **Abstract**
 The MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST allows for probing the molecular gas composition at mid-IR wavelengths at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. It is important to study these features in low-mass embedded protostellar systems since the formation of planets is thought to start in this phase. We present JWST/MIRI-MRS data of 18 low-mass protostellar systems in the JOYS program, focusing on gas-phase molecular lines in spectra extracted from the central protostellar positions. Besides H2, the most commonly detected molecules are H2O, CO2, CO, and OH. Other molecules such as 13CO2, C2H2, 13CCH, HCN, C4H2, CH4, and SO2 are detected only toward at most three of the sources. The JOYS data also yield the surprising detection of SiO gas toward two sources (BHR71-IRS1, L1448-mm) and for the first time CS and NH3 at mid-IR wavelengths toward a low-mass protostar (B1-c). The temperatures derived for the majority of the molecules are 100-300 K, much lower than what is typically derived toward more evolved Class II sources (>500 K). Toward three sources (e.g., TMC1-W), hot (~1000 K) H2O is detected, indicative of the presence of hot molecular gas in the embedded disks, but such warm emission from other molecules is absent. The agreement in abundance ratios with respect to H2O between ice and gas point toward ice sublimation in a hot core for a few sources (e.g., B1-c) whereas their disagreement and velocity offsets hint at high-temperature (shocked) conditions toward other sources (e.g., L1448-mm, BHR71-IRS1). The typical temperatures of the gas-phase molecules of 100-300 K are consistent with both ice sublimation in hot cores as well as high-temperature gas phase chemistry. Molecular features originating from the inner embedded disks are not commonly detected, likely because they are too extincted even at mid-IR wavelengths by small not-settled dust grains in upper layers of the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys provide a promising tomographic probe of the post-reionization era and of the standard model of cosmology. Simulations of this signal are crucial for maximizing the utility of these surveys. We present a fast method for simulating the cosmological distribution of HI based on a halo model approach. Employing the approximate $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ code, we generate the past light cone of dark matter halos. Subsequently, the halos are populated with HI according to a HI-halo mass relation. The nature of 21 cm intensity mapping demands large-volume simulations with a high halo mass resolution. To fulfill both requirements, we simulate a past light cone for declinations between -15° and -35° in the frequency range from 700 to 800 MHz, matching HIRAX, the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment. We run $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ for a 1 h$^{-3}$Gpc$^3$ box with 6700$^3$ simulation particles. With this configuration, halos with masses as low as M$_\text{min}$ = 4.3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$ are simulated, resulting in the recovery of more than 97% of the expected HI density. From the dark matter and HI past light cone, maps with a width of 5 MHz are created. To validate the simulations, we have implemented and present here an analytical dark matter and HI halo model in $\texttt{PyCosmo}$, a Python package tailored for theoretical cosmological predictions. We perform extensive comparisons between analytical predictions and the simulations for the mass function, mass density, power spectrum, and angular power spectrum for dark matter and HI. We find close agreement in the mass function and mass densities, with discrepancies within a few percent. For the three-dimensional power spectra and angular power spectra, we observe an agreement better than 10%.

          TIC 290061484: A Triply Eclipsing Triple System with the Shortest Known Outer Period of 24.5 Days

 - **Abstract**
 We have discovered a triply eclipsing triple-star system, TIC 290061484, with the shortest known outer period, Pout, of only 24.5 days. This "eclipses" the previous record set by lambda Tauri at 33.02 days, which held for 68 yr. The inner binary, with an orbital period of Pin = 1.8 days, produces primary and secondary eclipses and exhibits prominent eclipse timing variations with the same periodicity as the outer orbit. The tertiary star eclipses, and is eclipsed by, the inner binary with pronounced asymmetric profiles. The inclinations of both orbits evolve on observable timescales such that the third-body eclipses exhibit dramatic depth variations in TESS data. A photodynamical model provides a complete solution for all orbital and physical parameters of the triple system, showing that the three stars have masses of 6.85, 6.11, and 7.90 MSun, radii near those corresponding to the main sequence, and Teff in the range of 21,000-23,700 K. Remarkably, the model shows that the triple is in fact a subsystem of a hierarchical 2+1+1 quadruple with a distant fourth star. The outermost star has a period of ~3200 days and a mass comparable to the stars in the inner triple. In ~20 Myr, all three components of the triple subsystem will merge, undergo a Type II supernova explosion, and leave a single remnant neutron star. At the time of writing, TIC 290061484 is the most compact triple system and one of the tighter known compact triples (i.e., Pout/Pin = 13.7).

          Impact of Redshift Space Distortion on Persistent Homology of cosmic matter density field

 - **Abstract**
 By employing summary statistics obtained from Persistent Homology (PH), we investigate the influence of Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) on the topology of excursion sets formed through the super-level filtration method applied to three-dimensional matter density fields. The synthetic fields simulated by the Quijote suite in both real and redshift spaces are smoothed by accounting for the Gaussian smoothing function with different scales. The RSD leads a tendency for clusters ($\tilde{\beta}_0$) to shift towards higher thresholds, while filament loops ($\tilde{\beta}_1$) and cosmic voids ($\tilde{\beta}_2$) migrate towards lower thresholds. Notably, $\tilde{\beta}_2$ exhibits greater sensitivity to RSD compared to clusters and independent loops. As the smoothing scales increase, the amplitude of the reduced Betti number curve ($\tilde{\beta}_k$) decreases, and the corresponding peak position shifts towards the mean threshold. Conversely, the amplitude of $\tilde{\beta}_k$ remains almost unchanged with variations in redshift for $z\in[0-3]$. The analysis of persistent entropy and the overall abundance of $k$-holes indicates that the linear Kaiser effect plays a significant role compared to the non-linear effect for $R \gtrsim 30$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$, whereas persistent entropy proves to be a reliable measure against non-linear influences.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) catalog of "pulsar X-ray filaments," or "misaligned outflows." These are linear, synchrotron radiating features powered by ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons that escape from bow shock pulsars. The filaments are misaligned with the (large) pulsar velocity, distinguishing them from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) trail which is also often visible in CXO ACIS images. Spectral fits and morphological properties are extracted for five secure filaments and three candidates using a uniform method. We present a search of archival CXO data for linear diffuse features; the known examples are recovered and a few additional weak candidates are identified. We also report on a snapshot CXO ACIS survey of pulsars with properties similar to the filament producers, finding no new filaments, but some diffuse emission including one PWN trail. Finally, we provide an updated model for the pulsar properties required to create filaments in light of these new observations.
