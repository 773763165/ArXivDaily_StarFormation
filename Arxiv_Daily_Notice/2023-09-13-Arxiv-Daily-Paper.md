 - **Abstract**
 Planets form in disks of gas and dust around young stars. The disk molecular reservoirs and their chemical evolution affect all aspects of planet formation, from the coagulation of dust grains into pebbles, to the elemental and molecular compositions of the mature planet. Disk chemistry also enables unique probes of disk structures and dynamics, including those directly linked to ongoing planet formation. Here we review the protoplanetary disk chemistry of the volatile elements HOCNSP, the associated observational and theoretical methods, and the links between disk and planet chemical compositions. Three takeaways from this review are: (1) The disk chemical composition, including the organic reservoirs, is set by both inheritance and in situ chemistry. (2) Disk gas and solid O/C/N/H elemental ratios often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation of molecular carriers, chemistry, and dynamics. (3) Chemical, physical, and dynamical processes in disks are closely linked, which complicates disk chemistry modeling, but these links also present an opportunity to develop chemical probes of different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter as scalar particles consisting of multiple species is well motivated in string theory where axion fields are ubiquitous. A two-field fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model features two species of ultralight axion particles with different masses, $m_1 \neq m_2$, which is extended from the standard one-field model with $m_a \sim 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV}$. Here we perform numerical simulations to explore the properties of two-field FDM haloes. We find that the central soliton has a nested structure when $m_2 \gg m_1$, which is distinguishable from the generic flat-core soliton in one-field haloes. However, the formation of this nested soliton is subject to many factors, including the density fraction and mass ratio of the two fields. Finally, we study non-linear structure formation in two-field cosmological simulations with self-consistent initial conditions and find that the small-scale structure in two-field cosmology is also distinct from the one-field model in terms of DM halo counts and soliton formation time.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports the first measurement of the relationship between turbulent velocity and cloud size in the diffuse circumgalactic medium (CGM) in typical galaxy halos at redshift z~0.4-1. Through spectrally-resolved absorption profiles of a suite of ionic transitions paired with careful ionization analyses of individual components, cool clumps of size as small as l_cl~1 pc and density lower than nH = 0.001 cm^-3 are identified in galaxy halos. In addition, comparing the line widths between different elements for kinematically matched components provides robust empirical constraints on the thermal temperature T and the non-thermal motions bNT, independent of the ionization models. On average, bNT is found to increase with l_cl following bNT \propto l_cl^0.3 over three decades in spatial scale from l_cl~1 pc to l_cl~1 kpc. Attributing the observed bNT to turbulent motions internal to the clumps, the best-fit bNT-l_cl relation shows that the turbulence is consistent with Kolmogorov at <1 kpc with a roughly constant energy transfer rate per unit mass of epsilon~0.003 cm^2 s^-3 and a dissipation time scale of <~ 100 Myr. No significant difference is found between massive quiescent and star-forming halos in the sample on scales less than 1 kpc. While the inferred epsilon is comparable to what is found in CIV absorbers at high redshift, it is considerably smaller than observed in star-forming gas or in extended line-emitting nebulae around distant quasars. A brief discussion of possible sources to drive the observed turbulence in the cool CGM is presented.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation of haloes forms from the collapse of the smallest peaks in the initial density field. $N$-body simulations of this process suggest a prompt formation of a steep power-law cusp, but these calculations are plagued by numerical artifacts which casts some doubt on this result. Here, we develop new simulation methods based on the dark matter phase-space sheet approach and present results which are entirely free of artificial clumps. We find that a cusp with density $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ is indeed formed promptly, subsequently accreting a more extended halo and participating in the hierarchical growth of later halo generations. However, our simulations also suggest that the presence of artificial clumps just before peak collapse can significantly shallow the inner profiles of the cusps. We use $N$-body simulations with controlled amounts of small-scale power to place a conservative upper limit on the scales affected by artificial clumps. Finally, we used these results to simulate the collapse of the first generation of peaks of various types and in different cosmologies, finding prompt cusps to form in all cases. We conclude that prompt cusps are a generic feature of the collapse of peaks on the free-streaming scale of the initial density field, and their structure can safely be studied using $N$-body simulations provided care is taken to excise the region potentially affected by artificial clumps.
#### Librating Kozai-Lidov Cycles with a Precessing Quadrupole Potential are  Analytically Approximately Solved

 - **Abstract**
 The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a slightly aligned precessing quadrupole potential is investigated analytically for librating Kozai-Lidov cycles (KLCs). \citet{klein2023} presented an analytic solution for the approximate dynamics on a very long timescale developed in the neighborhood of the KLCs fixed point where the eccentricity vector is close to unity and aligned (or anti aligned) with the quadrupole axis and for a precession rate equal to the angular frequency of the secular Kozai-Lidov Equations around this fixed point. In this Letter, we generalize the analytic solution to encompass a wider range of precession rates. We show that the analytic solution approximately describes the quantitative dynamics for systems with librating KLCs for a wide range of initial conditions, including values that are far from the fixed point which is somewhat unexpected. In particular, using the analytic solution we map the strikingly rich structures that arise for precession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few). We also derive an exact global constant of motion for a precessing quadrupole potential which is not restricted to close alignments or to librating KLCS, by transforming back and forth to a rotating reference frame.
#### New evidence about HW Vir's circumbinary planets from  \textit{Hipparcos-Gaia} astrometry and a reanalysis of the eclipse timing  variations using nested sampling

 - **Abstract**
 The post common-envelope eclipsing binary HW Virginis has had many circumbinary companions proposed based on eclipse timing variations. Each proposed solution has lacked in predictability and orbital stability, leaving the origin of the eclipse timing variations an active area of research. Leveraging the catalogue of \textit{Hipparcos} and \textit{Gaia} proper motion anomalies, we show there is slight evidence for a circumbinary companion orbiting HW Vir. We place an upper limit in mass for such a companion which excludes some previously claimed companions. We also apply this method to V471 Tauri and confirm the non-detection of a previously claimed brown dwarf. We adapt the {\tt kima} nested sampling code to analyse eclipse timing variations and re-analyse archival data on HW Vir, varying the order of the ephemeris that we fit for and the amount of the data that we use. Although signals are clearly present, we find two signals around 2500 and 4000 day periods that are not coherent between different \textit{chunks} of the data, so are likely to not be of planetary origin. We analyse the whole dataset and find the best solution to contain four signals. Of these four we argue the outermost is the most compatible with astrometry and thus the most likely to be of planetary nature. We posit the other three pseudo-periodic signals are caused by physical processes on the white dwarf. The eventual release of the full \textit{Gaia} epoch astrometry is a promising way to confirm whether circumbinary planets exist around HW Vir (and other similar systems), and explore white dwarf physics.
#### Role of ionizing background on the non-thermal broadening inferred for  the aligned absorbers

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05717
 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations at $z\sim0.5$ we identify the aligned absorbers and measure the thermal ($b_{t}$) and non-thermal ($b_{nt}$) contribution to the line broadening using OVI and HI absorption lines. We find that the inferred temperature based on $b_{t}$ correlates strongly with the optical depth-weighted kinetic temperature of the absorbing gas albeit with a large scatter. We show this scatter comes from the spread in the kinetic temperature of the gas contributing to the absorption and hence depends on the feedback processes and the ionizing UV background (UVB) used in the simulations. We show the distribution of $b_{nt}$ is also affected by both feedback processes and the ionizing UVB. Therefore, $b_{nt}$ derived using aligned absorbers may not be a good probe of sub-grid turbulence. Instead, the distribution of $b_{t}$ and $b_{nt}$ together with the frequency of occurrence of the aligned absorbers can be used to place additional constraints on the parameters of the simulation for a given assumed UVB.
#### Discovery of An X-ray Photoionized Optical Nebula and A Radio Nebula  Associated with the ULX NGC 4861 X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted long-slit spectroscopic observations and analyzed archival radio data for the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 4861 X-1. Our spectral line analysis unveils that NGC 4861 X-1 is the fourth ULX situated within an X-ray photoionized nebula, following three previous findings made approximately two decades ago. Remarkably, we discover NGC 4861 X-1 also possesses a radio nebula emitting optically thin synchrotron radiation, which contradicts its X-ray photoionization and raises doubts about the four ULXs being a mere coincidence. Instead of gradually accumulating from different bands bit by bit, our multi-band discovery is made all at once. Moreover, we tentatively perceive a faint continuum spectrum of the optical nebula. Further observations are needed to ascertain its radio structures and verify the optical continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 The scale of alpha-element yields is difficult to predict from theory because of uncertainties in massive star evolution, supernova physics, and black hole formation, and it is difficult to constrain empirically because the impact of higher yields can be compensated by greater metal loss in galactic winds. We use a recent measurement of the mean iron yield of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) by Rodriguez et al. (RMN23), $\bar{y}_{\rm Fe}^{\rm cc} =0.058 \pm 0.007 M_\odot$, to infer the scale of alpha-element yields by assuming that the plateau of [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios observed in low metallicity stars represents the yield ratio of CCSN. For a Kroupa IMF and a plateau at [alpha/Fe]=0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg per unit mass of star formation are about equal to the mass fractions of these elements in the sun. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. (2016) CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with $M<40M_\odot$ implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in some models of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and the galaxy mass-metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. For straightforward assumptions, we find that one-zone GCE models with mass-loading factor $\eta\approx 0.6$ evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By requiring that models reach [alpha/Fe]=0 at late times, and assuming a mean Fe yield of $0.7M_\odot$ per Type Ia supernova, we infer a Hubble-time integrated SNIa rate of $1.1\times 10^{-3} M_\odot^{-1}$, compatible with estimates from supernova surveys. The RMN23 measurement provides one of the few empirical anchors for the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields, with wide-ranging implications for stellar and galactic astrophysics.
#### Discovery of A Compact X-ray Object with A 614s Periodicity in the  Direction of the Galactic center

 - **Abstract**
 We report on analysis of X-ray, optical and radio observations of the previously overlooked X-ray source 2CXO\,J174517.0$-$321356 located just 3.2$^{\circ}$ away from the Galactic center. Timing analysis of X-ray observations of the source with \textit{XMM-Newton} reveals periodic pulsations with periods of 1228\,s and 614\,s, with the latter being tentatively considered fundamental. On the other hand, an observation of the object with \textit{NuSTAR} reveals hard thermal-bremsstrahlung spectrum. Inspection of the archival VLT image reveals, however, no obvious optical counterpart down to $\rm{R}>25\,$mag. Observations made with ATCA showed a possible faint radio counterpart with a positive spectral index ($\alpha > 0.51$) between 1--3\,GHz, but follow-up ATCA and VLA observations at frequencies between 4.5--10\,GHz and 3--22\,GHz, respectively, could not detect it. Given the properties in these three bands, we argue that the most likely origin of the X-ray source is emission from a new intermediate polar close to the Galactic center. Alternatively, and less likely, it is an ultra-compact X-ray binary, which is one of the most compact X-ray binaries.
#### A Minimal Model for Understanding Secondary Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 We take a phenomenological approach in a minimal model to understand the spectral intensity of secondary cosmic-ray particles like positrons, antiprotons, Lithium, Beryllium and Boron. Our analysis shows that cosmic rays at $\sim$ GeV energies pass through a significant amount of matter in regions surrounding the sources. This grammage decreases with increasing cosmic-ray energy and becomes negligible beyond $\sim 100$ GeV. During the subsequent propagation in the interstellar medium cosmic rays of all energies up to $\sim 10^5$ GeV/$n$ pass through about 1-2 g cm$^{-2}$ of matter before leaking into the intergalactic medium. It is in the interstellar medium that the bulk of the positrons and antiprotons are generated. Also cosmic-ray nuclei like C, N, and O at all energies generate additional amounts of Li, Be and B nuclei with a spectrum similar to those of C, O etc. The implications of these findings of the minimal model to the observations of gamma rays and also the importance of spatial and temporal discreteness of cosmic-ray sources for modeling cosmic-ray propagation are briefly pointed out.
#### Forming merging double compact objects with stable mass transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Merging double compact objects (CO) represent the inferred sources of every detected gravitational wave (GW) signal, thus modeling their progenitors is important to constrain stellar evolution theory. Stable mass transfer (MT) between a donor star and a black hole is one of the proposed tightening mechanisms to form binary black holes merging within the age of the universe. We aim to assess the potential of stable non conservative mass transfer to produce the pairings of COs: black holes (BHs), neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs). We study the conditions required for mass transfer between a star and a CO to be stable and to lead to merging binary COs. We use published results for the response of the stellar radii to rapid mass loss; coupled with analytical models for orbital evolution, we determine the boundary for unstable MT and the post interaction properties of binaries undergoing stable MT. We investigate the impact of angular momentum loss prescription in the hardening by accounting for isotropic re emission from the accretor vicinity and mass outflow from the Lagrangian point L2. Stable MT in systems with a CO + Roche lobe filling star, in the limit of isotropic re-emission, is shown to be able to form any pair of merging COs apart from WD + BH. Considering mass outflow from L2, the resulting parameter space for GW progenitors is shifted towards smaller initial mass ratios, ruling out the formation of NS + NS while allowing the production of merging WD + BH pairs. We compare our results with single-degenerate binaries and find that conditions for stable MT to operate are present in nature. We show that stable MT in the isotropic re-emission limit can produce merging binary BHs with mass ratios consistent with the majority of inferred sources of the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue. Angular momentum loss from L2 lifts the achievable final mass ratio.
#### Extreme Red-wing Enhancements of UV Lines During the 2022 March 30 X1.3  Solar Flare

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present the study of a compact emission source during an X1.3 flare on 2022-March-30. Within a $\sim41$~s period (17:34:48 UT to 17:35:29 UT), IRIS observations show spectral lines of Mg II, C II and Si IV with extremely broadened, asymmetric red-wings. This source of interest (SOI) is compact, $\sim$ 1\arcsec.6, and is located in the wake of a passing ribbon. Two methods were applied to measure the Doppler velocities associated with these red wings: spectral moments and multi-Gaussian fits. The spectral moments method considers the averaged shift of the lines, which are 85 km s$^{-1}$, 125 km s$^{-1}$ and 115 km s$^{-1}$ for the Mg II, C II and Si IV lines respectively. The red-most Gaussian fit suggests a Doppler velocity up to $\sim$160 km s$^{-1}$ in all of the three lines. Downward mass motions with such high speeds are very atypical, with most chromospheric downflows in flares on the order 10-100 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, EUV emission is strong within flaring loops connecting two flare ribbons located mainly to the east of the central flare region. The EUV loops that connect the SOI and its counterpart source in the opposite field are much less brightened, indicating that the density and/or temperature is comparatively low. These observations suggest a very fast downflowing plasma in transition region and upper chromosphere, that decelerates rapidly since there is no equivalently strong shift of the O I chromospheric lines. This unusual observation presents a challenge that models of the solar atmosphere's response to flares must be able to explain.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme wavefront correction is required for coronagraphs on future space telescopes to reach 1e-8 or better starlight suppression for the direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets in reflected light. Thus, a suite of wavefront sensors working in tandem with active and adaptive optics are used to achieve stable, nanometer-level wavefront control over long observations. In order to verify wavefront control systems comprehensive and accurate integrated models are needed. These should account for any sources of on-orbit error that may degrade performance past the limit imposed by photon noise. An integrated model of wavefront sensing and control for a space-based coronagraph was created using geometrical raytracing and physical optics propagation methods. Our model concept consists of an active telescope front end in addition to a charge-6 vector vortex coronagraph instrument. The telescope uses phase retrieval to guide primary mirror bending modes and secondary mirror position to control the wavefront error within tens of nanometers. The telescope model is dependent on raytracing to simulate these active optics corrections for compensating the wavefront errors caused by misalignments and thermal gradients in optical components. Entering the coronagraph, a self-coherent camera is used for focal plane wavefront sensing and digging the dark hole. We utilize physical optics propagation to model the coronagraph's sensitivity to mid and high-order wavefront errors caused by optical surface errors and pointing jitter. We use our integrated models to quantify expected starlight suppression versus wavefront sensor signal-to-noise ratio.
#### Not empty enough: a local void cannot solve the $H_0$ tension

 - **Abstract**
 We review arguably the simplest solution for the Hubble tension -- the possibility that we live in a void. In this scenario, the local Hubble constant $H_0$ is higher than the global value, thus potentially explaining why $H_0$ measured locally by the distance ladder including Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) would be larger than the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background and other cosmological probes. In addition, since the local supernova sample is sparse and highly inhomogeneous, the error bars in the local Hubble constant might be larger than previously estimated. These two effects -- local matter density and sample inhomogeneity -- constitute the sample variance (or the cosmic variance) of the local Hubble constant measurements. To investigate these effects explicitly, we have mocked up SNIa observations by exactly matching their actual spatial distribution in a large N-body simulation. We have then investigated whether the sample variance is large enough to explain the Hubble tension. The answer is resoundingly negative: the typical local variation in $H_0$ is far smaller than what would be required to explain the Hubble tension; the latter would require a 20-$\sigma$ deviation from the expected sample variance. Equivalently, the void required to explain the Hubble tension would need to be so empty ($\delta\approx-0.8$ on a scale 120 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) that it would be incompatible with the large-scale structure in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Therefore, the possibility that we live in a void does not come close to explaining the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Enhancements of primordial curvature fluctuations in single field inflation often involve departures from attractor trajectories in the phase space. We study enhancement/suppression of primordial fluctuations in one of the simplest models with exact background solutions for arbitrary initial conditions: a single field inflationary model with a piecewise exponential potential. We then present close to exact analytical solutions for primordial fluctuations in a general transition between two slow-roll attractors, valid whether the first slow parameter increases or decreases. The main features in the primordial spectrum are determined by the ratio of exponents of the potential. We also discuss the imprint of such features in the induced GW spectrum. Lastly, we apply the $\delta N$ formalism to discuss non-Gaussianities and the tail of the probability distribution. We find that while non-Gaussianities are at most ${\cal O}(1)$ in the case of enhancement, they can be very large in the case of suppression. Our work can be easily generalized to multiple piecewise exponential potentials.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop an analytic model for the mass of the first stars forming in the center of primordial gas clouds as a function of host halo mass, redshift, and degree of rotation. The model is based on the estimation of key timescales determining the following three processes: the collapse of the gas cloud, the accretion onto the protostellar core, and the radiative feedback of the protostellar core. The final stellar mass is determined by the total mass accreted until the radiative feedback halts the accretion. The analytic estimation, motivated by the result of the full numerical simulations, leads to algebraic expressions allowing an extremely fast execution. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the stellar mass scale and its parameter dependences observed in state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations. This work clarifies the basic physical principles undergirding such numerical treatments and provides a path to efficiently calibrating numerical predictions against eventual observations of the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Type III radio bursts are not only the most intense but also the most frequently observed solar radio bursts. However, a number of their defining features remain poorly understood. Observational limitations, such as a lack of sufficient spectral and temporal resolution, have hindered a full comprehension of the emission process, especially in the hecto-kilometric wavelengths. Of particular difficulty is the ability to detect the harmonics of type III radio bursts. Hereafter we report for the first detailed observations of type III fundamental-harmonic pairs in the hecto-kilometric wavelengths, observed by the Parker Solar Probe. We present the statistical analysis of spectral characteristics and the polarization measurements of the fundamental-harmonic pairs. Additionally, we quantify various characteristic of the fundamental-harmonic pairs, such as the time-delay and time-profile asymmetry. Our report and preliminary analysis conclude that fundamental-harmonic pairs constitute a majority of all type III radio bursts observed during close encounters 6 -- 10 when the probe is in close proximity to the source region and propagation effects are less pronounced.
#### Tracing Evolution in Massive Protostellar Objects (TEMPO) -- I:  Fragmentation and emission properties of massive star-forming clumps in a  luminosity limited ALMA sample

 - **Abstract**
 The role of massive ($\geq$ 8M$_{\odot}$) stars in defining the energy budget and chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in their host galaxy is significant. In this first paper from the Tracing Evolution in Massive Protostellar Objects (TEMPO) project we introduce a colour-luminosity selected (L$_*$ $\sim$ 3$\times10^3$ to 1$\times10^5$ L$_{\odot}$) sample of 38 massive star forming regions observed with ALMA at 1.3mm and explore the fragmentation, clustering and flux density properties of the sample. The TEMPO sample fields are each found to contain multiple fragments (between 2-15 per field). The flux density budget is split evenly (53%-47%) between fields where emission is dominated by a single high flux density fragment and those in which the combined flux density of fainter objects dominates. The fragmentation scales observed in most fields are not comparable with the thermal Jeans length, $\lambda_J$, being larger in the majority of cases, suggestive of some non-thermal mechanism. A tentative evolutionary trend is seen between luminosity of the clump and the `spectral line richness' of the TEMPO fields; with 6.7GHz maser associated fields found to be lower luminosity and more line rich. This work also describes a method of line-free continuum channel selection within ALMA data and a generalised approach used to distinguishing sources which are potentially star-forming from those which are not, utilising interferometric visibility properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The LambdaCDM model is the most commonly accepted framework in modern cosmology. However, the local measurements of the Hubble constant, H0, via the Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) calibrated on Cepheids provide a value which is in significant disagreement, from 4 to 6 sigma, with the value of H0 inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observed by Planck. This disagreement is the so-called Hubble constant tension. To find out the reason for this discrepancy, we analyze the behaviour of the H0 in the Pantheon sample of SNe Ia through a binning approach: we divide the Pantheon into 3 and 4 bins ordered with redshift (z), and for each of them, we estimate the H0. After the H0 estimation, we fit the H0 values with a decreasing function of z, finding out that H0 undergoes a slow decreasing trend compatible with the evolution scenario in 2.0 sigma. [...] Together with SNe Ia, more astrophysical probes such as quasars (QSO) [...] and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) [...], are needed to tackle the H0 tension. In the realm of GRB-cosmology, one of the most promising correlations is the fundamental plane relation [...]. In the context of applying this relation as a cosmological tool, we also compute how many GRBs must be gathered to reach the same precision as the SNe Ia. Since we are about two decades away from reaching such precision, we also attempt to find additional correlations for the GRBs associated with SNe Ibc that could be exploited to standardize the class of GRB-SNe Ibc in the future. We find a hint of a correlation between the GRBs' end-of-plateau optical luminosity and the SNe's rest-frame peak time, suggesting that the GRBs with the most luminous optical plateau emission are associated with SNe with the most delayed peaks in their light curves. So far, it is the fundamental plane relation to be the most promising candle for exploring the high-z universe.

 - **Abstract**
 AH Her is a Z Cam-type dwarf nova with an orbital period of ~ 0.258 d. Dwarf nova oscillations and long-period dwarf nova oscillations have been detected, but no quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and negative superhumps (NSHs) have been found. We investigated the association between NSHs, QPOs, and outbursts of AH Her based on \textit{TESS} photometry. We find for the first time the NSHs with a period of 0.24497(1) d in AH Her, and trace the variation of the amplitude and period of NSHs with the outburst. The amplitude of the NSHs is most significant at quiescence, weakening as the outburst rises, becoming undetectable at the top, rebounding and weakening at the plateau, and strengthening again as the outburst declines. The variation of the accretion disk radius can explain the NSHs amplitude variation except for the plateau, so we suggest that the relationship between NSHs amplitude and outburst can be used as a window to study the accretion disk instability and the origin of NSHs. In addition, we find the periodic variations in the amplitude, maxima, and shape of the NSHs ranging from 2.33(2) d to 2.68(5) d, which may be related to the precession of the tilted disk. Finally, we find QPOs at the top of AH Her's long outburst with ~ 2800 s similar to HS 2325+8205, suggesting that the presence of QPOs at the top of Z Cam's long outburst may be a general phenomenon

 - **Abstract**
 The CORSIKA 8 project aims to develop a versatile and modern framework for particle shower simulations that meets the new needs of experiments and addresses the caveats of existing codes. Of particular relevance is the ability to compute particle showers that pass through two or more different media, of varying density, in a single run within a single code. CORSIKA 8 achieves this flexibility by using a volume tree that specifies volume containment, allowing one to quickly query to which medium a point belongs. Thanks to this design we are able to construct very specific environments with different geometries and media. As an example, we demonstrate this new functionality by running particle showers penetrating from air into Antarctic ice and validating them with a combination of the well-established CORSIKA 7 and GEANT4 codes.

 Large scientific collaborations, often with hundreds or thousands of members, are an excellent opportunity for a case study in best practices implemented while developing open source hardware. Using a publicly available design of timing equipment for gravitational wave detectors as a case study, we evaluated many facets of the open source hardware development, including practices, awareness, documentation, and longevity. Two diverse student teams, composed of high school and college students, participated in an end-to-end exercise of testing publicly-available documented hardware that originated from more than a decade ago. We found that the primary value of large collaborations lie in the ability to cultivate teamwork, provide a diverse set of role-models, and explore the possibilities of open hardware development of varying complexities. Learning from the experiences of the student groups, we make constructive recommendations where the open source hardware community can learn from the collaborations and vice versa.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant (SNR) DA 530 with the PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV follows a power law model with an index of 2.23. The much more extended $\gamma$-ray emission than the radio shell of DA 530 and the spatial coincidence with the molecular cloud suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission could be originated from the hadronic process, where the high energy protons are accelerated in and escaped from the shock of DA 530. With a steady-state injection model of protons, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum can be well fitted with the typical Galactic value for diffusion coefficient and the low energy content of the total escaped protons.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first constraints on the cross-correlation power spectrum of HeII-HeIII ($^{+}{\rm He}^3$) reionization using the redshifted 8.67GHz hyperfine transition between z=2.9 and z=4.1 and with interferometric data obtained from the public archive of the Australia Telescope Compact Array. 210 hours of observations of the primary calibrator source B1934-638 were extracted from data obtained with the telescope from 2014--2021, and coherently combined in a power spectrum pipeline to measure the HeII power across a range of spatial scales, and at three redshifts that span the period of Helium reionization. Our best limit places the brightness temperature fluctuation to be less than 557$\mu$K on spatial scales of 30 arcmin at z=2.91, and less than 755$\mu$K on scales of 30 arcmin at z=4.14 (2-sigma noise-limited). We measure a temperature of 489$\mu$K at z=2.91. ATCA's few antennas and persistent remaining RFI in the data prevent deeper integrations improving the results. This work is a proof of principle to demonstrate how this type of experiment can be undertaken to reach the 1--10$\mu$K level expected for the Helium signal at z~4.

 Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) form a mysterious class of variable stars with typical periods of tens of minutes and amplitudes above 0.1 mag. In this work, we present results of a variability search focused on timescales shorter than 1 h, conducted in OGLE-IV Galactic disk fields containing about 1.1 billion stellar sources down to I$\approx$20 mag. Twenty-five BLAPs have been detected, 20 of which are new discoveries. Their periods range from 8.4 min to 62.1 min. We have also found six new eclipsing binary systems with orbital periods from 38.3 min to 121.3 min and five short-period large-amplitude (> 0.17 mag in the I-band) variable stars of unknown type.

 - **Abstract**
 Resolving individual gravitational waves from tens of millions of double white dwarf (DWD) binaries in the Milky Way is a challenge for future space-based gravitational wave detection programs. By using previous data to define the priors for the next search, we propose an accelerated approach of searching the DWD binaries and demonstrate its efficiency based on the GBSIEVER detection pipeline. Compared to the traditional GBSIEVER method, our method can obtain $\sim 50\%$ of sources with 2.5\% of the searching time for LDC1-4 data. In addition, we find that both methods have a similar ability to detect the Milky Way structure by their confirmed sources. The relative error of distance and chirp mass is about 20\% for DWD binaries whose gravitational wave frequency is higher than $4\times10^{-3}$ Hz, even if they are close to the Galactic center. Finally, we propose a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold for LISA to confirm the detection of DWD binaries. The threshold should be 16 when the gravitational wave frequency is lower than $4\times10^{-3}$ Hz and 9 when the frequency range is from $4\times10^{-3}$ Hz to $1.5\times10^{-2}$ Hz.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter discusses three nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond the iron group that are influenced or shaped by neutrino interactions: the v process, the vp process and the r process. These processes are all related to explosive events involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, where an abundant amount of neutrinos are emitted. The interactions of the neutrinos with nucleons and nuclei through both charged-current and neutral-current reactions play a crucial role in the nucleosynthesis processes. During the propagation of neutrinos inside the nucleosynthesis sites, neutrinos may undergo flavor oscillations that can also potentially affect the nucleosynthesis yields. Here we provide a general overview of the possible effects of neutrinos and neutrino flavor conversions on these three heavy-element nucleosynthesis processes.
#### Saturn's Atmosphere in Northern Summer Revealed by JWST/MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn's northern summertime hemisphere was mapped by JWST/MIRI (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) in November 2022, tracing the seasonal evolution of temperatures, aerosols, and chemical species in the five years since the end of the Cassini mission. The spectral region between reflected sunlight and thermal emission (5.1-6.8 $\mu$m) is mapped for the first time, enabling retrievals of phosphine, ammonia, and water, alongside a system of two aerosol layers (an upper tropospheric haze $p<0.3$ bars, and a deeper cloud layer at 1-2 bars). Ammonia displays substantial equatorial enrichment, suggesting similar dynamical processes to those found in Jupiter's equatorial zone. Saturn's North Polar Stratospheric Vortex has warmed since 2017, entrained by westward winds at $p<10$ mbar, and exhibits localised enhancements in several hydrocarbons. The strongest latitudinal temperature gradients are co-located with the peaks of the zonal winds, implying wind decay with altitude. Reflectivity contrasts at 5-6 $\mu$m compare favourably with albedo contrasts observed by Hubble, and several discrete vortices are observed. A warm equatorial stratospheric band in 2022 is not consistent with a 15-year repeatability for the equatorial oscillation. A stacked system of windshear zones dominates Saturn's equatorial stratosphere, and implies a westward equatorial jet near 1-5 mbar at this epoch. Lower stratospheric temperatures, and local minima in the distributions of several hydrocarbons, imply low-latitude upwelling and a reversal of Saturn's interhemispheric circulation since equinox. Latitudinal distributions of stratospheric ethylene, benzene, methyl and carbon dioxide are presented for the first time, and we report the first detection of propane bands in the 8-11 $\mu$m region.

 - **Abstract**
 The overlapping of mean-motion resonances is useful for low or zero-propellant space mission design, but while most related prior work uses a planar CRTBP model, tours of multi-moon systems require using resonances affected by two moons. In this work, we investigate Jupiter-Ganymede unstable 4:3 resonant orbits in a concentric circular restricted 4-body model for the Jupiter-Europa-Ganymede system. We show that despite their high order, secondary resonances between these orbits and Europa have a large effect, especially 11/34, 12/37, 23/71, 25/77, 34/105, and 35/108; we also find strong evidence that the associated resonant islands overlap. We then compute many of the new objects which appear inside the secondary resonances, which gives final confirmation of the secondary resonance overlap.
#### Grain Growth and Dust Segregation Revealed by Multi-wavelength Analysis  of the Class I Protostellar Disk WL 17

 - **Abstract**
 The first step toward planet formation is grain growth from (sub-)micrometer to millimeter/centimeter sizes. Grain growth has been reported not only in Class II protoplanetary disks but also in Class 0/I protostellar envelopes. However, early-stage grain growth occurring in Class 0/I stages has rarely been observed on the protostellar disk scale. Here we present the results from the ALMA Band 3 ($\lambda$ = 3.1 mm) and 7 ($\lambda$ = 0.87 mm) archival data of the Class I protostellar disk WL 17 in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus molecular cloud. Disk substructures are found in both bands, but they are different: while a central hole and a symmetric ring appear in Band 3, an off-center hole and an asymmetric ring are shown in Band 7. Furthermore, we obtain an asymmetric spectral index map with a low mean value of $\alpha$ = 2.28 $\pm$ 0.02, suggestive of grain growth and dust segregation on the protostellar disk scale. Our radiative transfer modeling verifies these two features by demonstrating that 10 cm-sized large grains are symmetrically distributed, whereas 10 $\mu$m-sized small grains are asymmetrically distributed. Also, the analysis shows that the disk is expected to be massive and gravitationally unstable. We thus suggest a single Jupiter-mass protoplanet formed by gravitational instability as the origin of the ring-like structure, grain growth, and dust segregation identified in WL 17.

 - **Abstract**
 MCG-5-23-16 is a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy at redshift z=0.00849. We analyse here the X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, which are the first contemporaneous observations with these two X-ray telescopes. Two reflection features, producing a narrow core and a broad component of the Fe K$\alpha$, are clearly detected in the data. The analysis of the broad iron line shows evidence of a truncated disc with inner radius $R_{\rm in}=40^{+23}_{-16}$ $R_g$ and an inclination of $41^{+9}_{-10}$ $^\circ$. The high quality of the NuSTAR observations allows us to measure a high energy cut-off at $E_{\rm cut}=131^{+10}_{-9}$ keV. We also analyse the RGS spectrum, finding that the soft X-ray emission is produced by two photoionised plasma emission regions, with different ionisation parameters and similar column densities. Remarkably, the source only shows moderate continuum flux variability, keeping the spectral shape roughly constant in a time scale of $\sim20$ years.
#### How numerical treatments of the transition region modify energy flux  into the solar corona

 - **Abstract**
 The large temperature gradients in the solar transition region present a significant challenge to large scale numerical modelling of the Sun's atmosphere. In response, a variety of techniques have been developed which modify the thermodynamics of the system. This sacrifices accuracy in the transition region in favour of accurately tracking the coronal response to heating events. Invariably, the modification leads to an artificial broadening of the transition region. Meanwhile, many contemporary models of the solar atmosphere rely on tracking energy flux from the lower atmosphere, through the transition region and into the corona. In this article, we quantify how the thermodynamic modifications affect the rate of energy injection into the corona. We consider a series of one-dimensional models of atmospheric loops with different numerical resolutions and treatments of the thermodynamics. Then, using Alfv\'en waves as a proxy, we consider how energy injection rates are modified in each case. We find that the thermodynamic treatment and the numerical resolution significantly modify Alfv\'en travel times, the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system, and the rate at which energy is injected into the corona. Alarmingly, we find that the modification of the energy flux is frequency dependent, meaning that it may be difficult to compare the effects of different velocity drivers on coronal heating if they are imposed below an under-resolved transition region, even if the sophisticated thermodynamic adaptations are implemented.

 Large language models excel in many human-language tasks but often falter in highly specialized domains like scholarly astronomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroLLaMA, a 7-billion-parameter model fine-tuned from LLaMA-2 using over 300,000 astronomy abstracts from arXiv. Optimized for traditional causal language modeling, AstroLLaMA achieves a 30% lower perplexity than Llama-2, showing marked domain adaptation. Our model generates more insightful and scientifically relevant text completions and embedding extraction than state-of-the-arts foundation models despite having significantly fewer parameters. AstroLLaMA serves as a robust, domain-specific model with broad fine-tuning potential. Its public release aims to spur astronomy-focused research, including automatic paper summarization and conversational agent development.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy neutrinos originating in astrophysical sources should be accompanied by gamma-rays at production. Depending on the properties of the emission environment and the distance of the source to the Earth, these gamma-rays may be observed directly, or through the detection of lower energy photons that result from interactions with the intervening radiation fields. In this work, we present an automated tool that aims at using data from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope to identify multiwavelength counterparts to astrophysical neutrino events. The main goal of this tool is to enable prompt follow-up observations with ground-based and space-based observatories in order to help pinpoint the neutrino source.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate a recent finding based on strong lensing observations, which suggests that the sub-halos observed in clusters exhibit greater compactness compared to those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations. To address this discrepancy, we performed a comparative analysis by comparing the cumulative mass function of sub-halos and the $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation between observed clusters and 324 simulated clusters from The Three Hundred project, focusing on re-simulations using GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA baryonic models. The sub-halos' cumulative mass function of the GIZMO-SIMBA simulated clusters agrees with observations, while the GADGET-X simulations exhibit discrepancies in the lower sub-halo mass range possibly due to its strong SuperNova feedback. Both GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA simulations demonstrate a redshift evolution of the sub-halo mass function and the $V_{max}$ function, with slightly fewer sub-halos observed at lower redshifts. Neither the GADGET-X nor GIZMO-SIMBA(albeit a little closer) simulated clusters' predictions for the $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation align with the observational result. Further investigations on the correlation between sub-halo/halo properties and the discrepancy in the $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation reveals that the sub-halo's half mass radius and galaxy stellar age, the baryon fraction and sub-halo distance from the cluster's centre, as well as the halo relaxation state play important roles on this relation. Nevertheless, we think it is still challenging in accurately reproducing the observed $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation in our current hydrodynamic cluster simulation under the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

 Operating since 2004, the Pierre Auger Observatory has led to major advances in our 8 understanding of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The latest findings have revealed new insights 9 that led to the upgrade of the Observatory, with the primary goal of obtaining information on the 10 primary mass of the most energetic cosmic rays on a shower-by-shower basis. In the framework of the 11 upgrade, called AugerPrime, the 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors of the surface array are equipped 12 with plastic scintillators and radio antennas, allowing us to enhance the composition sensitivity. 13 To accommodate new detectors and to increase experimental capabilities, the electronics is also 14 upgraded. This includes better timing with up-to-date GPS receivers, higher sampling frequency, 15 increased dynamic range, and more powerful local processing of the data. In this paper, the design 16 characteristics of the new electronics and the enhanced dynamic range will be described. The 17 manufacturing and test processes will be outlined and the test results will be discussed. The 18 calibration of the SD detector and various performance parameters obtained from the analysis of 19 the first commissioning data will also be presented.

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances can be determined from stellar spectra, making it possible to study galactic formation and evolution. Accurate atomic data is essential for the reliable interpretation and modeling of astrophysical spectra. In this work, we perform laboratory studies on neutral aluminium. This element is found, for example, in young, massive stars and it is a key element for tracing ongoing nucleosynthesis throughout the Galaxy. The near-infrared (NIR) wavelength region is of particular importance, since extinction in this region is lower than for optical wavelengths. This makes the NIR wavelength region a better probe for highly obscured regions, such as those located close to the Galactic center. We investigate the spectrum of neutral aluminium with the aim to provide oscillator strengths (f-values) of improved accuracy for lines in the NIR and optical regions (670 - 4200 nm). Measurements of high-resolution spectra were performed using a Fourier transform spectrometer and a hollow cathode discharge lamp. The f-values were derived from experimental line intensities combined with published radiative lifetimes. We report oscillator strengths for 12 lines in the NIR and optical spectral regions, with an accuracy between 2 and 11%, as well as branching fractions for an additional 16 lines.

 - **Abstract**
 During the last $\sim$ 30 Myr the nuclear stellar disk in the Galactic center has been the most prolific star forming region of the Milky Way when averaged by volume. Remarkably, the combined mass of the only three clusters present today in the nuclear stellar disk adds up to only $\sim$10\% of the total expected mass of young stars formed in this period. Several causes could explain this apparent absence of clusters and stellar associations. The stellar density in the area is so high that only the most massive clusters would be detectable against the dense background of stars. The extreme tidal forces reigning in the Galactic center could dissolve even the most massive of the clusters in just a few Myr. Close encounters with one of the massive molecular clouds, that are abundant in the nuclear stellar disk, can also rapidly make any massive cluster or stellar association dissolve beyond recognition. However, traces of some dissolving young clusters/associations could still be detectable as co-moving groups. It is our aim to identify so far unknown clusters or groups of young stars in the Galactic Center. We focus our search on known, spectroscopically identified massive young stars to see whether they can pinpoint such structures. We created an algorithm to detect over-densities in the five-dimensional space spanned by proper-motion, position on the plane of the sky and line-of-sight distances, using reddening as a proxy for the latter. Since co-moving groups must be young in this environment, proper motions provide a good means to search for young stars in the Galactic center. We found four co-moving groups around massive stars, two of which are very close in position and velocity to the Arches' most likely orbit

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our previous work on the evolution of close binary systems with misaligned orbital and spin angular momenta resulting from non-dissipative tidal interaction to include all physical effects contributing to apsidal motion. In addition to tidal distortion of the primary by the compact secondary these include relativistic Einstein precession and the rotational distortion of the primary. The influence of the precession of the line of nodes is included. The dependence of the tidal torque on the apsidal angle $\hat\varpi$ couples the apsidal motion to the rate of evolution of the misalignment angle $\beta$ which is found to oscillate. We provide analytical estimates for the oscillation amplitude $\Delta\beta$ over a wide range of parameter space confirmed by numerical integrations. This is found to be more significant near critical curves on which $d{\hat \varpi } /dt=0$ for a specified $\beta$. We find that to obtain $0.1 < \Delta\beta < \sim 1,$ the mass ratio, $q > \sim1$ the initial eccentricity should be modest, $\cos \beta < 1/\sqrt{5},$ with $\cos\beta <0 $ corresponding to retrograde rotation, initially, and the primary rotation rate should be sufficiently large. The extended discussion of apsidal motion and its coupled evolution to the misalignment angle given here has potential applications to close binaries with anomalous apsidal motion as well as transiting exoplanets such as warm Jupiters.
#### Center-to-limb variations in coronal hole and quiet Sun regions obtained  with IRIS spectroscopic observations

 - **Abstract**
 The center-to-limb variations (CLV) of Gaussian fit parameters of the transition region Si~{\sc iv} 1402.77~{\AA} spectral line in quiet Sun (QS) and coronal hole (CH) regions are presented. The results are derived from a full-disk mosaic scan obtained by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph on 24 September 2017. The CLV for a CH transition region line has not previously been reported, and the parameters are found to show variations consistent with the QS. The intensity increases towards the limb, consistent with an increasing plasma column depth due to line-of-sight effects. The Doppler velocity is normalized to be zero at the limb for both QS and CH and increases to $+4.8$~\kms\ (redshift) at disk center for CH and $+5.2$~\kms\ for QS. Non-thermal broadening in the CH decreases from a maximum of 24~\kms\ at the limb to 10~\kms\ at disk center. For QS the broadening decreases from 25~\kms\ at the limb to 14~\kms\ at disk center. Both Doppler velocities and non-thermal velocities vary linearly with $\cos\,\theta$, where $\theta$ is the heliocentric angle. The QS results for both parameters are consistent with earlier work.
#### Quasi-stationary tidal evolution with arbitrarily misaligned orbital and  stellar angular momenta with a preliminary numerical investigation in the  non-dissipative limit

 - **Abstract**
 (Abbreviated) We extend the results of our 2021 paper concerning the problem of tidal evolution of a binary system with a rotating primary component with rotation axis arbitrarily inclined with respect to the orbital plane. Only the contribution of quasi-stationary tides is discussed. Unlike previous studies in this field we present evolution equations derived 'from first principles'. The governing equations contain two groups of terms. The first group of terms determines the evolution of orbital parameters and inclination angles a 'viscous' time scale. The second group of terms is due to stellar rotation. These terms are present even when dissipation in the star is neglected. Unlike in our 2021 paper we consider all potentially important sources of apsidal precession in an isolated binary, namely precession arising from the tidal distortion and rotation of the primary as well as Einstein precession. We solve these equations numerically for a sample of input parameters, leaving a complete analysis to an accompanying paper. Periodic changes to both the inclination of the rotational axis and its precession rate are found. For a particular binary parameters periodic flips between prograde and retrograde rotation are possible. Also, when the inclination angle is allowed to vary, libration of the apsidal angle becomes possible. Furthermore, when the spin angular momentum is larger than the orbital angular momentum there is a possibility of a significant periodic eccentricity changes. These phenomena could, in principle, be observed in systems with relatively large inclinations and eccentricities such as e.g. those containing a compact object. In such systems both large inclinations and eccentricities could be generated as a result of a kick applied to the compact object during a supernova explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present orbital elements for twenty-two single-line binaries, nine of them studied for the first time, determined from a joint spectroscopic and astrometric solution. The astrometry is based on interferometric measurements obtained with the HRCam Speckle camera on the SOAR 4.1m telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile, supplemented with historical data. The spectroscopic observations were secured using Echelle spectrographs (FEROS, FIDEOS and HARPS) at La Silla, Chile. A comparison of our orbital elements and systemic velocities with previous studies, including Gaia radial velocities, show the robustness of our estimations. By adopting suitable priors of the trigonometric parallax and spectral type of the primary component, and using a Bayesian inference methodology developed by our group, we were able to estimate mass ratios for these binaries. Combining the present results with a previous study of other single-line from our team we present a pseudo mass-to-luminosity relationship based on twenty three systems (45 stars) in the mass range 0.6 <= M_Sun <= 2.5. We find a reasonable correspondence with a fiducial mass-to-luminosity relationship. We conclude that our methodology does allow to derive tentative mass ratios for this type of binaries.
