          The remarkable microquasar S26: a super-Eddington PeVatron?

 - **Abstract**
 Context. S26 is an extragalactic microquasar with the most powerful jets ever discovered. They have a kinetic luminosity of $L_{\rm j}\sim5\times 10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. This implies that the accretion power to the black hole should be super-Eddington, of the order of $L_{\rm acc}\sim L_{\rm j}$. However, the observed X-ray flux of this system indicates an apparent very sub-Eddington accretion luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 10^{37}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. Aims. We aim to characterize the nature of S26, explain the system emission, and study the feasibility of super-Eddington microquasars as potential PeVatron sources. Methods. We first analyze X-ray observations of S26 obtained with XMM-Newton and model the super-Eddington disk and its wind. We then develop a jet model and study the particle acceleration and radiative processes that occur in shocks generated near the base of the jet and in its terminal region. Results. We find that the discrepancy between the jet and the apparent disk luminosities in S26 is caused by the complete absorption of the disk radiation by the wind ejected from the super-Eddington disk. The nonthermal X-rays are produced near the base of the jet, and the thermal X-rays are emitted in the terminal regions. The radio emission observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array can be explained as synchrotron radiation produced at the reverse shock in the lobes. We also find that S26 can accelerate protons to PeV energies in both the inner jet and the lobes. The ultra-high energy protons accelerated in the lobes are injected into the ISM with a total power of $\sim 10^{36}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. Conclusions. We conclude that S26 is a super-Eddington microquasar with a dense disk-driven wind that obscures the X-ray emission from the inner disk, and that the supercritical nature of the system allows the acceleration of cosmic rays to PeV energies.

          Forming planetary systems that contain only minor planets

 - **Abstract**
 Estimates of the frequency of planetary systems in the Milky Way are observationally limited by the low-mass planet regime. Nevertheless, substantial evidence for systems with undetectably low planetary masses now exist in the form of main-sequence stars which host debris discs, as well as metal-polluted white dwarfs. Further, low-mass sections of star formation regions impose upper bounds on protoplanetary disc masses, limiting the capacity for terrestrial or larger planets to form. Here, we use planetary population synthesis calculations to investigate the conditions that allow planetary systems to form only minor planets and smaller detritus. We simulate the accretional, collisional and migratory growth of $10^{17}$ kg embryonic seeds and then quantify which configurations with *entirely* sub-Earth-mass bodies ($\lesssim 10^{24}$ kg) survive. We find that substantial regions of the initial parameter space allow for sub-terrestrial configurations to form, with the success rate most closely tied to the initial dust mass. Total dust mass budgets of up to $10^2 M_{\oplus}$ within 10 au can be insufficiently high to form terrestrial or giant planets, resulting in systems with only minor planets. Consequently, the prevalence of planetary systems throughout the Milky Way might be higher than what is typically assumed, and minor planet-only systems may help inform the currently uncertain correspondence between planet-hosting white dwarfs and metal-polluted white dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of young planets (< 300 Myr) is pivotal for understanding planet formation and evolution. We present the 3-5$\mu$m transmission spectrum of the 17 Myr, Jupiter-size ($R$ $\sim$10$R_{\oplus}$) planet, HIP 67522 b, observed with JWST/NIRSpec/G395H. To check for spot contamination, we obtain a simultaneous $g$-band transit with SOAR. The spectrum exhibits absorption features 30-50% deeper than the overall depth, far larger than expected from an equivalent mature planet, and suggests that HIP 67522 b's mass is $<$20 $M_{\oplus}$ irrespective of cloud cover and stellar contamination. A Bayesian retrieval analysis returns a mass constraint of $13.8\pm1.0M_{\oplus}$. This challenges the previous classification of HIP 67522 b as a hot Jupiter and instead, positions it as a precursor to the more common sub-Neptunes. With a density of $<$0.10g/cm$^{3}$, HIP 67522 b is one of the lowest density planets known. We find strong absorption from H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ ($\ge7\sigma$), a modest detection of CO (3.5$\sigma$), and weak detections of H$_2$S and SO$_2$ ($\simeq2\sigma$). Comparisons with radiative-convective equilibrium models suggest supersolar atmospheric metallicities and solar-to-subsolar C/O ratios, with photochemistry further constraining the inferred atmospheric metallicity to 3$\times$10 Solar due to the amplitude of the SO$_2$ feature. These results point to the formation of HIP 67522 b beyond the water snowline, where its envelope was polluted by icy pebbles and planetesimals. The planet is likely experiencing substantial mass loss (0.01-0.03 M$_{\oplus}$ Myr$^{-1}$), sufficient for envelope destruction within a Gyr. This highlights the dramatic evolution occurring within the first 100 Myr of its existence.

          The Cosmic Evolution of the Supermassive Black Hole Population: A Hybrid Observed Accretion and Simulated Mergers Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can grow through both accretion and mergers. It is still unclear how SMBHs evolve under these two channels from high redshifts to the SMBH population we observe in the local universe. Observations can directly constrain the accretion channel but cannot effectively constrain mergers yet, while cosmological simulations provide galaxy merger information but can hardly return accretion properties consistent with observations. In this work, we combine the observed accretion channel and the simulated merger channel, taking advantage of both observations and cosmological simulations, to depict a realistic evolution pattern of the SMBH population. With this methodology, we can derive the scaling relation between the black-hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) and host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and the local black-hole mass function (BHMF). Our scaling relation is lower than those based on dynamically measured $M_\mathrm{BH}$, supporting the claim that dynamically measured SMBH samples may be biased. We show that the scaling relation has little redshift evolution. The BHMF steadily increases from $z=4$ to $z=1$ and remains largely unchanged from $z=1$ to $z=0$. The overall SMBH growth is generally dominated by the accretion channel, with possible exceptions at high mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}\gtrsim10^{8}~M_\odot$ or $M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\odot$) and low redshift ($z\lesssim1$). We also predict that around 25% of the total SMBH mass budget in the local universe may be locked within long-lived, wandering SMBHs, and the wandering mass fraction and wandering SMBH counts increase with $M_\star$.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\tau/m \sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.

          Tidally Heated Sub-Neptunes, Refined Planetary Compositions, and Confirmation of a Third Planet in the TOI-1266 System

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-1266 is a benchmark system of two temperate ($<$ 450 K) sub-Neptune-sized planets orbiting a nearby M dwarf exhibiting a rare inverted architecture with a larger interior planet. In this study, we characterize transit timing variations (TTVs) in the TOI-1266 system using high-precision ground-based follow-up and new TESS data. We confirm the presence of a third exterior non-transiting planet, TOI-1266 d (P = 32.5 d, $M_d$ = 3.68$^{+1.05}_{-1.11} M_{\oplus}$), and combine the TTVs with archival radial velocity (RV) measurements to improve our knowledge of the planetary masses and radii. We find that, consistent with previous studies, TOI-1266 b ($R_b$ = 2.52 $\pm$ 0.08 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_b$ = 4.46 $\pm$ 0.69 $M_{\oplus}$) has a low bulk density requiring the presence of a hydrogen-rich envelope, while TOI-1266 c ($R_c$ = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_c$ = 3.17 $\pm$ 0.76 $M_{\oplus}$) has a higher bulk density that can be matched by either a hydrogen-rich or water-rich envelope. Our new dynamical model reveals that this system is arranged in a rare configuration with the inner and outer planets located near the 3:1 period ratio with a non-resonant planet in between them. Our dynamical fits indicate that the inner and outer planet have significantly nonzero eccentricities ($e_b + e_d = 0.076^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$), suggesting that TOI-1266 b may have an inflated envelope due to tidal heating. Finally, we explore the corresponding implications for the formation and long-term evolution of the system, which contains two of the most favorable cool ($<$ 500 K) sub-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of new and near-future observatories probing the earliest epochs of the Universe has opened the opportunity to investigate the formation and growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs). Additionally, the use of high resolution cosmological simulations to investigate these high-redshift environments is needed to predict the dark matter halos in which these MBH seeds will form. We use the $\textit{Renaissance}$ simulations to analyse the formation and growth of so-called heavy seed black holes. Other past work has investigated the formation and growth of light (black hole) seeds with $\textit{Renaissance}$ and found that these black holes do not grow in the environments in which they reside. In this work we seed MBHs, in post-processing, and track accretion onto the MBHs as well as mergers with other MBHs at high-redshift. We show that the heavy seeds struggle to achieve high accretion rates with only the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim 10^5 \text{M}_\odot$) growing at close to the Eddington limit under optimistic conditions. Despite the lack of significant growth for these early MBHs, the signals from their merger events will be sufficiently strong (SNR $\sim 10^2$) to be probed by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories, such as $\textit{LISA}$. We predict that $\textit{LISA}$ will observe of the order of $10$ MBH merger events per year where the mergers occur at z $\gtrsim$ 10 or at least begin their early inspiral phase at z $\gtrsim$ 10.

 - **Abstract**
 We used new high spectral resolution observations of propynal (HCCCHO) towards TMC-1 and in the laboratory to update the spectral line catalog available for transitions of HCCCHO - specifically at frequencies lower than 30 GHz which were previously discrepant in a publicly available catalog. The observed astronomical frequencies provided high enough spectral resolution that, when combined with high-resolution (~2 kHz) measurements taken in the laboratory, a new, consistent fit to both the laboratory and astronomical data was achieved. Now with a nearly exact (<1 kHz) frequency match to the J=2-1 and 3-2 transitions in the astronomical data, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, a best fit to the total HCCCHO column density of 7.28+4.08/-1.94 x 10^12 cm^-2 was found with a surprisingly low excitation temperature of just over 3 K. This column density is around a factor of 5 times larger than reported in previous studies. Finally, this work highlights that care is needed when using publicly available spectral catalogs to characterize astronomical spectra. The availability of these catalogs is essential to the success of modern astronomical facilities and will only become more important as the next generation of facilities come online.

 - **Abstract**
 The BICEP3 and BICEP Array polarimeters are small-aperture refracting telescopes located at the South Pole designed to measure primordial gravitational wave signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization, predicted by inflation. Constraining the inflationary signal requires not only excellent sensitivity, but also careful control of instrumental systematics. Both instruments use antenna-coupled orthogonally polarized detector pairs, and the polarized sky signal is reconstructed by taking the difference in each detector pair. As a result, the differential response between detectors within a pair becomes an important systematic effect we must control. Additionally, mapping the intensity and polarization response in regions away from the main beam can inform how sidelobe levels affect CMB measurements. Extensive calibration measurements are taken in situ every austral summer for control of instrumental systematics and instrument characterisation. In this work, we detail the set of beam calibration measurements that we conduct on the BICEP receivers, from deep measurements of main beam response to polarized beam response and sidelobe mapping. We discuss the impact of these measurements for instrumental systematics studies and design choices for future CMB receivers.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) detectors provide a highly competitive alternative to charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the latter of which have historically been dominant in optical imaging. sCMOS boast comparable performances to CCDs with faster frame rates, lower read noise, and a higher dynamic range. Furthermore, their lower production costs are shifting the industry to abandon CCD support and production in favour of CMOS, making their characterization urgent. In this work, we characterized a variety of high-end commercially available sCMOS detectors to gauge the state of this technology in the context of applications in optical astronomy. We evaluated a range of sCMOS detectors, including larger pixel models such as the Teledyne Prime 95B and the Andor Sona-11, which are similar to CCDs in pixel size and suitable for wide-field astronomy. Additionally, we assessed smaller pixel detectors like the Ximea xiJ and Andor Sona-6, which are better suited for deep-sky imaging. Furthermore, high-sensitivity quantitative sCMOS detectors such as the Hamamatsu Orca-Quest C15550-20UP, capable of resolving individual photoelectrons, were also tested. In-lab testing showed low levels of dark current, read noise, faulty pixels, and fixed pattern noise, as well as linearity levels above $98\%$ across all detectors. The Orca-Quest had particularly low noise levels with a dark current of $0.0067 \pm 0.0003$ e$^-$/s (at $-20^\circ$C with air cooling) and a read noise of $0.37 \pm 0.09$ e$^-$ using its standard readout mode. Our tests revealed that the latest generation of sCMOS detectors excels in optical imaging performance, offering a more accessible alternative to CCDs for future optical astronomy instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task that involves distinguishing faint planetary signals from the overpowering glare of their host stars, often obscured by time-varying stellar noise known as "speckles". The predominant algorithms for speckle noise subtraction employ principal-based point spread function (PSF) fitting techniques to discern planetary signals from stellar speckle noise. We introduce torchKLIP, a benchmark package developed within the machine learning (ML) framework PyTorch. This work enables ML techniques to utilize extensive PSF libraries to enhance direct imaging post-processing. Such advancements promise to improve the post-processing of high-contrast images from leading-edge astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and extreme adaptive optics systems.

          Q-band Line Survey Observations toward a Carbon-chain-rich Clump in the Serpens South Region

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted Q-band (30 GHz $-$ 50 GHz) line survey observations toward a carbon-chain emission peak in the Serpens South cluster-forming region with the extended Q-band (eQ) receiver installed on the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. Approximately 180 lines have been detected including tentative detection, and these lines are attributed to 52 molecules including isotopologues. It has been found that this position is rich in carbon-chain species as much as Cyanopolyyne Peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1 CP), suggesting chemical youth. Not only carbon-chain species, but several complex organic molecules (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, HCCCHO, CH$_3$CN, and tentatively C$_2$H$_3$CN) have also been detected, which is similar to the chemical complexity found in evolved prestellar cores. The HDCS/H$_2$CS ratio has been derived to be $11.3 \pm 0.5$ %, and this value is similar to the prestellar core L1544. The chemically young features that are similar to the less-dense starless core TMC-1 CP ($10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ $-$ $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) and chemically evolved characters which resemble the dense prestellar core L1544 ($\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) mean that the clump including the observed position is a pre-cluster clump without any current star formation activity.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been widely accepted that mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae or electron-capture supernovae. Previous work has shown that the accretion rate could affect the elemental abundance on the outer layers of CO WDs, and therefore affect the observational characteristics after they exploded as SNe Ia. However, it has not been well studied how elemental abundance changes on the outer layers of He-accreting ONe WDs as they approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In this paper, we investigated the evolution of He-accreting ONe WDs with MESA. We found that a CO-rich mantle will accumulate beneath the He layers resulting from the He burning, after which the ignition of the CO-rich mantle could transform carbon into silicon (Si). The amount of Si produced by carbon burning is strongly anti-correlated with the accretion rate. As the ONe WD nearly approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (Mch) through accretion, it is likely to undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC), resulting in the formation of the neutron star (NS).

          Supernova Remnant Candidates Discovered by the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Sensitive radio continuum data could remove the difference between the number of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy compared to that expected, but due to confusion in the Galactic plane, faint SNRs can be challenging to distinguish from brighter HII regions and filamentary radio emission. Aims. We wish to exploit new SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) radio continuum data, which covers $251°\le l \le 358°$ and $2°\le l \le 61°$ at $|b|\le 1.5°$, to search for SNR candidates in the Milky Way disk. Methods. We also use MIR data from the Spitzer GLIMPSE, Spitzer MIPSGAL, and WISE surveys to help identify SNR candidates. The identified SNR candidate are sources of extended radio continuum emission that lack MIR counterparts, are not known as HII regions in the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, and are not known previously as SNRs Results. We locate 237 new Galactic SNR candidates in the SMGPS data. We also identify and confirm the expected radio morphology for 201 objects listed in the literature as being SNRs and 130 previously-identified SNR candidates. The known and candidate SNRs have similar spatial distributions and angular sizes. Conclusions. The SMGPS data allowed us to identify a large population of SNR candidates that can be confirmed as true SNRs using radio polarization measurements or by deriving radio spectral indices. If the 237 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, it would approximately double the number of known Galactic SNRs in the survey area, alleviating much of the difference between the known and expected populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Around half of the heavy elements in the universe are formed through the slow neutron capture (s-) process, which takes place in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses $1-6\;M_{\odot}$. The nucleosynthetic imprint of the s-process can be studied by observing the material on the surface of binary barium, carbon, CH, and CEMP stars. We study the s-process by observing the luminous components of binary systems polluted by a previous AGB companion. Our radial velocity (RV) monitoring program establishes a collection of binary stars exhibiting enrichment in s-process material for the study of elemental abundances, production of s-process material, and binary mass transfer. From high resolution optical spectra, we measure RVs for 350 stars and derive stellar parameters for 150 stars using ATHOS. For a sub-sample of 24 stars we refine our atmospheric parameters using the Xiru program. We use the MOOG code to compute 1D-LTE abundances of C, Mg, s-process elements Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pb, and Eu to investigate neutron capture events and stellar chemical composition. We estimate dynamical masses by optimising orbits with MCMC techniques in the ELC program, and we compare our results with low-mass AGB models in the FRUITY database. We find enhancements in s-process material in spectroscopic binaries, a signature of AGB mass transfer. We add Mo to the abundance patterns, and for 12 stars we add Pb detections or upper limits. Computed abundances are in general agreement with the literature. Comparing our abundances to the FRUITY yields, we find correlations in s-process enrichment and AGB mass, and agreements in theoretical and dynamically modelled masses. From our high-resolution observations we expand heavy element abundance patterns and highlight binarity in our chemically interesting systems. We investigate evolutionary stages for a small sub-set of our stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origins of massive black hole seeds and their co-evolution with their host galaxy requires studying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and estimating their mass. However, measuring the mass of these IMBHs is challenging due to the high spatial resolution requirement. A spectrophotometric reverberation monitoring is performed for a low-luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4395 to measure the size of the broad line region (BLR) and black hole mass. The data were collected using the 1.3-m Devasthal fast optical telescope (DFOT) and 3.6-m Devasthal optical telescope (DOT) at ARIES, Nainital, over two consecutive days in March 2022. The analysis revealed strong emission lines in the spectra and light curves of merged 5100Å spectroscopic continuum flux ($f_{\mathrm{5100}}$) with photometric continuum V-band and H$\alpha$, with fractional variabilities of 6.38\% and 6.31\% respectively. In comparison to several previous studies with lag estimation $<$ 90 minutes, our calculated H$\alpha$ lag supersedes by $125.0^{+6.2}_{-6.1}$ minutes using ICCF and {\small JAVELIN} methods. The velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\mathrm{line}}$) of the broad line clouds is measured to be $544.7^{+22.4}_{-25.1}$ km s$^{-1}$, yielding a black hole mass of $\sim$ $2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\times 10^{4}M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ and an Eddington ratio of 0.06.

 - **Abstract**
 Ram pressure stripping of the spiral galaxy ESO 137-001 within the highly dynamical intracluster medium (ICM) of the Norma cluster lead to spectacular extraplanar CO, optical, H$\alpha$, UV, and X-ray emission. The Halpha and X-ray tails extend up to 80 kpc from the galactic disk. Dynamical simulations of the ram pressure stripping event are presented to investigate the physics of the stripped gas and its ability to from stars, to predict HI maps, and to constrain the orbit of ESO 137-001 within the Norma cluster. Special care was taken for the stripping of the diffuse gas. In a new approach, we analytically estimate the mixing between the intracluster and interstellar media. Different temporal ram pressure profiles and the ICM-ISM mixing rate were tested. Three preferred models show most of the observed multi-wavelength characteristic of ESO 137-001. Our highest-ranked model best reproduces the CO emission distribution, velocity for distances <~ 20 kpc from the galactic disk, and the available NUV observations. The second and third preferred models reproduce best the available X-ray and Halpha observations of the gas tail including the Halpha velocity field. The angle between the direction of the galaxy's motion and the galactic disk is between 60 and 75 degrees. Ram pressure stripping thus occurs more face-on. The existence of a two-tail structures is a common feature in our models. It is due to the combined action of ram pressure and rotation together with the projection of the galaxy on the sky. Our modelling of the Halpha emission caused by ionization through thermal conduction is consistent with observations. HI emission distributions for the different models are predicted. Based on the 3D velocity vector derived from our dynamical model we derive a galaxy orbit, which is close to unbound.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present PyBlastAfterglow, a modular C++ code with a Python interface to model light curves and sky maps of gamma-ray burst afterglows. The code is open-source, modular, and sufficiently fast to perform parameter grid studies. PyBlastAfterglow is designed to be easily extendable and used as a testing bed for new physics and methods related to gamma-ray burst afterglows. For the dynamical evolution of relativistic ejecta, a thin-shell approximation is adopted, where both forward and reverse shocks are included self-consistently, as well as lateral structure, lateral spreading, and radiation losses. Several models of the shock microphysics are implemented, including a fully numerical model of the downstream electron distribution evolution, synchrotron emission, self-absorption, and synchrotron self-Compton emission under the one-zone approximation. Thus, the code is designed to be able to model complex afterglows that include emission from reverse shock, very high energy emission, structured jets, and off-axis observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of a transiting giant planet around the 3500 K M3-dwarf star TOI-6383A located 172 pc from Earth. It was detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and confirmed by a combination of ground-based follow-up photometry and precise radial velocity measurements. This planet has an orbital period of $\sim$1.791 days, mass of 1.040$\pm$0.094 $M_J$ and a radius of 1d.008$^{+0.036}_{-0.033} ~R_J$, resulting in a mean bulk density of 1.26$^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$ g cm$^{-3}$. TOI-6383A has an M-dwarf companion star, TOI-6383B, which has a stellar effective temperature $T_{eff}$ $\sim$ 3100 K and a projected orbital separation of 3100 AU. TOI-6383A is a low-mass dwarf star hosting a giant planet and is an intriguing object for planetary evolution studies due to its high planet-to-star mass ratio. This discovery is part of the \textit{Searching for Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS)} Survey, intending to provide robust and accurate estimates of the occurrence of GEMS and the statistics on their physical and orbital parameters. This paper presents an interesting addition to the small number of confirmed GEMS, particularly notable since its formation necessitates massive, ust-rich protoplanetary discs and high accretion efficiency ($>$ 10\%).

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a short, large amplitude X-ray flare from AT2019vcb (aka Tormund), a tidal disruption event at $z=0.088$. The discovery is based on the data from the SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope which happened to observe the source seven months after the onset of the optical TDE. eROSITA observation occurred 13 days after a soft flare was detected in the XMM-Newton data by Quintin et al. 2023. Both events bear similar characteristics in terms of timing and spectral properties. eROSITA spectrum is described as an accretion disk with a characteristic temperature of $\sim180$ eV and luminosity $\sim8\times10^{43}$ erg/s. The eROSITA flare lasted less than 12 hours and had an amplitude $\ge70$ with respect to the quiescent level, no flares were detected in later eROSITA observations (6-18 months later). The XMM-Newton and eROSITA flares provide strong evidence that the TDE AT2019vcb is a bona fide QPE source. Our work further strengthens the direct connection between TDEs and QPE following similar recent results in a TDE AT2019qiz by Nicholl et al. 2024.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the temporal analysis of the persistent neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS LMXB) GX 13+1 using NICER data. Classification of this source has been ambiguous so far. We investigate the evolution of the source in its hardness-intensity diagram (HID) and power density spectra (PDS) of the 0.5-10 keV NICER archival data. For the first time, we detect the source tracing out the entire Z-track, distinctly identifying the horizontal branch (HB), normal branch (NB) and flaring branch (FB). We also detect a peaked noise component in the PDS at $\sim$ 5.4 Hz, which appears to be present when the source is either in the NB or FB. We note a positive slope of the HB in the HID which could be due to either the high intrinsic absorption of the source or the stronger contribution of the soft spectral components in the soft energy domain.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G<16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G<16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass <13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass <13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.

          SOFIA/upGREAT far-infrared spectroscopy of bright rimmed pillars in IC 1848

 - **Abstract**
 Using the upGREAT instrument on SOFIA, we have imaged the [C II] 158 {\mu}m fine structure line emission in bright-rimmed pillars located at the southern edge of the IC1848 H II region, and carried out pointed observations of the [O I] 63 and 145 {\mu}m fine structure lines toward selected positions. The observations are used to characterize the morphology, velocity field, and the physical conditions in the G1 - G3 filaments. The velocity-resolved [C II] spectra show evidence of a velocity shift at the head of the brightest G1 filament, possibly caused by radiation pressure from the impinging UV photons or the rocket effect of the evaporating gas. Archival Herschel PACS and SPIRE data imply H2 column densities in the range 10^{21} - 10^{22} cm^{-2}, corresponding to maximum visual extinction AV = 10 mag, and average H2 volume density of about 4500 cm^{-3} in the filaments. The [C II] emission traces ~ 17% of the total H2 column density, as derived from dust SED fits. PDR models are unable to explain the observed line intensities of the two [O I] fine structure lines in IC1848, with the observed [O I] 145 {\mu}m line being too strong compared to the model predictions. The [O I] lines in IC1848 are overall weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is limited. However, our observations suggest that the [O I] 63/145 {\mu}m intensity ratio is a sensitive probe of the physical conditions in photon dominated regions such as IC1848. These lines are thus excellent targets for future high-altitude balloon instruments, less affected by telluric absorption.

 We show that a universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.

          Dynamical Dark Energy Beyond Planck? Constraints from multiple CMB probes, DESI BAO and Type-Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, when combined with Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae, suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) at a significance level ranging from $2.5\sigma$ to $3.9\sigma$. In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found, although the parameter uncertainties are significantly larger compared to both Planck- and ACT-based constraints. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\ell \lesssim 30$.

          Humps on the profiles of the radial-velocity distribution and the age of the Galactic bar

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the model of the Galaxy with a bar which reproduces well the distributions of the observed radial, VR, and azimuthal, VT, velocities derived from the Gaia DR3 data along the Galactocentric distance R. The model profiles of the distributions of the velocity VR demonstrate a periodic increase and the formation of a hump (elevation) in the distance range of 6--7 kpc. The average amplitude and period of variations in the velocity VR are A=1.76 +/- 0.15 km s-1 and P=2.1 +/- 0.1 Gyr. We calculated angles theta_01, theta_02 and theta_03 which determine orientations of orbits relative to the major axis of the bar at the time intervals: 0--1, 1--2 and 2--3 Gyr from the start of simulation. Stars whose orbits change orientations as follows: 0 <theta_01< 45 degrees, -45 <theta_02< 0 degrees and 0 <theta_03< 45 degrees, make a significant contribution to the hump formation. The fraction of orbits trapped into libration among orbits lying both inside and outside the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) is 28%. The median period P of long-term variations in the angular momentum and total energy of stars increases as Jacobi energy approaches the values typical for the OLR but then sharply drops. The distribution of model stars over the period P has two maxima located at P=0.6 and 1.9 Gyr. Stars with orbits lying both inside and outside the corotation radius (CR) concentrate to the first maximum. The distribution of stars whose orbits lie both inside and outside the OLR depends on their orientation. The fact that the observed profile of the VR-velocity distribution derived from the Gaia DR3 data does not show a hump suggests that the age of the Galactic bar, counted from the moment of reaching its full power, must lie near one of two values: 2.0 +/- 0.3 or 4.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr.

          Effects of the internal temperature on vertical mixing and on cloud structures in Ultra Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical mixing in hot Jupiter atmospheres plays a critical role in the formation and spacial distribution of cloud particles in their atmospheres. This affects the observed spectra of a planet through cloud opacity, which can be influenced by the degree of cold trapping of refractory species in the deep atmosphere. We aim to isolate the effects of the internal temperature on the mixing efficiency in the atmospheres of Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJ) and the spacial distribution of cloud particles across the globe. We couple a simplified tracer based cloud model, picket fence radiative-transfer scheme and mixing length theory to the Exo-FMS general circulation model. We run the model for five different internal temperatures at typical UHJ atmosphere system parameters. Our results show the convective eddy diffusion coefficient remains low throughout the vast majority of the atmosphere, with mixing dominated by advective flows. However, some regions can show convective mixing in the upper atmosphere for colder interior temperatures. The vertical extent of the clouds is reduced as the internal temperature is increased. Additionally, a global cloud layer gets formed below the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) in the cooler cases. Convection is generally strongly inhibited in UHJ atmospheres above the RCB due to their strong irradiation. Convective mixing plays a minor role compared to advective mixing in keeping cloud particles aloft in ultra hot Jupiters with warm interiors. Higher vertical turbulent heat fluxes and the advection of potential temperature inhibit convection in warmer interiors. Our results suggest isolated upper atmosphere regions above cold interiors may exhibit strong convective mixing in isolated regions around Rossby gyres, allowing aerosols to be better retained in these areas.

          An Analytically Tractable Marked Power Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing precision of cosmology data in the modern era is calling for methods to allow the extraction of non-Gaussian information using tools beyond two-point statistics. The marked power spectrum has the potential to extract beyond two-point information in a computationally efficient way while using much of the infrastructure already available for the power-spectrum. In this work we explore the marked power spectrum from an analytical perspective. In particular, we explore a low-order polynomial for the mark that allows us to better control the theoretical uncertainties and we show that with minimal new degrees of freedom the analytical results match measurements from N-body simulations for both the matter field and biased tracers in redshift space. Finally, we show that even within the limited forms of mark that we consider, there are degeneracies that can be broken by inclusion of the marked auto-spectrum or the cross-spectrum with the unmarked field. We discuss future theoretical developments that would enable us to apply this approach to survey data.
