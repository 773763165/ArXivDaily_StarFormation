 - **Abstract**
 On September 26, 2022, NASA's DART spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the secondary asteroid in the (65803) Didymos system, so that the efficiency with which a satellite could divert an asteroid could be measured from the change in the system's period. We present new data from the Thacher Observatory and measure a change in period, $\Delta P = -34.2 \pm 0.1$ min, which deviates from previous measurements by $3.5\,\sigma$. This suggests that the system period may have decreased by $\sim 1$ minute in the 20 to 30 days between previous measurements and our measurements. We find that no mechanism previously presented for this system can account for this large of a period change, and drag from impact ejecta is an unlikely explanation. Further observations of the (65803) Didymos system are needed to both confirm our result and to further understand this system post impact.

 - **Abstract**
 As stellar compositions evolve over time in the Milky Way, so will the resulting planet populations. In order to place planet formation in the context of Galactic chemical evolution, we make use of a large ($N = 5\,325$) stellar sample representing the thin and thick discs, defined chemically, and the halo, and we simulate planet formation by pebble accretion around these stars. We build a chemical model of their protoplanetary discs, taking into account the relevant chemical transitions between vapour and refractory minerals, in order to track the resulting compositions of formed planets. We find that the masses of our synthetic planets increase on average with increasing stellar metallicity [Fe/H] and that giant planets and super-Earths are most common around thin-disc ($\alpha$-poor) stars since these stars have an overall higher budget of solid particles. Giant planets are found to be very rare ($\lesssim$1\%) around thick-disc ($\alpha$-rich) stars and nearly non-existent around halo stars. This indicates that the planet population is more diverse for more metal-rich stars in the thin disc. Water-rich planets are less common around low-metallicity stars since their low metallicity prohibits efficient growth beyond the water ice line. If we allow water to oxidise iron in the protoplanetary disc, this results in decreasing core mass fractions with increasing [Fe/H]. Excluding iron oxidation from our condensation model instead results in higher core mass fractions, in better agreement with the core-mass fraction of Earth, that increase with increasing [Fe/H]. Our work demonstrates how the Galactic chemical evolution and stellar parameters, such as stellar mass and chemical composition, can shape the resulting planet population.

 - **Abstract**
 Humanity has wondered whether we are alone for millennia. The discovery of life elsewhere in the Universe, particularly intelligent life, would have profound effects, comparable to those of recognizing that the Earth is not the center of the Universe and that humans evolved from previous species. There has been rapid growth in the fields of extrasolar planets and data-driven astronomy. In a relatively short interval, we have seen a change from knowing of no extrasolar planets to now knowing more potentially habitable extrasolar planets than there are planets in the Solar System. In approximately the same interval, astronomy has transitioned to a field in which sky surveys can generate 1 PB or more of data. The Data-Driven Approaches to Searches for the Technosignatures of Advanced Civilizations_ study at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space Studies was intended to revisit searches for evidence of alien technologies in light of these developments. Data-driven searches, being able to process volumes of data much greater than a human could, and in a reproducible manner, can identify *anomalies* that could be clues to the presence of technosignatures. A key outcome of this workshop was that technosignature searches should be conducted in a manner consistent with Freeman Dyson's "First Law of SETI Investigations," namely "every search for alien civilizations should be planned to give interesting results even when no aliens are discovered." This approach to technosignatures is commensurate with NASA's approach to biosignatures in that no single observation or measurement can be taken as providing full certainty for the detection of life. Areas of particular promise identified during the workshop were (*) Data Mining of Large Sky Surveys, (*) All-Sky Survey at Far-Infrared Wavelengths, (*) Surveys with Radio Astronomical Interferometers, and (*) Artifacts in the Solar System.
#### Protonated hydrogen cyanide as a tracer of pristine molecular gas

 - **Abstract**
 Protonated hydrogen cyanide, HCNH$^{+}$, plays a fundamental role in astrochemistry because it is an intermediary in gas-phase ion-neutral reactions within cold molecular clouds. However, the impact of the environment on the chemistry of HCNH$^{+}$ remains poorly understood. With the IRAM-30 m and APEX-12 m observations, we report the first robust distribution of HCNH$^{+}$ in the Serpens filament and in Serpens South. Our data suggest that HCNH$^{+}$ is abundant in cold and quiescent regions, but is deficit in active star-forming regions. The observed HCNH$^{+}$ fractional abundances relative to H$_{2}$ range from $3.1\times 10^{-11}$ in protostellar cores to $5.9\times 10^{-10}$ in prestellar cores, and the HCNH$^{+}$ abundance generally decreases with increasing H$_{2}$ column density, which suggests that HCNH$^{+}$ coevolves with cloud cores. Our observations and modeling results suggest that the abundance of HCNH$^{+}$ in cold molecular clouds is strongly dependent on the H$_{2}$ number density. The decrease in the abundance of HCNH$^{+}$ is caused by the fact that its main precursors (e.g., HCN and HNC) undergo freeze-out as the number density of H$_{2}$ increases. However, current chemical models cannot explain other observed trends, such as the fact that the abundance of HCNH$^{+}$ shows an anti-correlation with that of HCN and HNC, but a positive correlation with that of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ in the southern part of the Serpens South northern clump. This indicates that additional chemical pathways have to be invoked for the formation of HCNH$^{+}$ via molecules like N$_{2}$ in regions in which HCN and HNC freeze out. Both the fact that HCNH$^{+}$ is most abundant in molecular cores prior to gravitational collapse and the fact that low-$J$ HCNH$^{+}$ transitions have very low H$_{2}$ critical densities make this molecular ion an excellent probe of pristine molecular gas.
#### Estimating Ejecta Mass Ratios in Kepler's SNR: Global X-Ray Spectral  Analysis Including Suzaku Systematics and Emitting Volume Uncertainties

 - **Abstract**
 The exact origins of many Type Ia supernovae$\unicode{x2013}$progenitor scenarios and explosive mechanisms$\unicode{x2013}$remain uncertain. In this work, we analyze the global Suzaku X-Ray spectrum of Kepler's supernova remnant in order to constrain mass ratios of various ejecta species synthesized during explosion. Critically, we account for the Suzaku telescope effective area calibration uncertainties of 5$\unicode{x2013}$20% by generating 100 mock effective area curves and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo based spectral fitting to produce 100 sets of best-fit parameter values. Additionally, we characterize the uncertainties from assumptions made about the emitting volumes of each model plasma component: finding that these uncertainties can be the dominant source of error. We then compare our calculated mass ratios to previous observational studies of Kepler's SNR and to the predictions of SN Ia simulations. Our mass ratio estimates require a $\sim$90% attenuated $^{12}$C$+^{16}$O reaction rate and are potentially consistent with both near- and sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ progenitors, but are inconsistent with the dynamically stable double detonation origin scenario and only marginally consistent with the dynamically unstable dynamically-driven double-degenerate double detonation (D$^6$) scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological scenarios with a non-standard equation of state can involve ultrastiff fluids, understood as primordial fluids for which $p/\rho> 1$. Their energy densities can dominate the Universe energy budget at early times, in the otherwise radiation dominated epoch. During that period the Universe undergoes a faster expansion, that has implications for any decoupling process that takes place in that era. Quintessence models or Ekpyrotic cosmologies are good examples of such scenarios. Assuming the ultrastiff state to be thermally decoupled at very early times, if ever coupled, its observational imprints are left solely in the Universe expansion rate and in the radiation energy density. We consider a complete set of ultrastiff fluids and study their signatures in the neutrino decoupling and BBN eras. Measurements of $N_\text{eff}$ alone place mild constraints on these scenarios, with forthcoming measurements from the Simons Observatory in the Chilean Atacama desert being able to test regions where still sizable effects are observable. However, when BBN data is taken into account, those regions are proven to be barely reconcilable with primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances measurements. Our findings show that measurements of the primordial helium-4 abundance imply the tightest constraints, with measurements of primordial deuterium being -- to a certain extent -- competitive as well. We point out that a $\sim 60\%$ improvement on the statistical uncertainty of the primordial helium-4 abundance measurement, will test these scenarios in the region where they can produce sizable effects. Beyond that precision the regions that are accessible degenerate with standard expectations. In that case, although potentially present, neither neutrino decoupling nor BBN observables will be sensitive probes.
#### Sub-second infrared variability from the archetypal accreting neutron  star 4U~1728-34

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the first simultaneous high-time resolution X-ray and infrared (IR) observations of a neutron star low mass X-ray binary in its hard state. We performed $\approx 2\,$h of simultaneous observations of 4U 1728-34 using HAWK-I@VLT, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The source displayed significant X-ray and IR variability down to sub-second timescales. By measuring the cross-correlation function between the infrared and X-ray lightcurves, we discovered a significant correlation with an infrared lead of $\approx 30-40\,$ms with respect to the X-rays. We analysed the X-ray energy dependence of the lag, finding a marginal increase towards higher energies. Given the sign of the lag, we interpret this as possible evidence of Comptonization from external seed photons. We discuss the origin of the IR seed photons in terms of cyclo-synchrotron radiation from an extended hot flow. Finally, we also observed the IR counterpart of a type-I X-ray burst, with a delay of $\approx7.2\,$s. Although some additional effects may be at play, by assuming that this lag is due to light travel time between the central object and the companion star, we find that 4U 1728-34 must have an orbital period longer than $3\,$h and an inclination higher than 8$^\circ$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and validation of two long-period giant exoplanets orbiting the early K dwarf TOI-4600 (V=12.6, T=11.9), first detected using observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) by the TESS Single Transit Planet Candidate Working Group (TSTPC-WG). The inner planet, TOI-4600 b, has a radius of 6.80$\pm$0.31 R$_{\oplus}$ and an orbital period of 82.69 d. The outer planet, TOI-4600 c, has a radius of 9.42$\pm$0.42 R$_{\oplus}$ and an orbital period of 482.82 d, making it the longest-period confirmed or validated planet discovered by TESS to date. We combine TESS photometry and ground-based spectroscopy, photometry, and high-resolution imaging to validate the two planets. With equilibrium temperatures of 347 K and 191 K, respectively, TOI-4600 b and c add to the small but growing population of temperate giant exoplanets that bridge the gap between hot/warm Jupiters and the solar system's gas giants. TOI-4600 is a promising target for further transit and precise RV observations to measure masses and orbits for the planets as well as search for additional non-transiting planets. Additionally, with Transit Spectroscopy Metric (TSM) values of $\sim$30, both planets are amenable for atmospheric characterization with JWST. Altogether will lend insight into the formation and evolution of planet systems with multiple giant exoplanets.
#### Simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR Observations of the Ultra-compact X-ray  Binary 4U 0614+091

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first joint NuSTAR and NICER observations of the ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) 4U 0614+091. This source shows quasi-periodic flux variations on the timescale of ~days. We use reflection modeling techniques to study various components of the accretion system as the flux varies. We find that the flux of the reflected emission and the thermal components representing the disk and the compact object trend closely with the overall flux. However, the flux of the power-law component representing the illuminating X-ray corona scales in the opposite direction, increasing as the total flux decreases. During the lowest flux observation, we see evidence of accretion disk truncation from roughly 6 gravitational radii to 11.5 gravitational radii. This is potentially analogous to the truncation seen in black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, which tends to occur during the low/hard state at sufficiently low Eddington ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of likely cluster members. Using photometry from the Gaia, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity and reddening as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we find 2781 likely cluster members and 831 binaries. We select a main-sequence 'primary sample' with 14.85 < G < 19.5 containing 1515 likely cluster members and 256 binaries with mass ratios q > 0.5, to investigate for mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. As the cluster has persisted through several half-mass relaxation times, and the expected mass-segregation timescale for stars in our primary sample is also significantly shorter than the cluster age, we interpret these results as strong evidence for mass segregation in the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.
#### Rapid Chemical Enrichment by Intermittent Star Formation in GN-z11

 - **Abstract**
 We interpret the peculiar super-solar nitrogen abundance recently reported by the James Webb Space Telescope observations for GN-z11 (z=10.6) using our state-of-the-art chemical evolution models. The observed CNO ratios can be successfully reproduced -- independently of the adopted initial mass function, nucleosynthesis yields and presence of supermassive ($>$1000$M_\odot$) stars -- if the galaxy has undergone an intermittent star formation history with a quiescent phase lasting $\sim$100 Myr, separating two strong star bursts. Immediately after the second burst, Wolf-Rayet stars (up to $120M_\odot$) become the dominant enrichment source, also temporarily ($<$1 Myr) enhancing particular elements (N, F, Na, Al) and isotopes ($^{13}$C, $^{18}$O). Alternative explanations involving (i) single burst models, also including very massive stars and/or pair-instability supernovae, or (ii) pre-enrichment scenarios fail to match the data. Feedback-regulated, intermittent star formation might be common in early systems. Elemental abundances can be used to test this hypothesis, and to get new insights on nuclear and stellar astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey will provide optical spectra for $\sim 3$ million quasars. Accurate redshifts for these quasars will facilitate a broad range of science applications. Here we provide improved systemic redshift estimates for the $\sim 95$k quasars included in the DESI Early Data Release (EDR), based on emission-line fits to the quasar spectra. The majority of the DESI pipeline redshifts are reliable. However, $\sim 19\%$ of the EDR quasars have pipeline redshifts that deviate from our new redshifts by $>500\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. We use composite quasar spectra to demonstrate the improvement of our redshift estimates, particularly at $z>1$. These new redshifts are available at \url{https://github.com/QiaoyaWu/DESI_EDR_qsofit/blob/main/DESI_EDR_Aug29_redshift_only.fits}.
#### Non-local Interactions are Essential Elements for Dark Matter Halo  Stability: A Cross-Model Study

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a comprehensive methodology for examining the stability of dark matter (DM) halos, emphasizing the necessity for non-local inter-particle interactions, whether they are fundamental or effective in nature, to maintain halo stability. We highlight the inadequacy of vanilla cold collision-less DM models in forecasting a stable halo without considering a "non-local" interaction in the halo's effective free energy, which could potentially arise from factors like baryonic feedback, self-interactions, or the intrinsic quantum characteristics of dark particles. The stability prerequisite necessitates significant effective interactions between any two points within the halo, regardless of their distance from the center. The methodology proposed herein offers a systematic framework to scrutinize the stability of various DM models and refine their parameter spaces. We deduce that DM halos within a model, where the deviation from the standard cold collision-less framework is confined to regions near the halo center, are unlikely to exhibit stability in their outer sectors. In our study, we demonstrate that the issue of instability within DM halos cannot be addressed adequately using perturbative quantum effects. This issue is less pronounced for fermionic DM but suffers from a higher degree of severity when considering bosonic DM. We find that halos made of bosons with notable quantum effects have sharp edges, while those made of fermions show more diffuse boundaries extending toward infinity. We also explore the broadest form of the effective free-energy around a chosen mass profile.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical Very-High-Energy (VHE, >10PeV) neutrinos deliver crucial information about the sources of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), the composition of UHECRs, and neutrino/particle physics at highest energies. UHE-tau neutrinos skimming the Earth's surface produce tau leptons, which can emerge from the ground, decay, and start an upward-going extensive air shower (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere. The tau neutrino can be reconstructed by imaging the EAS. We developed an atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope flying on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission to test the air-shower imaging concept at highest altitudes. The EUSO-SPB2 ultra-long-duration balloon mission is a precursor of the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a candidate for an astrophysics probe-class mission. The telescope implements Schmidt optics with a 0.785 m^2 light collection area and a 512-pixel SiPM camera covering a 12.8{\deg} by 6.4{\deg} (Horizontal by Vertical) field-of-view with 0.4{\deg} resolution. The camera signals are sampled with 100MSa/s and digitized with 12-bit resolution. The objectives of the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov telescope include a search for UHE neutrinos below Earth's limb, UHECRs above the limb, the study of the night sky background, and studying the telescope's performance. In this presentation, I will present an overview of the Cherenkov telescope and discuss the in-flight performance of the telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a few PeV ($\sim$10$^{15}$ eV) energies. The primary signature of 100 TeV $\gamma$ rays may come from PeV protons or multi-hundred TeV (not PeV) electrons. The search for PeVatrons has been one of the key science topics for VERITAS and HAWC. In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray sources with photon energies above 100 TeV, up to 1.4 PeV. This provides a clear list of PeVatron candidates for further study with VERITAS and HAWC. Most of these sources contain possible source associations, such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, two sources: LHAASO J2108+5157 and LHAASO J0341+5258, do not have any such counterparts. Therefore, multiwavelength observations are required to identify the objects responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays, to understand the source morphology and association, and to shed light on the emission processes. Here, we will present the status of VERITAS/HAWC observations and results for the LHAASO PeVatron candidate J0341+5258, and also discuss the VERITAS PeVatron search in general.
#### KilonovAE: Exploring Kilonova Spectral Features with Autoencoders

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae are likely a key site of heavy r-process element production in the Universe, and their optical/infrared spectra contain insights into both the properties of the ejecta and the conditions of the r-process. However, the event GW170817/AT2017gfo is the only kilonova so far with well-observed spectra. To understand the diversity of absorption features that might be observed in future kilonovae spectra, we use the TARDIS Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate a suite of optical spectra spanning a wide range of kilonova ejecta properties and r-process abundance patterns. To identify the most common and prominent absorption lines, we perform dimensionality reduction using an autoencoder, and we find spectra clusters in the latent space representation using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model. Our synthetic kilonovae spectra commonly display strong absorption by strontium Sr II, yttrium Y II, and zirconium Zr I - II, with strong lanthanide contributions at low electron fractions (Ye < 0.25). When a new kilonova is observed, our machine learning framework will provide context on the dominant absorption lines and key ejecta properties, helping to determine where this event falls within the larger 'zoo' of kilonovae spectra.
#### Transverse Wind Velocity Recorded in Spiral-Shell Pattern

 - **Abstract**
 The propagation speed of a circumstellar pattern revealed in the plane of the sky is often assumed to represent the expansion speed of the wind matter ejected from a post-main-sequence star at the center. We point out that the often-adopted isotropic wind assumption and the binary hypothesis as the underlying origin for the circumstellar pattern in the shape of multilayered shells are, however, mutually incompatible. We revisit the hydrodynamic models for spiral-shell patterns induced by the orbital motion of a hypothesized binary, of which one star is losing mass at a high rate. The distributions of transverse wind velocities as a function of position angle in the plane of the sky are explored along viewing directions. The variation of the transverse wind velocity is as large as half the average wind velocity over the entire three dimensional domain in the simulated models investigated in this work. The directional dependence of the wind velocity is indicative of the overall morphology of the circumstellar material, implying that kinematic information is an important ingredient in modeling the snapshot monitoring (often in the optical and near-infrared) or the spectral imaging observations for molecular line emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent abrupt changes of CW Leonis may indicate that we are witnessing the moment that the central carbon star is evolving off the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and entering into the pre-planetary nebula (PPN) phase. The recent appearance of a red compact peak at the predicted stellar position is possibly an unveiling event of the star, and the radial beams emerging from the stellar position resemble the feature of the PPN Egg Nebula. The increase of light curve over two decades is also extraordinary, and it is possibly related to the phase transition. Decadal-period variations are further found in the residuals of light curves, in the relative brightness of radial beams, and in the extended halo brightness distribution. Further monitoring of the recent dramatic and decadal-scale changes of this most well-known carbon star CW Leonis at the tip of AGB is still highly essential, and will help us gain a more concrete understanding on the conditions for transition between the late stellar evolutionary phases.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and very high energy (VHE) neutrinos from space is a promising way to measure their extremely low fluxes by significantly increasing the observed volume. The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), the next, most advanced pathfinder for such a mission, was launched May 13th 2023 from Wanaka New Zealand. The pioneering EUSO-SPB2 payload flew a Fluorescence Telescope (FT) with a PMT camera pointed in nadir to record fluorescence light from cosmic ray extensive air shower (EAS) with energies above 1 EeV, and a Cherenkov telescope (CT) with a silicon photomultiplier focal surface for observing Cherenkov emission of cosmic ray EAS with energies above 1 PeV with an above-the-limb geometry and of PeV-scale EAS initiated by neutrino-sourced tau decay. As the CT is a novel instrument, optical background measurements for space neutrino observation are an important goal of the mission. Any data collected during the mission will influence and improve the development of a space-based multi-messenger observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). We present an overview of the EUSO-SPB2 mission and its science goals and summarize results as available, from the 2023 flight.

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the jet power of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) model and the hybrid model based on the self-similar solution of advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). We study the formation mechanism of the jets of BL Lacs with known redshifts detected by the Fermi satellite after 10 yr of data (4FGL-DR2). The kinetic power of the jets of Fermi BL Lacs is estimated through radio luminosity. The main results are as follows. (1) We find that the jet kinetic power of about 72\% intermediate peak frequency BL Lacs (IBL) and 94\% high-frequency peak BL Lacs (HBL) can be explained by the hybrid jet model based on ADAFs surrounding Kerr black holes. However, the jet kinetic power of about 74\% LBL cannot be explained by the BZ jet model or the hybrid model. (2) The LBL has a higher accretion rate than IBL and HBL. About 14\% IBL and 62\% HBL have pure optically thin ADAFs. However, 7\% LBL may have a hybrid structure consisting of an standard thin disk (SS) plus optically thin ADAFs. (3) After excluding the redshift dependence, there is a weak correlation between the jet kinetic power and the accretion disk luminosity for Fermi BL Lacs. (4) There is a significant correlation between inverse Compton luminosity and synchrotron luminosity for Fermi BL Lacs. The slope of the relation between inverse Compton luminosity and synchrotron luminosity for Fermi BL Lacs is consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process. The result may suggest that the high-energy components of Fermi BL Lacs are dominated by the SSC process.
#### Measurements of the Hubble constant from combinations of supernovae and  radio quasars

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we propose an improved cosmological model independent method of determining the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$. The method uses unanchored luminosity distances $H_0d_L(z)$ from SN Ia Pantheon data combined with angular diameter distances $d_A(z)$ from a sample of intermediate luminosity radio quasars calibrated as standard rulers. The distance duality relation between $d_L(z)$ and $d_A(z)$, which is robust and independent of any cosmological model, allows to disentangle $H_0$ from such combination. However, the number of redshift matched quasars and SN Ia pairs is small (37 data-points). Hence, we take an advantage from the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to recover the $d_A(z)$ relation from a network trained on full 120 radio quasar sample. In this case, the result is unambiguously consistent with values of $H_0$ obtained from local probes by SH0ES and H0LiCOW collaborations. Three statistical summary measures: weighted mean $\widetilde{H}_0=73.51(\pm0.67) {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, median $Med(H_0)=74.71(\pm4.08) {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and MCMC simulated posterior distribution $H_0=73.52^{+0.66}_{-0.68} {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ are fully consistent with each other and the precision reached $1\%$ level. This is encouraging for the future applications of our method. Because individual measurements of $H_0$ are related to different redshifts spanning the range $z=0.5 - 2.0$, we take advantage of this fact to check if there is any noticeable trend in $H_0$ measurements with redshift of objects used for this purpose. However, our result is that the data we used strongly support the lack of such systematic effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding telescope pointing (i.e., line of sight) is important for observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and astronomical objects. The Moon is a candidate astronomical source for pointing calibration. Although the visible size of the Moon ($\ang{;30}$) is larger than that of the planets, we can frequently observe the Moon once a month with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We developed a method for performing pointing calibration using observational data from the Moon. We considered the tilts of the telescope axes as well as the encoder and collimation offsets for pointing calibration. In addition, we evaluated the effects of the nonuniformity of the brightness temperature of the Moon, which is a dominant systematic error. As a result, we successfully achieved a pointing accuracy of $\ang{;3.3}$ compared with an angular resolution of $\ang{;36}$ (i.e., 9\% uncertainty in the angular resolution). This level of accuracy competes with past achievements in other ground-based CMB experiments using observational data from the planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of the current paper is to apply the method of Bambi (Bambi, 2015) to a source which contains two or more simultaneous triads of variability components. The joint chi-square variable that can be composed in this case, unlike some previous studies, allows the goodness of the fit to be tested. It appears that a good fit requires one of the observation groups to be disregarded. Even then, the model prediction for the mass of the neutron star in the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511-3057 is way too high to be accepted.

 - **Abstract**
 Using multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) observations, we probe the jet size in the optically thick hard state jets of two black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) systems, MAXI J1820+070 and V404 Cygni. Due to optical depth effects, the phase referenced VLBI core positions move along the jet axis of the BHXRB in a frequency dependent manner. We use this "core shift" to constrain the physical size of the hard state jet. We place an upper limit of $0.3$\,au on the jet size measured between the 15 and 5 GHz emission regions of the jet in MAXI J1820+070, and an upper limit of $1.0$\,au between the $8.4$ and $4.8$\,GHz emission regions of V404 Cygni. Our limit on the jet size in MAXI J1820+070 observed in the low-hard state is a factor of $5$ smaller than the values previously observed in the high-luminosity hard state (using time lags between multi-frequency light curves), thus showing evidence of the BHXRB jet scaling in size with jet luminosity. We also investigate whether motion of the radio-emitting region along the jet axis could affect the measured VLBI parallaxes for the two systems, leading to a mild tension with the parallax measurements of Gaia. Having mitigated the impact of any motion along the jet axis in the measured astrometry, we find the previous VLBI parallax measurements of MAXI J1820+070 and V404 Cygni to be unaffected by jet motion. With a total time baseline of $8$ years, due to having incorporated fourteen new epochs in addition to the previously published ones, our updated parallax measurement of V404 Cygni is $0.450 \pm 0.018$\,mas ($2.226 \pm 0.091$\,kpc).
#### On the galaxy counterpart and environment of the dusty Damped  Lyman-$α$ Absorber at $z=2.226$ towards Q1218+0832

 - **Abstract**
 We report on further observations of the field of the quasar Q1218+0832. Geier et al. (2019) presented the discovery of the quasar resulting from a search for quasars reddened and dimmed by dust in foreground Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (DLAs). The DLA is remarkable by having a very large HI column density close to 10^22 cm^-2. Its dust extinction curve shows the 2175 AA-bump known from the Local Group. It also shows absorption from cold gas exemplified by CI and CO-molecules. We here present narrow-band observations of the field of Q1218+0832 and also use archival HST image to search for the galaxy counterpart of the DLA. No emission from the DLA galaxy is found neither in the narrow-band imaging nor in the HST image. In the HST image, we can probe down to an impact parameter of 0.3 arcsec and a 3-sigma detection limit of 26.8 mag per arcsec^2. In the narrow-band image, we probe down to 0 arcsec impact parameter and detect nothing down to a 3-sigma detection limit of about 3*10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We do detect a bright Lyman-alpha emitter 59 arcsec south of Q1218+0832 with a flux of 3*10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We conclude that the DLA galaxy must be located at very small impact parameter (<0.3 arcsec, 2.5 kpc) or is optically dark. Also, the DLA galaxy most likely is part of a galaxy group.

 - **Abstract**
 As one of the brightest galactic ${\gamma}$-ray sources, the Cygnus Cocoon superbubble has been observed by many detectors, such as $Fermi$-LAT, ARGO, HAWC, and LHAASO. However, the origin of $\gamma$-ray emission for the Cygnus Cocoon and the possible contribution to PeV cosmic rays are still under debate. The recent ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray observations by LHAASO up to 1.4 PeV towards the direction of the Cygnus Cocoon, as well as the neutrino event report of IceCube-201120A coming from the same direction, suggest that the Cygnus Cocoon may be one of the sources of high-energy cosmic rays in the Galaxy. In this work, we propose a dual-zone diffusion model for the Cygnus Cocoon: the cocoon region and surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This scenario can account for the $\gamma$-ray data from GeV to $\sim$ 50 TeV and agree with the one sub-PeV neutrino event result from IceCube so far. Moreover, it predict a non-negligible contribution $\gamma$-ray emission at hundreds TeV from the ISM surrounding the Cygnus Cocoon. This possible diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray features can be resolved by the future LHAASO observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Acceleration processes that occur in astrophysical plasmas produce cosmic rays that are observed on Earth. To study particle acceleration, fully-kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are often used as they can unveil the microphysics of energization processes. Tracing of individual particles in PIC simulations is particularly useful in this regard. However, by-eye inspection of particle trajectories includes a high level of bias and uncertainty in pinpointing specific acceleration mechanisms that affect particles. Here we present a new approach that uses neural networks to aid individual particle data analysis. We demonstrate this approach on the test data that consists of 252,000 electrons which have been traced in a PIC simulation of a non-relativistic high Mach number perpendicular shock, in which we observe the two-stream electrostatic Buneman instability to pre-accelerate a portion of electrons to nonthermal energies. We perform classification, regression and anomaly detection by using a Convolutional Neural Network. We show that regardless of how noisy and imbalanced the datasets are, the regression and classification are able to predict the final energies of particles with high accuracy, whereas anomaly detection is able to discern between energetic and non-energetic particles. The methodology proposed may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and also hybrid kinetic simulations.
#### On the source counts of VLBI-detected radio sources and the prospects of  all-sky surveys with current and next generation instruments

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the detection fraction and the number counts of radio sources imaged with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at 1.4 GHz as part of the mJIVE-20 survey. From a sample of 24,903 radio sources identified by FIRST, 4,965 are detected on VLBI-scales, giving an overall detection fraction of $19.9\pm2.9~$per cent. However, we find that the detection fraction falls from around 50 per cent at a peak surface brightness of $80~mJy~beam^{-1}$ in FIRST to around 8 per cent at the detection limit, which is likely dominated by the surface brightness sensitivity of the VLBI observations, with some contribution from a change in the radio source population. We also find that compactness at arcsec-scales is the dominant factor in determining whether a radio source is detected with VLBI, and that the median size of the VLBI-detected radio sources is 7.7 mas. After correcting for the survey completeness and effective sky area, we determine the slope of the differential number counts of VLBI-detected radio sources with flux densities $S_{\rm 1.4~GHz} > 1~mJy$ to be $\eta_{\rm VLBI} = -1.74\pm 0.02$, which is shallower than in the cases of the FIRST parent population ($\eta_{\rm FIRST} = -1.77\pm 0.02$) and for compact radio sources selected at higher frequencies ($\eta_{\rm JBF} = -2.06\pm 0.02$). From this, we find that all-sky ($3\pi~sr$) surveys with the EVN and the VLBA have the potential to detect $(7.2\pm0.9)\times10^{5}$ radio sources at mas-resolution, and that the density of compact radio sources is sufficient (5.3~deg$^{-2}$) for in-beam phase referencing with multiple sources (3.9 per primary beam) in the case of a hypothetical SKA-VLBI array.
#### A common origin of multi-messenger spectral anomaly of galactic cosmic  rays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of cosmic rays (CRs) have revealed a two-component anomaly in the spectra of primary and secondary particles, as well as their ratios, prompting investigation into their common origin. In this study, we incorporate the identification of slow diffusion zones around sources as a common phenomenon into our calculations, which successfully reproduces all previously described anomalies except for the positron spectrum. Crucially, our research offers a clear physical picture of the origin of CR: while high-energy ($\textrm{>200~GV}$, including the knee) particles are primarily produced by fresh accelerators and are confined to local regions, low energy ($\textrm{<200~GV}$) components come from distant sources and travel through the outer diffusive zone outside of the galactic disk. This scenario can be universally applied in the galactic disk, as evidenced by ultra-high energy diffuse $\rm\gamma$-ray emissions detected by the AS$\rm\gamma$ experiment. Furthermore, our results predict that the spectrum of diffuse $\rm\gamma$-ray is spatial-dependent, resting with local sources, which can be tested by LHAASO experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of baryons, which account for $15\%$ of the matter in the Universe, will end their lives as carbon and oxygen inside cold black dwarfs. Dark matter (DM) makes up the remaining $85\%$ of the matter in the universe, however, the fate of DM is unknown. Here we show that the destiny of purely gravitationally interacting DM particles follows one of two possible routes. The first possible route, the "radiation-destiny" scenario, is that massive DM particles lose sufficient energy through gravitational radiation causing them to spiral into a supermassive black hole that ultimately disappears through Hawking radiation. The second possible route, the "drifting-alone" destiny, applies to lighter DM particles, where only the central DM halo region spirals into the central BH which is then Hawking radiated away. The rest of the DM halo is ripped apart by the accelerated expansion of the Universe.
#### Asteroseismology sheds light on the origin of carbon-deficient red  giants: likely merger products and linked to the Li-rich giants

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-deficient red giants (CDGs) are a peculiar class of stars that have eluded explanation for decades. We aim to better characterise CDGs by using asteroseismology (Kepler, TESS) combined with spectroscopy (APOGEE, LAMOST), and astrometry (Gaia). We discovered 15 new CDGs in the Kepler field, and confirm that CDGs are rare, being only $0.15\%$ of our background sample. Remarkably, we find that our CDGs are almost exclusively in the red clump (RC) phase. Asteroseismic masses reveal that our CDGs are primarily low-mass stars ($M \lesssim$ 2~M$_{\odot}$), in contrast to previous studies which suggested they are intermediate mass ($M = 2.5 - 5.0~\rm M_{\odot}$) based on HR diagrams. A very high fraction of our CDGs ($50\%$) are also Li-rich giants. We observe a bimodal distribution of luminosity in our CDGs, with one group having normal RC luminosity and the other being a factor of two more luminous than expected for their masses. We find demarcations in chemical patterns and luminosities which lead us to split them into three groups: (i) normal-luminosity CDGs, (ii) over-luminous CDGs, and (iii) over-luminous highly-polluted CDGs. We conclude that a merger of a helium white dwarf with an RGB star is the most likely scenario for the two groups of over-luminous stars. Binary mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB stars is a possibility for the highly-polluted over-luminous group. For the normal-luminosity CDGs, we cannot distinguish between core He-flash pollution or lower-mass merger scenarios. Due to the overlap with the CDGs, Li-rich giants may have similar formation channels.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of large hydrocarbon cycles toward several cold dense clouds. We observed four sources (L1495B, Lupus-1A, L483, and L1527) in the Q band (31-50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m radiotelescope. Using the line stack technique, we find statistically significant evidence of benzonitrile (C6H5CN) in L1495B, Lupus-1A, and L483 at the 31.8 sigma, 15.0 sigma, and 17.2 sigma levels, respectively, while there is no hint of C6H5CN in the fourth source, L1527. The column densities derived are in the range (1.8-4.0)e12 cm-2, which is somewhat below the value derived toward the cold dense cloud TMC-1. When we analyse together all the benzonitrile abundances derived toward cold clouds in this study and in the literature, a clear trend emerges in which the higher the abundance of HC7N, the more abundant C6H5CN is. This indicates that aromatic cycles are specially favored in those interstellar clouds where long carbon chains are abundant, which suggests that the chemical processes that are responsible for the formation of linear carbon chains are also behind the synthesis of aromatic rings. We also searched for cycles other than benzonitrile, and found evidence of indene (C9H8), cyclopentadiene (C5H6), and 1-cyano cyclopentadiene (1-C5H5CN) at the 9.3 sigma, 7.5 sigma, and 8.4 sigma, respectively, toward L1495B, which shows the strongest signal from C6H5CN. The relative abundances between the various cycles detected in L1495B are consistent, within a factor of three, to those found previously in TMC-1. It is therefore likely that not only C6H5CN but also other large aromatic cycles are abundant in clouds rich in carbon chains.

 - **Abstract**
 The global coronal model COCONUT was originally developed to replace models such as the WSA model in space weather forecasting to improve the physical accuracy of the predictions. This model has, however, several simplifications implemented in its formulation to allow for rapid convergence, one of which includes a single-fluid treatment. In this paper, we have two goals. Firstly, we aim to introduce a novel multi-fluid global coronal model and validate it with simple cases as well as with real data-driven applications. Secondly, we aim to investigate to what extent considering a single-fluid plasma in the global coronal model might affect the resulting plasma dynamics, and thus whether the assumptions on which the single-fluid coronal model is based are justified. We developed a multi-fluid global coronal model, COCONUT-MF, which resolves the ion and neutral fluid equations separately. While this model is still steady-state and thus does not resolve unsteady processes, it can account for charge exchange, chemical and collisional contributions. We present the results of the ion-neutral modelling for a dipole, a minimum of solar activity, and a solar maximum. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the applied AUSM+ scheme compared to HLL. Subsequently, we also evaluate the effects of the considered ion-neutral coupling terms on the resulting plasma dynamics. Despite the very low concentration of neutrals, these terms still affect the flow field to a limited but non-negligible extent (up to 5 to 10% locally). Even though the coronal plasma is generally assumed to be collisionless, our results show that there is sufficient collisionality in it to couple the two fluids. Follow-up work will include extension of the model to lower atmospheric layers of the Sun and inclusion of more advanced physical terms such as heating and radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 The wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) is proposed to become the next large optical/near infrared facility for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) once the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) has become operational. While the latter is optimized for unprecedented sensitivity and adaptive-optics assisted image quality over a small field-of-view, WST addresses the need for large survey volumes in spectroscopy with the light-collecting power of a 10 m class telescope. Its unique layout will feature the combination of multi-object and integral field spectroscopy simultaneously. For the intended capacity of this layout a very large number of detectors is needed. The complexity of the detector systems presents a number of challenges that are discussed with a focus on novel approaches and innovative detector designs that can be expected to emerge over the anticipated 20-year timeline of this project.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of old warm neutron stars suggest the presence of a heating source in these stars, requiring a paradigm beyond the standard neutron-star cooling theory. In this work, we study the scenario where this heating is caused by the friction associated with the creep motion of neutron superfluid vortex lines in the crust. As it turns out, the heating luminosity in this scenario is proportional to the time derivative of the angular velocity of the pulsar rotation, and the proportional constant $J$ has an approximately universal value for all neutron stars. This $J$ parameter can be determined from the temperature observation of old neutron stars because the heating luminosity is balanced with the photon emission at late times. We study the latest data of neutron star temperature observation and find that these data indeed give similar values of $J$, in favor of the assumption that the frictional motion of vortex lines heats these neutron stars. These values turn out to be consistent with the theoretical calculations of the vortex-nuclear interaction.

 MWC 349A is a massive star with a well-known circumstellar disk rotating following a Keplerian law, and an ionized wind launched from the disk surface. Recent ALMA observations carried out toward this system have however revealed an additional high-velocity component in the strong, maser emission of hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs), suggesting the presence of a high-velocity ionized jet. In this work, we present 3D non-LTE radiative transfer modeling of the emission of the H30$\alpha$ and H26$\alpha$ maser lines, and of their associated radio continuum emission, toward the MWC 349A massive star. By using the MORELI code, we reproduce the spatial distribution and kinematics of the high-velocity emission of the H30$\alpha$ and H26$\alpha$ maser lines with a high-velocity ionized jet expanding at a velocity of $\sim$ 250 km s$^{-1}$, surrounded by MWC 349A's wide-angle ionized wind. The bipolar jet, which is launched from MWC 349A's disk, is poorly collimated and slightly miss-aligned with respect to the disk rotation axis. Thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity and spatial accuracy provided by ALMA, we also find that the already known, wide-angle ionized wind decelerates as it expands radially from the ionized disk. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings in understanding the formation and evolution of massive stars. Our results show the huge potential of RRL masers as powerful probes of the innermost ionized regions around massive stars and of their high-velocity jets.

 Despite decades of scientific research on the subject, the climate of the first 1.5 Gyr of Mars history has not been fully understood yet. Especially challenging is the need to reconcile the presence of liquid water for extended periods of time on the martian surface with the comparatively low insolation received by the planet, a problem which is known as the Faint Young Sun (FYS) Paradox. In this paper we use ESTM, a latitudinal energy balance model with enhanced prescriptions for meridional heat diffusion, and the radiative transfer code EOS to investigate how seasonal variations of temperature can give rise to local conditions which are conductive to liquid water runoffs. We include the effects of the martian dichotomy, a northern ocean with either 150 or 550 m of Global Equivalent Layer (GEL) and simplified CO$_2$ or H$_2$O clouds. We find that 1.3-to-2.0 bar CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres can produce seasonal thaws due to inefficient heat redistribution, provided that the eccentricity and the obliquity of the planet are sufficiently different from zero. We also studied the impact of different values for the argument of perihelion. When local favorable conditions exist, they nearly always persist for $>15\%$ of the martian year. These results are obtained without the need for additional greenhouse gases (e.g. H$_2$, CH$_4$) or transient heat-injecting phenomena (e.g. asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions). Moderate amounts (0.1 to 1\%) of CH$_4$ significantly widens the parameter space region in which seasonal thaws are possible.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuing previous work on the identification and characterization of periodic and non-periodic variations in long and almost uninterrupted high cadence light curves of cataclysmic variables observed by the TESS mission, the results on 23 novalike variables and old novae out of sample of 127 suchsystems taken from the Ritter & Kolb catalogue are presented. All of them exhibit at least at some epochs either positive or negative (or both) superhumps, and in 19 of them superhumps were detected for the first time. The basic properties of the superhumps such as their periods, their appearance and disappearance, and their waveforms are explored. Together with recent reports in the literature, this elevates the number of known novalike variables and old novae with superhumps by more than 50%. The previous census of superhumps and the Stolz-Schoembs relation for these stars are updated. Attention is drawn to superhump properties in some stars which behave differently from the average, as well as to positive superhumps in high mass ratio systems which defy theory. As a byproduct, the orbital periods of 13 stars are either improved or newly measured, correcting previously reported erroneous values.

 - **Abstract**
 We generalize the theory of the inhomogeneity effect to enable comparison among different inhomogeneous planets. A metric of inhomogeneity based on the cumulative distribution function is applied to investigate the dependence of planetary cooling on previously overlooked parameters. The mean surface temperature of airless planets increases with rotational rate and surface thermal inertia, which bounds the value in the tidally locked configuration and the equilibrium temperature. Using an analytical model, we demonstrate that the internal heat flux of giant planets exhibits significant spatial variability, primarily emitted from the nightside and high-latitude regions acting as ``radiator fins." Given a horizontally uniform interior temperature in the convective zone, the outgoing internal flux increases up to several folds as the inhomogeneity of the incoming stellar flux increases. The enhancement decreases with increasing heat redistribution through planetary dynamics or rotation. The outgoing internal flux on rapidly rotating planets generally increases with planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity. The radiative timescale and true anomaly of the vernal equinox also play significant roles. If the radiative timescale is long, the outgoing internal flux shows a slightly decreasing but nonlinear trend with obliquity. Our findings indicate that rotational and orbital states greatly influence the cooling of planets and impact the interior evolution of giant planets, particularly for tidally locked planets and planets with high eccentricity and obliquity (such as Uranus), as well as the spatial and temporal variations of their cooling fluxes.

 - **Abstract**
 The interior flux of a giant planet impacts atmospheric motion, and the atmosphere dictates the interior's cooling. Here we use a non-hydrostatic general circulation model (SNAP) coupled with a multi-stream multi-scattering radiative module (HARP) to simulate the weather impacts on the heat flow of hot Jupiters. We found that the vertical heat flux is primarily transported by convection in the lower atmosphere and regulated by dynamics and radiation in the overlying ``radiation-circulation" zone. The temperature inversion occurs on the dayside and reduces the upward radiative flux. The atmospheric dynamics relay the vertical heat transport until the radiation becomes efficient in the upper atmosphere. The cooling flux increases with atmospheric drag due to increased day-night contrast and spatial inhomogeneity. The temperature dependence of the infrared opacity greatly amplifies the opacity inhomogeneity. Although atmospheric circulation could transport heat downward in a narrow region above the radiative-convective boundary, the opacity inhomogeneity effect overcomes the dynamical effect and leads to a larger overall interior cooling than the local simulations with the same interior entropy and stellar flux. The enhancement depends critically on the equilibrium temperature, drag, and atmospheric opacity. In a strong-drag atmosphere hotter than 1600 K, a significant inhomogeneity effect in three-dimensional (3D) models can boost interior cooling several-fold compared to the 1D radiative-convection equilibrium models. This study confirms the analytical argument of the inhomogeneity effect in Zhang (2023ab). It highlights the importance of using 3D atmospheric models in understanding the inflation mechanisms of hot Jupiters and giant planet evolution in general.
#### First Targeted Search for Gravitational Waves from Highly Spinning Light  Compact Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for gravitational waves from compact-binary mergers, which to date have reported nearly 100 observations, have previously ignored binaries whose components are both light ($< 2 M_\odot$) and have high dimensionless spin ($>$ 0.05). While previous searches targeted sources that are representative of observed double neutron star binaries in the galaxy, it is already known that neutron stars can regularly be spun up to a dimensionless spin of $\sim$ 0.4, and in principle reach up to $\sim$ 0.7 before breakup would occur. Furthermore, there may be primordial black hole binaries or exotic formation mechanisms to produce subsolar mass black holes. In these cases, it is possible for the binary constituent to be spun up beyond that achievable by a neutron star. A single detection of this type of source would reveal a novel formation channel for compact binaries. To determine if there is evidence for any such sources, we conduct the first search of LIGO and Virgo data from three observing runs for light compact objects with high spin. Our analysis detects previously known observations e.g. GW170817 and GW200115; however, we report no additional mergers. The most significant candidate, not previously known, is consistent with the noise distribution, and so we constrain the merger rate of spinning light binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The $S_8$ tension between low-redshift galaxy surveys and the primary CMB signals a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Recently differing results have been obtained using low-redshift galaxy surveys and the higher redshifts probed by CMB lensing, motivating a possible time-dependent modification to the growth of structure. We investigate a simple phenomenological model in which the growth of structure deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction at late times, in particular as a simple function of the dark energy density. Fitting to galaxy lensing, CMB lensing, BAO, and Supernovae datasets, we find significant evidence - 2.5 - 3$\sigma$, depending on analysis choices - for a non-zero value of the parameter quantifying a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. The preferred model, which has a slower growth of structure below $z\sim 1$, improves the joint fit to the data over $\Lambda$CDM. While the overall fit is improved, there is weak evidence for galaxy and CMB lensing favoring different changes in the growth of structure.
#### Hierarchical Reconstruction of the Cosmic Web, The H-Spine method

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic web consists of a nested hierarchy of structures: voids, walls, filaments, and clusters. These structures interconnect and can encompass one another, collectively shaping an intricate network. Here we introduce the Hierarchical Spine (H-Spine) method, a framework designed to hierarchically identify and characterize voids, walls, and filaments. Inspired by the geometrical and dynamical constraints imposed by anisotropic gravitational collapse, the H-Spine method captures the geometry and interconnectivity between cosmic structures as well as their nesting relations, offering a more complete description of the cosmic web compared to single-scale or multi-scale approaches. To illustrate the method's utility, we present the distribution of densities and sizes of voids, walls and filaments identified in a 3-level hierarchical space. This analysis demonstrates how each level within the hierarchy unveils distinctive densities and scales inherent to cosmic web elements.
