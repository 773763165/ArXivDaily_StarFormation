#### Small but mighty: High-resolution spectroscopy of ultra-hot Jupiter  atmospheres with compact telescopes. KELT-9 b's transmission spectrum with  Wendelstein's FOCES Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 When observing transmission spectra produced by atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, large telescopes are typically the instrument of choice due to the very weak signal of the planet's atmosphere. This study aims to alleviate the desire for large telescopes by illustrating that the same science is possible with smaller telescope classes. We use the cross-correlation technique to showcase the potential of the high-resolution spectrograph FOCES at Wendelstein Observatory and demonstrate its potential to resolve the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter, KELT-9 b. A performance comparison is conducted between FOCES and HARPS-N spectrographs, considering both single transit and combined observations over three nights. With FOCES, we have detected seven species in KELT-9 b's atmosphere: Ti II, Fe I, Fe II, Na I, Mg I, Na II, Cr II, Sc II. Although HARPS-N surpasses FOCES in performance, our results reveal that smaller telescope classes are capable of resolving ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres. This broadens the scope of potential studies, allowing for investigations into phenomena like temporal variations in atmospheric signals and the atmospheric loss characteristics of these close-in planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by the discussion in the community on possible hidden systematic errors in late universe cosmological probes and non-trivial physical models developed to reduce the Hubble tension, we investigate the Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNe samples for possible deviations from the original $\Lambda$CDM analysis. To simultaneously account for possible systematics or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, we adopt Gaussian processes to model additional covariance while making no further assumptions on their origin. We explore both stationary and non-stationarity corrections to the covariance. While small changes in the inferred cosmological parameters $H_0$ and $\Omega_{m}$ can occur, we find no statistically significant evidence for missing covariance. We find an upper limit for the Gaussian processes amplitude $\sigma < 0.031$ mag with $95\%$ confidence, which corresponds to $20\%$ of the average statistical error in the Pantheon+ sample. The strongest effect we find on the inferred cosmological parameter posterior can reduce the statistical significance of the Hubble tension between Pantheon+ and Planck estimates from 5.3$\sigma$ to 4.5$\sigma$. Therefore, we conclude that the SN cosmological parameter inference is robust against the analysis modifications studied in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Breit Pauli $R$-matrix method to calculate accurate energies and radiative data for states in C I up to $n$=30 and with $l\le 3$. We provide the full dataset of decays to the five 2s$^2$2p$^2$ ground configuration states $^3$P$_{0,1,2}$, $^1$D$_2$, $^1$S$_0$. This is the first complete set of data for transitions from $n\ge 5$. We compare oscillator strengths and transition probabilities with the few previously calculated values for such transitions, finding generally good agreement (within 10%) with the exception of values recently recommended by NIST, where significant discrepancies are found. We then calculate spectral line intensities originating from the Rydberg states using typical chromospheric conditions and assuming LTE, and compare them with well-calibrated SOHO SUMER UV spectra of the quiet Sun. The relative intensities of the Rydberg series are in excellent agreement with observation, which provides firm evidence for the identifications and blends of nearly 200 UV lines. Such comparison also resulted in a large number of new identifications of C I lines in the spectra. We also estimate optical depth effects and find that these can account for much of the absorption noted in the observations. The atomic data can be applied to model a wide range of solar and astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are exotic transients that can lead to temporary super-Eddington accretion onto a supermassive black hole. Such accretion mode is naturally expected to result in powerful outflows of ionized matter. However, to date such an outflow has only been directly detected in the X-ray band in a single TDE, ASASSN-14li. This outflow has a low velocity of just a few 100 km/s, although there is also evidence for a second, ultra-fast phase. Here we present the detection of a low-velocity outflow in a second TDE, ASASSN-20qc. The high-resolution X-ray spectrum reveals an array of narrow absorption lines, each blueshifted by a few 100 km/s, which cannot be described by a single photo-ionization phase. For the first time, we confirm the multiphase nature of a TDE outflow, with at least two phases and two distinct velocity components. One highly ionized phase is outflowing at $910^{+90}_{-80}$ km/s, while a lower ionization component is blueshifted by $400_{-120}^{+100}$ km/s. We perform time-resolved analysis of the X-ray spectrum and detect that, surprisingly, the mildly ionized absorber strongly varies in ionization parameter over the course of a single 60 ks observation, indicating that its distance from the black hole may be as low as 400 gravitational radii. We discuss these findings in the context of TDEs and compare this newly detected outflow with that of ASASSN-14li.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent astronomical observations have shown that interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) exist even in cold environments ($\sim$10 K), while various interstellar COMs have conventionally been detected in the hot gas ($\gtrsim$ 100 K) in the vicinity of high-mass and low-mass protostars. However, the formation pathway of each interstellar COM remains largely unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that an automated reaction path search based on transition state theory, which does not require predetermined pathways, is helpful for investigating the formation pathways of interstellar COMs in the gas phase. The exhaustive search within electronic ground states helps elucidate the complex chemical formation pathways of COMs at low temperatures. Here we examine the formation pathways of dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) and methyl formate (HCOOCH$_3$), which are often detected in the cold and hot gas of star-forming regions. We have identified a barrierless and exothermic formation path of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ by reaction between neutral species; CH$_3$O + CH$_3$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$CO $\cdots$ CH$_4$ $\rightarrow$ CH$_3$OCH$_3$ is the most efficient path in the large chemical network constructed by our automated reaction path search and is comparable with previous studies. For HCOOCH$_3$, we obtain complex pathways initiated from reactions between neutral species; HCOO and CH$_3$ generate HCOOCH$_3$ and its isomers without external energy. However, we also identified the competing reaction branches producing CO$_2$ + CH$_4$ and CH$_3$COOH, which would be more efficient than the formation of HCOOCH$_3$. Then the gas-phase formation of HCOOCH$_3$ through reactions between neutral species would not be efficient compared to the CH3OCH$_3$ formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the frequency and critical mass accretion rate of millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) using a one-zone X-ray burst model. The surface gravity is specified by two kinds of equation of states: neutron star (NS) and strange star (SS). The base flux, $Q_{b}$, is set in the range of 0-2 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. It is found that the frequency of mHz QPO is positively correlated to the surface gravity but negatively to the base heating. The helium mass fraction has a significant influence on the oscillation frequency and luminosity. The observed 7-9 mHz QPOs can be either explained by a heavy NS/light SS with a small base flux or a heavy SS with a large base flux. As base flux increases, the critical mass accretion rate for marginally stable burning is found to be lower. Meanwhile, the impact of metallicity on the properties of mHz QPOs was investigated using one-zone model. It shows that both the frequency and critical mass accretion rate decrease as metallicity increases. An accreted NS/SS with a higher base flux and metallicity, combined with a lower surface gravity and helium mass fraction, could be responsible for the observed critical mass accretion rate ($\dot{m}\simeq 0.3\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$). The accreted fuel would be in stable burning if base flux is over than $\sim$2 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. This finding suggests that the accreting NSs/SSs in low-mass X-ray binaries showing no type I X-ray bursts possibly have a strong base heating.
#### Refining the IceCube detector geometry using muon and LED calibration  data

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory deployed 5160 digital optical modules (DOMs) on 86 cables, called strings, in a cubic kilometer of deep glacial ice below the geographic South Pole. These record the Cherenkov light of passing charged particles. Knowledge of the DOM positions is vital for event reconstruction. While vertical positions have been calibrated, previous in-situ geometry calibration methods have been unable to measure horizontal deviations from the surface positions, largely due to degeneracies with ice model uncertainties. Thus the lateral position of the surface position of each hole is to date in almost all cases used as the lateral position of all DOMs on a given string. With the recent advances in ice modeling, two new in-situ measurements have now been undertaken. Using a large sample of muon tracks, the individual positions of all DOMs on a small number of strings around the center of the detector have been fitted. Verifying the results against LED calibration data shows that the string-average corrections improve detector modeling. Directly fitting string-average geometry corrections for the full array using LED data agrees with the average corrections as derived from muons where available. Analyses are now ongoing to obtain per-DOM positions using both methods and in addition, methods are being developed to correct the recorded arrival times for the expected scattering delay, allowing for multilateration of the positions using nanosecond-precision propagation delays.
#### Revisiting Planetary Systems in Okayama Planet Search Program: A new  long-period planet, RV astrometry joint analysis, and  multiplicity-metallicity trend around evolved stars

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we revisit 32 planetary systems around evolved stars observed within the framework of the Okayama Planet Search Program and its collaborative framework of the EAPS-Net to search for additional companions and investigate the properties of stars and giant planets in multiple-planet systems. With our latest radial velocities obtained from Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), we confirm an additional giant planet in the wide orbit of 75 Cet system ($P_{\rm{c}} = 2051.62_{-40.47}^{+45.98}\ \rm{d}$, $M_{\rm{c}}\sin i=0.912_{-0.090}^{+0.088}\ M_{\rm{J}}$, and $a_{\rm{c}}=3.929_{-0.058}^{+0.052}\ \rm{au}$), along with five stars exhibiting long-term radial velocity accelerations, which indicates massive companions in the wide orbits. We have also found that the radial velocity variations of several planet-harboring stars may indicate additional planet candidates, stellar activities, or other understudied sources. These stars include $\epsilon$ Tau, 11 Com, 24 Boo, 41 Lyn, 14 And, HD 32518, and $\omega$ Ser. We further constrain the orbital configuration of the HD 5608, HD 14067, HD 120084, and HD 175679 systems by combining radial velocities with astrometry, as their host central stars exhibit significant astrometric accelerations. For other systems, we simply refine their orbital parameters. Moreover, our study indicates that the OPSP planet-harboring stars are more metal-poor compared to the currently known planet-harboring stars, and this is likely due to the $B-V$ color upper limit at 1.0 for star selection in the beginning of the survey. Finally, by investigating the less-massive giant planets ($< 5 M_{\rm{J}}$) around currently known planet-harboring evolved stars, we have found that metallicity positively correlates with the multiplicity and total planet mass of the system, which can be evidence for the core-accretion planet formation model.

 - **Abstract**
 The leading theory for the origin of Jupiter Trojans (JTs) assumes that JTs were captured to their orbits near the Lagrangian points of Jupiter during the early reconfiguration of the giant planets. The natural source region for the majority of JTs would then be the population of planetesimals born in a massive trans-Neptunian disk. If true, JTs represent the most accessible stable population of small Solar System bodies that formed in the outer regions of the Solar System. For this work, we compiled photometric datasets for about 1000 JTs and applied the convex inversion technique in order to assess their shapes and spin states. We obtained full solutions for $79$ JTs, and partial solutions for an additional $31$ JTs. We found that the observed distribution of the pole obliquities of JTs is broadly consistent with expectations from the streaming instability, which is the leading mechanism for the formation of planetesimals in the trans-Neptunian disk. The observed JTs' pole distribution has a slightly smaller prograde vs. retrograde asymmetry (excess of obliquities $>130^\circ$) than what is expected from the existing streaming instability simulations. However, this discrepancy can be plausibly reconciled by the effects of the post-formation collisional activity. Our numerical simulations of the post-capture spin evolution indicate that the JTs' pole distribution is not significantly affected by dynamical processes such as the eccentricity excitation in resonances, close encounters with planets, or the effects of nongravitational forces. However, a few JTs exhibit large latitude variations of the rotation pole and may even temporarily transition between prograde- and retrograde-rotating categories.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Although more than one thousand sub-stellar companions have already been detected with the radial velocity (RV) method, many new companions remain to be detected in the public RV archives. Aims. We wish to use the archival data obtained with the ESO/HARPS spectrograph to search for sub-stellar companions. Methods. We use the astronomic acceleration measurements of stars obtained with the Hipparcos and Gaia satellites to identify anomalies that could be explained by the presence of a companion. Once hints for a companion are found, we combine the RV data with absolute astrometry and, when available, relative astrometry data, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to determine the orbital parameters and mass of the companion. Results. We find and characterize three new brown dwarfs (GJ660.1 C, HD73256 B, and HD165131 B) and six new planets (HD75302 b, HD108202 b, HD135625 b, HD185283 b, HIP10337 b, and HIP54597 b) with separations between 1 and 6 au and masses between 0.6 and 100 MJup. We also constrain the orbital inclination of ten known sub-stellar companions and determine their true mass. Finally, we identify twelve new stellar companions. This shows that the analysis of proper motion anomalies allows for optimizing the RV search for sub-stellar companions and their characterization.
#### On the nature of the continuum reverberation of X-ray/UV and optical  emission of IRAS 09149-6206

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a continuum reverberation mapping study of the radio-quiet Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 09149-6206. The analysis was performed using X-ray, UV and optical observations made with the {\em Swift} telescope between January and December 2017. The time delays between different light curves were measured using three different algorithms: PyI$^2$CCF, PyROA and JAVELIN. Our results show that the time delays increase with wavelength after $\tau\propto \lambda^{4/3}$, as predicted for a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disc, but only after accounting for significant diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region. However, the measured size of the accretion disc can be up to five times larger than that predicted by standard theory. To our surprise, the strong increase in soft X-ray fluxes is delayed by about 15 days compared to the optical UV fluctuations, which challenges the prediction of the lamp-post model. Our analysis of the X-ray variability reveals the presence of a non-variable spectral component at 0.3-6.0 keV along with variable excess emission at 2.0-3.0 keV, which could be partly related to relativistic reflection in the inner region of the accretion disc. IRAS 09149-6206 joins the list of objects for which the traditional lamp-post model cannot explain the observed time delays. A scenario that incorporates other geometric considerations into the lamp-post model, e.g. an extended corona along a scattering source, might be better suited to explain the observed long time delays

 - **Abstract**
 Hot corinos are of great interest due to their richness in interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) and the consequent potential prebiotic connection to solar-like planetary systems. Recent surveys have reported an increasing number of hot corino detections in Class 0/I protostars; however, the relationships between their physical properties and the hot-corino signatures remain elusive. In this study, our objective is to establish a general picture of the detectability of the hot corinos by identifying the origin of the hot-corino signatures in the sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) project. We apply spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling to our sample and identify the physical parameters of the modeled YSOs directly, linking the detection of hot-corino signatures to the envelope properties of the YSOs. Imaging simulations of the methanol emission further support this scenario. We, therefore, posit that the observed COM emission originates from the warm inner envelopes of the sample YSOs, based on both the warm region size and the envelope density profile. The former is governed by the source luminosity and is additionally affected by the disk and cavity properties, while the latter is related to the evolutionary stages. This scenario provides a framework for detecting hot-corino signatures toward luminous Class 0 YSOs, with fewer detections observed toward similarly luminous Class I sources.
#### An ALMA Glimpse of Dense Molecular Filaments Associated with High-mass  Protostellar Systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Recent millimeter/sub-millimeter facilities have revealed the physical properties of filamentary molecular clouds in relation to high-mass star formation. A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO$^{+}$(4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10$^4$-10$^{5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$ in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO$^{+}$(4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H$_2$ volume density of $\gtrsim$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and a line mass of $\sim$10$^3$-10$^{4}$ $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity linewidths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H$_2$ column densities with an exponent of $\sim$0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions withiin $ \lesssim$1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments owing to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding $\sim$5 $\times$10$^4$ $L_{\odot}$. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H$\;${\sc ii} regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers of black holes and other compact objects produce gravitational waves which carry a part of the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the system. Due to asymmetry in the gravitational wave emission, a recoil kick velocity is imparted to the merger remnant. It has been conjectured that a significant fraction of the mergers detected so far reside in globular clusters. We explore the scenario where the merger remnant in a globular cluster is moving at a significant speed with respect to the binary that underwent merger. We study this in the situation when the kick velocity is higher than the escape velocity in the case of globular clusters assuming a Plummer density profile for the cluster. We study the evolution of the system to study the outcome: whether dynamical friction can trap the black hole within the globular cluster, whether the black hole escapes the globular cluster but ends up in the bulge, and lastly, whether the black halo becomes a halo object. We present results for an analysis based on orbital parameters of ten globular clusters using data from GAIA EDR3. We find that if the kick velocity is smaller than $120$ km/s then a majority of remnant black holes end up in the bulge. Note that our results in terms of where compact objects launched from a globular cluster end up are applicable to any mechanism, e.g., a compact object ejected due to three-body interactions.
#### An inner warp discovered in the disk around HD 110058 using VLT/SPHERE  and HST/STIS

 - **Abstract**
 An edge-on debris disk was detected in 2015 around the young, nearby A0V star HD 110058. The disk showed features resembling those seen in the disk of beta Pictoris that could indicate the presence of a perturbing planetary-mass companion in the system. We investigated new and archival scattered light images of the disk in order to characterise its morphology and spectrum. In particular, we analysed the disk's warp to constrain the properties of possible planetary perturbers. Our work uses data from two VLT/SPHERE observations and archival data from HST/STIS. We measured the morphology of the disk by analysing vertical profiles along the length of the disk to extract the centroid spine position and vertical height. We extracted the surface brightness and reflectance spectrum of the disk. We detect the disk between 20 au (with SPHERE) and 150 au (with STIS), at a position angle of 159.6$^\circ\pm$0.6$^\circ$. Analysis of the spine shows an asymmetry between the two sides of the disk, with a 3.4$^\circ\pm$0.9$^\circ$ warp between ~20 au and 60 au. The disk is marginally vertically resolved in scattered light, with a vertical aspect ratio of 9.3$\pm$0.7% at 45 au. The extracted reflectance spectrum is featureless, flat between 0.95 micron and 1.1 micron, and red from 1.1 micron to 1.65 micron. The outer parts of the disk are also asymmetric with a tilt between the two sides compatible with a disk made of forward-scattering particles and seen not perfectly edge-on, suggesting an inclination of <84$^\circ$. The presence of an undetected planetary-mass companion on an inclined orbit with respect to the disk could explain the warp. The misalignment of the inner parts of the disk with respect to the outer disk suggests a warp that has not yet propagated to the outer parts of the disk, favouring the scenario of an inner perturber as the origin of the warp.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently released data from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations provide strong evidence for a stochastic signal consistent with a gravitational-wave background, potentially originating from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). However, in order to determine whether the SIGWs with a specific power spectrum of curvature perturbations can account for the PTA signal, one needs to estimate the energy density of the SIGWs, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we use a model-independent approach to reconstruct the primordial curvature power spectrum using a free spectrum cross over from $10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $10^{20}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with NANOGrav 15-yrs data set. Our results can simplify the task of assessing whether a given primordial curvature power spectrum can adequately explain the observed PTA signal without calculating the energy density of SIGWs.

 - **Abstract**
 Helium white dwarfs (HeWDs) are thought to form from low-mass red giant stars experiencing binary interaction. Because the helium core mass of a red giant star is closely related to the stellar radius, there exists well-known relation between the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$) and the mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) of the HeWDs, which is almost independent of the type of the companion star. Traditional derivation of the $M_{\rm WD}$-$P_{\rm orb}$ relation generally neglected the effect of wind mass loss from the red giants, while observations show that wind mass loss from red giants in binary systems is systematically higher than that from isolated stars. In this work, we calculate binary evolution with tidally enhanced stellar wind (TEW) and find that it causes significantly scatter of the traditional $M_{\rm WD}$-$P_{\rm orb}$ relation. The TEW can prevent the red giants from overflowing their Roche lobes and slow down the growth of the helium core, leaving a lower-mass HeWD for given orbital period. This scenario may account for some of the HeWD binaries that deviate from the traditional $M_{\rm WD}$-$P_{\rm orb}$ relation. However, we point out that observations of more HeWD binaries in wide orbits are needed to test the TEW model and to constrain the enhanced wind factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanets growing within the protoplanetary disk by pebble accretion acquire hydrostatic gas envelopes. Due to accretion heating, the temperature in these envelopes can become high enough to sublimate refractory minerals which are the major components of the accreted pebbles. Here we study the sublimation of different mineral species and determine whether sublimation plays a role during the growth by pebble accretion. For each snapshot in the growth process, we calculate the envelope structure and sublimation temperature of a set of mineral species representing different levels of volatility. Sublimation lines are determined using and equilibrium scheme for the chemical reactions responsible for destruction and formation of the relevant minerals. We find that the envelope of the growing planet reaches temperatures high enough to sublimate all considered mineral species when the mass is larger than 0.4 Earth masses. The sublimation lines are located within the gravitionally bound envelope of the planet. We make a detailed analysis of the sublimation of FeS at around 720 K, beyond which the mineral is attacked by H2 to form gaseous H2S and solid Fe. We calculate the sulfur concentration in the planet under the assumption that all sulfur released as H2S is lost from the planet by diffusion back to the protoplanetary disk. Our calculated values are in good agreement with the slightly depleted sulfur abundance of Mars, while the model overpredicts the extensive sulfur depletion of Earth by a factor of approximately 2. We show that a collision with a sulfur-rich body akin to Mars in the moon-forming impact lifts the Earth's sulfur abundance to approximately 10% of the solar value for all impactor masses above 0.05 Earth masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rocky Planet Search (RPS) program is dedicated to a blind radial velocity (RV) search of planets around bright stars in the Northern hemisphere, using the high-resolution echelle spectrograph HARPS-N installed on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). The goal of this work is to revise and update the properties of three planetary systems by analysing the HARPS-N data with state-of-the-art stellar activity mitigation tools. The stars considered are HD 99492 (83Leo B), HD 147379 (Gl617 A) and HD 190007. We employ a systematic process of data modelling, that we selected from the comparison of different approaches. We use YARARA to remove instrumental systematics from the RV, and then use SPLEAF to further mitigate the stellar noise with a multidimensional correlated noise model. We also search for transit features in the Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite (TESS) data of these stars. We report on the discovery of a new planet around HD 99492, namely HD 99492 c, with an orbital period of 95.2 days and a minimum mass of msin i = 17.9 M_Earth, and refine the parameters of HD 99492 b. We also update and refine the Keplerian solutions for the planets around HD 147379 and HD 190007, but do not detect additional planetary signals. We discard the transiting geometry for the planets, but stress that TESS did not exhaustively cover all the orbital phases. The addition of the HARPS-N data, and the use of advanced data analysis tools, has allowed us to present a more precise view of these three planetary systems. It demonstrates once again the importance of long observational efforts such as the RPS program. Added to the RV exoplanet sample, these planets populate two apparently distinct populations revealed by a bimodality in the planets minimum mass distribution. The separation is located between 30 and 50 M_Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instrument aboard Juno has allowed clear, high-resolution imaging of Io's polar volcanoes. We have used data from JIRAM's M-band (4.78 micron) imager from eleven Juno orbits to construct a global map of volcanic flux. This map provides insight into the spatial distribution of volcanoes and the ways in which high- and low-latitude volcanoes differ. Using spherical harmonic analysis, we have quantitatively compared our volcanic flux map to the surface heat flow distribution expected by modeling data of Io's tidal heat deposition (de Kleer et al. 2019). Systems of bright volcanoes were confirmed at high latitudes. Our study finds that both poles are more active than previous studies have suggested, although the south pole was viewed too infrequently to establish reliable long-term trends. While none of the tidal heat flow models match well, the asthenospheric heating model agrees best with the observed volcanic flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet observations of Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs), exoplanets with temperatures over 2000\,K, provide us with an opportunity to investigate if and how atmospheric escape shapes their upper atmosphere. Near-ultraviolet transit spectroscopy offers a unique tool to study this process owing to the presence of strong metal lines and a bright photospheric continuum as the light source against which the absorbing gas is observed. WASP-189b is one of the hottest planets discovered to date, with a day-side temperature of about 3400\,K orbiting a bright A-type star. We present the first near-ultraviolet observations of WASP-189b, acquired with the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment ($CUTE$). $CUTE$ is a 6U NASA-funded ultraviolet spectroscopy mission, dedicated to monitoring short-period transiting planets. WASP-189b was one of the $CUTE$ early science targets and was observed during three consecutive transits in March 2022. We present an analysis of the $CUTE$ observations and results demonstrating near-ultraviolet (2500--3300~\AA) broadband transit depth ($1.08^{+0.08}_{-0.08}\%$) of about twice the visual transit depth indicating that the planet has an extended, hot upper atmosphere with a temperature of about 15000\,K and a moderate mass loss rate of about \SI{4e8}{\kg\per\second}. We observe absorption by Mg{\sc ii} lines ($R_p/R_s$ of $0.212^{+0.038}_{-0.061}$) beyond the Roche lobe at $>$4$\sigma$ significance in the transmission spectrum at a resolution of 10~\AA, while at lower resolution (100~\AA), we observe a quasi-continuous absorption signal consistent with a "forest" of low-ionization metal absorption dominated by Fe{\sc ii}. The results suggest an upper atmospheric temperature ($\sim15000$\,K), higher than that predicted by current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models.
