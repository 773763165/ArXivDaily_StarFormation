#### Title:
          Pulsational characteristics of mass accreting stars in close binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binaries with pulsating components are a distinct subclass of binaries, merging orbital and pulsational analyses. In recent years, that subclass led to the definition of a newly formed branch of tidal asteroseismology. While single-star pulsators are well understood, the effects of binarity and possible mass transfer on pulsational characteristics, particularly in mass-gaining stars, remain to be systematically explored. Here, I present preliminary results on the asteroseismic properties of a mass-accreting model for a 10 $M_{\odot}$ $\beta$ Cephei-type star

          An X-ray view of the Cataclysmic Variable V902 Mon: Discovery of an X-ray eclipse

 - **Abstract**
 V902 Mon is one of a few eclipsing Intermediate Polars (IPs), and show deep eclipses in the optical lightcurves. The presence of a strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line in its X-ray spectrum and its low X-ray flux compared to other IPs suggests significant absorption, most likely from an accretion disk. In an observation carried out using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), we confirm the presence of an X-ray eclipse in the energy resolved lightcurves, coincident with the optical AAVSO/CV-band lightcurves. Broadband X-ray spectral analysis using NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations confirm a strong absorption N$_{H}$ $\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ local to the source, along with a high equivalent width of about 0.7 keV for a Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line. We interpret this using a model similar to an Accretion Disk Corona source, which have a very high inclination and the compact object is heavily obscured by the body of the accretion disk. We propose that the primary X-rays from the accretion column in V902 Mon is hidden from our direct view at all times by the accretion disk. In this scenario, the observed scattered X-rays indicate substantial absorption of direct X-rays by the accretion disk. Additionally, a strong Fe fluorescence line suggests reprocessing of the radiation by a more extended region, such as the pre-shock region, which could be located a few white dwarf radii above the orbital plane.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-destructive readout capability of the Skipper Charge Coupled Device (CCD) has been demonstrated to reduce the noise limitation of conventional silicon devices to levels that allow single-photon or single-electron counting. The noise reduction is achieved by taking multiple measurements of the charge in each pixel. These multiple measurements come at the cost of extra readout time, which has been a limitation for the broader adoption of this technology in particle physics, quantum imaging, and astronomy applications. This work presents recent results of a novel sensor architecture that uses multiple non-destructive floating-gate amplifiers in series to achieve sub-electron readout noise in a thick, fully-depleted silicon detector to overcome the readout time overhead of the Skipper-CCD. This sensor is called the Multiple-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) can perform multiple independent charge measurements with each amplifier, and the measurements from multiple amplifiers can be combined to further reduce the readout noise. We will show results obtained for sensors with 8 and 16 amplifiers per readout stage in new readout operations modes to optimize its readout speed. The noise reduction capability of the new techniques will be demonstrated in terms of its ability to reduce the noise by combining the information from the different amplifiers, and to resolve signals in the order of a single photon per pixel. The first readout operation explored here avoids the extra readout time needed in the MAS-CCD to read a line of the sensor associated with the extra extent of the serial register. The second technique explore the capability of the MAS-CCD device to perform a region of interest readout increasing the number of multiple samples per amplifier in a targeted region of the active area of the device.

 - **Abstract**
 The relativistic inverse stellar structure problem determines the equation of state of the stellar matter given a knowledge of suitable macroscopic observable properties (e.g. their masses and radii) of the stars composed of that material. This study determines how accurately this equation of state can be determined using noisy mass and radius observations. The relationship between the size of the observational errors and the accuracy of the inferred equation of state is evaluated, and the optimal number of adjustable equation of state parameters needed to achieve the highest accuracy is determined.

          SN 2023ixf: interaction signatures in the spectrum at 445 days

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2023ixf is one of the most neaby and brightest Type II supernovae (SNe) of the past decades. A rich set of pre-explosion data provided important insight on the properties of the progenitor star. There has been a wide range of estimated initial masses of 9 - 22 $M{_\odot}$. Early monitoring of the SN also showed the presence of a dense CSM structure near the star ($10^{15}$ cm) that was probably expelled in the last years prior to the explosion. These extended CSM structure can be further probed with late-time observations during the nebular phase. This study is based on a nebular spectrum obtained with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope 445 days after explosion. The SN evolution is analyzed in comparison with a previous spectrum at an age of 259 days, and compared with those of similar SNe II and with synthetic radiation-transfer nebular spectra. The 445-d spectrum exhibits a dramatic evolution with clear signs of ejecta-CSM interaction. The H${\alpha}$ profile shows a complex profile that can be separated into a boxy component arising from the interaction with a CSM shell and a central peaked component that may be due to the radioactive-powered SN ejecta. The CSM shell would be located at a distance of $\approx10^{16}$ cm from the progenitor and it may be associated with mass loss occurring up until $\approx 500 - 1000$ years before the explosion. Similar interaction signatures have been detected in other SNe II, although for events with standard plateau durations this happened at times later than 600 - 700 days. SN 2023ixf appears to belong to a group of SNe II with short plateaus or linear light curves that develop interaction features before $\approx 500$ days. Other lines, such as those from [O I] and [Ca II] appear to be unaffected by the CSM interaction. This allowed us to estimate an initial progenitor mass, which resulted in the relatively low range of 10 - 15 $M{_\odot}$.

          Solar System Elemental Abundances from the Solar Photosphere and CI-Chondrites

 - **Abstract**
 Solar photospheric abundances and CI-chondrite compositions are reviewed and updated to obtain representative solar system abundances of the elements and their isotopes. The new photospheric abundances obtained here lead to higher solar metallicity. Full 3D NLTE photospheric analyses are only available for 11 elements. A quality index for analyses is introduced. For several elements, uncertainties remain large. Protosolar mass fractions are H (X = 0.7060), He (Y = 0.2753), and for metals Li to U (Z = 0.0187). The protosolar (C+N)/H agrees within 13% with the ratio for the solar core from the Borexino experiment. Elemental abundances in CI-chondrites were screened by analytical methods, sample sizes, and evaluated using concentration frequency distributions. Aqueously mobile elements (e.g., alkalis, alkaline earths, etc.) often deviate from normal distributions indicating mobilization and/or sequestration into carbonates, phosphates, and sulfates. Revised CI-chondrite abundances of non-volatile elements are similar to earlier estimates. The moderately volatile elements F and Sb are higher than before, as are C, Br and I, whereas the CI-abundances of Hg and N are now significantly lower. The solar system nuclide distribution curves of s-process elements agree within 4% with s-process predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. P-process nuclide distributions are assessed. No obvious correlation of CI-chondritic to solar elemental abundance ratios with condensation temperatures is observed, nor is there one for ratios of CI-chondrites/solar wind abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless shock waves, found in supernova remnants, interstellar, stellar, and planetary environments, and laboratories, are one of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. This study combines in situ satellite measurements with recent theoretical developments to establish a reinforced shock acceleration model for relativistic electrons. Our model incorporates transient structures, wave-particle interactions, and variable stellar wind conditions, operating collectively in a multiscale set of processes. We show that the electron injection threshold is on the order of suprathermal range, obtainable through multiple different phenomena abundant in various plasma environments. Our analysis demonstrates that a typical shock can consistently accelerate electrons into very high (relativistic) energy ranges, refining our comprehension of shock acceleration while providing insight on the origin of electron cosmic rays.

          Velocity Structure and Molecular Formation in Polaris Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present a wide-field $(60\arcmin \times 30\arcmin)$ study of a dense region within the Polaris Flare, hereafter referred to as the `Polaris molecular cloud', using $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J=1-0$) observations at $20\arcsec$ resolution, obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope. The analysis reveals molecular gas formation occurring at column densities up to $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, evidenced by an anti-correlation between $\textsc{Hi}$ and CO distributions, indicating active atomic-to-molecular gas conversion. We found a threshold column density for molecular formation at $\sim5\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is common among more evolved molecular clouds. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $X_{\rm CO}$, was found to be $0.7 \times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, lower than the solar neighborhood average. Our chemical models estimate the cloud's age to be $\sim10^{5}-10^{6}$ years, suggesting an early stage of molecular cloud evolution. This interpretation is consistent with the observed low $X_{\rm CO}$ factor. While virial analysis suggests that the entire cloud is gravitationally unbound, we identified several filamentary structures extending from the main cloud body. These filaments show systematic velocity gradients of $0.5-1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$, and analysis of the velocities shows that the molecular gas within them is falling toward the main cloud body, following a free-fall model. This suggests ongoing mass accumulation processes through the filaments, demonstrating that gravitational processes can be important even at column densities of $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

          FEASTS Combined with Interferometry. III. The Low-column-density HI Around M51 and Possibility of Turbulent-mixing Gas Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 With a new joint-deconvolution pipeline, we combine the single-dish and interferometric atomic hydrogen (HI) data of M51 observed by the FAST (FEASTS program) and VLA (THINGS). The product data cube has a typical line width of $13\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and a $2\sigma$ line-of-sight (LOS) sensitivity of HI column density $N_\text{HI}\sim3.2\times10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ at a spatial resolution of ${\sim}18''$ (${\sim}0.7\,\text{kpc}$). Among the HI-detected LOSs extending to ${\sim}50\,\text{kpc}$, ${\sim}89\%$ consist of diffuse HI only, which is missed by previous VLA observations. The distribution of dense HI is reproduced by previous hydrodynamical simulations of this system, but the diffuse component is not, likely due to unresolved physics related to the interaction between the circumgalactic and interstellar media. With simple models, we find that these low-$N_\text{HI}$ structures could survive the background ultraviolet photoionization, but are susceptible to the thermal evaporation. We find a positive correlation between LOS velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and $N_\text{HI}$ with a logarithmic index of ${\sim}0.5$. Based on existing turbulent mixing layer (TML) theories and simulations, we propose a scenario of hot gas cooling and accreting onto the disk through a TML, which could reproduce the observed power index of ${\sim}0.5$. We estimate the related cooling and accretion rates to be roughly $1/3$ to $2/3$ of the star-formation rate. A typical column density of diffuse HI (${\sim}10^{19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) can be accreted within $300\,\text{Myr}$, the interaction time scale previously estimated for the system. Such a gas accretion channel has been overlooked before, and may be important for gas-rich interacting systems and for high redshift galaxy evolution.

          Spinning spectral sirens: Robust cosmological measurement using mass-spin correlations in the binary black hole population

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from compact binary mergers provide a direct measurement of luminosity distance, which, in combination with redshift information, serves as a cosmological probe. In order to statistically infer merger redshifts, the ``spectral standard siren" method relies on features, such as peaks, dips or breaks, in the compact object mass spectrum, which get redshifted in the detector-frame relative to the source-frame. However, if the source-frame location of these features evolves over cosmic time, the spectral siren measurement may be biased. Some features, such as the edges of the pair-instability supernova mass gap, may be more stable than others. We point out that binary black hole (BBH) spins, which are not redshifted in the detector-frame, provide a natural way to identify robust mass scales for spectral siren cosmology. For example, there is recent evidence for a mass scale in the BBH population that separates slowly spinning from more rapidly spinning BBH mergers, consistent with the lower edge of the pair instability gap. Applying our method to data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third transient catalog, we demonstrate how to isolate this mass scale and produce a robust ``spinning spectral siren" measurement of the Hubble constant: $H_0 = 85^{+99}_{-67}\,\rm{km}\, \rm{s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, or $H_0 =80^{+60}_{-46}\,\rm{km}\, \rm{s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with other mass features, such as the $\sim35\,M_\odot$ peak. We consider the possibility that the source-frame location of the $\sim35\,M_\odot$ peak evolves with redshift, and show that information from black hole spin can be used to mitigate the associated bias for self-calibrating spectral sirens.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid advancement of image analysis methods in time-domain astronomy, particularly those leveraging AI algorithms, has highlighted efficient image pre-processing as a critical bottleneck affecting algorithm performance. Image pre-processing, which involves standardizing images for training or deployment of various AI algorithms, encompasses essential steps such as image quality evaluation, alignment, stacking, background extraction, gray-scale transformation, cropping, source detection, astrometry, and photometry. Historically, these algorithms were developed independently by different research groups, primarily based on CPU architecture for small-scale data processing. This paper introduces a novel framework for image pre-processing that integrates key algorithms specifically modified for GPU architecture, enabling large-scale image pre-processing for different algorithms. To prepare for the new algorithm design paradigm in the AI era, we have implemented two operational modes in the framework for different application scenarios: Eager mode and Pipeline mode. The Eager mode facilitates real-time feedback and flexible adjustments, which could be used for parameter tuning and algorithm development. The pipeline mode is primarily designed for large scale data processing, which could be used for training or deploying of artificial intelligence models. We have tested the performance of our framework using simulated and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances image pre-processing speed while maintaining accuracy levels comparable to CPU based algorithms. To promote accessibility and ease of use, a Docker version of our framework is available for download in the PaperData Repository powered by China-VO, compatible with various AI algorithms developed for time-domain astronomy research.

          Hydrodynamic Predictions for the Next Outburst of T Coronae Borealis: It will be the Brightest Classical or Recurrent Nova Ever Observed in X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 T Coronae Borealis (TCrB) is a recurrent nova (RN) with recorded outbursts in 1866, and 1946 and possible outbursts in 1217 and 1787. It is predicted to explode again in 2025 or 2026 based on multiple observational studies. The system consists of a massive (M$_{wd}$ $\gtrsim$ 1.35 M$_\odot$) white dwarf (WD) and a red giant (M3-M4 III). We have performed 1-D hydrodynamic simulations with NOVA to predict the behavior of the next outburst. These simulations consist of a range of mass accretion rates onto $\sim$1.35 M$_\odot$ WDs, designed to bound the conditions necessary to achieve ignition of an explosion after an $\approx$80 year inter-outburst period. We have used both carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon initial compositions, in order to include the possible ejecta abundances to be measured in the observations of the next outburst. As the WD in the TCrB system is observed to be massive, theoretical predictions reported here imply that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the TNR. Therefore, the secular evolution of the WD may allow it to approach the Chandrasekhar limit and either explode as a Type Ia supernova or undergo accretion induced collapse, depending on its underlying composition. We have followed the evolution of just the WD, after removing the ejected matter from the surface layers. Our intent is to illuminate the mystery of the unique, second, maximum in the two well observed outbursts and we have found conditions that bracket the predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive air showers produce high-energy muons that can be utilized to probe hadronic interaction models in cosmic ray interactions. Most muons originate from pion and kaon decays, called $\textit{conventional}$ muons, while a smaller fraction, referred to as $\textit{prompt}$ muons, arises from the decay of heavier, short-lived hadrons. The $\texttt{EHISTORY}$ option of the air shower simulation tool $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$ is used in this work to investigate the prompt and conventional muon flux in the energy range of 100 TeV to 100 PeV, utilizing the newly developed open-source python software $\texttt{PANAMA}$. Identifying the muon parent particles allows for scaling the contribution of prompt particles, which can be leveraged by future experimental analyses to measure the normalization of the prompt muon flux. Obtained prompt muon spectra from $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$ are compared to $\texttt{MCEq}$ results. The relevance to large-volume neutrino detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT, and the connection to hadronic interaction models is discussed.

          Systematic study of the composition of Type I X-ray burst ashes: Neutron star structure v.s. Reaction rate uncertainties

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we calculate for the first time the impacts of neutron star(NS) structure on the type I X-ray burst ashes using the \texttt{MESA} code. We find an increased mass fraction of the heavier elements with increasing surface gravity (increase mass or decrease radius), resulting in a higher average mass number ($A_{\rm ash}$) of burst ashes (except for higher mass NS due to the competition between the envelope temperature and the recurrence time). The burst strength ($\alpha$) increases as surface gravity increases, which indicates the positive correlation between $A_{\rm ash}$ and $\alpha$ with changes in surface gravity. If the $\alpha$ value is higher, heavier $p$-nuclei should be produced by the type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis. Besides, the effects of various burst input parameters, e.g. base heating ($Q_{\rm b}$), metallicity ($Z$) and some new reaction rates are calculated for comparison. We find that the heavier nuclei synthesis is inversely correlated to the base heating/metallicity, the smaller the base heating/metallicity, the greater the mass fraction of the heavier elements. The $\alpha$ value decreases as $Q_{\rm b}$ or $Z$ decreases, which also indicates the positive correlation between $A_{\rm ash}$ and $\alpha$ with variation in $Q_{\rm b}$ or $Z$. The new reaction rates from the $(p,\gamma)$ reactions on $^{17}\rm{F}$, $^{19}\rm{F}$, $^{26}\rm{P}$, $^{56}\rm{Cu}$, $^{65}\rm{As}$, and $(\alpha,p)$ reaction on $^{22}\rm{Mg}$ have only minimal effects on burst ashes. In hydrogen-rich X-ray binary systems, nuclei heavier than $^{64}\rm{Ge}$ are fertile produced with larger NS mass, smaller NS radius, smaller base heating and smaller metallicity.

          The Impact of $^{12}$C($α, γ$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Explodability of Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.

          Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. I. Nature of Solar Cycle Variability

 - **Abstract**
 Inter-cycle variations in the series of 11-year solar activity cycles have a significant impact on both the space environment and climate. Whether solar cycle variability is dominated by deterministic chaos or stochastic perturbations remains an open question. Distinguishing between the two mechanisms is crucial for predicting solar cycles. Here we reduce the solar dynamo process responsible for the solar cycle to a one-dimensional iterative map, incorporating recent advance in the observed nonlinearity and stochasticity of the cycle. We demonstrate that deterministic chaos is absent in the nonlinear system, regardless of model parameters, if the generation of the poloidal field follows an increase-then-saturate pattern as the cycle strength increases. The synthesized solar cycles generated by the iterative map exhibit a probability density function (PDF) similar to that of observed normal cycles, supporting the dominant role of stochasticity in solar cycle variability. The parameters governing nonlinearity and stochasticity profoundly influence the PDF. The iterative map provides a quick and effective tool for predicting the range, including uncertainty of the subsequent cycle strength when an ongoing cycle amplitude is known. Due to stochasticity, a solar cycle loses almost all its original information within 1 or 2 cycles. Although the simplicity of the iterative map, the behaviors it exhibits are generic for the nonlinear system. Our results provide guidelines for analyzing solar dynamo models in terms of chaos and stochasticity, highlight the limitation in predicting solar cycle, and motivate further refinement of observational constraints on nonlinear and stochastic processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of GJ 2126 b, a highly eccentric (e = 0.85) Jupiter-like planet orbiting its host star every 272.7 days. The planet was detected and characterized using 112 radial velocity (RV) measurements from HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher), provided by HARPS-RVBank. This planet orbits a low-mass star and ranks among the most eccentric exoplanets discovered, placing it in a unique region of the parameter space of the known exoplanet population. This makes it a valuable addition to the exoplanet demographics, helping to refine our understanding of planetary formation and evolution theories.

 - **Abstract**
 In the near future, the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will obtain unprecedented imaging and spectroscopic data. The statistical errors in the cosmological parameter constraints will be reduced significantly. The corresponding theoretical tools must meet the percent-level accuracy required to extract as much cosmological information as possible from the observations. We present the \texttt{CSST Emulator} to provide nonlinear power spectrum predictions in the eight cosmological parameter space $\Omega_\mathrm{cb},\Omega_\mathrm{b},H_{0},n_{s},A_{s},w_{0}, w_{a}$, and $m_\nu$. It is constructed based on the \textsc{Kun} simulation suite, consisting of 129 high-resolution simulations with box size $L=1\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ and evolving $3072^3$ particles. The determinations of parameter ranges, sampling method, and emulation strategy in the whole construction have been optimized exquisitely. This enables our prediction for $k\leq 10\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2.0$ to reach $1\%$ accuracy validated through internal and external simulations. We also compare our results with recent \texttt{BACCO}, \texttt{EuclidEmulator2}, and \texttt{Mira-Titan IV} emulators, which demonstrate the \texttt{CSST Emulator}'s excellent performance across a wide cosmological parameter range in the nonlinear regime. \texttt{CSST Emulator} is publicly released at this https URL, and provides a fundamental theoretical tool for accurate cosmological inference with future CSST observations.

          New perspectives on MASCARA-1b: A combined analysis of pre- and post-eclipse emission data using CRIRES+

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution emission spectroscopy observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-1b with CRIRES+ in the K-band, covering the post-eclipse phases of its orbit. These observations complement previously published pre-eclipse data. The stellar and telluric features were removed using SysRem, and the planetary signal was analysed with the cross-correlation technique. After confirming the presence of chemical species in our atmospheric model, we combined the pre- and post-eclipse datasets for a joint analysis. By employing a Bayesian retrieval framework, this joint retrieval enabled us to constrain the spatially varying temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detected strong emission signatures of CO and H$_2$O in the post-eclipse and combined datasets. While a well-mixed retrieval model results in a super-solar C/O, allowing for vertically varying chemistry yields C/O values consistent with solar. The retrieved parameters are not only consistent across the datasets but also across different chemical regimes. We did not identify any significant velocity shifts between the detected species or across the datasets, which could otherwise serve as proxies for possible atmospheric dynamics. We also explored phase dependence through the model scaling factor and found no substantial changes in atmospheric properties throughout the observed phases. Due to strong degeneracies between the temperature gradient and chemical abundances, our retrieved temperatures are broadly consistent with either a full redistribution of heat or strong day-night contrasts. While this complicates direct comparisons with recent Spitzer phase curve analyses suggesting inefficient recirculation, we find no clear evidence of spatial variation in the chemical or temperature structure of MASCARA-1b from pre- to post-eclipse, nor temporal variation over $\approx$2 years.

 As the Galactic tide acts to decouple bodies from the scattered disk it creates a spiral structure in physical space that is roughly 15,000 au in length. The spiral is long-lived and persists in the inner Oort cloud to the present time. Here we discuss dynamics underlying the Oort spiral and (feeble) prospects for its observational detection.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a method to determine the reachable set (RS) of spacecraft after a single velocity impulse with an arbitrary direction, which is appropriate for the RS in both the state and observation spaces under arbitrary dynamics, extending the applications of current RS methods from two-body to arbitrary dynamics. First, the single-impulse RS model is generalized as a family of two-variable parameterized polynomials in the differential algebra scheme. Then, using the envelope theory, the boundary of RS is identified by solving the envelope equation. A framework is proposed to reduce the complexity of solving the envelope equation by converting it to the problem of searching the root of a one-variable polynomial. Moreover, a high-order local polynomial approximation for the RS envelope is derived to improve computational efficiency. The method successfully determines the RSs of two near-rectilinear halo orbits in the cislunar space. Simulation results show that the RSs in both state and observation spaces can be accurately approximated under the three-body dynamics, with relative errors of less than 0.0658%. In addition, using the local polynomial approximation, the computational time for solving the envelope equation is reduced by more than 84%.

          The impact of wind accretion in Evolving Symbiotic Systems

 - **Abstract**
 The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to binary systems has long struggled to produce reliable mass accretion efficiencies when the stellar wind velocity of the donor star is smaller than the orbital velocity of the accretor. This limitation is significant in symbiotic systems where such conditions exist. Recently, our group introduced a geometric correction to the standard implementation of the BHL model that demonstrates improved agreement with numerical simulations. The present work investigates the impact of this new implementation on the evolution of symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$_\odot$ white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. The primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis focuses on the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. Our results show that the choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.

          Constraining the Hubble Constant with a Simulated Full Covariance Matrix Using Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, plays a crucial role in understanding the expansion history of the universe and constraining the Hubble constant, $\mathrm{H}_0$. The Cosmic Chronometers (CC) method provides an independent approach to measuring $H(z)$, but existing studies either neglect off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix or use an incomplete covariance matrix, limiting the accuracy of $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints. To address this, we use a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) to simulate the full $33 \times 33$ covariance matrix based on a previously proposed $15 \times 15$ covariance matrix. We find that two key hyperparameters, epochs and batch size, significantly affect the simulation and introduce two criteria for selecting optimal values. Using the simulated covariance matrix, we constrain $\mathrm{H}_0$ via two independent methods: EMCEE and Gaussian Process. Our results show that different hyperparameter selection criteria lead to variations in the chosen combinations but have little impact on the final constrained $\mathrm{H}_0$. However, different epochs and batch size settings do affect the results. Incorporating the simulated covariance matrix increases the uncertainty in $\mathrm{H}_0$ compared to using no covariance matrix or only the proposed $15 \times 15$ covariance matrix. The comparison between EMCEE and GP suggests that the constraint method itself also influences the final $\mathrm{H}_0$. These findings highlight the importance of properly modeling covariance in CC-based $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints.

          The nature of gravitational wave events with host environment escape velocities

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. It also enables testing general relativity and improves source localization, which the latter is instrumental in multi-messenger astronomy. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events originating from globular clusters. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.

          A solution to the Hubble tension with self-interacting ultralight dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We show that oscillations of self-interacting ultralight dark matter with a characteristic energy scale $ \tilde{m} \simeq 1~eV $ naturally act as an extra radiation component just before the recombination era, decreasing the sound horizon radius of the photon-baryon fluid. This reduction leads to an increase in the present-day Hubble parameter, potentially resolving the Hubble tension without the need for exotic matter or energy. The required mass and quartic self-interaction coupling are consistent with current astronomical constraints, including the relic dark matter density. This model could also reduce the $S_8$ tension often associated with other early-time solutions.

          New Potential Ultra-compact X-ray Binaries for Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors From Low-Mass Main-Sequence Companion Channel

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation and evolution of Ultra-Compact X-ray Binaries (UCXBs) using the COMPAS binary evolution code, starting from the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS). Focusing on the low-mass MS companion channel, we simulate gravitational wave (GW) signals from UCXBs with LEGWORK and evaluate their detectability by space-based observatories such as Taiji and TianQin. By incorporating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculations with a threshold of SNR > 5, we provide a realistic framework to assess the detectability of the GW source. Our analysis suggests that the Milky Way currently hosts 7-32 observable UCXBs from the MS companion channel. Taiji or LISA alone could detect 1-6 sources over an 8-year observation period, while TianQin, due to its high-frequency sensitivity, contributes to detecting systems with extremely short orbital periods and can also detect 1-4 sources. Comparison with sensitivity curves validates UCXBs as detectable GW sources, particularly at greater Galactic distances. This study improves our understanding of the evolution of UCXBs and their role as GW sources. By integrating population synthesis, SNR-based analyses, and observational data, we establish UCXBs as significant targets for GW astronomy, paving the way for future missions and theoretical studies of compact binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 To date only very few meteor clusters have been instrumentally recorded. This means that every new detection is an important contribution to the understanding of these phenomena, which are thought to be evidence of the meteoroid fragmentation in the Solar System. On 31 May 2022, at 6:48:55 UT, a cluster consisting of 52 meteors was detected within 8.5 seconds during a predicted outburst of the tau-Herculid meteor shower. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the atmospheric trajectories of the meteors and use the collected information to deduce the origin of the cluster. The meteors were recorded by two video cameras during an airborne campaign. Due to only the single station observation, their trajectories were estimated under the assumption that they belonged to the meteor shower. The mutual positions of the fragments, together with their photometric masses, was used to model the processes leading to the formation of the cluster. The physical properties of the cluster meteors are very similar to the properties of the tau-Herculids. This finding confirms the assumption of the shower membership used for the computation of atmospheric trajectories. This was the third cluster that we have studied in detail, but the first one where we do not see the mass separation of the particles. The cluster is probably less than 2.5 days old, which is too short for such a complete mass separation. Such an age would imply disintegration due to thermal stress. However, we cannot rule out an age of only a few hours, which would allow for other fragmentation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Projects aiming to detect gravitational waves (GWs) in space in the millihertz range will utilize interferometers to measure the separations between free-falling test masses. The phasemeter measures the phase changes of the interference signals caused by the test masses' relative movements. The measurement sensitivity of the phasemeter is one of the key factors in the detection. In this work, we reviewed the core metrology of the phasemeter and evaluated the ultra-low noise performance of the phasemeter with analog signals. Frequency readout noise related to the bit width of the numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) inside the phasemeter is identified as one of the main noise sources of phase measurement theoretically and experimentally. After increasing the NCO bit widths, the single-channel phase noise of the phasemeter reached 2.0 {\mu}rad/Hz^{1/2} at 6 mHz, and the differential phase noise reached 0.4 {\mu}rad/Hz^{1/2} at 6 mHz. The phase noise performances remained consistent within the carrier frequency range of 4.9 MHz to 25.1 MHz.

          Comparative Analysis of EMCEE, Gaussian Process, and Masked Autoregressive Flow in Constraining the Hubble Constant Using Cosmic Chronometers Dataset

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble constant ($\mathrm{H}_0$) is essential for understanding the universe's evolution. Different methods, such as Affine Invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble sampler (EMCEE), Gaussian Process (GP), and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF), are used to constrain $\mathrm{H}_0$ using $H(z)$ data. However, these methods produce varying $\mathrm{H}_0$ values when applied to the same dataset. To investigate these differences, we compare the methods based on their sensitivity to individual data points and their accuracy in constraining $\mathrm{H}_0$. We introduce Multiple Random Sampling Analysis (MRSA) to assess their sensitivity to individual data points. Our findings reveal that GP is more sensitive to individual data points than both MAF and EMCEE, with MAF being more sensitive than EMCEE. Sensitivity also depends on redshift: EMCEE and GP are more sensitive to $H(z)$ at higher redshifts, while MAF is more sensitive at lower redshifts. For accuracy assessment, we simulate $H_{\mathrm{sim}}(z_{\mathrm{sim}})$ datasets with a prior $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{0prior}}$. Comparing the constrained $\mathrm{H_{0sim}}$ values with $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{0prior}}$ shows that EMCEE is the most accurate, followed by MAF, with GP being the least accurate, regardless of the simulation method.

 - **Abstract**
 Binarity in massive stars has proven to be an important aspect in the their evolution. For Be stars, it might be the cause of their spin up, and thus part of the mechanism behind the formation of their viscous decretion disks. Detecting companions in systems with Be stars is challenging, making it difficult to obtain observational constraints on their binary fraction. We explore the effects of a binary companion in a system with a Be star, from disk formation to quasi steady-state using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of coplanar, circular binary systems. High spatial resolution is achieved by adopting particle splitting in the SPH code, as well as a more realistic description of the secondary star and the disk viscosity. The tidal forces considerably affect the Be disk, forming distinct regions in the system, with observational consequences that can be used to infer the presence of a otherwise undetectable companion. With the upgraded code, we can probe a region approximately 4 times larger than previously possible. We describe the configuration and kinematics of each part of the system, and provide a summary of their expected observational signals. Material that enters the Roche lobe of the companion is partially captured by it, forming a rotationally supported, disk-like structure. Material not accreted escapes and forms a circumbinary disk around the system. This is the first work to describe the region beyond the truncation region of the Be disk and its observational consequences with detail. We argue that observational features of previously unclear origin, such as the intermittent shell features and emission features of HR 2142 and HD 55606, originate in areas beyond the truncation region. This new understanding of the behavior of disks in Be binaries will allow not just for better interpretation of existing data, but also for the planning of future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Using new telescope images and archival data, we investigated the positions and motions of the stars in double star system 06160-0745 BRT 376. We found that the two stars share nearly identical parallaxes and exhibit a low relative proper motion, suggesting they move together through space. Furthermore, their combined 3D velocity is less than the calculated escape velocity, indicating they are gravitationally bound rather than just physically near each other. These findings point to 06160-0745 BRT 376 being a true binary system. Future observations will help refine our understanding of its orbital path and further illuminate the nature of stars in close, interacting pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 The renewed global interest in lunar exploration requires new orbital strategies to ensure flight safety which can benefit extended lunar missions and service a plethora of planned instruments in the lunar orbit and surface. We investigate here the equivalent fuel consumption cost to transfer from (to) a given orbit and enter (leave) at any point of an invariant manifold associated with a Lyapunov orbit around the Earth-Moon $L_1$ Lagrangian point using bi-impulsive maneuvers. Whereas solving this type of transfer is generally computationally expensive, we simulate here tens of millions of transfers orbits, for different times of flight, Jacobi constants and spatial location on the manifold. We are able to reduce computational cost by taking advantage of the efficient procedure given by the Theory of Functional Connections for solving boundary value problems, represented with special constraints created to the purposes of this work. We develop here the methodology for constructing these transfers, and apply it to find a low-cost transfer from an orbit around the Earth to a stable manifold and another low-cost transfer from an unstable manifold to an orbit around the Moon. In the end, we obtain an innovative Earth-to-Moon transfer that involves a gravity assist maneuver with the Moon and allows a long stationed stage at the Lyapunov orbit around $L_1$ which can be used for designing multi-purpose missions for extended periods of time with low fuel costs. This is paramount to optimize new exploration concepts.

 - **Abstract**
 DX Cha (HD 104237) is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a Herbig A7.5Ve-A8Ve primary star and a K3-type companion. Here we report on new $3.55$ micrometer interferometric observations of this source with the Multi Aperture Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). To model the four MATISSE observations obtained between 2020 and 2023, we constructed a time-dependent interferometric model of the system, using the oimodeler software. The model consists of an asymmetric ring and two point sources on a Keplerian orbit. Our best-fit model consists of a circumbinary ring with a diameter of $0.86$ au ($8.1$ mas), featuring a strong azimuthal asymmetry. We found that the position angle of the asymmetry changes tens of degrees between the MATISSE epochs. The ring is relatively narrow, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$$0.13$ au ($1.23$ mas). The presence of circumstellar dust emission so close to the binary is unexpected, as previous hydrodynamic simulations predicted an inner disk cavity with a diameter of $\sim$$4$ au ($\sim$$37.5$ mas). Thus, we argue that the narrow envelope of material we detected is probably not a gravitationally stable circumbinary ring, but may be part of tidal accretion streamers channeling material from the inner edge of the disk toward the stars.

 Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. While there is a vast source of candidate systems in the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS, published catalogues of well-characterised systems fall short of reflecting this abundance. We seek to improve the efficiency of efforts to process these data with the development of a machine learning model to inspect dEB light curves and predict the input parameters for subsequent formal analysis by the jktebop code.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology of the Horizontal Branch (HB) in Globular Clusters (GC) is among the early evidences that they contain multiple populations of stars. Indeed, the location of each star along the HB depends both on its initial helium content (Y) and on the global average mass loss along the red giant branch ($\mu$). In most GCs, it is generally straightforward to analyse the first stellar population (standard Y), and the most extreme one (largest Y), while it is more tricky to look at the "intermediate" populations (mildly enhanced Y). In this work, we do this for the GCs NGC6752 and NGC2808; wherever possible the helium abundance for each stellar populations is constrained by using independent measurements present in the literature. We compare population synthesis models with photometric catalogues from the Hubble Space Telescope Treasury survey to derive the parameters of these HB stars. We find that the location of helium enriched stars on the HB is reproduced only by adopting a higher value of $\mu$ with respect to the first generation stars in all the analysed stellar populations. We also find that $\mu$ correlates with the helium enhancement of the populations. This holds for both clusters. This finding is naturally predicted by the model of ''pre-main sequence disc early loss'', previously suggested in the literature, and is consistent with the findings of multiple-populations formation models that foresee the formation of second generation stars in a cooling flow.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a machine learning approach to reconstructing the cosmological initial conditions from late-time dark matter halo number density fields in redshift space, with the goal of improving sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and in particular primordial non-Gaussianity. Using an U-Net architecture, our model achieves a cross-correlation accuracy of 44% for scales out to $k = 0.4 \text{ h}/\text{Mpc}$ between reconstructed and true initial conditions of Quijote 1 Gpc$^3$ simulation boxes with an average halo number density of $\bar{n} = 4\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^{3}$ in the tracer field at $z=0$ . We demonstrate that our reconstruction is likely to be optimal for this setup and that it is highly effective at reducing redshift-space distortions. Using a Fisher analysis, we show that reconstruction improves cosmological parameter constraints derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum. By combining the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole, and bispectrum monopole up to $k_{\rm{max}} = 0.52 \text{ h}/\text{Mpc}$, our joint analysis of pre- and post-reconstructed fields from the Quijote simulation suite finds improved marginalized errors on all cosmological parameters. In particular, reconstruction improves constraints on $f_{\rm{NL}}$ by factors of 1.33, 1.88, and 1.57 for local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of reconstruction in decoupling modes, mitigating redshift-space distortions and maximizing information on cosmology. The results provide important insights into the amount of cosmological information that can be extracted from small scales, and can potentially be used to complement standard analysis of observational data, upon further development.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ultraviolet (UV) Type Ia Supernova CubeSat (UVIa) is a CubeSat/SmallSat mission concept that stands to test critical space-borne UV technology for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) while elucidating long-standing questions about the explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). UVIa will observe whether any SNe Ia emit excess UV light shortly after explosion to test progenitor/explosion models and provide follow-up over many days to characterize their UV and optical flux variations over time, assembling a comprehensive multi-band UV and optical low-redshift anchor sample for upcoming high-redshift SNe Ia surveys (e.g., Euclid, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Roman Space Telescope). UVIa's mission profile requires it to perform rapid and frequent visits to newly discovered SNe Ia, simultaneously observing each SNe Ia in two UV bands (FUV: 1500-1800A and NUV: 1800-2400A) and one optical band (u-band: 3000-4200A). In this study, we describe the UVIa mission concept science motivation, mission design, and key technology development.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multimessenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437$-$4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437$-$4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, concincide with the rough mass range of PSR J0437$-$4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437$-$4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.

          Determination of Hubble constant from Megamaser Cosmology Project using Profile Likelihood

 - **Abstract**
 The Megamaser Cosmology Project inferred a value for the Hubble constant given by $H_0=73.9 \pm 3.0 $ km/sec/Mpc. This value was obtained using Bayesian inference by marginalizing over six nuisance parameters, corresponding to the velocities of the megamaser galaxy systems. We obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant with the same data using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to dispense with the aforementioned nuisance parameters. The frequentist estimate of the Hubble constant is given by $H_0=73.5^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km/sec/Mpc and agrees with the Bayesian estimate to within $0.2\sigma$, and both approaches also produce consistent confidence/credible intervals. Therefore, this analysis provides a proof of principle application of profile likelihood in dealing with nuisance parameters in Cosmology, which is complementary to Bayesian analysis.

          Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations: implications for black hole parameter estimation

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and foundational to modern physics. One of its most important consequences is the constancy of the speed of light. This invariance, together with the geometry of spacetime, implies that no particle can move faster than the speed of light. In this article, we present the most stringent neutrino-based test of this prediction, using the highest energy neutrino ever detected to date, KM3-230213A. The arrival of this event, with an energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}\,\text{PeV}$, sets a constraint on $\delta \equiv c_\nu^2-1 < 4\times10^{-22}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Bondi spherical accretion solution has been used to model accretion onto compact objects in a variety of situations, from interpretation of observations to subgrid models in cosmological simulations. Aims. We aim to investigate how the presence of dark matter (DM) alters the dynamics and physical properties of accretion onto supermassive black holes on scales ranging from ~ 10 pc to the event horizon. Methods. In particular, we investigate Bondi-like accretion flows with zero and low specific angular momentum around supermassive black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos by performing 1D and 2.5D general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations using the black hole accretion code (BHAC). Results. We find notable differences in the dynamics and structure of spherical accretion flows in the presence of DM. The most significant effects include increases in density, temperature, and pressure, as well as variations in radial velocity both inside and outside the regions containing DM or even the production of outflow. Conclusions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the role of cosmological effects, particularly DM, in shaping the behavior of accretion flows and black holes (BHs). Our simulations may be directly applicable to model systems with a large black hole-to-halo mass ratio, which are expected to be found at very high redshifts.

          Using Infrared Dust Echoes to Identify Bright Quasi-periodic Eruption Sources

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei and represent an intriguing new class of transients. Currently, 10 QPE sources are reported in the literature, and a major challenge lies in identifying more because they are (apparently) intrinsically and exclusively X-ray bright. Here we highlight the unusual infrared (IR) echo of the tidal disruption event (TDE) -- and subsequent QPE source -- AT2019qiz, which rose continuously and approximately linearly with time over roughly 1000 days (between 2019 and 2024). We argue that this continuous long rise alongside the relatively high inferred IR temperature (800-1200 K) cannot be generated by the TDE itself, including the late-time/remnant TDE disk, but that the reprocessing of the light from the QPEs by a shell of dust can reproduce the observations. This model predicts 1) IR QPEs at the 0.1 percent level that are potentially detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, and 2) that if the QPEs cease in AT2019qiz, the IR light curve should decline steadily and linearly over the same 1000-day timescale. We identify another TDE with similar IR behavior, AT2020ysg, which could thus harbor QPEs. Our findings and inferences constitute a novel method for identifying ``bright'' QPEs (with peak bolometric luminosities $\gtrsim$10$^{44}$ erg/sec), i.e., that the follow-up of optically selected TDEs with wide-field infrared surveys can indirectly reveal the presence of QPEs. This approach could be particularly effective with the upcoming Roman telescope, which could detect dozens of QPE candidates for high-cadence X-ray follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation and the dynamics of vortex lines in rotating scalar dark matter halos, focusing on models with quartic repulsive self-interactions. In the nonrelativistic regime, vortex lines and their lattices arise from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of motion, as for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates studied in laboratory experiments. Indeed, in such systems vorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field, which leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity background. In the continuum limit where the number of vortex lines becomes very large, we find that the equilibrium solution is a rotating soliton that obeys a solid-body rotation, with an oblate density profile aligned with the direction of the total spin. This configuration is dynamically stable provided the rotational energy is smaller than the self-interaction and gravitational energies. Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with stochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged density profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always emerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex lines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile. These vertical vortex lines form a regular lattice in the equatorial plane, in agreement with the analytical predictions of uniform vortex density and solid-body rotation. These vortex lines might further extend between halos to form the backbone of spinning cosmic filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We need to understand the spin evolution of massive stars to compute their internal rotationally induced mixing processes, isolate effects of close binary evolution, and predict the rotation rates of white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. Aims. We discuss the spindown of massive main sequence stars imposed by stellar winds. Methods. We use detailed grids of single star evolutionary models to predict the distribution of the surface rotational velocities of core-hydrogen burning Galactic massive stars as function of their mass and evolutionary state. We then compare the spin properties of our synthetic populations with appropriately selected sub-samples of Galactic main sequence OB-type stars extracted from the IACOB survey. Results. We find that below $\sim 40 M_\odot$, observations and models agree in finding that the surface rotational velocities of Galactic massive stars remain relatively constant during their main sequence evolution. The more massive stars in the IACOB sample appear to spin down less than predicted, while our updated angular momentum loss prescription predicts an enhanced spindown. Furthermore, the observations show a population of fast rotators, with $v \sin I \gtrsim 200$ km/s persisting for all ages, which is not reproduced by our synthetic single star populations. Conclusions. We conclude that the wind-induced spindown of massive main sequence stars is yet to be fully understood, and that close binary evolution might significantly contribute to the fraction of rapid rotators in massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.
