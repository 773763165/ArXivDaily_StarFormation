#### Korg: fitting, model atmosphere interpolation, and Brackett lines

 - **Abstract**
 We describe several updates to Korg, a package for 1D LTE spectral synthesis of FGKM stars. Built-in functions to fit observed spectra via synthesis or equivalent widths make it easy to take advantage of Korg's automatic differentiation. Comparison to a past analysis of 18 Sco shows that we obtain significantly reduced line-to-line abundance scatter with Korg. Fitting and synthesis are facilitated by a rigorously-tested model atmosphere interpolation method, which introduces negligible error to synthesized spectra for stars with $T_\mathrm{eff} \gtrsim 4000\,\mathrm{K}$. For cooler stars, atmosphere interpolation is complicated by the presence of molecules, though we demonstrate an adequate method for cool dwarfs. The chemical equilibrium solver has been extended to include polyatomic and charged molecules, extending Korg's regime of applicability to M stars. We also discuss a common oversight regarding the synthesis of hydrogen lines in the infrared, and show that Korg's Brackett line profiles are a much closer match to observations than others available.

 - **Abstract**
 Reviewing the empirical and theoretical parameter relationships between various parameters is a good way to understand more about contact binary systems. In this investigation, two-dimensional (2D) relationships for P-M_V(system), P-L_1,2, M_1,2-L_1,2, and q-L_ratio were revisited. The sample used is related to 118 contact binary systems with an orbital period shorter than 0.6 days whose absolute parameters were estimated based on the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) parallax. We reviewed previous studies on 2D relationships and updated six parameter relationships. Therefore, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Machine Learning (ML) methods were used, and the outcomes were compared. We selected 22 contact binary systems from eight previous studies for comparison, which had light curve solutions using spectroscopic data. The results show that the systems are in good agreement with the results of this study.

 - **Abstract**
 ESA's Hera mission aims to visit binary asteroid Didymos in late 2026, investigating its physical characteristics and the result of NASA's impact by the DART spacecraft in more detail. Two CubeSats on-board Hera plan to perform a ballistic landing on the secondary of the system, called Dimorphos. For these types of landings the translational state during descent is not controlled, reducing the spacecrafts complexity but also increasing its sensitivity to deployment maneuver errors and dynamical uncertainties. This paper introduces a novel methodology to analyse the effect of these uncertainties on the dynamics of the lander and design a trajectory that is robust against them. This methodology consists of propagating the uncertain state of the lander using the non-intrusive Chebyshev interpolation (NCI) technique, which approximates the uncertain dynamics using a polynomial expansion, and analysing the results using the pseudo-diffusion indicator, derived from the coefficients of the polynomial expansion, which quantifies the rate of growth of the set of possible states of the spacecraft over time. This indicator is used here to constrain the impact velocity and angle to values which allow for successful settling on the surface. This information is then used to optimize the landing trajectory by applying the NCI technique inside the transcription of the problem. The resulting trajectory increases the robustness of the trajectory compared to a conventional method, improving the landing success by 20 percent and significantly reducing the landing footprint.

 - **Abstract**
 In the recent years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as one of the most interesting and hotly debated topics in cosmology. Among other possibilities, PBHs could explain both some of the signals from binary black hole mergers observed in gravitational wave detectors and an important component of the dark matter in the Universe. Significant progress has been achieved both on the theory side and from the point of view of observations, including new models and more accurate calculations of PBH formation, evolution, clustering, merger rates, as well as new astrophysical and cosmological probes. In this work, we review, analyse and combine the latest developments in order to perform end-to-end calculations of the various gravitational wave signatures of PBHs. Different ways to distinguish PBHs from stellar black holes are emphasized. Finally, we discuss their detectability with LISA, the first planned gravitational-wave observatory in space.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the mass-radius relation of individual white dwarfs is an empirically challenging task that has been performed for only a few dozen stars. We measure the white dwarf mass-radius relation using gravitational redshifts and radii of 137 white dwarfs in wide binaries with main sequence companions. We obtain the space velocities to these systems using the main sequence companion, and subtract these Doppler redshifts from the white dwarfs' apparent motions, isolating their gravitational redshifts. We use Gaia data to calculate the surface temperatures and radii of these white dwarfs, thereby deriving an empirical gravitational redshift-radius relation. This work demonstrates the utility of low-resolution Galactic surveys to measure the white dwarf equation of state. Our results are consistent with theoretical models, and represent the largest sample of individual white dwarf gravitational redshift measurements to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Common-envelope evolution - where a star is engulfed by a companion - is a critical but poorly understood step in, e.g., the formation pathways for gravitational-wave sources. However, it has been extremely challenging to identify observable signatures of such systems. We show that for systems involving a neutron star, the hypothesized super-Eddington accretion onto the neutron star produces MeV-range, months-long neutrino signals within reach of present and planned detectors. While there are substantial uncertainties on the rate of such events (0.01-1/century in the Milky Way) and the neutrino luminosity (which may be less than the accretion power), this signal can only be found if dedicated new searches are developed. If detected, the neutrino signal would lead to significant new insights into the astrophysics of common-envelope evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 4-Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity has garnered significant attention in the last few years as a phenomenological competitor to general relativity. We consider the theoretical and observational implications of this theory in both the early and late universe, (re-)deriving background and perturbation equations and constraining its characteristic parameters with data from cosmological probes. Our investigation surpasses the scope of previous studies by incorporating non-flat spatial sections. We explore consequences of 4DEGB on the sound and particle horizons in the very early universe, and demonstrate that 4DEGB can provide an independent solution to the horizon problem for some values of its characteristic parameter $\alpha$. Finally, we constrain an unexplored regime of this theory in the limit of small coupling $\alpha$ (empirically supported in the post-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis era by prior constraints). This version of 4DEGB includes a geometric term that resembles dark radiation at the background level, but whose influence on the perturbed equations is qualitatively distinct from that of standard forms of dark radiation. In this limit, only one beyond-$\Lambda$CDM degree of freedom persists, which we denote as $\tilde{\alpha}_C$. Our analysis yields the estimate $\tilde{\alpha}_C = (-9 \pm 6) \times 10^{-6}$ thereby providing a new constraint of a previously untested sector of 4DEGB.
#### Updated Proper Motion of the Neutron Star in the Supernova Remnant  Cassiopeia~A

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19879
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present updated estimates of the velocity of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A using over two decades of Chandra observations. We use two methods: 1.) recording NS positions from dozens of Chandra observations, including the astrometric uncertainty estimates on the data points but not correcting the astrometry of the observations, and 2.) correcting the astrometry of the 13 Chandra observations that have a sufficient number of point sources with identified Gaia counterparts. For method #1, we find velocity of 280 $\pm$ 123 km s$^{-1}$, with an angle of 87 $\pm$ 22 degrees south of east. For method #2, we find a velocity of 445 $\pm$ 90 km s$^{-1}$ at an angle of 68 $\pm$ 12 degrees south of east. Both of these results match with the explosion-center-estimated velocity of $\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$ and the previous 10 year baseline proper motion measurement of 570 $\pm$ 260 km s$^{-1}$, but our use of additional data over a longer baseline has led to a smaller uncertainty by a factor of 2$\unicode{x2013}$3. Our estimates rule out velocities $\gtrsim$600 km s$^{-1}$ and better match with simulations of Cassiopeia A that include NS kick mechanisms.
#### Free-Form and Hybrid Lens Models for SDSS J1004+4112: Substructure and  Central Image Time Delay Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS J1004+4112 is a well studied gravitational lens with a recently measured time delay between its first and fourth arriving quasar images. Using this new constraint, we present updated free-form lens reconstructions using the lens inversion method {\tt GRALE}, which only uses multiple image and time delay data as inputs. In addition, we obtain hybrid lens reconstructions by including a model of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) as a Sersic lens. For both reconstructions, we use two sets of images as input: one with all identified images, and the other a revised set leaving out images that have been potentially misidentified. We also develop a source position optimization MCMC routine, performed on completed {\tt GRALE} runs, that allows each model to better match observed image positions and time delays. All the reconstructions produce similar mass distributions, with the hybrid models finding a steeper profile in the center. Similarly, all the mass distributions are fit by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, finding results consistent with previous parametric reconstructions and those derived from Chandra X-ray observations. We identify a $\sim 5 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ substructure apparently unaffiliated with any cluster member galaxy and present in all our models, and study its reality. Using our free-form and hybrid models we predict a central quasar image time delay of $\sim 2980 \pm 270$ and $\sim 3280 \pm 215$ days, respectively. A potential future measurement of this time delay will, while being an observational challenge, further constrain the steepness of the central density profile.
#### Spectroscopic Links Among Giant Planet Irregular Satellites and Trojans

 - **Abstract**
 We collect near-infrared spectra ($\sim0.75-2.55\ \mu m$) of four Jovian irregular satellites and visible spectra ($\sim0.32-1.00\ \mu m$) of two Jovian irregular satellites, two Uranian irregular satellites, and four Neptune Trojans. We find close similarities between observed Jovian irregular satellites and previously characterized Jovian Trojans. However, irregular satellites' unique collisional histories complicate comparisons to other groups. Laboratory study of CM and CI chondrites show that grain size and regolith packing conditions strongly affect spectra of dark, carbonaceous materials. We hypothesize that different activity histories of these objects, which may have originally contained volatile ices that subsequently sublimated, could cause differences in regolith grain-size or packing properties and therefore drive spectral variation. The Uranian satellites Sycorax and Caliban appear similar to TNOs. However, we detect a feature near 0.7 $\mu m$ on Sycorax, suggesting the presence of hydrated materials. While the sample of Neptune Trojans have more neutral spectra than the Uranian satellites we observe, they remain consistent with the broad color distribution of the Kuiper belt. We detect a possible feature near 0.65-0.70 $\mu m$ on Neptune Trojan 2006 RJ103, suggesting that hydrated material may also be present in this population. Characterizing hydrated materials in the outer solar system may provide critical context regarding the origins of hydrated CI and CM chondrite meteorites. We discuss how the hydration state(s) of the irregular satellites constrains the thermal histories of the interiors of their parent bodies, which may have formed among the primordial Kuiper belt.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (SNs) are one of the most powerful cosmic sources of neutrinos, with energies of several MeV. The emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carries away the gravitational binding energy of the compact remnant and drives its evolution from the hot initial to the cold final states. Detecting these neutrinos from Earth and analyzing the emitted signals present a unique opportunity to explore the neutrino mass ordering problem. This research outlines the detection of neutrinos from SNs and their relevance in understanding the neutrino mass ordering. The focus is on developing a model-independent analysis strategy, achieved by comparing distinct detection channels in large underground detectors. The objective is to identify potential indicators of mass ordering within the neutrino sector. Additionally, a thorough statistical analysis is performed on the anticipated neutrino signals for both mass orderings. Despite uncertainties in supernova explosion parameters, an exploration of the parameter space reveals an extensive array of models with significant sensitivity to differentiate between mass orderings. The assessment of various observables and their combinations underscores the potential of forthcoming supernova observations in addressing the neutrino mass ordering problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed distribution of cosmological Long-soft Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) has been argued as the first direct evidence of Collapsars. A similar plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed duration distribution of Short-hard Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs) has been suggested as evidence of compact binary mergers. We present an equally plausible alternative interpretation for this evidence, which is purely statistical. Specifically, we show that the observed plateau in the short-duration tail of the duration distribution of LGRBs can naturally occur in the statistical distributions of strictly-positive physical quantities, exacerbated by the effects of mixing with the duration distribution of SGRBs, observational selection effects and data aggregation (e.g., binning) methodologies. The observed plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed distributions of SGRBs can similarly result from a combination of sample incompleteness and inhomogeneous binning of data.

 - **Abstract**
 We show, for the first time, radio measurements of the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) of air showers induced by cosmic rays that are compared to measurements of the established fluorescence method at the same location. Using measurements at the Pierre Auger Observatory we show full compatibility between our radio and the previously published fluorescence data set, and between a subset of air showers observed simultaneously with both radio and fluorescence techniques, a measurement setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory. Furthermore, we show radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy and demonstrate the ability to make competitive high-resolution $X_\text{max}$ measurements with even a sparse radio array. With this, we show that the radio technique is capable of cosmic-ray mass composition studies, both at Auger and at other experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is currently the largest array of radio antenna stations deployed for the detection of cosmic rays, spanning an area of $17$ km$^2$ with 153 radio stations. It detects the radio emission of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays in the $30-80$ MHz band. Here, we report the AERA measurements of the depth of the shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$), a probe for mass composition, at cosmic-ray energies between $10^{17.5}$ to $10^{18.8}$ eV, which show agreement with earlier measurements with the fluorescence technique at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show advancements in the method for radio $X_\text{max}$ reconstruction by comparison to dedicated sets of CORSIKA/CoREAS air-shower simulations, including steps of reconstruction-bias identification and correction, which is of particular importance for irregular or sparse radio arrays. Using the largest set of radio air-shower measurements to date, we show the radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy, reaching a resolution better than $15$ g cm$^{-2}$ at the highest energies, demonstrating that radio $X_\text{max}$ measurements are competitive with the established high-precision fluorescence technique. In addition, we developed a procedure for performing an extensive data-driven study of systematic uncertainties, including the effects of acceptance bias, reconstruction bias, and the investigation of possible residual biases. These results have been cross-checked with air showers measured independently with both the radio and fluorescence techniques, a setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory.
#### Constraining primordial black hole masses through $f(R)$ gravity  scalarons in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

 - **Abstract**
 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is a strong probe for constraining new physics including gravitation. $f(R)$ gravity theory is an interesting alternative to general relativity which introduces additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. In this work we demonstrate the existence of black hole solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and develop a relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass. We have used observed bound on the freezeout temperature to constrain scalaron mass range by modifying the cosmic expansion rate at the BBN epoch. The mass range of primordial black holes (PBHs) which are astrophysical dark matter candidates is deduced. The range of scalaron mass which does not spoil the BBN era is found to be $10^{-16}-10^4 \text{ eV}$. The scalaron mass window $10^{-16}-10^{-14}\text{ eV}$ is consistent with the $f(R)$ gravity PPN parameter derived from solar system experiments. The PBH mass range is obtained as $10^6-10^{-14}\text{ }M_{\odot}$. Scalarons constrained by BBN are also eligible to accommodate axion like dark matter particles. Estimation of deuterium (D) fraction and relative D+$^3$He abundance in the $f(R)$ gravity scenario shows that the BBN history mimics that of general relativity. While the PBH mass range is eligible for non-baryonic dark matter, the BBN bounded scalarons provide with an independent strong field test of $f(R)$ gravity.
#### Hybrid propagation physics for the design and modeling of astronomical  observatories: a coronagraphic example

 - **Abstract**
 For diffraction-limited optical systems an accurate physical optics model is necessary to properly evaluate instrument performance. Astronomical observatories outfitted with coronagraphs for direct exoplanet imaging require physical optics models to simulate the effects of misalignment and diffraction. Accurate knowledge of the observatory's PSF is integral for the design of high-contrast imaging instruments and simulation of astrophysical observations. The state of the art is to model the misalignment, ray aberration, and diffraction across multiple software packages, which complicates the design process. Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition (GBD) is a ray-based method of diffraction calculation that has been widely implemented in commercial optical design software. By performing the coherent calculation with data from the ray model of the observatory, the ray aberration errors can be fed directly into the physical optics model of the coronagraph, enabling a more integrated model of the observatory. We develop a formal algorithm for the transfer-matrix method of GBD, and evaluate it against analytical results and a traditional physical optics model to assess the suitability of GBD for high-contrast imaging simulations. Our GBD simulations of the observatory PSF, when compared to the analytical Airy function, have a sum-normalized RMS difference of ~10^-6. These fields are then propagated through a Fraunhofer model of a exoplanet imaging coronagraph where the mean residual numerical contrast is 4x10^-11, with a maximum near the inner working angle at 5x10^-9. These results show considerable promise for the future development of GBD as a viable propagation technique in high-contrast imaging. We developed this algorithm in an open-source software package and outlined a path for its continued development to increase the fidelity and flexibility of diffraction simulations using GBD.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of heavy stars ($M\ge40{\rm M}_\odot$) undergoing pair-instability in the presence of annihilating dark matter. Focusing on the scenario where the dark matter is in capture-annihilation equilibrium, we model the profile of energy injections in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that significant changes to masses of astrophysical black holes formed by (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae can occur when the ambient dark matter density $ \rho_{\rm DM} \gtrsim10^9 \rm \, GeV \, cm^{-3}$. There are two distinct outcomes, depending on the dark matter mass. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim1$ GeV the DM is primarily confined to the core. The annihilation increases the lifetime of core helium burning, resulting in more oxygen being formed, fueling a more violent explosion during the pair-instability-induced contraction. This drives stronger pulsations, leading to lighter black holes being formed than predicted by the standard model. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\lesssim0.5$ GeV there is significant dark matter in the envelope, leading to a phase where the star is supported by the energy from the annihilation. This reduces the core temperature and density, allowing the star to evade the pair-instability allowing heavier black holes to be formed. We find a mass gap for all models studied.
#### Does the $ν_{\max}$ scaling relation depend on metallicity? Insights  from 3D convection simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Solar-like oscillations have been detected in thousands of stars thanks to modern space missions. These oscillations have been used to measure stellar masses and ages, which have been widely applied in Galactic archaeology. One of the pillars of such applications is the $\nu_{\max}$ scaling relation: the frequency of maximum power $\nu_{\max}$, assumed to be proportional to the acoustic cut-off frequency, $\nu_{\rm ac}$, scales with effective temperature and surface gravity. However, the theoretical basis of the $\nu_{\max}$ scaling relation is uncertain, and there is an ongoing debate about whether it can be applied to metal-poor stars. We investigate the metallicity dependence of the $\nu_{\max}$ scaling relation by carrying out 3D near-surface convection simulations for solar-type stars with [Fe/H] between -3 and 0.5 dex. Firstly, we found a negative correlation between $\nu_{\rm ac}$ and metallicity from the 3D models. This is in tension with the positive correlation identified by studies using 1D models. Secondly, we estimated theoretical $\nu_{\max}$ values using velocity amplitudes determined from first principles, by quantifying the mode excitation and damping rates with methods validated in our previous works. We found that at solar effective temperature and surface gravity, $\nu_{\max}$ does not show correlation with metallicity. This study opens an exciting prospect of testing the asteroseismic scaling relations against realistic 3D hydrodynamical stellar models.

 - **Abstract**
 Time dependent photoionization modeling of warm absorber outflows in active galactic nuclei can play an important role in understanding the interaction between warm absorbers and the central black hole. The warm absorber may be out of the equilibrium state because of the variable nature of the central continuum. In this paper, with the help of time dependent photoionization modeling, we study how the warm absorber gas changes with time and how it reacts to changing radiation fields. Incorporating a flaring incident light curve, we investigate the behavior of warm absorbers using a photoionization code that simultaneously and consistently solves the time dependent equations of level population, heating and cooling, and radiative transfer. We simulate the physical processes in the gas clouds, such as ionization, recombination, heating, cooling, and the transfer of ionizing radiation through the cloud. We show that time dependent radiative transfer is important and that calculations which omit this effect quantitatively and systematically underestimate the absorption. Such models provide crucial insights into the characteristics of warm absorbers and can constrain their density and spatial distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the fundamental questions in astronomy is how planetary systems form and evolve. Measuring the planetary occurrence and architecture as a function of time directly addresses this question. In the fourth paper of the Planets Across Space and Time (PAST) series, we investigate the occurrence and architecture of Kepler planetary systems as a function of kinematic age by using the LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler sample. To isolate the age effect, other stellar properties (e.g., metallicity) have been controlled. We find the following results. (1) The fraction of stars with Kepler-like planets ($F_{\text{Kep}}$) is about 50% for all stars; no significant trend is found between $F_{\text{Kep}}$ and age. (2) The average planet multiplicity ($\bar{N}_p$) exhibits a decreasing trend (~2$\sigma$ significance) with age. It decreases from $\bar{N}_p$~3 for stars younger than 1 Gyr to $\bar{N}_p$~1.8 for stars about 8 Gyr. (3) The number of planets per star ($\eta=F_{\text{Kep}}\times\bar{N}_p$) also shows a decreasing trend (~2-3$\sigma$ significance). It decreases from $\eta$~1.6-1.7 for young stars to $\eta$~1.0 for old stars. (4) The mutual orbital inclination of the planets ($\sigma_{i,k}$) increases from $1.2^{+1.4}_{-0.5}$ to $3.5^{+8.1}_{-2.3}$ as stars aging from 0.5 to 8 Gyr with a best fit of $\log{\sigma_{i,k}}=0.2+0.4\times\log{\frac{\text{Age}}{\text{1Gyr}}}$. Interestingly, the Solar System also fits such a trend. The nearly independence of $F_{\text{Kep}}$~50% on age implies that planet formation is robust and stable across the Galaxy history. The age dependence of $\bar{N}_p$ and $\sigma_{i,k}$ demonstrates planetary architecture is evolving, and planetary systems generally become dynamically hotter with fewer planets as they age.

 - **Abstract**
 We present zephyr, a novel method that integrates cutting-edge normalizing flow techniques into a mixture density estimation framework, enabling the effective use of heterogeneous training data for photometric redshift inference. Compared to previous methods, zephyr demonstrates enhanced robustness for both point estimation and distribution reconstruction by leveraging normalizing flows for density estimation and incorporating careful uncertainty quantification. Moreover, zephyr offers unique interpretability by explicitly disentangling contributions from multi-source training data, which can facilitate future weak lensing analysis by providing an additional quality assessment. As probabilistic generative deep learning techniques gain increasing prominence in astronomy, zephyr should become an inspiration for handling heterogeneous training data while remaining interpretable and robustly accounting for observational uncertainties.
#### The Connection between the Intracluster Light and its Host Halo:  Formation Time and Contribution from Different Channels

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the analysis presented in Contini et al. 2023 to higher redshifts, up to $z=2$, by focusing on the relation between the intracluster light (ICL) fraction and the halo mass, its dependence with redshift, role played by the halo concentration and formation time, in a large sample of simulated galaxy groups/clusters with $13\lesssim \log M_{halo} \lesssim 15$. Moreover, a key focus is to isolate the relative contributions provided by the main channels for the ICL formation to the total amount. The ICL fraction at higher redshift is weakly dependent on halo mass, and comparable with that at the present time, in agreement with recent observations. Stellar stripping, mergers and pre-processing are the major responsible channels of the ICL formation, with stellar stripping that accounts for $\sim 90\%$ of the total ICL, regardless of halo mass and redshift. Pre-processing is an important process for clusters to accrete already formed ICL. The diffuse component forms very early, $z\sim 0.6$, and its formation depends on both concentration and formation time of the halo, with more concentrated and earlier formed haloes that assemble their ICL earlier than later formed ones. The efficiency of this process is independent of halo mass, but increases with decreasing redshift, which implies that stellar stripping becomes more important with time as the concentration increases. This highlights the link between the ICL and the dynamical state of a halo: groups/clusters that have a higher fraction of diffuse light are more concentrated, relaxed and in an advanced stage of growth.

 - **Abstract**
 The isotopic ratios are good tools for probing the stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution. We performed high-sensitivity mapping observations of the J=7-6 rotational transitions of OCS, OC34S, O13CS, and OC33S toward the Galactic Center giant molecular cloud, Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) with IRAM 30m telescope. Positions with optically thin and uncontaminated lines are chosen to determine the sulfur isotope ratios. A 32S/34S ratio of 17.1\pm0.9 was derived with OCS and OC34S lines, while 34S/33S ratio of 6.8\pm1.9 was derived directly from integrated intensity ratio of OC34S and OC33S. With independent and accurate measurements of 32S/34S ratio, our results confirm the termination of the decreasing trend of 32S/34S ratios toward the Galactic Center, suggesting a drop in the production of massive stars at the Galactic centre.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently astrometric microlensing is the only tool that can directly measure the mass of a single star, it can also help us to detect compact objects like isolated neutron stars and black holes. The number of microlensing events that are being predicted and reported is increasing. In the paper, the potential lens stars are selected from three types of stars, high-proper-motion stars, nearby stars and high-mass stars. For each potential lens star, we select a larger search scope to find possible matching sources to avoid missing events as much as possible. Using Gaia DR3 data, we predict 4500 astrometric microlensing events with signal>0.1mas that occur between J2010.0 and J2070.0, where 1664 events are different from those found previously. There are 293 lens stars that can cause two or more events, where 5 lens stars can cause more than 50 events. We find that 116 events have the distance of background stars from the proper motion path of lens stars more than 8 arcsec in the reference epoch, where the maximum distance is 16.6 arcsec, so the cone search method of expanding the search range of sources for each potential lens star can reduce the possibility of missing events.
#### Further Development of Event-Based Analysis of X-ray Polarization Data

 - **Abstract**
 An event-based maximum likelihood method for handling X-ray polarimetry data is extended to include the effects of background and nonuniform sampling of the possible position angle space. While nonuniform sampling in position angle space generally introduces cross terms in the uncertainties of polarization parameters that could create degeneracies, there are interesting cases that engender no bias or parameter covariance. When including background in Poisson-based likelihood formulation, the formula for the minimum detectable polarization (MDP) has nearly the same form as for the case of Gaussian statistics derived by Elsner et al. (2012) in the limiting case of an unpolarized signal. A polarized background is also considered, which demonstrably increases uncertainties in source polarization measurements. In addition, a Kolmogorov-style test of the event position angle distribution is proposed that can provide an unbinned test of models where the polarization angle in Stokes space depends on event characteristics such as time or energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The dust in planet-forming disks evolve rapidly through growth and radial drift, and external photoevaporation also contributes to this evolution in massive star-forming regions. We test whether the presence of substructures can explain the survival of the dust component and observed millimeter continuum emission in protoplanetary disks located within massive star-forming regions. We also characterize the dust content removed by the photoevaporative winds. For this, we performed hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks subject to irradiation fields of $F_{UV} = 10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4\, G_0$, with different dust trap locations. We used the FRIED grid to derive the mass loss rate for each irradiation field and disk properties, and then measure the evolution of the dust mass over time. For each simulation we estimate continuum emission at $\lambda = 1.3\, \textrm{mm}$ along with the radii encompassing $90\%$ of the continuum flux, and characterize the dust size distribution entrained in the photoevaporative winds, along with the resulting far-ultraviolet (FUV) cross section. Our simulations show that the presence of dust traps can extend the lifetime of the dust component of the disk to a few millionyears if the FUV irradiation is $F_{UV} \lesssim 10^3 G_0$, but only if the dust traps are located inside the photoevaporative truncation radius. The dust component of a disk quickly disperse if the FUV irradiation is strong ($10^4\, G_0$) or if the substructures are located outside the photoevaporation radius. We do find however, that the dust grains entrained with the photoevaporative winds may result in an absorption FUV cross section of $\sigma \approx 10^{-22}\, \textrm{cm}^2$ at early times of evolution ($<$0.1 Myr), which is enough to trigger a self-shielding effect that reduces the total mass loss rate, and slow down the disk dispersal in a negative feedback loop process.
#### How do baryonic effects on the cosmic matter distribution vary with  scale and local density environment?

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20278
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20278
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate how the baryonic effects vary with scale and local density environment mainly by utilizing a novel statistic, the environment-dependent wavelet power spectrum (env-WPS). With four state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, EAGLE, SIMBA, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG, we compare the env-WPS of the total matter density field between the hydrodynamic and dark matter-only (DMO) runs at $z=0$. We find that the clustering is most strongly suppressed in the emptiest environment of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}<0.1$ with maximum amplitudes $\sim67-89$ per cent on scales $\sim1.86-10.96\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and less suppressed in higher density environments on small scales (except Illustris). In the environments of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}\geqslant0.316$ ($\geqslant10$ in EAGLE), the feedbacks also lead to enhancement features at intermediate and large scales, which is most pronounced in the densest environment of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}\geqslant100$ and reaches a maximum $\sim 7-15$ per cent on scales $\sim0.87-2.62\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (except Illustris). The baryon fraction of the local environment decreases with increasing density, denoting the feedback strength, and potentially explaining some differences between simulations. We also measure the volume and mass fractions of local environments, which are affected by $\gtrsim 1$ per cent due to baryon physics. In conclusion, our results reveal that the baryonic processes can change the overall cosmic structure greatly over the scales of $k>0.1\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These findings warrant further investigation and confirmation by using much larger or more numerous simulations, comparing different cosmic structure classifications, or altering a specific process in the simulation, e.g. the star formation, black hole accretion, stellar feedback or active galactic nucleus feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets move supersonically in a gaseous medium during planetary engulfment, stellar interactions and within protoplanetary disks. For a nearly uniform medium, the relevant parameters are the Mach number and the size of the body, $R$, relative to its accretion radius, $R_A$. Over many decades, numerical and analytical work has characterized the flow, the drag on the body and the possible suite of instabilities. Only a limited amount of work has treated the stellar boundary as it is in many of these astrophysical settings, a hard sphere at $R$. Thus we present new 3-D Athena++ hydrodynamic calculations for a large range of parameters. For $R_A\ll R$, the results are as expected for pure hydrodynamics with minimal impact from gravity, which we verify by comparing to experimental wind tunnel data in air. When $R_A\approx R$, a hydrostatically-supported separation bubble forms behind the gravitating body, exerting significant pressure on the sphere and driving a recompression shock which intersects with the bow shock. For $R_A\gg R$, the bubble transitions into an isentropic, spherically-symmetric halo, as seen in earlier works. These two distinct regimes of flow morphology may be treated separately in terms of their shock stand-off distance and drag coefficients. Most importantly for astrophysical applications, we propose a new formula for the dynamical friction which depends on the ratio of the shock stand-off distance to $R_A$. That exploration also reveals the minimum size of the simulation domain needed to accurately capture the deflection of incoming streamlines due to gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the spin-up of a mass-accreting star in a close binary system passing through the first stage of mass exchange in the Hertzsprung gap. Inside an accreting star, angular momentum is carried by meridional circulation and shear turbulence. The circulation carries part of the angular momentum entering the accretor to its surface. The greater the rate of arrival of angular momentum in the accretor is, the greater this part. It is assumed that this part of the angular momentum can be removed by the disk further from the accretor. If the angular momentum in the matter entering the accretor is more than half the Keplerian value, then the angular momentum obtained by the accretor during mass exchange stage does not depend on the rate of arrival of angular momentum. The accretor may have the characteristics of a Be-star immediately after the end of mass exchange.

 - **Abstract**
 Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is a $N$-body software developed for the time-efficient integration of collisional and fragmenting systems of planetesimals or moonlets orbiting a central mass. It features a fragmentation model, based on crater scaling and ejecta models, able to realistically simulate a violent impact. The user of Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N can choose between four different built-in modules to compute self-gravity and detect collisions. One of these makes use of a mesh-based algorithm to treat mutual interactions in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time. Another module, much more efficient than the standard Barnes-Hut tree code, is a $\mathcal{O}(N)$ tree-based algorithm called FalcON. It relies on fast multipole expansion for gravity computation and we adapted it to collision detection as well. Computation time is reduced by building the tree structure using a three-dimensional Hilbert curve. For the same precision in mutual gravity computation, Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is found to be up to 25 times faster than the famous software REBOUND. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is written entirely in the C language and only needs a C compiler to run. A python add-on, that requires only basic python libraries, produces animations of the simulations from the output files. The name Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N, reminding of a scorpion, comes from the French $N$-corps, meaning $N$-body, and from the mathematical notation $\mathcal{O}(N)$, due to the running time of the software being almost linear in the total number $N$ of moonlets. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is designed for the study of accreting or fragmenting disks of planetesimal or moonlets. It detects collisions and computes mutual gravity faster than REBOUND, and unlike other $N$-body integrators, it can resolve a collision by fragmentation. The fast multipole expansions are implemented up to order six to allow for a high precision in mutual gravity computation.

 - **Abstract**
 To probe star formation processes, we present a multi-scale and multi-wavelength investigation of the `Snake' nebula/infrared dark cloud G11.11$-$0.12 (hereafter, G11; length $\sim$27 pc). Spitzer images hint at the presence of sub-filaments (in absorption), and reveal four infrared-dark hub-filament system (HFS) candidates (extent $<$ 6 pc) toward G11, where massive clumps ($>$ 500 $M_{\odot}$) and protostars are identified. The $^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), and NH$_{3}$(1,1) line data reveal a noticeable velocity oscillation toward G11, as well as its left part (or part-A) around V$_{lsr}$ of 31.5 km s$^{-1}$, and its right part (or part-B) around V$_{lsr}$ of 29.5 km s$^{-1}$. The common zone of these cloud components is investigated toward the center's G11 housing one HFS. Each cloud component hosts two sub-filaments. In comparison to part-A, more ATLASGAL clumps are observed toward part-B. The JWST near-infrared images discover one infrared-dark HFS candidate (extent $\sim$0.55 pc) around the massive protostar G11P1 (i.e., G11P1-HFS). Hence, the infrared observations reveal multiple infrared-dark HFS candidates at multi-scale in G11. The ALMA 1.16 mm continuum map shows multiple finger-like features (extent $\sim$3500-10000 AU) surrounding a dusty envelope-like feature (extent $\sim$18000 AU) toward the central hub of G11P1-HFS. Signatures of forming massive stars are found toward the center of the envelope-like feature. The ALMA H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ line data show two cloud components with a velocity separation of $\sim$2 km s$^{-1}$ toward G11P1. Overall, the collision process, the ``fray and fragment'' mechanism, and the ``global non-isotropic collapse'' scenario seem to be operational in G11.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however earlier data shows no variability for at least 10 years prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H$\alpha$ emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc ($z=0.13$) and G274296 ($z>0.42$) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multi-messenger contaminants.
#### Observational Bias and Young Massive Cluster Characterisation II. Can  Gaia accurately observe young clusters and associations?

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of clusters suffer from issues such as completeness, projection effects, resolving individual stars and extinction. As such, how accurate are measurements and conclusions are likely to be? Here, we take cluster simulations (Westerlund2- and Orion- type), synthetically observe them to obtain luminosities, accounting for extinction and the inherent limits of Gaia, then place them within the real Gaia DR3 catalogue. We then attempt to rediscover the clusters at distances of between 500pc and 4300pc. We show the spatial and kinematic criteria which are best able to pick out the simulated clusters, maximising completeness and minimising contamination. We then compare the properties of the 'observed' clusters with the original simulations. We looked at the degree of clustering, the identification of clusters and subclusters within the datasets, and whether the clusters are expanding or contracting. Even with a high level of incompleteness (e.g. $<2\%$ stellar members identified), similar qualitative conclusions tend to be reached compared to the original dataset, but most quantitative conclusions are likely to be inaccurate. Accurate determination of the number, stellar membership and kinematic properties of subclusters, are the most problematic to correctly determine, particularly at larger distances due to the disappearance of cluster substructure as the data become more incomplete, but also at smaller distances where the misidentification of asterisms as true structure can be problematic. Unsurprisingly, we tend to obtain better quantitative agreement of properties for our more massive Westerlund2-type cluster. We also make optical style images of the clusters over our range of distances.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova explosions attributed to the unseen companion in several binary systems identified by the Third Gaia Data Release (Gaia DR3) may be responsible for a number of well-known and well-studied features in the radio sky, including the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and the North-Celestial-Pole Loop. Slices from the Longitude-Latitude-Velocity data cube of the $\lambda$-21-cm galactic neutral hydrogen HI4PI survey (HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016) show multiple signatures of an expanding shell. The source of this expansion, which includes the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch on the approaching side, may be the neutron star candidate in the Gaia DR3 1093757200530267520 binary. If we make the simplifying assumptions that the expansion of the cavity is uniform and spherically symmetric, then the explosion took place about 700,000 years ago. The momentum is in reasonable agreement with recent model estimates for a supernova this old. The HI on the receding side of this cavity is interacting with the gas approaching us on the near side of a second cavity. The North-Celestial-Pole Loop appears to be located at the intersection of these two expanding features. The neutron star candidate in the Gaia DR3 1144019690966028928 binary may be (in part) responsible for this cavity. Explosions from other candidates may account for the observed elongation along the line of sight of this second cavity. We can use the primary star in these binaries to anchor the distances to the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and North-Celestial-Pole Loop, which are about 167 and about 220 pc, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-slow-roll~(USR) inflation predicts an exponential amplification of scalar perturbations at small scales, which leads to a stochastic gravitational wave background~(SGWB) through the coupling of the scalar and tensor modes at the second-order expansion of the Einstein equation. In this work, we search for such a scalar-induced SGWB from the NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) dataset, and find that the SGWB from USR inflation could explain the observed data. We place constraints on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum to $P_{\mathrm{Rp}} > 10^{-1.80}$ at $95\%$ confidence level (C.L.) at the scale of $k\sim 20\, \mathrm{pc}^{-1}$. We find that $\log_{10} P_{\mathrm{Rp}}$ degenerates with the peak scale $\log_{10} k_{\mathrm{p}}$. We also obtain the parameter space allowed by the data in the USR inflationary scenario, where the $e$-folding numbers of the duration of the USR phase has a lower limit $\Delta N > 2.80$ ($95\%$ C.L.) when the USR phase ends at $N\approx 20$. Since the priors for the model parameters %in the USR model are uncertain, we do not calculate the Bayes factors. Instead, to quantify the goodness of fit, we calculate the maximum values of the log-likelihood for USR inflation, bubble collision of the cosmological phase transition, and inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), respectively. Our results imply that the SGWB from USR inflation can fit the data better than the one from SMBHBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models of accretion discs and observational data indicate that the X-ray emission from the inner parts of an accretion disc can irradiate its outer regions and induce a thermal wind, which carries away the mass and angular momentum from the disc. Our aim is to investigate the influence of the thermal wind on the outburst light curves of black hole X-ray binary systems. We carry out numerical simulations of a non-stationary disc accretion with wind using upgraded open code freddi. We assume that the wind launches only from the ionised part of the disc and may turn off if the latter shrinks fast enough. Our estimates of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ are shifted downward compared to a scenario without a wind. Generally, correction of $\alpha$ depends on the spectral hardness of central X-rays and the disc outer radius, but unlikely to exceed a factor of 10 in the case of a black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH LMXB). We fit 2002 outburst of BH LMXB 4U 1543-47 taking into account the thermal wind. The mass loss in the thermal wind is of order of the accretion rate on the central object at the peak of the outburst. New estimate of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ for the accretion disc in this system is about two times lower than the previous one. Additionally, we calculate evolution of the number of hydrogen atoms towards 4U 1543-47 due to the thermal wind from the hot disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust emission is an important tool in studies of star-forming clouds, as a tracer of column density and indirectly via the dust evolution that is connected to the history and physical conditions of the clouds. We examine radiative transfer (RT) modelling of dust emission over an extended cloud region, using a filament in the Taurus molecular cloud as an example. We examine how well far-infrared observations can be used to determine both the cloud and the dust properties. Using different assumptions of the cloud shape, radiation field, and dust properties, we fit RT models to Herschel observations of the Taurus filament. Further comparisons are made with measurements of the near-infrared extinction. The models are used to examine the degeneracies between the different cloud parameters and the dust properties. The results show significant dependence on the assumed cloud structure and the spectral shape of the external radiation field. If these are constrained to the most likely values, the observations can be explained only if the dust far-infrared (FIR) opacity has increased by a factor of 2-3 relative to the values in diffuse medium. However, a narrow range of FIR wavelengths provides only weak evidence of the spatial variations in dust, even in the models covering several square degrees of a molecular cloud. The analysis of FIR dust emission is affected by several sources of uncertainty. Further constraints are therefore needed from observations at shorter wavelengths, especially regarding the trends in dust evolution.
#### Primordial Orbital Alignment of Sednoids

 - **Abstract**
 We examined the past history of the three most detached TransNeptunian Objects (TNOs) -- Sedna, 2012 VP113, and Leleakuhonua (2015 TG387) -- the three clearest members of the dynamical class known as sednoids, with high perihelia distances $q$. By integrating backward their nominal (and a set of cloned) orbits for the Solar System's age, we surprisingly find that the only time all their apsidal lines tightly cluster was 4.5 Gyr ago, at perihelion longitude $\varpi$ of 200{\deg}. This "primordial alignment" is independent of the observational biases that contribute to the current on-sky clustering in the large-semimajor axis Kuiper Belt. If future sednoid discoveries confirm these findings, this strongly argues for an initial event during the planet formation epoch which imprinted this particular apsidal orientation on the early detached TNO population and then subsequently modified only by the simple precession from the 4 giant planets. If other sednoids also cluster around the same primordial value, various models suggesting a still present planet in the outer Solar System would be incompatible with this alignment. We inspected two scenarios that could potentially explain the primordial alignment. First, a rogue planet model (where another massive planet raises perihelia near its own longitude until ejection) naturally produces this signature. Alternatively, a close stellar passage early in Solar System history raises perihelia, but it is poor at creating strong apsidal clustering. We show that all other known $35<q<55$ au TNOs are either too perturbed or orbits are still too uncertain to provide evidence for or against this paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-5344 b as a transiting giant exoplanet around an M0 dwarf star. TOI-5344 b was discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry and confirmed with ground-based photometry (the Red Buttes Observatory 0.6m telescope), radial velocity (the Habitable-zone Planet Finder), and speckle imaging (the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager). TOI-5344 b is a Saturn-like giant planet ($\rho = 0.80^{+0.17}_{-0.15}\ \text{g cm}^{-3}$) with a planetary radius of $9.7 \pm \ 0.5 \ \text{R}_{\oplus}$ ($0.87 \pm \ 0.04 \ \text{R}_{\text{Jup}}$) and a planetary mass of $135^{+17}_{-18} \text{M}_{\oplus}$ ($0.42^{+0.05}_{-0.06} \ \text{M}_{\text{Jup}}$). It has an orbital period of $3.792622 \pm 0.000010$ days and an orbital eccentricity of $0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$. We measure a high metallicity for TOI-5344 of [Fe/H] = $0.48 \pm 0.12$, where the high metallicity is consistent with expectations from formation through core accretion. We compare the metallicity of the M-dwarf hosts of giant exoplanets to that of M-dwarf hosts of non-giants ($\lesssim 8\ \text{R}_{\oplus}$). While the two populations appear to show different metallicity distributions, quantitative tests are prohibited by various sample caveats.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion onto black holes is one of the most efficient energy source in the Universe. Black hole accretion powers some of the most luminous objects in the universe, including quasars, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, and black hole X-ray transients. In the present review, we give an astrophysical overview of black hole accretion processes, with a particular focus on black hole X-ray binary systems. In Section 1, we briefly introduce the basic paradigms of black hole accretion. Physics related to accretion onto black holes are introduced in Section 2. Models proposed for black hole accretion are discussed in this section, from the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disk accretion to the advective-dominated accretion flow. Observational signatures that make contact to stellar-mass black hole accretion are introduced in Section 3, including the spectral and fast variability properties. A short conclusion is given in Section 4.

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art surveys reveal that most massive stars in the universe evolve in close binaries. Massive stars in such systems are expected to develop aspherical envelopes due to tidal interactions and/or rotational effects. Recently, it was shown that point explosions in oblate stars can produce relativistic equatorial ring-like outflows. Moreover, since stripped-envelope stars in binaries can expand enough to fill their Roche lobes anew, it is likely that these stars die with a greater degree of asphericity than the oblate spheroid geometry previously studied. We investigate the effects of this asymmetry by studying the gas dynamics of axisymmetric point explosions in stars in various stages of filling their Roche lobes. We find that point explosions in these pear-shaped stars produce trans-relativistic ejecta that coalesces into bullets pointed both toward and away from the binary companion. We present this result and comment on key morphological differences between core-collapse explosions in spherical versus distorted stars in binary systems, effects on gravitational wave sources, and observational signatures that could be used to glean these explosion geometries from current and future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback plays a crucial role in star formation and the life cycle of molecular clouds. The intense star formation region 30 Doradus, which is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), is a unique target for detailed investigation of stellar feedback owing to the proximity of the hosting galaxy and modern observational capabilities that together allow us to resolve individual molecular clouds $-$ nurseries of star formation. We study the impact of large-scale feedback on the molecular gas using the new observational data in the $^{12}$CO(3$-$2) line obtained with the APEX telescope. Our data cover an unprecedented area of 13.9 sq. deg. of the LMC disc with a spatial resolution of 5 pc and provide an unbiased view on the molecular clouds in the galaxy. Using this data, we locate molecular clouds in the disc of the galaxy, estimate their properties such as the areal number density, relative velocity and separation, width of the line profile, CO-line luminosity, size, virial mass and compare these properties between the clouds of 30 Doradus and those in the rest of the LMC disc. We find that compared with the rest of the observed molecular clouds in the LMC disc, those in 30 Doradus show the highest areal number density; they are spatially more clustered, move faster with respect to each other and feature larger linewidths. In parallel, we do not find statistically significant differences in such properties as the CO-line luminosity, size, and virial mass between the clouds of 30 Doradus and the rest of the observed field. We interpret our results as signatures of gas dispersal and fragmentation due to high-energy large-scale feedback.
