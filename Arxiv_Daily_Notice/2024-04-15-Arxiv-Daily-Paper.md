 - **Abstract**
 Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary formation in clusters through triple encounters between three unbound stars, 'three-body' binary formation, is one of the main dynamical formation processes of binary systems in dense environments. In this paper, we use an analytical probabilistic approach to study the process for the equal mass case and calculate a probability distribution for the orbital parameters of three-body-formed binaries, as well as their formation rate. For the first time, we give closed-form analytical expressions to the full orbital parameter distribution, accounting for both energy and angular momentum conservation. This calculation relies on the sensitive dependence of the outcomes of three-body scatterings on the initial conditions: here we compute the rate of three-body binaries from ergodic interactions, which allow for an analytical derivation of the distribution of orbital parameters of the binaries thus created. We find that soft binaries are highly favoured in this process and that these binaries have a super-thermal eccentricity distribution, while the few hard three-body binaries have an eccentricity distribution much closer to thermal. The analytical results predict and reproduce simulation results of three-body scattering experiments in the literature well.
#### Testing common approximations to predict the 21cm signal at the Epoch of  Reionization and Cosmic Dawn

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the 21cm signal from the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn is a complex and challenging task. Various simplifying assumptions have been applied over the last decades to make the modeling more affordable. In this paper, we investigate the validity of several such assumptions, using a simulation suite consisting of three different astrophysical source models that agree with the current constraints on the reionization history and the UV luminosity function. We first show that the common assumption of a saturated spin temperature may lead to significant errors in the 21cm clustering signal over the full reionization period. The same is true for the assumption of a neutral universe during the cosmic dawn which may lead to significant deviation from the correct signal during the heating and the Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling period. Another popular simplifying assumption consists of predicting the global differential brightness temperature ($dT_b$) based on the average quantities of the reionization fraction, gas temperature, and Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling. We show that such an approach leads to a 10 percent deeper absorption signal compared to the results obtained by averaging the final $dT_b$-map. Finally, we investigate the simplifying method of breaking the 21cm clustering signal into different auto and cross components that are then solved assuming linearity. We show that even though the individual fields have a variance well below unity, they often cannot be treated perturbatively as the perturbations are strongly non-Gaussian. As a consequence, predictions based on the perturbative solution of individual auto and cross power spectra may lead to strongly biased results, even if higher-order terms are taken into account.
#### Milky Way-est: Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Large Magellanic  Cloud and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Analogs

 - **Abstract**
 We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they: ($i$) are consistent with the MW's measured halo mass and concentration, ($ii$) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like ($\approx 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$) subhalo within the last $1.3~\mathrm{Gyr}$ on a realistic orbit, placing them near $50~\mathrm{kpc}$ from the host center at $z\approx 0$, and ($iii$) undergo a $>$1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times ($0.67<z<3$). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute $< 1\%$ of all halos in the MW's mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain $22\%$ more subhalos with present-day virial masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches $\approx 80\%$ in the inner $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with $\approx 60\%$ of the total subhalo population within $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy's dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.
#### The Origin of Young Stellar Populations in NGC 1783: Accretion of  External Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of young stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1783 has caught significant attention, with suggestions ranging from it being a genuine secondary stellar generation to a population of blue straggler stars or simply contamination from background stars. Thanks to multi-epoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster, and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of protoplanets and circumplanetary disks provides a unique opportunity to characterize planet formation through observations. Massive protoplanets shape the physical and chemical structure of their host circumstellar disk by accretion, localized emission, and disk depletion. In this work, we study the thermal changes induced within the disk by protoplanet accretion and synthetic predictions through hydrodynamical simulations with post-processed radiative transfer with an emphasis on radio millimeter emission. We explored distinct growth conditions and varied both planetary accretion rates and the local dust-to-gas mass ratios for a protoplanet at 1200 K. The radiative transfer models show that beyond the effect of disk gaps, in most cases, the CPD and the planet's emission locally increase the disk temperature. Moreover, depending on the local dust-to-gas depletion and accretion rate, the CPD presence may have detectable signatures in millimeter emission. It also has the power to generate azimuthal asymmetries important for continuum subtraction. Thus, if other means of detection of protoplanets are proven, the lack of corresponding evidence at other wavelengths can set limits on their growth timescales through a combined analysis of the local dust-to-gas ratio and the accretion rate.
#### Interpreting DESI's evidence for evolving dark energy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08056
 - **Abstract**
 The latest results on baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument), when combined with cosmic microwave background and supernova data, show indications of a deviation from a cosmological constant in favour of evolving dark energy. Use of a pivot scale for the equation of state $w$ shows that this evidence is concentrated in the derivative of $w$ rather than its mean offset from -1, indicating a new cosmic coincidence where the mean equation of state matches that of the $\Lambda$CDM model precisely in the region probed by the observations. We argue that conclusions on dark energy evolution are strongly driven by the assumed parameter priors and that this coincidence, which we are naming the PhantomX coincidence (where X stands for crossing), may be a signature of an inappropriate choice of priors.

 - **Abstract**
 A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.
#### Galactic Chemical Evolution Models Favor an Extended Type Ia Supernova  Delay-Time Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial $t^{-1}$ power law.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally-locked, fast rotating (1-3 hr), and highly-irradiated atmospheres. Here, we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the white dwarf-brown dwarf (WD-BD) binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD-BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1 to 1.7 $\mu$m phase curves show rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of 10.5$\pm$0.1%. We observe a wavelength dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model recreates the hemisphere integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the night side, whereas the featureless day side spectrum is likely dominated by H$^-$ opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly-irradiated BD EPIC2122B.

 - **Abstract**
 In the presence of anisotropic neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, the quantum kinetic equations drive coherent oscillations in neutrino helicity, frequently referred to as spin oscillations. These oscillations depend directly on the absolute mass scale and Majorana phase, but are usually too transient to produce important effects. In this paper we present a full momentum-space analysis of Majorana neutrino spin oscillations in a snapshot of a three-dimensional neutron star merger simulation. We find an interesting angular dependence that allows for that resonant and adiabatic oscillations to occur along specific directions in a large volume of the merger remnant. The solid angle spanned by these directions is extremely narrow in general. We then analyze spin transformation in the presence of flavor transformation by characterizing how the effect's resonance and timescale change during a fast flavor instability. For this analysis, we derive a generalized resonance condition that poses a restrictive requirement for resonance to exist in any flavor channel. We determine that spin oscillations at all locations in the merger snapshot have a length scale that is too large for significant oscillations to be expected even where there exist resonant and adiabatic directions.
#### A Truncated Primordial Power Spectrum and Its Impact on B-Mode  Polarization

 - **Abstract**
 The absence of large-angle correlations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), confirmed by three independent satellite missions, creates significant tension with the standard model of cosmology. Previous work has shown, however, that a truncation, $k_{min}$, of the primordial power spectrum comprehensively resolves the anomaly and the missing power at $\ell\lesssim 5$ (the low multipoles). Since this cutoff is consistent with the hypothesized delay of inflation well beyond the Planck time, we are strongly motivated to consider its possible impact on other observational signatures. In this Letter, we analyze and predict its influence on the most revealing probe awaiting measurement by upcoming missions -- the B-mode polarization of the CMB, whose accurate determination should greatly impact the inflationary picture. We highlight the quantitative power of this discriminant by specifically considering the LiteBIRD mission, predicting the effect of $k_{min}$ on both the angular power spectrum and the angular correlation function of the B-mode, for a range of tensor-to-scalar ratios, $r$. While its impact on the latter appears to be negligible, $k_{\rm min}$ should have a very pronounced effect on the former. We show that for $r=0.036$, $k_{min}$'s impact on $C_{\ell}^{BB}$ at low $\ell$'s should be easily detectable by LiteBIRD, but will be largely hidden by the total uncertainty of the measurement if $r\lesssim 0.02$.
#### Observation of Alfvén Wave Reflection in the Solar Chromosphere:  Ponderomotive Force and First Ionization Potential Effect

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in the solar chromosphere, distinguishing between upward and downward propagating waves. We find clear evidence for the reflection of waves in the chromosphere and differences in propagation between cases with waves interpreted to be resonant or nonresonant with the overlying coronal structures. This establishes the wave connection to coronal element abundance anomalies through the action of the wave ponderomotive force on the chromospheric plasma, which interacts with chromospheric ions but not neutrals, thereby providing a novel mechanism of ion-neutral separation. This is seen as a "First Ionization Potential Effect" when this plasma is lifted into the corona, with implications elsewhere on the Sun for the origin of the slow speed solar wind and its elemental composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Lasair is the UK Community Broker for transient alerts from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We explain the system's capabilities, how users can achieve their scientific goals, and how Lasair is implemented. Lasair offers users a kit of parts that they can use to build filters to concentrate their desired alerts. The kit has novel lightcurve features, sky context, watchlists of special sky objects and regions of the sky, dynamic crossmatching with catalogues of known astronomical sources, and classifications and annotations from other users and partner projects. These resources can be shared with other users, copied, and modified. Lasair offers real-time machine-to-machine notifications of filtered transient alerts. Even though the Rubin Observatory is not yet complete, Lasair is a mature system: it has been processing and serving data from the similarly formatted stream of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alerts.
#### Non-Gaussianity from primordial black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08318
 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects of non-Gaussianity from primordial black holes (PBHs). The formation of PBHs is in general a rare event and the number of PBHs fluctuates following the Poisson distribution function, which is independent from the pre-existing inflationary adiabatic fluctuations. Such fluctuations can dominate over the adiabatic mode on small scales. We focus on the non-Gaussianity of matter density fluctuations induced by the Poisson fluctuation of PBHs and discuss the potentially observable consequences such as the skewness, kurtosis and the scale-dependent bias.
#### Estimate of force noise from electrostatic patch potentials in LISA  Pathfinder

 - **Abstract**
 This paper discusses force noise in LISA and LISA Pathfinder arising from the interaction of patch potentials on the test mass and surrounding electrode housing surfaces with their own temporal fluctuations. We aim to estimate the contribution of this phenomenon to the force noise detected in LISA Pathfinder in excess of the background from Brownian motion. We introduce a model of that approximates the interacting test mass and housing surfaces as concentric spheres, treating patch potentials as isotropic stochastic Gaussian processes on the surface of these spheres. We find that a scenario of patches due to surface contamination, with diffusion driven density fluctuations, could indeed produce force noise with the observed frequency $f^{-2}$ dependence. However there is not enough experimental evidence, neither from LISA Pathfinder itself, nor from other experiments, to predict the amplitude of such a noise, which could range from completely negligible to explaining the entire noise excess. We briefly discuss several measures to ensure that this noise is sufficiently small in LISA .
#### Evidence of the gamma-ray counterpart from nova FM Cir with F ermi-LAT

 - **Abstract**
 We report the analysis results of X-ray and gamma-ray data of the nova FM Cir taken by Swift and Fermi-LAT. The gamma-ray emission from FM Cir can be identified with a significance level of 3sigma within 40 days after the nova eruption (2018 January 19) while we bin the light curve per day. The significance can further exceed 4 sigma confidence level if we accumulate longer time (i.e., 20 days) to bin the light curve. The gamma-ray counterpart could be identified with a Test Statistic (TS) above 4 until 180 days after the eruption. The duration of the gamma-ray detection was longer than those reported in the previous studies of the other novae detected in the GeV range. The significant X-ray emission was observed after the gamma-ray flux level fell below the sensitivity of Fermi-LAT. The hardness ratio of the X-ray emission decreased rapidly with time, and the spectra were dominated by blackbody radiation from the hot white dwarf. Except for the longer duration of the gamma-ray emission, the multi-wavelength properties of FM Cir closely resemble those of other novae detected in the GeV range.

 - **Abstract**
 We review the theory behind the formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates. We consider the binary formation in the early and late Universe, emphasising the former as it gives the dominant contribution of the present primordial black hole merger rate. The binaries formed in the early Universe are highly eccentric and get easily disrupted by interactions with other primordial black holes. We discuss in detail how the suppression of the merger rate arising from such interactions can be estimated and how such interactions lead to the formation of another, much harder, binary population that contributes to the present merger rate if more than 10% of dark matter consists of primordial black holes with a narrow mass distribution.
#### MINCE II. Neutron capture elements

 - **Abstract**
 The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to gather the abundances of neutron-capture elements but also of light elements and iron peak elements in a large sample of giant stars in this metallicity range. T The aim of this work is to study the chemical evolution of galactic sub-components recently identified (i.e. Gaia Sausage Enceladus (GSE), Sequoia). We used high signal-to-noise ratios, high-resolution spectra and standard 1D LTE spectrum synthesis to determine the detailed abundances. We could determine the abundances for up to 10 neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu) in 33 stars. The general trends of abundance ratios [n-capture element/Fe] versus [Fe/H] are in agreement with the results found in the literature. When our sample is divided in sub-groups depending on their kinematics, we found that the run of [Sr/Ba] vs [Ba/H] for the stars belonging to the GSE accretion event shows a tight anti-correlation. The results for the Sequoia stars, although based on a very limited sample, shows a [Sr/Ba] systematically higher than the [Sr/Ba] found in the GSE stars at a given [Ba/H] hinting at a different nucleosynthetic history. Stochastic chemical evolution models have been computed to understand the evolution of the GSE chemical composition of Sr and Ba. The first conclusions are that the GSE chemical evolution is similar to the evolution of a dwarf galaxy with galactic winds and inefficient star formation. Detailed abundances of neutron-capture elements have been measured in high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of intermediate metal-poor stars, the metallicity range covered by the MINCE project. These abundances have been compared to detailed stochastic models of galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In order to understand the formation of the first stars, which set the transition between the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs, it is necessary to provide a detailed description of the physics at work within the first clouds of gas which, during their gravitational collapse, will set the conditions for stars to be form through the mechanism of thermal instability. Aims. Our objective is to study in detail the molecular cooling of gas in the halos preceding the formation of the first stars. We are furthermore assessing the sensitivity of the 21cm hydrogen line to this cooling channel. Results. We present the CHEMFAST code, that we developed to compute the cosmological 21cm neutral hydrogen line inside collapsing matter overdensity. We precisely track evolution in the abundances of ions, atoms and molecules through a network of chemical reactions. Computing the molecular thermal function due to the excitation of the rotational levels of the H2 molecule, we find it strongly affects the gas temperature inside collapsing clouds of $10^8$ M$_\odot$. The gas temperature falls at the end of the collapse, when the molecular cooling takes over the heating due to gravitation. Conclusions. We find that the 21cm brightness temperature inside the collapsing cloud presents an emission feature, different from the one predicted in expansion scenario. It moreover follows the same behavior as the gas temperature, as it is also strongly affected by the molecular cooling. This makes it a promising probe in order to map the collapsing halos and thermal processes at work inside them.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The determination of meteor shower or parent body associations is inherently a statistical problem. Traditional methods, primarily the similarity discriminants, have limitations, particularly in handling the increasing volume and complexity of meteoroid orbit data. Aims. We aim to introduce a new, more statistically robust and generalizable method for estimating false positive detections in meteor shower identification, leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Methods. Utilizing a dataset of 824 fireballs observed by the European Fireball Network, we apply a multivariate Gaussian kernel within KDE and z-score data normalization. Our method analyzes the parameter space of meteoroid orbits and geocentric impact characteristics, focusing on four different similarity discriminants: DSH, D', DH, and DN. Results. The KDE methodology consistently converges towards a true established shower-associated fireball rate within the EFN dataset of 18-25% for all criteria. This indicates that the approach provides a more statistically robust estimate of the shower-associated component. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the potential of KDE, combined with appropriate data normalization, in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of meteor shower analysis. This method addresses the existing challenges posed by traditional similarity discriminants and offers a versatile solution adaptable to varying datasets and parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension has proven to be stubbornly persistent, despite widespread efforts to relax it. As a possible resolution of this problem we propose a radical alternative to the way in which cosmological models are viewed. Specifically, we consider building cosmological models from spaces that exhibit intrinsic symmetries, rather than as space-times with explicit symmetry. This change in perspective allows statistical homogeneity and isotropy to be maintained, while relaxing some strong mathematical constraints that the standard approach imposes. We show that a Hubble tension arises naturally in our new approach, and that (as a corollary) a prediction can be made for the radial component of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Our prediction appears to be consistent with the DESI first-year data release, which has otherwise been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars reside in binary systems, which are expected to experience mass transfer during their evolution. However, so far the conditions under which mass transfer leads to a common envelope, and thus possibly to a merging of both stars, are not well understood. Main uncertainties arise from the possible swelling of the mass gainer, and from angular momentum loss from the binary system, during non-conservative mass transfer. We have computed a dense grid of detailed models of stars accreting mass at constant rates, to determine their radius increase due to their thermal disequilibrium. While we find that models with faster than thermal timescale accretion generally expand, this expansion remains quite limited in the intermediate mass regime even for accretion rates which exceed the thermal timescale accretion rate by a factor of 100. Our models of massive accretion stars expand to extreme radii under those conditions. When the accretion rate exceed the Eddington accretion rate, our models expand dynamically. We have derived analytical fits to the radius evolution of our models and a prescription for the borderline between stable mass transfer and mergers for arbitrary accretion efficiencies. We then apply our results to grids of binary models adopting various constant mass transfer efficiencies and angular momentum budgets. We find that the former parameter has the stronger effect on the outcome of the Roche lobe overflow. Our results are consistent with detailed binary evolution models, and often lead to a smaller initial parameter space for stable mass transfer than other recipes in the literature. We use this method to investigate the origin of the Wolf-Rayet stars with O star companions in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and find that the efficiency of the mass transfer process which lead to the formation of the Wolf-Rayet star was likely below 50%.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the transient Jupiter co-orbital comet P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS) drew significant interest. Not only will LD2 transition between being a Centaur and a Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) in 2063, the first time this process can be observed as it happens, it is also very active for its large heliocentric distance. We present observations and orbital integrations of the newly discovered transient Jupiter co-orbital comet P/2023 V6 (PANSTARRS), the second such object known. Despite similar modern orbits, V6 is significantly (15 times) less active than LD2 and most JFCs as determined via Afrho measurements at the same heliocentric distance. We find V6 is co-orbital between 2020 and 2044, twice the duration of LD2, but it will not become a JFC soon. We interpret these differences in activity as evolutionary, with V6 having lost a significant fraction of its near-surface ice compared to LD2 by previously being warmer. While V6's pre-encounter orbit was somewhat warmer than LD2's, future thermal modeling will be needed to understand if this can explain their differences or if a more significant difference further into the past is required. This is more evidence that LD2 is a pristine and ice-rich object, and thus it may display very strong activity when it becomes a JFC. We sue the differences between V6 and LD2 to discuss the interpretation of cometary activity at large heliocentric distances as well as the small end of the crater record of the Galilean Satellites. Continuing observations of both objects are highly encouraged.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution radio observations of nearby active galactic nuclei have revealed extended, limb-brightened structures in their inner jets. This ties in with other multi-wavelength observations from radio to X-ray and gamma-ray, indicating that a structured jet model is required. While electrons need to be kept energized to account for the observed features, the underlying particle acceleration mechanism is still unclear. We explore the role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration, i.e., classical second-order Fermi and shear acceleration, for understanding the multi-wavelength observations of the inner jets of M87. An analytical Fokker-Planck description is adopted to infer characteristic spectral indices and cutoff energies for these two mechanisms. We focus on electron synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission process. We find that the multi-wavelength observations of M87 can be satisfactorily accounted for in a framework, where the X-rays are produced at a larger distance from the core than the radio emission region. This provides further support to multi-zone, broadband emission modelling. We use our findings to also comment on the acceleration of cosmic rays entrained in the sheath.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 > -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.
