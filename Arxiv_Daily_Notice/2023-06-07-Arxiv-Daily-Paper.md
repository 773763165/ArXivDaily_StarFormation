 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission of globular clusters (GCs) is attributed to their large fraction of compact binary systems, especially those with millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We analyze a population of 124 Galactic GCs to investigate how their dynamical properties affect the formation and evolution of compact binary systems and how this can be translated into the clusters' observed X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission. We use mainly Chandra X-ray Observatory and Fermi Large Area Telescope observations to achieve our goals and start by detecting 39 GCs in $\gamma$ rays, seven of which are not listed in previous Fermi-LAT catalogs. Additionally, we find that the total number of X-ray sources within a GC and its $\gamma$-ray luminosity are linearly correlated with the stellar encounter rate, indicating that compact binary systems are mainly formed via close stellar encounters. We also find an unexpected rise in the number of X-ray sources for GCs with low rates of stellar encounters, suggesting that there is a dynamical threshold where the formation of X-ray sources is dominated by stellar encounters. Furthermore, we use the Heggie-Hills law to find that subsequent stellar encounters in these compact binaries will, on average, make the binaries even harder, with basically no possibility of binary ionization. Finally, we find that all GCs are point-like sources in $\gamma$ rays, indicating that the MSPs are concentrated in the clusters' cores, likely due to dynamical friction.

 - **Abstract**
 The observational signature of core crystallization of white dwarfs has recently been discovered. However, the magnitude of the crystallization-powered cooling delay required to match observed white dwarfs is larger than predicted by conventional models, requiring additional mechanisms of energy release in white dwarf interiors. The most ideal benchmarks for understanding this discrepancy would be bright and nearby crystallizing white dwarfs with total ages that can be externally constrained. In this work we report that a recently discovered white dwarf is a bound companion to the triple star HD 190412, forming a new Sirius-like system in the solar neighbourhood. The location of HD 190412 C on the $T_{\text{eff}}-\text{mass}$ diagram implies it is undergoing crystallization, making this the first confirmed crystallizing white dwarf whose total age can be externally constrained. Motivated by the possibility that a cooling delay caused by crystallization can be directly detected for this white dwarf we employ a variety of methods to constrain the age of the system; however, our empirical age anomaly of $+3.1\pm1.9$ Gyr is ultimately too imprecise to reach statistical significance, preventing us from making strong constraints to models of white dwarf crystallization. Our results are nonetheless compatible with the recent hypothesis that $^{22}$Ne phase separation is responsible for the excess cooling delay of crystallizing white dwarfs. The discovery of this system at only 32 parsecs suggests that similar benchmark systems are likely to be common; future discoveries may therefore provide powerful tests for models of white dwarf crystallization.
#### Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-Rich Red  Giants

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analysing 1155 Li-rich giants (A(Li) $\geq$ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelg\"anger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial supernova abundances. Comparing Li-rich and doppelg\"anger spectra reveals systematic differences in the H-$\alpha$ and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with $v_\textrm{broad} \gtrsim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to doppelg\"angers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelg\"angers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean $s-$process abundances ($\geq 0.05$ dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelg\"angers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios $\gtrsim$ 0.5 at $\gtrsim$ 7 AU. We also discover that highly Ba-enriched stars are missing from the Li-rich population, possibly due to low-mass AGB companions which preclude Li-enrichment. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.
#### First Detection of A Linear Structure in the Midplane of the Young HH  211 Protostellar Disk: A Spiral Arm?

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral structures have been detected in evolved protostellar disks, driving the disk accretion towards the central protostars to facilitate star formation. However, it is still unclear if these structures can form earlier in young protostellar disks. With the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we have detected and spatially resolved a very young and nearly edge-on dusty disk with a radius of only ~ 20 au in the HH 211 protostellar system at submillimeter wavelength. It is geometrically thick, indicating that the submillimeter light-emitting dust grains have yet to settle to the midplane for planet formation. Intriguingly, it shows 3 bright linear structures parallel to the equatorial plane, resembling a 3-layer pancake that has not been seen before. The top and bottom ones arise from the warm disk surfaces, unveiling the flared structure of the disk. More importantly, the middle one is in the dense midplane of the disk and can be modeled as a trailing spiral arm excited by disk gravity, as seen in evolved protostellar disks, supporting the presence of spiral structures in the very early phase for disk accretion.
#### Simulations of idealised 3D atmospheric flows on terrestrial planets  using LFRic-Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that LFRic-Atmosphere, a model built using the Met Office's GungHo dynamical core, is able to reproduce idealised large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns specified by several widely-used benchmark recipes. This is motivated by the rapid rate of exoplanet discovery and the ever-growing need for numerical modelling and characterisation of their atmospheres. Here we present LFRic-Atmosphere's results for the idealised tests imitating circulation regimes commonly used in the exoplanet modelling community. The benchmarks include three analytic forcing cases: the standard Held-Suarez test, the Menou-Rauscher Earth-like test, and the Merlis-Schneider Tidally Locked Earth test. Qualitatively, LFRic-Atmosphere agrees well with other numerical models and shows excellent conservation properties in terms of total mass, angular momentum and kinetic energy. We then use LFRic-Atmosphere with a more realistic representation of physical processes (radiation, subgrid-scale mixing, convection, clouds) by configuring it for the four TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) scenarios. This is the first application of LFRic-Atmosphere to a possible climate of a confirmed terrestrial exoplanet. LFRic-Atmosphere reproduces the THAI scenarios within the spread of the existing models across a range of key climatic variables. Our work shows that LFRic-Atmosphere performs well in the seven benchmark tests for terrestrial atmospheres, justifying its use in future exoplanet climate studies.
#### Wobbling jets in common envelope evolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03618
 - **Abstract**
 We find that the convective motion in the envelopes of red supergiant (RSG) stars supplies a non-negligible stochastic angular momentum to the mass that a secondary star accretes in a common envelope evolution (CEE), such that jets that the secondary star launches wobble. The orbital motion of the secondary star in a CEE and the density gradient in the envelope impose a non-zero angular momentum to the accreted mass with a constant direction parallel to the orbital angular momentum. From one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations with the numerical code \textsc{mesa} we find that the stochastic convection motion in the envelope of RSG stars adds a stochastic angular momentum component with an amplitude that is about 0.1-1 times that of the constant component due to the orbital motion. We mimic a CEE of the RSG star by removing envelope mass at a high rate and by depositing energy into its envelope. The stochastic angular momentum implies that the accretion disk around the secondary star (which we do not simulate), and therefore the jets that it launches, wobble with angles of up to tens of degrees with respect to the orbital angular momentum axis. This wobbling makes it harder for jets to break out from the envelope and can shape small bubbles in the ejecta that compress filaments that appear as arcs in the ejected nebula, i.e., in planetary nebulae when the giant is an asymptotic giant branch star.
#### Young Stellar Object Candidates in IC 417
 - **Authors:** L. M. Rebull, R. L. Anderson III, G. Hall, J. D. Kirkpatrick, X. Koenig, C. E. Odden, B. Rodriguez, R. Sanchez, B. Senson, V. Urbanowski, M. Austin, K. Blood, E. Kerman, J. Long, N. Roosa

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03728
 - **Abstract**
 IC 417 is in the Galactic Plane, and likely part of the Aur OB2 association; it is ~2 kpc away. Stock 8 is one of the densest cluster constituents; off of it to the East, there is a 'Nebulous Stream' (NS) that is dramatic in the infrared (IR). We have assembled a list of literature-identified young stellar objects (YSOs), new candidate YSOs from the NS, and new candidate YSOs from IR excesses. We vetted this list via inspection of the images, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and color-color/color-magnitude diagrams. We placed the 710 surviving YSOs and candidate YSOs in ranked bins, nearly two-thirds of which have more than 20 points defining their SEDs. The lowest-ranked bins include stars that are confused, or likely carbon stars. There are 503 in the higher-ranked bins; half are SED Class III, and $\sim$40\% are SED Class II. Our results agree with the literature in that we find that the NS and Stock 8 are at about the same distance as each other (and as the rest of the YSOs), and that the NS is the youngest region, with Stock 8 a little older. We do not find any evidence for an age spread within the NS, consistent with the idea that the star formation trigger came from the north. We do not find that the other literature-identified clusters here are as young as either the NS or Stock 8; at best they are older than Stock 8, and they may not all be legitimate clusters.
#### A Chondritic Solar Neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 A persistent question in exoplanet demographics is whether exoplanetary systems form from similar compositional building blocks to our own. Polluted white dwarf stars offer a unique way to address this question as they provide measurements of the bulk compositions of exoplanetary material. We present a statistical analysis of the rocks polluting oxygen-bearing white dwarfs and compare their compositions to rocks in the Solar System. We find that the majority of the extrasolar rocks are consistent with the composition of typical chondrites. Measurement uncertainties prevent distinguishing between chondrites and bulk Earth, but do permit detecting the differences between chondritic compositions and basaltic or continental crust. We find no evidence of crust amongst the polluted white dwarfs. We show that the chondritic nature of extrasolar rocks is also supported by the compositions of local stars. While galactic chemical evolution results in variations in the relative abundances of rock-forming elements spatially and temporally on galaxy-wide scales, the current sample of polluted white dwarfs are sufficiently young and close to Earth that they are not affected by this process. We conclude that exotic compositions are not required to explain the majority of observed rock types around polluted white dwarfs, and that variations between exoplanetary compositions in the stellar neighborhood are generally not due to significant differences in the initial composition of protoplanetary disks. Nonetheless, there is evidence from stellar observations that planets formed in the first several billion years in the Galaxy have lower metal core fractions compared with Earth on average.
#### High energy cosmic rays and gamma rays from star clusters: the case of  Cygnus OB2

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03762
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03762
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the acceleration of cosmic rays at the termination shock that results from the interaction of the collective wind of star clusters with the surrounding interstellar medium. The solution of the transport equation of accelerated particles in the wind-excavated cavity, including energy losses due to CR interactions with neutral gas in the bubble, shows several interesting properties that are discussed in detail. The issue of the maximum energy of the accelerated particles is discussed with special care, because of its implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. Gamma ray emission is produced in the cavity due to inelastic pp scattering, while accelerated particles are advected downstream of the termination shock and diffuse at the same time. Both the spectrum and the morphology of such emission are discussed, with a comparison of our results with the observations of gamma ray emission from the Cygnus OB2 region.
#### Reinterpreting the Polluted White Dwarf SDSS J122859.93+104032.9 in  Light of Thermohaline Mixing Models: More Polluting Material from a Larger  Orbiting Solid Body

 - **Abstract**
 The polluted white dwarf (WD) system SDSS J122859.93+104032.9 (SDSS J1228) shows variable emission features interpreted as originating from a solid core fragment held together against tidal forces by its own internal strength, orbiting within its surrounding debris disk. Estimating the size of this orbiting solid body requires modeling the accretion rate of the polluting material that is observed mixing into the WD surface. That material is supplied via sublimation from the surface of the orbiting solid body. The sublimation rate can be estimated as a simple function of the surface area of the solid body and the incident flux from the nearby hot WD. On the other hand, estimating the accretion rate requires detailed modeling of the surface structure and mixing in the accreting WD. In this work, we present MESA WD models for SDSS J1228 that account for thermohaline instability and mixing in addition to heavy element sedimentation to accurately constrain the sublimation and accretion rate necessary to supply the observed pollution. We derive a total accretion rate of $\dot M_{\rm acc}=1.8\times 10^{11}\,\rm g\,s^{-1}$, several orders of magnitude higher than the $\dot M_{\rm acc}=5.6\times 10^{8}\,\rm g\,s^{-1}$ estimate obtained in earlier efforts. The larger mass accretion rate implies that the minimum estimated radius of the orbiting solid body is r$_{\rm{min}}$ = 72 km, which, although significantly larger than prior estimates, still lies within upper bounds (a few hundred km) for which the internal strength could no longer withstand tidal forces from the gravity of the WD.
