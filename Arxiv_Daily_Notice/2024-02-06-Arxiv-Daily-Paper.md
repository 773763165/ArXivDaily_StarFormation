 - **Abstract**
 We present evidence of variable 1.3 millimeter emission from the 1-3 Myr, SpT G2-G5 class III YSO, HD~283572. HD~283572 was observed on 8 dates with the Submillimeter Array between 2021 December and 2023 May, a total on-source time of 10.2 hours, probing a range of timescales down to 5.2 seconds. Averaging all data obtained on 2022 Jan 17 shows a 4.4 mJy ($8.8\sigma$) point source detection with a negative spectral index ($\alpha{=}{-2.7}{\pm}1.2$), with peak emission rising to 13.8 mJy in one 3 minute span, and 25 mJy in one 29.7 second integration ($L_\nu=4.7\times10^{17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$). Combining our data for the other 7 dates shows no detection, with an rms noise of 0.24 mJy beam$^{-1}$. The stochastic millimeter enhancements on time frames of seconds--minutes--hours with negative spectral indices are most plausibly explained by synchrotron or gyro-synchrotron radiation from stellar activity. HD 283572's 1.3 mm light-curve has similarities with variable binaries, suggesting HD 283572's activity may have been triggered by interactions with an as-yet undetected companion. We additionally identify variability of HD 283572 at 10 cm, from VLASS data. This study highlights the challenges of interpreting faint mm emission from evolved YSOs that may host tenuous disks, and suggests that a more detailed temporal analysis of spatially unresolved data is generally warranted. The variability of class III stars may open up new ground for understanding the physics of flares in the context of terrestrial planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Obscuration in high-redshift quasi-stellar objects (QSO) has a profound impact on our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes across the cosmic time. An accurate quantification of its relevance is therefore mandatory. We present a study aimed at evaluating the importance of obscuration in high redshift jetted QSO, i.e. those active nuclei characterized by the presence of powerful relativistic jets. We compare the observed number of radio detected QSO at different radio flux density limits with the value predicted by the beaming model on the basis of the number of oriented sources (blazars). Any significant deficit of radio-detected QSO compared to the predictions can be caused by the presence of obscuration along large angles from the jet direction. We apply this method to two sizable samples characterized by the same optical limit (mag=21) but significantly different radio density limits (30 mJy and 1 mJy respectively) and containing a total of 87 independent radio-loud 4<z<6.8 QSO, 31 of which classified as blazars. We find a general good agreement between the numbers predicted by the model and those actually observed, with only a marginal discrepancy at 0.5 mJy that could be caused by the lack of completeness of the sample. We conclude that we have no evidence of obscuration within angles 10-20deg from the relativistic jet direction. We also show how the ongoing deep wide-angle radio surveys will be instrumental to test the presence of obscuration at much larger angles, up to 30-35deg. We finally suggest that, depending on the actual fraction of obscured QSO, relativistic jets could be much more common at high redshifts compared to what is usually observed in the local Universe
#### Exploring the predictability of the solar cycle from the polar field  rise rate: Results from observations and simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The inherent stochastic and nonlinear nature of the solar dynamo makes the strength of the solar cycles vary in a wide range, making it difficult to predict the strength of an upcoming solar cycle. Recently, our work has shown that by using the observed correlation of the polar field rise rate with the peak of polar field at cycle minimum and amplitude of following cycle, an early prediction can be made. In a follow-up study, we perform SFT simulations to explore the robustness of this correlation against variation of meridional flow speed, and against stochastic fluctuations of BMR tilt properties that give rise to anti-Joy and anti-Hale type anomalous BMRs. The results suggest that the observed correlation is a robust feature of the solar cycle and can be utilized for a reliable prediction of peak strength of a cycle at least 2 to 3 years earlier than the minimum.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe photometry improvements in the La Silla--Quest RR Lyrae star (RRLS) survey that enable it to reach distances from the Sun ($d_{\odot}$) $\sim 140$ kpc. We report the results of surveying $\sim 300~ {\rm deg}^2$ of sky around the large, low-surface-brightness Crater II dwarf spheroidal galaxy. At $d_{\odot}$ $> 80$ kpc, we find a large overdensity of RRLS that extends beyond the traditional isophotal contours used for Crater II. The majority of these RRLS (34) have a linear distribution on the sky, extending over $15^{\circ}$, that runs through Crater II and is oriented along Crater II's proper motion vector. We hypothesize that this unlikely distribution traces extended tidal streams associated with Crater II. To test this, we search for other Crater II stellar populations that should be in the streams. Using Gaia proper motion data, we isolate $\approx$ 17 candidate stars outside of Crater II that are consistent with being luminous stars from the Crater II Red Giant Branch (RGB). Their spatial distribution is consistent with the RRLS one. The inferred streams are long, spanning a distance range $\sim 80 - 135$ kpc from the Galactic Centre. They are oriented at a relatively small angle relative to our line-of-sight ($\sim 25^{\circ}$), which means some stream stars are likely projected onto the main body of the galaxy. Comparing the numbers of RRLS and RGB candidate stars found in the streams to those in the main galaxy, we estimate Crater II has lost $\gtrsim 30\%$ of its stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Substructures in disc density are ubiquitous in the bright extended discs that are observed with high resolution. These substructures are intimately linked to the physical mechanisms driving planet formation and disc evolution. Surveys of star-forming regions find that most discs are in fact compact, less luminous, and do not exhibit these same substructures. It remains unclear whether compact discs also have similar substructures or if they are featureless. This suggests that different planet formation and disc evolution mechanisms operate in these discs. We investigated evidence of substructure within two compact discs around the stars Sz 65 and Sz 66 using high angular resolution observations with ALMA at 1.3 mm. The two stars form a wide-binary system with 6.36 arcsec separation. The continuum observations achieve a synthesised beam major axis of 0.026 arcsec, equivalent to about 4.0 au, enabling a search for substructure on these spatial scales and a characterisation of the gas and dust disc sizes with high precision. We analysed the data in the image plane through an analysis of reconstructed images, as well as in the uv plane by modelling the visibilities and by an analysis of the 12CO emission line. Comparisons were made with high-resolution observations of compact discs and radially extended discs. We find evidence of substructure in the dust distribution of Sz 65, namely a shallow gap centred at approximately 20 au, with an emission ring exterior to it. Ninety percent of the measured continuum flux is found within 27 au, and the distance for 12CO is 161 au. The observations show that Sz 66 is very compact: 90 per cent of the continuum flux is contained within 16 au, and 64 au for the gas. While the overall prevalence and diversity of substructure in compact discs relative to larger discs is yet to be determined, we find evidence that substructures can exist in compact discs.

 - **Abstract**
 The disparate nature of thermal-nonthermal energy partition during flares, particularly during weak flares, is still an open issue. Following the Neupert effect, quantifying the relative yield of X-ray emission in different energy bands can enable inferring the underlying energy release mechanism. During September 20-25, 2021, the Solar Orbiter mission - being closer to the Sun ($\sim$0.6 AU) and having a moderate separation angle (<40$^{\circ}$) from the Sun-Earth line provided a unique opportunity to analyze multi-wavelength emission from $\sim$200 (mostly weak) flares, commonly observed by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX), STEREO-A, GOES, and SDO observatories. Associating the quotient (q$_{f}$) of hard X-ray fluence (12-20 keV) and soft X-ray flux (4-10 keV) with the peak SXR flux enabled us to identify strongly non-thermal flares. Multi-wavelength investigation of spectral and imaging mode observations of the 20 strongly non-thermal weak flares reveals an inverse relationship of q$_{f}$ with the emission measure (EM) (and density), and a positive relationship with the flare plasma temperature. This indicates that plasma in tenuous loops attains higher temperatures compared to that in the denser loops, in response to nonthermal energy deposition. This is in agreement with the plasma parameters of the coronal loops, as derived by applying the one-dimensional Palermo Harvard (PH) hydrodynamical code to the coronal loop plasma having different initial coronal loop base pressures when subjected to similar heating input. Our investigation, therefore, indicates that the plasma parameters of the flaring loop in the initial phase have a decisive role in thermal-nonthermal energy partitioning.

 - **Abstract**
 We present resolved images of IRAS 23077+6707 in $1.3\,\mathrm{mm}$/$225\,\mathrm{GHz}$ thermal dust and CO gas emission with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and $grizy$ optical scattered light with the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). The Pan-STARRS data show a bipolar distribution of optically scattering dust that is characteristic for disks observed at high inclinations. Its radial extent in scattered light emission spans $\sim12''$, with two highly asymmetric filaments extending along the upper bounds of each nebula by $\sim9''$. The SMA data measure $1.3\,\mathrm{mm}$ continuum dust as well as $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J$=2$-$1 line emission over $11''$-$16''$ extents, with the gas presenting the typical morphology of a disk in Keplerian rotation, in both position-velocity space and in each CO line spectra. IRAS 23077+6707 has no reported distance estimate, but if it is located in the Cepheus star-forming region ($180$-$800\,\mathrm{pc}$), it would have a radius spanning thousands of au. Taken together, we infer IRAS 23077+6707 to be a giant and gas-rich edge-on protoplanetary disk, which to our knowledge is the largest in extent so far discovered.

 - **Abstract**
 The equation of state dependence of neutron star's astrophysical features modeling is key to our understanding of dense matter. However, there exists a series of almost equation-of-state independent relations reported in the literature, called quasi-universal relations, that are used to determine neutron star radii and moments of inertia from X-ray and gravitational wave signals. Using sets of equations of state constrained by multi-messenger astronomy measurements and nuclear-physics theory, we discuss quasi-universal relations in the context of future gravitational-wave detectors Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and X-ray detector STROBE-X. We focus on relations that involve the moment of inertia $I$, the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ and the compactness $C$: $C(\Lambda)$, $I(\Lambda)$ and $I(C)$. The quasi-universal fits and their associated errors are constructed with three different microphysics approaches which include state of the art nuclear physics theory and astrophysical constraints. Gravitational-wave and X-ray signals are simulated with the sensitivity of the next generation of detectors. Equation of state inference on those simulated signals is performed to assess if quasi-universal relations will offer a better precision on the extraction of neutron star's macroscopic parameters than equation of state dependent relations. We show that detections with the 3rd generation of gravitational wave detectors and the X-ray detector STROBE-X will be sensitive to the fit error marginalization technique. We also find that the sensitivity of those detectors will be sufficient that using full equation of state distributions will offer better precision on extracted parameters than quasi-universal relations.We also note that nuclear physics theory offers a more pronounced equation of state invariance of quasi-universal relations than current astrophysical constraints.
#### Subsurface Thermophysical Properties of Europa's Leading and Trailing  Hemispheres as Revealed by ALM

 - **Abstract**
 We present best-fit values of porosity -- and the corresponding effective thermal inertiae -- determined from three different depths in Europa's near-subsurface (~1-20 cm). The porosity of the upper ~20 cm of Europa's subsurface varies between 75-50% ($\Gamma_{eff}\approx50-140$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) on the leading hemisphere and 50-40% ($\Gamma_{eff}\approx140-180$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) on the trailing hemisphere. Residual maps produced by comparison with these models reveal thermally anomalous features that cannot be reproduced by globally homogeneous porosity models. These regions are compared to Europa's surface terrain and known compositional variations. We find that some instances of warm thermal anomalies are co-located with known geographical or compositional features on both the leading and trailing hemisphere; cool temperature anomalies are well correlated with surfaces previously observed to contain pure, crystalline water ice and the expansive rays of Pwyll crater. Anomalous regions correspond to locations with subsurface properties different from those of our best-fit models, such as potentially elevated thermal inertia, decreased emissivity, or more porous regolith. We also find that ALMA observations at ~3 mm sound below the thermal skin depth of Europa (~10-15 cm) for a range of porosity values, and thus do not exhibit features indicative of diurnal variability or residuals similar to other frequency bands. Future observations of Europa at higher angular resolution may reveal additional locations of variable subsurface thermophysical properties, while those at other wavelengths will inform our understanding of the regolith compaction length and the effects of external processes on the shallow subsurface.
#### NEOWISE Observations of Distant Active Long-period Comets C/2014 B1  (Schwartz), C/2017 K2 (Pan-STARRS), and C/2010 U3 (Boattini)

 - **Abstract**
 Hyperactive comet activity typically becomes evident beyond the frost line (3 to 4 au) where it becomes too cold for water-ice to sublimate. If carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the species that drive activity at sufficiently large distances, then detailed studies on the production rates of these species are extremely valuable to examine the formation of the solar system because these two species (beyond water) are next culpable for driving cometary activity. The NEOWISE reactivated mission operates at two imaging bandpasses, W1 and W2 at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, respectively, with the W2 channel being fully capable of detecting CO and CO2 at 4.67 and 4.23 microns in the same bandpass. It is extremely difficult to study CO2 from the ground due to contamination in Earth's atmosphere. We present our W1 and W2 photometry, dust measurements, and findings for comets C/2014 B1 (Schwartz), C/2017 K2 (Pan-STARRS), and C/2010 U3 (Boattini), hereafter, B1, K2, and U3, respectively. Our results assess CO and CO2 gas production rates observed by NEOWISE. We have determined: (1) comets B1 and K2 have CO2 and CO gas production rates of 1e27 and 1e29 molecules per second, respectively, if one assumes the excess emission is attributed to either all CO or all CO2; (2) B1 and K2 are considered hyperactive in that their measured AfRho dust production values are on the order of greater than or equal to 1e3 cm; and (3) the CO and CO2 production rates do not always follow the expected convention of increasing with decreased heliocentric distance, while B1 and K2 exhibit noticeable dust activity on their inbound leg orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 As next-generation imaging instruments and interferometers search for planets closer to their stars, they must contend with increasing orbital motion and longer integration times. These compounding effects make it difficult to detect faint planets but also present an opportunity. Increased orbital motion makes it possible to move the search for planets into the orbital domain, where direct images can be freely combined with the radial velocity and proper motion anomaly, even without a confirmed detection in any single epoch. In this paper, we present a fast and differentiable multimethod orbit-modeling and planet detection code called Octofitter. This code is designed to be highly modular and allows users to easily adjust priors, change parameterizations, and specify arbitrary function relations between the parameters of one or more planets. Octofitter further supplies tools for examining model outputs including prior and posterior predictive checks and simulation-based calibration. We demonstrate the capabilities of Octofitter on real and simulated data from different instruments and methods, including HD 91312, simulated JWST/NIRISS aperture masking interferometry observations, radial velocity curves, and grids of images from the Gemini Planet Imager. We show that Octofitter can reliably recover faint planets in long sequences of images with arbitrary orbital motion. This publicly available tool will enable the broad application of multiepoch and multimethod exoplanet detection, which could improve how future targeted ground- and space-based surveys are performed. Finally, its rapid convergence makes it a useful addition to the existing ecosystem of tools for modeling the orbits of directly imaged planets.
#### Searching for cosmological variation of the proton-to-electron mass  ratio using a single $H_2$ system

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring physics beyond General Relativity and the Standard Model of Particle Physics involves investigating spacetime variations in natural constants. This study employs an $H_2$-single of QSO 0347-383 observational spectrum to propose a unique approach for detecting potential changes in the proton-to-electron mass ratio. By comparing the ratio from observational and laboratory data in the Lyman-Alpha transition line, we derive a cosmological variation of $\Delta\mu / \mu = (0.120 \pm 0.144) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z_{abs}=3.025$. This approach not only advances fundamental physics understanding but also introduces innovative techniques for analyzing high-redshift QSO systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2016, an exposure meter was installed on the Lijiang Fiber-fed High-Resolution Spectrograph to monitor the coupling of starlight to the science fiber during observations. Based on it, we investigated a method to estimate the exposure flux of the CCD in real time by using the counts of the photomultiplier tubes (PMT) of the exposure meter, and developed a piece of software to optimize the control of the exposure time. First, by using flat-field lamp observations, we determined that there is a linear and proportional relationship between the total counts of the PMT and the exposure flux of the CCD. Second, using historical observations of different spectral types, the corresponding relational conversion factors were determined and obtained separately. Third, the method was validated using actual observation data, which showed that all values of the coefficient of determination were greater than 0.92. Finally, software was developed to display the counts of the PMT and the estimated exposure flux of the CCD in real-time during the observation, providing a visual reference for optimizing the exposure time control.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the fourth data release (DR4) of the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS), the last major step in our hemispheric survey with six optical filters: u, v, g, r, i, z. SMSS DR4 covers 26,000 sq.deg from over 400,000 images acquired by the 1.3m SkyMapper telescope between 2014-03 and 2021-09. The 6-band sky coverage extends from the South Celestial Pole to Dec = +16deg, with some images reaching Dec ~ +28deg. In contrast to previous DRs, we include all good-quality images from the facility taken during that time span, not only those explicitly taken for the public Survey. From the image dataset, we produce a catalogue of nearly 13 billion detections made from ~700 million unique astrophysical objects. The typical 10sigma depths for each field range between 18.5 and 20.5 mag, depending on the filter, but certain sky regions include longer exposures that reach as deep as 22 mag in some filters. As with previous SMSS catalogues, we have cross-matched with a host of other imaging and spectroscopic datasets to facilitate additional science outcomes. SMSS DR4 is now available to the worldwide astronomical community.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from spectral and timing study of the Z source GX 340+0 using AstroSat's SXT and LAXPC data. During the observation the source traced out the complete Z-track, allowing for the spectral evolution study of the Horizontal, Normal and Flaring branches (HB, NB and FB) as well as the hard and soft apexes (HA and SA). The spectra are better and more physically described by a blackbody component and a hot Comptonizing corona with a varying covering fraction, rather than one having a disc component. Along the track, the Comptonized flux (as well as the covering fraction) monotonically decreases. It is the blackbody component (both the temperature and radius) which varies non-monotonically and hence gives rise to the Z-track behaviour. Rapid timing study reveals a prominent Quasi-periodic Oscillation (QPO) at ~ 50 Hz at the HB, HA and upper NB, while a QPO at ~ 6 Hz is seen for the other branches. The fractional r.m.s of the QPOs increase with energy and exhibit soft lags in all branches except SA and FB.
#### Stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in young associations

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, combining high-contrast imaging and space astrometry we found that Jupiter-like (JL) planets are frequent in the beta Pic moving group (BPMG) around those stars where their orbit can be stable, prompting further analysis and discussion. We broaden our previous analysis to other young nearby associations to determine the frequency, mass, and separation of companions in general and JL in particular and their dependencies on the mass and age of the associations. We collected available data about companions including those revealed by visual observations, eclipses, spectroscopy, and astrometry. We determined search completeness and found that it is very high for stellar companions, while completeness corrections are still large for JL companions. Once these corrections are included, we found a high frequency of companions, both stellar (>0.52+/-0.03) and JL (0.57+/-0.11). The two populations are separated by a gap that corresponds to the brown dwarf desert. Within the population of massive companions, we found trends in frequency, separation, and mass ratios with stellar mass. Planetary companions pile up in the region just outside the ice line and we found them to be frequent once completeness was considered. The frequency of JL planets decreases with the overall mass and possibly the age of the association. We tentatively identify the two populations as due to disk fragmentation and core accretion, respectively. The distributions of stellar companions with a semi-major axis <1000 au is well reproduced by a simple model of formation by disk fragmentation. The observed trends with stellar mass can be explained by a shorter but much more intense phase of accretion onto the disk of massive stars and by a more steady and prolonged accretion on solar-type stars. Possible explanations for the trends in the population of JL planets with association mass and age are briefly discussed.

 Recent astrophysical models predict that stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could form and coalesce within a few gravitational radii of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Detecting the gravitational waves (GWs) from such systems requires numerical tools which can track the dynamics of the binaries while capturing all the essential relativistic effects. This work develops upon our earlier study of a BBH moving along a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a Kerr SMBH. Here we modify the numerical method to simulate a BBH falling toward the SMBH along a parabolic orbit of arbitrary inclination with respect to the equator. By tracking the evolution in a frame freely falling alongside the binary, we find that the eccentricity of the BBH is more easily excited than it is in the previous equatorial case, and that the cause is the asymmetry of the tidal tensor imposed on the binary when the binary moves out of the equatorial plane. Since the eccentricity reaches maximum around the same time that the BBH becomes the closest to the SMBH, multi-band GW bursts could be produced which are simultaneously detectable by the space- and ground-based detectors. We show that the effective spins of such GW events also undergo significant variation due to the rapid reorientation of the inner BBHs during their interaction with SMBHs. These results demonstrate the richness of three-body dynamics in the region of strong gravity, and highlight the necessity of building new numerical tools to simulate such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 A Be/X-ray binary system known as RX J0440.9+4431 (or LS V +44 17) is a potential member of the uncommon gamma-ray binary class. With an orbital period of 150 days, this system consists of a neutron star and a Be star companion. The MAXI observatory discovered an X-ray outburst from the source in December of 2022. Early in January, the outburst reached its peak, which was then followed by a decrease and a subsequent rebrightening. The X-ray flux exceeded 1 Crab in the 15-50 keV range at this second peak. AstroSat observations were conducted close to the peak of the second outburst, from January 11 to January 12, 2023. We report here the results of our search for 3-80 keV X-ray emission in the data of the AstroSat's LAXPC detector. It is found that the pulse period of the source is around 208 seconds. The source is found to be emitting more in the softer part of the X-ray energy range. The spectral characteristics can be described by employing a power-law model with an exponential cutoff, along with a blackbody component, interstellar absorption and an additional 6.4 keV iron fluorescence line.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the case for a single-band LSST-matched depth Roman Community Survey over the footprint of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Wide-Fast-Deep to enhance the key science programs of both missions. We propose to observe the ~18K sq deg LSST Wide-Fast-Deep footprint in the F146 filter to mAB~25; this will take approximately 5 months of Roman observing time. The combination of the multiwavelength nature of LSST and angular resolution of Roman would lead to enhanced scientific returns for both the Roman and LSST surveys. Galaxy deblending and crowded field photometry will be significantly improved. The extension of Rubin LSST six-band optical photometry to IR wavelengths would improve photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation, leading to improved cosmological parameter estimation, penetrate interstellar dust in the Galactic plane, improve differential chromatic refraction derived Spectral Energy Distributions, maximize galaxy-star separation and minimize crowding confusion through improved angular resolution. Conversely, the LSST survey will provide a time-domain extension of the Roman survey on the shared footprint and 6-band optical photometry with sensitivity extending all the way to ultraviolet wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Young Stellar Objects (YSO) are newly formed stars from molecular clouds. They stay close to where they were born and serve as good tracers to study gas and star formation. During cloud evolution, young massive stars can disrupt the surrounding gas through stellar feedback, changing the gas distribution. We study the distribution of the gas around a sample of YSO associations located at $d \lesssim 3.5 \;\rm kpc$ from the Sun by comparing the location and morphology between $^{12}$CO (J = 1$-$0) emission, Planck 870 $\mu$m maps and YSO associations. Based on the spatial distribution of the gas compared to that of the YSOs, we classify the YSO associations into six types: direct, close, bubble, complex, diffuse, and clean associations. The complex associations are large structures consisting of both gas-rich and gas-poor segments. We study the velocity dispersion-size relation toward different association types. From the ratio between different types, we estimate a feedback time of $\approx$ 1.7 Myr in the solar neighborhood. The sample sets a solid foundation to explore the relationship between interstellar medium evolution, star formation, and Galaxy structure.

 - **Abstract**
 In light of the non-perturbative resonance effects that may occur during inflation, we introduce a parametrization for the power spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) characterized by narrow-band amplification. We utilize the universal $\Omega_\text{GW}\propto k^3$ infrared limit, applicable to a wide array of gravitational wave sources, to devise a robust yet straightforward parameterization optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses. This parameterization is demonstrated through select examples where its application is pertinent, and we discuss the advantages of this approach over traditional parametrizations for narrow-band scenarios. To evaluate the sensitivity of our proposed model parameters, we apply a mock likelihood based on the CMB-Stage4 data. Furthermore, we explicate the computational process for the mapping relationship between the foundational model parameters and our parameterized framework, using a two-field inflation model that resonantly amplifies gravitational waves (GWs) as an example.

 - **Abstract**
 In-ice radio-detection is a promising technique to discover and characterize ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, with energies above 100 PeV, adopted by present - ARA, ARIANNA, and RNO-G - and planned - IceCube-Gen2. So far, their ability to measure neutrino flavor has remained unexplored. We show and quantify how the neutrino flavor can be measured with in-ice radio detectors using two complementary detection channels. The first channel, sensitive to $\nu_e$, identifies them via their charged-current interactions, whose radio emission is elongated in time due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. The second channel, sensitive to $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$, identifies events made up of multiple showers generated by the muons and taus they generate. We show this in state-of-the-art forecasts geared at IceCube-Gen2, for representative choices of the UHE neutrino flux. This newfound sensitivity could allow us to infer the UHE neutrino flavor composition at their sources - and thus the neutrino production mechanism - and to probe UHE neutrino physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Context - Around the year 2000, Triton's south pole experienced an extreme summer solstice that occurs every about 650 years, when the subsolar latitude reached about 50{\deg}. Bracketing this epoch, a few occultations probed Triton's atmosphere in 1989, 1995, 1997, 2008 and 2017. A recent ground-based stellar occultation observed on 6 October 2022 provides a new measurement of Triton's atmospheric pressure which is presented here. Aims- The goal is to constrain the Volatile Transport Models (VTMs) of Triton's atmosphere that is basically in vapor pressure equilibrium with the nitrogen ice at its surface. Methods - Fits to the occultation light curves yield Triton's atmospheric pressure at the reference radius 1400 km, from which the surface pressure is induced. Results - The fits provide a pressure p_1400= 1.211 +/- 0.039 microbar at radius 1400 km (47 km altitude), from which a surface pressure of p_surf= 14.54 +/- 0.47 microbar is induced (1-sigma error bars). To within error bars, this is identical to the pressure derived from the previous occultation of 5 October 2017, p_1400 = 1.18 +/- 0.03 microbar and p_surf= 14.1 +/- 0.4 microbar, respectively. Based on recent models of Triton's volatile cycles, the overall evolution over the last 30 years of the surface pressure is consistent with N2 condensation taking place in the northern hemisphere. However, models typically predict a steady decrease in surface pressure for the period 2005-2060, which is not confirmed by this observation. Complex surface-atmosphere interactions, such as ice albedo runaway and formation of local N2 frosts in the equatorial regions of Triton could explain the relatively constant pressure between 2017 and 2022.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on X-ray polarization measurements of the extra-galactic Crab-like PSR B0540-69 and its Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using a ~850 ks Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) exposure. The PWN is unresolved by IXPE. No statistically significant polarization is detected for the image-averaged data, giving a 99% confidence polarization upper limit (MDP99) of 5.3% in 2-8 keV energy range. However, a phase-resolved analysis detects polarization for both the nebula and pulsar in the 4-6 keV energy range. For the PWN defined as the off-pulse phases, the polarization degree (PD) of (24.5 ${\pm}$ 5.3)% and polarization angle (PA) of (78.1 ${\pm}$ 6.2){\deg} is detected at 4.6${\sigma}$ significance level, consistent with the PA observed in the optical band. In a single on-pulse window, a hint of polarization is measured at 3.8${\sigma}$ with polarization degree of (50.0 ${\pm}$ 13.1)% and polarization angle of (6.2 ${\pm}$ 7.4){\deg}. A 'simultaneous' PSR/PWN analysis finds two bins at the edges of the pulse exceeding 3${\sigma}$ PD significance, with PD of (68 ${\pm}$ 20)% and (62 ${\pm}$ 20)%; intervening bins at 2-3${\sigma}$ significance have lower PD, hinting at additional polarization structure.

 - **Abstract**
 In Yukawa cosmology, a recent discovery revealed a relationship between baryonic matter and the dark sector. The relationship is described by the parameter $\alpha$ and the long-range interaction parameter $\lambda$ - an intrinsic property of the graviton. Applying the uncertainty relation to the graviton raises a compelling question: Is there a quantum mechanical limit to the measurement precision of the Hubble constant ($H_0$)? We argue that the uncertainty relation for the graviton wavelength $\lambda$ can be used to explain a running of $H_0$ with redshift. We show that the uncertainty in time has an inverse correlation with the value of the Hubble constant. That means that the measurement of the Hubble constant is intrinsically linked to length scales (redshift) and is connected to the uncertainty in time. On cosmological scales, we found that the uncertainty in time is related to the look-back time quantity. For measurements with a high redshift value, there is more uncertainty in time, which leads to a smaller value for the Hubble constant. Conversely, there is less uncertainty in time for local measurements with a smaller redshift value, resulting in a higher value for the Hubble constant. Therefore, due to the uncertainty relation, the Hubble tension is believed to arise from fundamental limitations inherent in cosmological measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Lunar sulfides and oxides are a significant source of noble and base metals and will be vital for future human colonies' self-sustainability. Sulfide detection (pyrite and troilite) applies to many technological fields and use cases, for example, as a raw material source (available in situ on the Lunar surface) for new solar panel production methods. Ilmenite is the primary iron and titanium ore on the Moon and can provide helium-3 for nuclear fusion and oxygen for rocket fuel. The most important ore minerals have prominent absorption peaks in a narrow far-infrared (FIR) wavelength range of 20-40 $\mu$m, much stronger than the spectral features of other common minerals, including significant silicates, sulfates, and carbonates. Our simulations based on the linear mixing of pyrite with the silicates mentioned above indicated that areas containing at least 10-20% pyrite could be detected from the orbit in the FIR range. MIRORES, Multiplanetary far-IR ORE Spectrometer, proposed here, would operate with a resolution down to <5 m, enabling the detection of areas covered by 2-3 m$^2$ of pyrite (or ilmenite) on a surface of ~17 m$^2$ from an altitude of 50 km, creating possibilities for detecting large and local smaller orebodies along with their stockworks. The use of the Cassegrain optical system achieves this capability. MIRORES will measure radiation in eight narrow bands (0.3 $\mu$m in width) that can include up to five bands centered on the ore mineral absorption bands, for example, 24.3, 24.9, 27.6, 34.2, and 38.8 $\mu$m for pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, ilmenite, and troilite, respectively. The instrument size is 32 $\times$ 32 $\times$ 42 cm, and the mass is <10 kg, which fits the standard microsatellite requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 Lithium's susceptibility to burning in stellar interiors makes it an invaluable tracer for delineating the evolutionary pathways of stars, offering insights into the processes governing their development. Observationally, the complex Li production and depletion mechanisms in stars manifest themselves as Li plateaus, and as Li-enhanced and Li-depleted regions of the HR diagram. The Li-dip represents a narrow range in effective temperature close to the main-sequence turn-off, where stars have slightly super-solar masses and strongly depleted Li. To study the modification of Li through stellar evolution, we measure 3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) Li abundance for 581 149 stars released in GALAH DR3. We describe a novel method that fits the observed spectra using a combination of 3D NLTE Li line profiles with blending metal line strength that are optimized on a star-by-star basis. Furthermore, realistic errors are determined by a Monte Carlo nested sampling algorithm which samples the posterior distribution of the fitted spectral parameters. The method is validated by recovering parameters from a synthetic spectrum and comparing to 26 stars in the Hypatia catalogue. We find 228 613 Li detections, and 352 536 Li upper limits. Our abundance measurements are generally lower than GALAH DR3, with a mean difference of 0.23 dex. For the first time, we trace the evolution of Li-dip stars beyond the main sequence turn-off and up the subgiant branch. This is the first 3D NLTE analysis of Li applied to a large spectroscopic survey, and opens up a new era of precision analysis of abundances for large surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 DG Tau is a nearby T Tauri star associated with a collimated jet, a circumstellar disk and a streamer a few hundred au long. The streamer connects to the disk at $\sim$50 au from DG Tau. At this location SO emission is observed, likely due to the release of sulphur from dust grains caused by the shock of the impact of the accretion streamer onto the disk. We investigate the possibility that the DG Tau streamer was produced via cloudlet capture on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations, considering a cloudlet initiating infall at 600 au from DG Tau with low angular momentum so that the centrifugal force is smaller than the gravitational force, even at 50 au. The elongation of the cloudlet into a streamer is caused by the tidal force when its initial velocity is much less than the free-fall velocity. The elongated cloudlet reaches the disk and forms a high density gas clump. Our hydrodynamic model reproduces the morphology and line-of-sight velocity of CS ($5-4$) emission from the Northern streamer observed with ALMA. We discuss the conditions for forming a streamer based on the simulations. We also show that the streamer should perturb the disk after impact for several thousands of years.

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the phase space distribution function (DF) and the energy distribution of dark matter particles for a spherical halo in dynamical equilibrium assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. Comparing the results with simulations of a wide range of haloes, we find that with appropriate matching, the energy distribution for a simulated halo can be well described by that derived from the best-fit NFW profile. Deviations occur at low energy when the NFW profile provides a poor fit for $r<0.05R_{vir}$, where $R_{vir}$ is the virial radius. The comparisons of DFs are similar to those of energy distributions, but the DF derived from the best-fit NFW profile has somewhat less accuracy because additional deviations are introduced through the density of energy states. We also compare the NFW fits to the simulated DFs and energy distributions with the DarkEXP fits of Hjorth & Williams (arXiv:1010.0265). We find that these fits have comparable accuracy in the region where both fit well, and that there is an approximate relation between the energy scale of the DarkEXP fits and the parameters of the NFW profile. The DarkEXP fits are better at low energy because they require the central gravitational potential as an input.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-peaked supernovae with precursors, dramatic light-curve rebrightenings, and spectral transformation are rare, but are being discovered in increasing numbers by modern night-sky transient surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Here, we present the observations and analysis of SN 2023aew, which showed a dramatic increase in brightness following an initial luminous (-17.4 mag) and long (~100 days) unusual first peak (possibly precursor). SN 2023aew was classified as a Type IIb supernova during the first peak but changed its type to resemble a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) after the marked rebrightening. We present comparisons of SN 2023aew's spectral evolution with SESN subtypes and argue that it is similar to SNe Ibc during its main peak. P-Cygni Balmer lines are present during the first peak, but vanish during the second peak's photospheric phase, before H$\alpha$ resurfaces again during the nebular phase. The nebular lines ([O I], [Ca II], Mg I], H$\alpha$) exhibit a double-peaked structure which hints towards a clumpy or non-spherical ejecta. We analyze the second peak in the light curve of SN 2023aew and find it to be broader than normal SESNe as well as requiring a very high $^{56}$Ni mass to power the peak luminosity. We discuss the possible origins of SN 2023aew including an eruption scenario where a part of the envelope is ejected during the first peak which also powers the second peak of the light curve through SN-CSM interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 The understanding of neutron star equation of state hinges on a comprehensive analysis of multi-messenger, multi-wavelength data. The recent scrutiny of PSR J0030+0451 data by NICER introduces complexities, unveiling a tension with another X-ray observation of the central compact object in HESS J1731-347, specifically concerning the mass-radius constraint of low-mass neutron stars. This tension persists when integrating NICER's updated data with LIGO/Virgo's gravitational-wave data from the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. Despite attempts to reconcile these disparate observations, the current combined data still can not distinguish different types of neutron stars -- whether they are pure neutron stars or hybrid stars. Bayesian inference indicates only modest changes in the posterior ranges of parameters related to the nuclear matter and deconfinement phase transition. This ongoing exploration underscores the intricate challenges in precisely characterizing neutron stars. It also points out that it is possible to probe the equation of state at different density regimes from future more accurate radii of neutron stars with various masses.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) on various scales, we investigate it at parsec resolution on the kiloparsec scale. Here, we report on the sub-kpc scale Gas Density Histogram (GDH) of the Milky Way. The GDH is a density probability distribution function (PDF) of the gas volume density. Using this method, we are free from an identification of individual molecular clouds and their spatial structures. We use survey data of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ($J$=1-0) emission in the Galactic plane ($l = 10^{\circ}$-$50^{\circ}$) obtained as a part of the FOREST Unbiased Galactic plane Imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45m telescope (FUGIN). We make a GDH for every channel map of $2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}$ area, including the blank sky component, and without setting cloud boundaries. This is a different approach from previous works for molecular clouds. The GDH fits well to a single or double log-normal distribution, which we name the low-density log-normal (L-LN) and high-density log-normal (H-LN) components, respectively. The multi-log-normal components suggest that the L-LN and H-LN components originate from two different stages of structure formation in the ISM. Moreover, we find that both the volume ratios of H-LN components to total ($f_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the width of the L-LN along the gas density axis ($\sigma_{\rm{L}}$) show coherent structure in the Galactic-plane longitude-velocity diagram. It is possible that these GDH parameters are related to strong galactic shocks and other weak shocks in the Milky Way.

 The data from the Gaia satellite led us to revise our conception of the Galaxy structure and history. Hitherto unknown components have been discovered and a deep re-thinking of what the Galactic halo is is in progress. We selected from the Gaia catalogue stars with extreme transverse velocities with respect to the Sun ($|V_T| > 500 $ and observed them with FORS2 at the ESO VLT, to classify them using both their chemical and dynamical properties. Two apparently young stars, identified in paper\,I, were observed with UVES. We derived abundances for Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Fe, analysing the spectra with while for Ba we used line profile fitting. We computed actions from parallaxes and kinematical data. The stars span the metallicity range $ Fe/H -0.5$ with $ Fe/H = -1.6$. Star GHS143 has a total speed of about 1440 which is almost three times faster than the local escape velocity of 522 strongly implying this star is unbound to the Galaxy. Remarkably, this star is not escaping from the Galaxy, but it is falling into it. Ten stars are apparently young with masses in excess of 1.3M. Their interpretation as evolved blue stragglers is doubtful. The existence of a young metal-poor population is possible. The two stars observed with UVES show no lithium, suggesting they are blue stragglers. We detected a metal-poor population, confined to the bulge, that we call SpiteF, and argue that it is the result of a recent accretion event. We detect 102 candidates of the Aurora population that should have formed prior to the formation of the disc. Our sample is non-homogeneous and mainly retrograde. The stars are metal poor, and 23<!PCT!> have Fe/H -2.0$. Our selection is efficient at finding very metal-poor stars, but it selects peculiar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia satellite has already provided the astronomical community with three data releases, and the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) on board Gaia has provided the radial velocity for 33 million stars. When deriving the radial velocity from the RVS spectra, several stars are measured to have large values. To verify the credibility of these measurements, we selected some bright stars with the modulus of radial velocity in excess of 500\ to be observed with SOPHIE at OHP and UVES at VLT. This paper is devoted to investigating the chemical composition of the stars observed with UVES. We derived atmospheric parameters using Gaia photometry and parallaxes, and we performed a chemical analysis using the code. We find that the sample consists of metal-poor stars, although none have extremely low metallicities. The abundance patterns match what has been found in other samples of metal-poor stars selected irrespective of their radial velocities. We highlight the presence of three stars with low Cu and Zn abundances that are likely descendants of pair-instability supernovae. Two stars are apparently younger than 1\,Ga, and their masses exceed twice the turn-off mass of metal-poor populations. This makes it unlikely that they are blue stragglers because it would imply they formed from triple or multiple systems. We suggest instead that they are young metal-poor stars accreted from a dwarf galaxy. Finally, we find that the star RVS721 is associated with the Gjoll stream, which itself is associated with the Globular Cluster NGC\,3201.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic data sets for SN 2020pvb, a Type IIn-P supernova (SN) similar to SNe 1994W, 2005cl, 2009kn and 2011ht, with a precursor outburst detected (PS1 w-band ~ -13.8 mag) around four months before the B-band maximum light. SN 2020pvb presents a relatively bright light curve peaking at M_B = -17.95 +- 0.30 mag and a plateau lasting at least 40 days before it went in solar conjunction. After this, the object is no longer visible at phases > 150 days above -12.5 mag in the B-band, suggesting that the SN 2020pvb ejecta interacts with a dense spatially confined circumstellar envelope. SN 2020pvb shows in its spectra strong Balmer lines and a forest of FeII lines with narrow P Cygni profiles. Using archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we constrain the progenitor of SN 2020pvb to have a luminosity of log(L/L_sun) <= 5.4, ruling out any single star progenitor over 50 M_sun. All in all, SN 2020pvb is a Type IIn-P whose progenitor star had an outburst ~ 0.5 yr before the final explosion, the material lost during this outburst is probably playing a role in shaping the physical properties of the supernova.

 The HERMES Technologic and Scientific Pathfinder project is a constellation of six CubeSats aiming to observe transient high-energy events such as the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). HERMES will be the first space telescope to include a siswich detector, able to perform spectroscopy in the 2 keV to 2 MeV energy band. The particular siswich architecture, which combines a solid-state Silicon Drift Detector and a scintillator crystal, requires specific calibration procedures that have not been yet standardized in a pipeline. We present in this paper the HERMES calibration pipeline, mescal, intended for raw HERMES data energy calibration and formatting. The software is designed to deal with the particularities of the siswich architecture and to minimize user interaction, including also an automated calibration line identification procedure, and an independent calibration of each detector pixel, in its two different operating modes. The mescal pipeline can set the basis for similar applications in future siswich telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of the disc in our Galaxy and the relation of the thick and thin disc formation and evolution is still a matter of debate. The chemo-dynamical characterization of disc stars is key to resolve this question, in particular at parameter regimes where both disc components overlap, such as the region around [Fe/H] $\sim$ $-0.7$ corresponding to the thin disc metal-poor end. In this paper we re-assess the recent detection of a metal-poor extension of stars moving with thin-disc-like rotational velocities between -2 < [Fe/H] < -0.7 that was made based on metallicity estimates obtained from photometric data and their rotational velocity distribution. We explore the chemo-dynamical properties of metal-poor stars within the recent Gaia third data release (DR3), which includes the first catalogue of metallicity estimates from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) experiment. We complement them with the two largest high-resolution ($\lambda/d\lambda$ > 20,000) spectroscopic surveys available, the GALAH DR3 and the APOGEE DR17. We confirm that there are high angular-momentum stars moving in thin-disc-like orbits, i.e., with high angular momentum $\rm L_{z}/J_{tot}$ > 0.95, and close to the Galactic plane, $\rm |Z_{max}|$ < 750 pc, reaching metallicity values down to [Fe/H] $\sim-1.5$. We also find tentative evidence of stars moving on such orbits at lower metallicities, down to [Fe/H] $\sim -2.5$, although in smaller numbers. Based on their chemical trends the fast rotators with [Fe/H] < -1 would have formed in a medium less chemically evolved than the bulk of the thick disc. Fast rotators with chemical abundances typical of the thin disc appear at metallicities between -1 < [Fe/H] < -0.7.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the ionised and atomic gas kinematics and excitation state in the central region of ongoing star formation of the nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxy Sextans B. The analysis is based on the new observations performed in Ha emission line with high resolution ($R \sim 16000$) scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer at the 6-m BTA SAO RAS telescope, and on the long-slit spectral observations at the 9.2-m SALT and 2.5-m CMO SAI MSU telescopes. Strong non-circular gas motions detected in the studied regions probably resulted from the off-plane gas motions and impact of stellar feedback. We identified six regions of elevated Ha velocity dispersion, five of which exhibit asymmetric or two-component Ha line profiles. Three of these regions are young ($<1.1$ Myr) expanding ($V_{\rm exp} \sim 25-50\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$) superbubbles. We argue that at least three regions in the galaxy could be supernova remnants. We conclude that supernovae feedback is the dominant source of energy for superbubbles in Sextans B, which is expected for such a low metallicity, although we cannot rule out a strong impact of pre-supernova feedback for one superbubble.
#### Reply to: Effects of density and temperature variations on the  metallicity of Mrk 71

 - **Abstract**
 In Chen et al., 2023 (C23; arXiv:2304.09898), we introduced a new method to directly measure temperature fluctuations and applied it to a nearby dwarf galaxy, Mrk 71, finding a temperature fluctuation parameter $t^2 = 0.008\pm 0.043$. This result is lower by $\sim 2\sigma$ than the value required to explain the abundance discrepancy (AD) in this object. In the Matters Arising article submitted by Mendez-Delgado et al. (arXiv:2310.01197), the authors claim that using the same data presented in C23 in a different way, it is possible to conclude that the measurements are consistent with a larger $t^2 \simeq 0.1$ inferred indirectly from recombination lines (RLs). However, this requires a higher density such that the infrared [O III] 52 $\mu$m and [O III] 88 $\mu$m lines -- which form the basis of the direct measurement method -- are mutually inconsistent. Moreover, to reach agreement between the direct $t^2$ measurement and the larger $t^2$ value inferred from RLs requires systematically varying four parameters by $\sim 1\sigma$ from their best-determined values, which collectively amount to a $\sim2\sigma$ difference, consistent with the significance ($\sim 2 \sigma$) originally reported in C23. Therefore, we conclude that the results of C23 hold, and that the combined optical and infrared [O III] data disfavour $t^2 \simeq 0.1$ at the $\approx2\sigma$ level in Mrk 71. Future work is nonetheless warranted to better understand the AD associated with both optical and infrared emission line analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of neutron star mergers have the potential to unveil detailed physics of matter and gravity in regimes inaccessible by other experiments. Quantitative comparisons to theory and parameter estimation require nonlinear numerical simulations. However, the detailed physics of energy and momentum transfer between different scales, and the formation and interaction of small scale structures, which can be probed by detectors, are not captured by current simulations. This is where turbulence enters neutron star modelling. This review will outline the theory and current status of turbulence modelling for relativistic neutron star merger simulations.
#### Spectroscopic Insights into the Quiescent Stages of RS Ophiuchi  (2006-2021): Photoionization Modeling and Accretion Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of the nova RS Ophiuchi during its quiescent stage, spanning a duration of approximately 13 years. The spectra exhibit prominent low-ionization emission features, including hydrogen, helium, iron, and TiO absorption features originating from the cool secondary component. The CLOUDY photoionization code is employed to model these spectra, allowing us to estimate various physical parameters such as temperature, luminosity, and hydrogen density, along with elemental abundances and accretion rate. The central ionizing sources exhibit temperatures in the range of $1.05 - 1.8~\times 10^4$ K and luminosities between $0.1 - 7.9~\times 10^{30}$ \ergs. Notably, \ion{He}{} displays an overabundance from 2008 to 2016, returning to solar values by 2020, while \ion{Fe}{} appears subsolar from 2008 to 2014 but becomes overabundant from 2006 onward. The mean accretion rate, as calculated from the model, is approximately $1.254 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. About 47\% of the critical mass was accreted after April, 2020 ($\sim$15 months before the 2021 outburst), and approximately 88\% of the critical mass was accreted after July 20, 2018. This non-uniform accretion rate suggests a more rapid approach towards reaching the critical mass in the final years, possibly attributed to the heightened gravitational pull resulting from previously accreted matter, influencing the accretion dynamics as the system approaches the critical mass limit.

 - **Abstract**
 Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.
