          Atomic Transition Probabilities for UV and Optical Lines of Tm II

 - **Abstract**
 We report new branching fraction measurements for 224 ultraviolet (UV) and optical transitions of Tm II. These transitions range in wavelength (wavenumber) from 2350 - 6417 Angstroms (42532 - 15579 cm-1) and originate in 13 odd-parity and 24 even-parity upper levels. Thirty-five of the 37 levels, accounting for 213 of the 224 transitions, are studied for the first time. Branching fractions are determined for two levels studied previously for comparison to earlier results. The levels studied for the first time are high-lying, ranging in energy from 35753 - 54989 cm-1. The branching fractions are determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution spectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an earlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values with accuracy ranging from 5 - 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and theoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist. These new log(gf) values are used to derive an abundance from one previously unused Tm II line in the UV spectrum of the r-process-enhanced metal-poor star HD 222925, and this abundance is consistent with previous determinations based on other Tm II lines.

          Exoplanets Across Galactic Stellar Populations with PLATO: Estimating Exoplanet Yields Around FGK Stars for the Thin Disk, Thick Disk and Stellar Halo

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] < -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.

          Accounting for Selection Effects in Supernova Cosmology with Simulation-Based Inference and Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear exploding stars that can be used to put constraints on the nature of our universe. One challenge with population analyses of SNe Ia is Malmquist bias, where we preferentially observe the brighter SNe due to limitations of our telescopes. If untreated, this bias can propagate through to our posteriors on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we develop a novel technique of using a normalising flow to learn the non-analytical likelihood of observing a SN Ia for a given survey from simulations, that is independent of any cosmological model. The learnt likelihood is then used in a hierarchical Bayesian model with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to put constraints on different sets of cosmological parameters conditioned on the observed data. We verify this technique on toy model simulations finding excellent agreement with analytically-derived posteriors to within $1 \sigma$.
#### Title:
          Radiation and outflow properties of super-Eddington accretion flows around various mass classes of black holes: Dependence on the accretion rates

 - **Abstract**
 We perform axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion flow and outflow around black holes to examine the properties of radiation and outflow as functions of the black hole mass and the accretion rate onto the black hole ($\dot M_{\rm BH}$). We find that the $\dot{m}_{\rm BH} (\equiv \dot{M}_{\rm BH}c^2 /L_{\rm Edd})$ dependence of $L_{\rm rad}/L_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm mech}/L_{\rm Edd}$ found for stellar-mass black hole can apply to the high mass cases, where $L_{\rm rad}$ is the radiation luminosity, $L_{\rm mech}$ is the mechanical luminosity, $c$ is the speed of light, and $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. Such universalities can appear in the regime, in which electron scattering opacity dominates over absorption opacity. Further, the normalized isotropic mechanical luminosity $L_{\rm mech}^{\rm ISO}/L_{\rm Edd}$ (evaluated by normalized density and velocity at $\theta=10^\circ$) exhibits a broken power-law relationship with ${\dot m}_{\rm BH}$; $L_{\rm mech}^{\rm ISO}/ L_{\rm Edd} \propto{\dot m}_{\rm BH}^{2.7}$ (or $\propto {\dot m}_{\rm BH}^{0.7}$) below (above) ${\dot m}_{\rm BH}\sim 400$. This is because the radial velocity stays nearly constant (or even decreases) below (above) the break with increase of $\dot m_{\rm BH}$. We also find that the luminosity ratio is $L_{\rm mech}/L_{\rm rad}^{\rm ISO} \sim$ 0.05 at ${\dot m}_{\rm BH} \sim 100$, which is roughly consistent with the observations of NLS1, 1H 0323+103.

          The Effect of Donor Star Rejuvenation on Common Envelope Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 In close binary star systems, common envelope evolution may occur after a previous phase of mass transfer. Some isolated formation channels for double neutron star binaries suggest that the donor of common envelope evolution was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer. Accretion should substantially alter the structure of the donor, particularly by steepening the density gradient at the core-envelope interface and rejuvenating the star. We study the common envelope evolution of a donor that was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer and has a rejuvenated structure. We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the common envelope evolution of a 18 $M_\odot$ supergiant with a 1.4 $M_\odot$ companion using rejuvenated and non-rejuvenated 1D stellar models for the donor. We compare the two simulations to characterize the effect of the rejuvenation on the outcome of the common envelope phase and the shape of the ejecta. We find that accounting for a previous phase of mass transfer reduces the duration of the inspiral phase by a factor of two, likely due to the different structure in the outer layers of the donor. In the rejuvenated case, the simulations show more equatorially concentrated and asymmetric ejecta, though both cases display evidence for the formation of a pressure-supported thick circumbinary disk. During the dynamical inspiral phase, the impact of rejuvenation on the unbinding of the envelope is unclear; we find that rejuvenation decreases the amount of unbound mass by 20$\%$ to 40$\%$ depending on the energy criterion used.

          Emulation of $f(R)$ modified gravity from $\Lambda$CDM using conditional GANs

 - **Abstract**
 A major aim of current and upcoming cosmological surveys is testing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the full scientific value of these surveys will only be realised through efficient simulation methods that keep up with the increasing volume and precision of observational data. $N$-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) theories are computationally expensive since highly non-linear equations need to be solved to model the non-linear matter evolution; this represents a significant bottleneck in the path to reach the data volume and resolution attained by equivalent $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We develop a field-level, neural-network-based emulator that generates density and velocity divergence fields under the $f(R)$ gravity MG model from the corresponding $\Lambda$CDM simulated fields. Using attention mechanisms and a complementary frequency-based loss function, our model is able to learn this intricate mapping. We further use the idea of latent space extrapolation to generalise our emulator to $f(R)$ models with differing field strengths. The predictions of our emulator agree with the $f(R)$ simulations to within 5% for matter density and to within 10% for velocity divergence power spectra up to $k \sim 2\,h$ $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. But for a few select cases, higher-order statistics are reproduced with $\lesssim$10% agreement with the $f(R)$ simulations. Latent extrapolation allows our emulator to generalise to different $f(R)$ model variants without explicitly training on those variants. Given a $\Lambda$CDM simulation, the GPU-based emulator is able to reproduce the equivalent $f(R)$ realisation $\sim$600 times faster than full $N$-body simulations. This lays the foundations for a valuable tool for realistic yet rapid mock field generation and robust cosmological analyses.

          Origin of Mars's moons by disruptive partial capture of an asteroid

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Phobos and Deimos remains unknown. They are typically thought either to be captured asteroids or to have accreted from a debris disk produced by a giant impact. Here, we present an alternative scenario wherein fragments of a tidally disrupted asteroid are captured and evolve into a collisional proto-satellite disk. We simulate the initial disruption and the fragments' subsequent orbital evolution. We find that tens of percent of an unbound asteroid's mass can be captured and survive beyond collisional timescales, across a broad range of periapsis distances, speeds, masses, spins, and orientations in the Sun--Mars frame. Furthermore, more than one percent of the asteroid's mass could evolve to circularise in the moons' accretion region. The resulting lower mass requirement for the parent body than that for a giant impact could increase the likelihood of this route to forming a proto-satellite disk that, unlike direct capture, could also naturally explain the moons' orbits. These formation scenarios imply different properties of Mars's moons to be tested by upcoming spacecraft missions.

          Toward Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy Using JWST/MIRI's Medium Resolution Spectrometer

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)'s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (the MRS) on JWST has potentially important advantages for transit and eclipse spectroscopy of exoplanets, including lack of saturation for bright host stars, wavelength span to longward of 20 microns, and JWST's highest spectral resolving power. We here test the performance of the MRS for time series spectroscopy by observing the secondary eclipse of the bright stellar eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris. Our observations push the MRS into saturation at the shortest wavelength, more than for any currently known exoplanet system. We find strong charge migration between pixels that we mitigate using a custom data analysis pipeline. Our data analysis recovers much of the spatial charge migration by combining detector pixels at the group level, via weighting by the point spread function. We achieve nearly photon-limited performance in time series data at wavelengths longward of 5.2 microns. In 2017, Snellen et al. suggested that the MRS could be used to detect carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere of the temperate planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. We infer that the relative spectral response of the MRS versus wavelength is sufficiently stable to make that detection feasible. As regards the secondary eclipse of this Algol-type binary, we measure the eclipse depth by summing our spectra over the wavelengths in four channels, and also measuring the eclipse depth as observed by TESS. Those eclipse depths require a temperature for the secondary star that is significantly hotter than previous observations in the optical to near-IR, probably due to irradiation by the primary star. At full spectral resolution of the MRS, we find atomic hydrogen recombination emission lines in the secondary star, from principal quantum levels n = 7, 8, 10, and 14.

          Is Gamma-ray Burst 221009A Really a Once-in-10,000 Year Event?

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) brighter than the GRB 221009A, the brightest yet observed, have previously been estimated to occur at a rate of 1 per 10,000 years, based on the extrapolation of the distribution of fluences of the Long GRB population. We show that bursts this bright could instead have a rate as high as approximately one per 200 years if they are from a separate population of narrow-jet GRBs. This population must have a maximum redshift of about $z\approx 0.38$ in order to avoid over-producing the observed rate of fainter GRBs. We show that it will take $> 100$ years to confirm this new population based on observing another GRB from it with a $\gamma$-ray detector; observing an orphan optical afterglow from this population with Vera Rubin Observatory or an orphan radio afterglow with the Square Kilometer Array will also take similarly long times to observe, and it is unclear if they could be distinguished from the standard GRB population. We show that the nearby narrow-jet population has more favorable energetics for producing ultra-high energy cosmic rays than standard GRBs. The rate of bursts in the Milky Way bright enough to cause mass extinctions of life on Earth from the narrow jet population is estimated to be approximately 1 per 500 Myr. This GRB population could make life in the Milky Way less likely, with implications for future searches for life on exoplanets.

          Closing the gap: secular evolution of bar-induced dark gaps in presence of thick discs

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dark gaps, a preferential light deficit along the bar minor axis, is observationally well known. The properties of dark gaps are thought to be associated with the properties of bars, and their spatial locations are often associated with bar resonances. However, a systematic study, testing the robustness and universality of these assumptions, is still largely missing. Here, we investigate the formation and evolution of bar-induced dark gaps using a suite of N-body models of (kinematically cold) thin and (kinematically hot) thick discs with varying thick disc mass fraction, and different thin-to-thick disc geometry. We find that dark gaps are a natural consequence of the trapping of disc stars by the bar. The properties of dark gaps (such as strength and extent) are well correlated with the properties of bars. For stronger dark gaps, the fractional mass loss along the bar minor axis can reach up to ~60-80 percent of the initial mass contained, which is redistributed within the bar. These trends hold true irrespective of the mass fraction in the thick disc and the assumed disc geometry. In all our models harbouring slow bars, none of the resonances (corotation, Inner Lindblad resonance, and 4:1 ultra-harmonic resonance) associated with the bar correspond to the location of dark gaps, thereby suggesting that the location of dark gaps is not a universal proxy for these bar resonances, in contrast with earlier studies.

          Three-Dimensional Venus Cloud Structure Simulated by a General Circulation Model

 - **Abstract**
 The clouds have a great impact on Venus's energy budget and climate evolution, but its three-dimensional structure is still not well understood. Here we incorporate a simple Venus cloud physics scheme into a flexible GCM to investigate the three-dimensional cloud spatial variability. Our simulations show good agreement with observations in terms of the vertical profiles of clouds and H2SO4 vapor. H2O vapor is overestimated above the clouds due to efficient transport in the cloud region. The cloud top decreases as latitude increases, qualitatively consistent with Venus Express observations. The underlying mechanism is the combination of H2SO4 chemical production and meridional circulation. The mixing ratios of H2SO4 at 50-60 km and H2O vapors in the main cloud deck basically exhibit maxima around the equator, due to the effect of temperature's control on the saturation vapor mixing ratios of the two species. The cloud mass distribution is subject to both H2SO4 chemical production and dynamical transport and shows a pattern that peaks around the equator in the upper cloud while peaks at mid-high latitudes in the middle cloud. At low latitudes, H2SO4 and H2O vapors, cloud mass loading and acidity show semidiurnal variations at different altitude ranges, which can be validated against future missions. Our model emphasizes the complexity of the Venus climate system and the great need for more observations and simulations to unravel its spatial variability and underlying atmospheric and/or geological processes.

          Gemini Planet Imager Observations of a Resolved Low-Inclination Debris Disk Around HD 156623

 - **Abstract**
 The 16 Myr-old A0V star HD 156623 in the Scorpius--Centaurus association hosts a high-fractional-luminosity debris disk, recently resolved in scattered light for the first time by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) in polarized intensity. We present new analysis of the GPI H-band polarimetric detection of the HD 156623 debris disk, with particular interest in its unique morphology. This debris disk lacks a visible inner clearing, unlike the majority of low-inclination disks in the GPI sample and in Sco-Cen, and it is known to contain CO gas, positioning it as a candidate ``hybrid'' or ``shielded'' disk. We use radiative transfer models to constrain the geometric parameters of the disk based on scattered light data and thermal models to constrain the unresolved inner radius based on the system's spectral energy distribution (SED). We also compute a measurement of the polarized scattering phase function, adding to the existing sample of empirical phase function measurements. We find that HD 156623's debris disk inner radius is constrained to less than 26.6 AU from scattered light imagery and less than 13.4 AU from SED modeling at a 99.7% confidence interval, and suggest that gas drag may play a role in retaining sub-blowout size dust grains so close to the star.

 - **Abstract**
 A small number of pulsars are known to emit giant pulses, single pulses much brighter than average. Among these is PSR J0534+2200, also known as the Crab pulsar, a young pulsar with high giant pulse rates. Long-term monitoring of the Crab pulsar presents an excellent opportunity to perform statistical studies of its giant pulses and the processes affecting them, potentially providing insight into the behavior of other neutron stars that emit bright single pulses. Here, we present an analysis of a set of 24,985 Crab giant pulses obtained from 88 hours of daily observations at a center frequency of 1.55 GHz by the 20-meter telescope at the Green Bank Observatory, spread over 461 days. We study the effects of refractive scintillation at higher frequencies than previous studies and compare methods of correcting for this effect. We also search for deterministic patterns seen in other single-pulse sources, possible periodicities seen in several rotating radio transients and fast radio bursts, and clustering of giant pulses like that seen in the repeating fast radio burst FRB121102.

          TensorFlow Hydrodynamics Analysis for Ly-$\alpha$ Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Python program THALAS (TensorFlow Hydrodynamics Analysis for Lyman-Alpha Simulations), which maps baryon fields (baryon density, temperature, and velocity) to Ly$\alpha$ optical depth fields in both real space and redshift space. Unlike previous Ly$\alpha$ codes, THALAS is fully differentiable, enabling a wide variety of potential applications for general analysis of hydrodynamical simulations and cosmological inference. To demonstrate THALAS's capabilities, we apply it to the Ly$\alpha$ forest inversion problem: given a Ly$\alpha$ optical depth field, we reconstruct the corresponding real-space dark matter density field. Such applications are relevant to both cosmological and three-dimensional tomographic analyses of Lyman Alpha forest data.

 - **Abstract**
 The efficiency of science observation Short-Term Scheduling (STS) can be defined as being a function of how many highly ranked observations are completed per unit time. Current STS at ESO's Paranal observatory is achieved through filtering and ranking observations via well-defined algorithms, leading to a proposed observation at time t. This Paranal STS model has been successfully employed for more than a decade. Here, we summarise the current VLT(I) STS model, and outline ongoing efforts of optimising the scientific return of both the VLT(I) and future ELT. We describe the STS simulator we have built that enables us to evaluate how changes in model assumptions affect STS effectiveness. Such changes include: using short-term predictions of atmospheric parameters instead of assuming their constant time evolution; assessing how the ranking weights on different observation parameters can be changed to optimise the scheduling; changing STS to be more `dynamic' to consider medium-term scheduling constraints. We present specific results comparing how machine learning predictions of the seeing can improve STS efficiency when compared to the current model of using the last 10\,min median of the measured seeing for observation selection.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilized photometric data from the space telescope AKARI to identify potential planetary nebulae (PNe) and proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) candidates. Using the colour-colour diagram, we found a region with a high concentration of established PNe and PPNe, comprising about 95% of the objects. Based on this, we identified 67 objects within this region that lack definitive classification in existing literature, suggesting they are promising candidates. We conducted Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis and morphological investigations using imagery from various observatories and satellites. Finally, we present a list of 65 potential PNe and PPNe candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores the use of low-dimensional parametric representations of neutron-star equations of state that include discontinuities caused by phase transitions. The accuracies of optimal piecewise-analytic and spectral representations are evaluated for equations of state having first- or second-order phase transitions with a wide range of discontinuity sizes. These results suggest that the piecewise-analytic representations of these non-smooth equations of state are convergent, while the spectral representations are not. Nevertheless, the lower-order (2 <= N_parms <= 7) spectral representations are found to be more accurate than the piecewise-analytic representations with the same number of parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is known for its high star formation activity. At its center lies the young massive star cluster R136, providing a significant amount of the energy that makes the nebula shine so brightly at many wavelengths. Recently, young massive star clusters have been suggested to also efficiently produce high-energy cosmic rays, potentially beyond PeV energies. Here, we report the detection of very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the direction of R136 with the High Energy Stereoscopic System, achieved through a multicomponent, likelihood-based modeling of the data. This supports the hypothesis that R136 is indeed a very powerful cosmic-ray accelerator. Moreover, from the same analysis, we provide an updated measurement of the $\gamma$-ray emission from 30 Dor C, the only superbubble detected at TeV energies presently. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity above $0.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$ of both sources is $(2-3)\times 10^{35}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This exceeds by more than a factor of 2 the luminosity of HESS J1646$-$458, which is associated with the most massive young star cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-ray emission from each source is extended with a significance of $>3\sigma$ and a Gaussian width of about $30\,\mathrm{pc}$. For 30 Dor C, a connection between the $\gamma$-ray emission and the nonthermal X-ray emission appears likely. Different interpretations of the $\gamma$-ray signal from R136 are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The brightest of all time (BOAT) GRB221009A show evidence for a narrow, evolving MeV emission line. Here, we show that this line can be explained as due to pair annihilation in the prompt emission region, and that its temporal evolution is naturally explained as the high-latitude emission (emission from higher angles from the line of sight) after prompt emission is over. We consider both the high and low optical depth for pair production regimes, and find acceptable solutions, with the GRB Lorentz factor $\Gamma \approx 600$ and the emission radius $r \gtrsim 10^{16.5}$~cm. We discuss the conditions for the appearance of such a line, and show that a unique combination of high luminosity and Lorentz factor that is in a fairly narrow range are required for the line detection. This explains why such an annihilation line is rarely observed in GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2013, the IceCube Collaboration reported the first observation of an astrophysical neutrino flux, with energies extending up to the PeV-scale. Over the last decade, this flux has been characterized by measurements in multiple detection channels that are complementary with respect to the sensitive energy range, flavor composition, sky coverage, and backgrounds. The origin of these neutrinos remains largely unknown. However, evidence has been found for neutrino emission from the directions of the blazar TXS 0506+056, Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. and the Galactic Plane. IceCube also has an active program of indirect dark matter searches with competitive constraints on dark matter models. In this talk, we will present recent results of the IceCube experiment, highlighting the latest diffuse flux measurements, point source searches, and dark matter analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding planet formation is important in the context of the origin of planetary systems in general and of the Solar System in particular, as well as to predict the likelihood of finding Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth analogues around other stars. We aim to precisely determine the radii and dynamical masses of transiting planets orbiting the young M star AU Mic using public photometric and spectroscopic datasets. We characterise the stellar activity and physical properties (radius, mass, density) of the transiting planets in the young AU Mic system through joint transit and radial velocity fits with Gaussian processes. We determine a radius of $R^{b}$= 4.79 +/- 0.29 R$_\oplus$, a mass of $M^{b}$= 9.0 +/- 2.7 M$_\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\rho^{b}$ = 0.49 +/- 0.16 g cm$^{-3}$ for the innermost transiting planet AU Mic b. For the second known transiting planet, AU Mic c, we infer a radius of $R^{c}$= 2.79 +/- 0.18 R$_\oplus$, a mass of $M^{c}$= 14.5 +/- 3.4 M$_\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\rho^{c}$ = 3.90 +/- 1.17 g cm$^{-3}$. According to theoretical models, AU Mic b may harbour an H2 envelope larger than 5\% by mass, with a fraction of rock and a fraction of water. AU Mic c could be made of rock and/or water and may have an H2 atmosphere comprising at most 5\% of its mass. AU Mic b has retained most of its atmosphere but might lose it over tens of millions of years due to the strong stellar radiation, while AU Mic c likely suffers much less photo-evaporation because it lies at a larger separation from its host. Using all the datasets in hand, we determine a 3$\sigma$ upper mass limit of $M^{[d]}\sin{i}$ = 8.6 M$_{\oplus}$ for the AU Mic 'd' TTV-candidate. In addition, we do not confirm the recently proposed existence of the planet candidate AU Mic 'e' with an orbital period of 33.4 days.

 Aims. The space radiation environment conditions and the maximum expected coronal mass ejection (CME) speed are being assessed through the investigation of scaling laws between the peak proton flux and fluence of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the speed of the CMEs. Methods. We utilize a complete catalog of SEP events, covering the last ~25 years of CME observations (i.e. 1997 to 2017). We calculate the peak proton fluxes and integrated event fluences for those events reaching an integral energy of up to E> 100 MeV, covering the period of the last ~25 years of CME observations. For a sample of 38 strong SEP events, we first investigate the statistical relations between the recorded peak proton fluxes (IP) and fluences (FP) at a set of integral energies of E >10 MeV, E>30 MeV, E>60 MeV, and E>100 MeV versus the projected CME speed near the Sun (VCME) obtained by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO). Based on the inferred relations, we further calculate the integrated energy dependence of both IP and FP, assuming that they follow an inverse power-law with respect to energy. By making use of simple physical assumptions, we combine our derived scaling laws to estimate the upper limits for VCME, IP, and FP focusing on two cases of known extreme SEP events that occurred on February 23, 1956 (GLE05) and in AD774/775, respectively. Given physical constraints and assumptions, several options for the upper limit VCME, associated with these events, are investigated. Results. A scaling law relating IP and FP to the CME speed as V^{5}CME for CMEs ranging between ~3400-5400 km/s is consistent with values of FP inferred for the cosmogenic nuclide event of AD774/775. At the same time, the upper CME speed that the current Sun can provide possibly falls within an upper limit of VCME <= 5500 km/s.

 - **Abstract**
 This study concerns an inventory of the gravitational force and tidal field induced by filaments, walls, cluster nodes and voids on Megaparsec scales and how they assemble and shape the Cosmic Web. The study is based on a N$_{\rm Part}=512^3$ $\Lambda$CDM dark matter only N-body simulation in a (300$h^{-1}$~Mpc)$^3$ box at $z=0$. We invoke the density field NEXUS+ multiscale morphological procedure to assign the appropriate morphological feature to each location. We then determine the contribution by each of the cosmic web components to the local gravitational and tidal forces. We find that filaments are, by far, the dominant dynamical component in the interior of filaments, in the majority of underdense void regions and in all wall regions. The gravitational influence of cluster nodes is limited, and they are only dominant in their immediate vicinity. The force field induced by voids is marked by divergent outflowing patterns, yielding the impression of a segmented volume in which voids push matter towards their boundaries. Voids manifest themselves strongly in the tidal field as a cellular tapestry that is closely linked to the multiscale cosmic web. However, even within the interior of voids, the dynamical influence of the surrounding filaments is stronger than the outward push by voids. Therefore, the dynamics of voids cannot be understood without taking into account the influence of the environment. We conclude that filaments constitute the overpowering gravitational agent of the cosmic web, while voids are responsible for the cosmic web's spatial organisation and hence of its spatial connectivity.

          Dust rings trap protoplanets on eccentric orbits and get consumed by them

 - **Abstract**
 We study the orbital evolution and mass growth of protoplanets with masses $M \in [0.1-8]$~M$_\oplus$ in the vicinity of a dusty ring, using three-dimensional numerical simulations with a two-fluid model and nested-meshes. We find two stable, eccentric orbits that lock the planet in the ring vicinity, thereby inhibiting its migration and allowing it to accrete dust from the ring. One of these orbits has an eccentricity comparable to the aspect ratio of the gaseous disc and has its periastron within the ring, enabling intermittent accretion during each pass. The other orbit has a smaller eccentricity and an apoastron slightly inside the ring. A planet locked at the outer orbit efficiently accretes from the ring and can reach the critical mass for runaway gas accretion on timescales $\gtrsim 10^5$ yr (for a 10~M$_\oplus$ dust ring at 10~au) while a planet locked at the inner orbit has a slower growth and might not supersede the super-Earth stage over the disc lifetime. While in our runs a low-mass embryo forming within the ring eventually joins the outer orbit, it is likely that the path taken depends on the specific details of the ring. The trapping on the outer orbit arises from an intermittent, strong thermal force at each passage through the ring, where the accretion rate spikes. It is insensitive to uncertainties that plague models considering planets trapped on circular orbits in rings. It is highly robust and could allow a growing planet to follow an expanding ring over large distances.

 - **Abstract**
 Phase transitions in the early universe lead to a reduction in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. This exponentially enhances the formation rate of primordial black holes. However, this sensitivity to the equation of state is the same that primordial black hole abundances show to the primordial curvature power spectrum amplitude. In this paper, we investigate peaked power spectra and show the challenges associated with motivating populations of primordial black holes with standard model enhancements. The parametrisation of different power spectra plays an important role in this discussion. The allowed parameter space consistent with a large QCD phase transition impact on the primordial black hole abundance differs greatly. This is particularly evident for wider spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous simulations of cataclysmic variables studied either the quiescence, or the outburst state in multiple dimensions or they simulated complete outburst cycles in one dimension using simplified models for the gravitational torques. We self-consistently simulate complete outburst cycles of normal and superoutbursts in cataclysmic variable systems in two dimensions. We study the effect of different $\alpha$ viscosity parameters, mass transfer rates, and binary mass ratios on the disk luminosities, outburst occurrence rates, and superhumps. We simulate non-isothermal, viscous accretion disks in cataclysmic variable systems using a modified version of the FARGO code with an updated equation of state and a cooling function designed to reproduce s-curve behavior. Our simulations can model complete outburst cycles using the thermal tidal instability model. We find higher superhump amplitudes and stronger gravitational torques than previous studies, resulting in better agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and future large-scale structure surveys aim to constrain cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision by analyzing vast amounts of data. This imposes a pressing need to develop fast and accurate methods for computing the matter power spectrum $P(k)$, or equivalently, the matter transfer function $T(k)$. In previous works, we introduced precise fitting formulas for these quantities within the standard cosmological model, including extensions such as the presence of massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. However, these formulations overlooked a key characteristic imprinted in $P(k)$: the baryon acoustic oscillation signal. Here, we leverage our understanding of the well-known physics behind this oscillatory pattern to impose constraints on our genetic algorithm, a machine learning technique. By employing this ``physics-informed'' approach, we introduce an expression that accurately describes the matter transfer function with sub-percent mean accuracy. The high interpretability of the output allows for straightforward extensions of this formulation to other scenarios involving massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. We anticipate that this formula will serve as a competitive fitting function for $P(k)$, meeting the accuracy requirements essential for cosmological analyses.

          Testing the interacting dark energy model in a phenomenological scenario with gamma-ray bursts and Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we utilize recent observational data from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Pantheon+ Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) sample to explore the interacting Dark Energy (IDE) model in a phenomenological scenario. Results from GRBs-only, SNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of H0 from GRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement. Considering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at z = 3.91, we find that the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than that of the {\Lambda}CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program ``AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks''. The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1), $^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of $\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\prime \prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\prime \prime}$ (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\sigma$) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of $\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular resolution $\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\sim 0.875^{\prime \prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.

          Robust Preference for Dynamical Dark Energy in DESI BAO and SN Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and two different samples of Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon-Plus and DESY5) reveal a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) characterized by a present-day quintessence-like equation of state that crossed into the phantom regime in the past. A core ansatz for this result is assuming a linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$ to describe the evolution of the DE equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we test if and to what extent this assumption impacts the results. To prevent broadening uncertainties in cosmological parameter inference and facilitate direct comparison with the baseline CPL case, we focus on 4 alternative well-known models that, just like CPL, consist of only two free parameters: the present-day DE EoS ($w_0$) and a parameter quantifying its dynamical evolution ($w_a$). We demonstrate that the preference for DDE remains robust regardless of the parameterization: $w_0$ consistently remains in the quintessence regime, while $w_a$ consistently indicates a preference for a dynamical evolution towards the phantom regime. This tendency is significantly strengthened by DESY5 SN measurements. By comparing the best-fit $\chi^2$ obtained within each DDE model, we notice that the linear CPL parameterization is not the best-fitting case. Among the models considered, the EoS proposed by Barboza and Alcaniz consistently leads to the most significant improvement.
