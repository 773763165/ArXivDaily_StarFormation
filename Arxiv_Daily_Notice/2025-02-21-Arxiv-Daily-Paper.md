          Calibrating chemical mixing induced by internal gravity waves based on hydrodynamical simulations; The chemical evolution of OB-type stars

 - **Abstract**
 Internal gravity waves (IGWs) have been shown to contribute to the transport of chemical elements in stars with a convective core and radiative envelope. Recent 2D hydrodynamical simulations of convection in intermediate-mass stars have provided estimates of the chemical mixing efficiency of such waves. The chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing is described by a constant A times the squared wave velocity. The value of A, however, remains unconstrained by such simulations. This work aims at investigating what values A can take in order to reproduce the observed nitrogen surface abundances of the most nitrogen-enriched massive stars. Furthermore, we discuss the prevalence of IGW mixing compared to rotational mixing. We provide an implementation of these mixing profiles predicted from hydrodynamical simulations in the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We compute evolution tracks for stars between 3 and 30Msun with this new implementation for IGW mixing and study the evolution for the surface abundances of isotopes involved in the CNO cycle, particularly the N14 isotope. We show that this 1D framework predicting the chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing yields consistent morphologies of the mixing profile in comparison with hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the value of A must increase with mass in order to reproduce the most nitrogen-enriched stars. Assuming these calibrated values for A, mixing by IGWs is a potential mechanism to reproduce well-mixed stars without needing rapid rotation. We have provided observational limits on the efficiency of IGW mixing for future theoretical studies. Future asteroseismic modelling efforts taking IGW mixing into account will be able to place additional constraints on the convective core mass, as our models predict that the convective core should be significantly more massive if IGW mixing is indeed efficient.

          Discovery of the variable optical counterpart of the redback pulsar PSR J2055+1545

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of the variable optical counterpart to PSR J2055+1545, a redback millisecond pulsar, and the first radial velocity curve of its companion star. The multi-band optical light curves of this system show a $0.4$$-$$0.6 \ \mathrm{mag}$ amplitude modulation with a single peak per orbit and variable colours, suggesting that the companion is mildly irradiated by the pulsar wind. We find that the flux maximum is asymmetric and occurs at orbital phase $\simeq0.4$, anticipating the superior conjunction of the companion (where the optical emission of irradiated redback companions is typically brightest). We ascribe this asymmetry, well fit with a hot spot in our light curve modelling, to irradiation from the intrabinary shock between pulsar and companion winds. The optical spectra obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} reveal a G-dwarf companion star with temperatures of $5749 \pm 34 \ \mathrm{K}$ and $6106 \pm 35 \ \mathrm{K}$ at its inferior and superior orbital conjunctions, respectively, and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of $385 \pm 3 \ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Our best-fit model yields a neutron star mass of $1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \ \mathrm{M_{sun}}$ and a companion mass of $0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.01} \ \mathrm{M_{sun}}$. Based on the close similarity between the optical light curve of PSR~J2055$+$1545 and those observed from PSR J1023+0038 and PSR J1227-4853 during their rotation-powered states, we suggest this system may develop an accretion disc in the future and manifest as a transitional millisecond pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. (469219) Kamo`oalewa is a small near-Earth asteroid, which is currently a quasi-satellite of the Earth. Lightcurve measurements also reveal a rotation period of only about 30 minutes. This asteroid has been selected as the target of the Tianwen-2 sample-return mission of the China National Space Administration. Aims. The first goal of this paper is to observe and improve the orbit determination of (469219) Kamo`oalewa, and better determine the Yarkovsky effect acting on it. The second goal is to estimate the thermal inertia of the asteroid, taking advantage of an improved Yarkovsky effect determination. Methods. Our observational campaign imaged the asteroid from the Loiano Astronomical Station and from the Calar Alto Observatory, in March 2024. We also accurately re-measured a precovery detection from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from 2004. New astrometry was later used in a 7-dimensional orbit determination, aimed at estimating both the orbital elements and the Yarkovsky effect. Thermal inertia is later studied by using the ASTERIA, a new method that is suitable to estimate thermal inertia of small asteroids. Results. We detected a semi-major axis drift of $(-67.35 \pm 4.70) \times 10^{-4}$ au My$^{-1}$ due to the Yarkovsky effect, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 14. The new orbit solution also significantly reduced the position uncertainty for the arrival of the Tianwen-2 spacecraft. By using different models for the physical parameters of Kamo`oalewa, the ASTERIA model estimated the thermal inertia at $\Gamma = 150^{+90}_{-45}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$ or $\Gamma = 181^{+95}_{-60}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 As bound stellar systems orbit within a galaxy, stars may be tidally stripped to form streams of stars that nearly follow the orbit of their progenitor system. Stellar streams provide one of the most promising avenues for constraining the global mass distribution of the Milky Way and the nature of dark matter (DM). The stream stars' kinematic "track" enables inferring large-scale properties of the DM distribution, while density variations and anomalies provide information about local DM clumps (e.g., from DM subhalos). Using precise astrometric data from the Gaia Mission, which enables clean selections of Milky Way stream stars, we now know of a few streams with perturbations and density anomalies. A full accounting of the density tracks and substructures within all >100 Milky Way stellar streams will therefore enable powerful new constraints on DM. However, methods for discovering and characterizing membership of streams are heterogeneous and often highly customized to individual streams. Here we present a new, flexible framework for modeling stellar stream density and membership. Our framework allows us to include off-track or non-Gaussian components to the stream density, meaning we can capture anomalous features (such as the GD-1 steam's spur). We test our model on GD-1, where we characterize previously-known features and provide the largest catalog of probable member stars to date (1689 stars). Our framework (built on JAX and numpyro) provides a path toward uniform analysis of all Milky Way streams, enabling tight constraints on the Galactic mass distribution and its dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid advancement of large-scale cosmological simulations has opened new avenues for cosmological and astrophysical research. However, the increasing diversity among cosmological simulation models presents a challenge to the robustness. In this work, we develop the Model-Insensitive ESTimator (MIEST), a machine that can robustly estimate the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, from neural hydrogen maps of simulation models in the CAMELS project$-$TNG, SIMBA, ASTRID, and EAGLE. An estimator is considered robust if it possesses a consistent predictive power across all simulations, including those used during the training phase. We train our machine using multiple simulation models and ensure that it only extracts common features between the models while disregarding the model-specific features. This allows us to develop a novel model that is capable of accurately estimating parameters across a range of simulation models, without being biased towards any particular model. Upon the investigation of the latent space$-$a set of summary statistics, we find that the implementation of robustness leads to the blending of latent variables across different models, demonstrating the removal of model-specific features. In comparison to a standard machine lacking robustness, the average performance of MIEST on the unseen simulations during the training phase has been improved by $\sim17$% for $\Omega_m$ and $\sim 38$% for $\sigma_8$. By using a machine learning approach that can extract robust, yet physical features, we hope to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in a (subgrid) model-insensitive manner, and ultimately, gain insight into the underlying physical processes responsible for robustness.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion is the dominant contribution to the cosmic massive black hole density in the Universe today. Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is challenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to black hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for gas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in large-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the "Learning the Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial conditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we update the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based inflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple model for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive black hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters. Once the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly similar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the details in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole regime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion mechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high redshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high redshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies and mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same black hole formation model.

          Learning the Universe: $3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ Tests of a Field Level $N$-body Simulation Emulator

 - **Abstract**
 We apply and test a field-level emulator for non-linear cosmic structure formation in a volume matching next-generation surveys. Inferring the cosmological parameters and initial conditions from which the particular galaxy distribution of our Universe was seeded can be achieved by comparing simulated data to observational data. Previous work has focused on building accelerated forward models that efficiently mimic these simulations. One of these accelerated forward models uses machine learning to apply a non-linear correction to the linear $z=0$ Zeldovich approximation (ZA) fields, closely matching the cosmological statistics in the $N$-body simulation. This emulator was trained and tested at $(h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, although cosmological inference requires significantly larger volumes. We test this emulator at $(3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ by comparing emulator outputs to $N$-body simulations for eight unique cosmologies. We consider several summary statistics, applied to both the raw particle fields and the dark matter (DM) haloes. We find that the power spectrum, bispectrum and wavelet statistics of the raw particle fields agree with the $N$-body simulations within ${\sim} 5 \%$ at most scales. For the haloes, we find a similar agreement between the emulator and the $N$-body for power spectrum and bispectrum, though a comparison of the stacked profiles of haloes shows that the emulator has slight errors in the positions of particles in the highly non-linear interior of the halo. At these large $(3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, the emulator can create $z=0$ particle fields in a thousandth of the time required for $N$-body simulations and will be a useful tool for large-scale cosmological inference. This is a Learning the Universe publication.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 There are a few different mechanisms that can cause white dwarf stars to vary in brightness, providing opportunities to probe the physics, structures, and formation of these compact stellar remnants. The observational characteristics of the three most common types of white dwarf variability are summarized: stellar pulsations, rotation, and ellipsoidal variations from tidal distortion in binary systems. Stellar pulsations are emphasized as the most complex type of variability, which also has the greatest potential to reveal the conditions of white dwarf interiors.

          Dynamics of stellar systems with collisions: eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in nearly collisionless limit

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the decay of perturbations in an infinite homogeneous self-gravitating model with a Maxwellian distribution function (DF) when weak collisions are present. In collisionless systems within the stable parameter range, the eigenvalue spectrum consists of a continuous set of real frequencies associated with van Kampen modes, which are singular eigenfunctions of the stellar DF. An initial perturbation in the stellar density and gravitational potential decays exponentially through a superposition of these modes, a phenomenon known as Landau damping. However, the perturbation in the stellar DF does not decay self-similarly; it becomes increasingly oscillatory in velocity space over time, indicating the absence of eigenfunctions corresponding to the Landau damping eigenfrequencies. Consequently, we refer to perturbations undergoing Landau damping as quasi-modes rather than true eigenmodes. Even rare collisions suppress the formation of steep DF gradients in velocity space. Ng & Bhattacharjee (2021) demonstrated that introducing collisions eliminates van Kampen modes and transforms Landau quasi-modes into true eigenmodes forming a complete set. As the collision frequency approaches zero, their eigenfrequencies converge to those of the collisionless Landau quasi-modes. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the eigenfunction of the least-damped aperiodic mode as the collision frequency approaches zero. We derive analytic expressions for the eigenfunction in the resonance region and for the damping rate as a function of collision frequency. Additionally, we employ the standard matrix eigenvalue problem approach to numerically verify our analytical results.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate visualization of double star astrometric data is essential for effective analysis and interpretation. This article presents a Python toolkit designed for astronomers who need to plot measurements from diverse sources -- historical, Gaia DR3, and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network -- while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio to avoid visually distorting the data. The toolkit is composed of three scripts: one that handles polar coordinates (P.A., separation), one for Cartesian (X, Y) coordinates, and another with the option to include predicted theoretical points. This paper describes the purpose, functionality, and usage of these scripts, including example figures, installation guides, and licensing information. This toolkit has been used by the author and collaborators in published and submitted research on double star systems, demonstrating its versatility for both professional and student-driven investigations.

          Radio observations of the ultra-long GRB 220627A reveal a hot cocoon supporting the blue supergiant progenitor scenario

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the most distant ultra-long gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected to date, GRB~220627A at redshift $z=3.084$. Its prompt gamma-ray light curve shows a double-pulse profile, with the pulses separated by a period of quiescence lasting ${\sim} 15\,$min, leading to early speculation it could be a strongly gravitationally lensed GRB. However, our analysis of the $\textit{Fermi}$/GBM spectra taken during the time intervals of both pulses show clear differences in their spectral energy distributions, disfavouring the lensing scenario. We observed the radio afterglow from $7$ to $456\,$d post-burst: an initial, steep decay ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-2}$) is followed by a shallower decline ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-1/2}$) after ${\sim} 20\,$d. Our afterglow modelling shows that these radio properties can be explained by the presence of a slow, wide ejecta component in addition to a fast, narrow ejecta component, consistent with the picture of a highly-collimated jet and its thermal cocoon decelerating into the ambient medium. The properties of the cocoon point toward a progenitor with a large stellar radius, supporting the blue supergiant scenario proposed for ultra-long GRBs. We also conducted an independent test of the lensing hypothesis via Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at ${\sim} 12\,$d post-burst by searching, for the first time, for multiple images of the candidate lensed GRB afterglow. Our experiment highlighted the growing need for developments in real-time correlation capabilities for time-critical VLBI experiments, particularly as we advance towards the SKA and ngVLA era of radio astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova is a topic of active research. The core of a supernova is an intense source of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Self-interaction among neutrinos (as well as antineutrinos) gives rise to a rich phenomenology not seen in terrestrial situations. In studies of the dynamics of flavor evolution in such environments, the gravitational effects are generally ignored. Although the curvature outside a dense core does not deviate much from a flat space, the spin of the neutrinos can still couple to the torsion of the spacetime. These extra degrees of freedom of curved spacetime have interaction strengths that are proportional to the density of the neutrinos and the other fermions \cite{Chakrabarty:2019cau} \cite{Barick:2023qjq} as well as the coupling constants of the spin-torsion interaction. We have studied the effects of such interactions in flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova \cite{Ghose:Manuscript}. The self-interaction gets modified by the spin-torsion interaction and the oscillation dynamics is modified. We have seen that there are noticeable changes in the flavor dynamics when the neutrino density is uniform. We have also studied the effects of such interaction in a realistic core-collapse supernova (CCSN). As neutrino astronomy enters the precision era, this study will shed light on the potential of neutrino fluxes from CCSN to probe the neutrino-neutrino interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), a special subset of Near-Earth Objects, are both dangerous and scientifically valuable. PHAs that truly undergo close approaches with the Earth (dubbed CAPHAs) are of particular interest and extensively studied. The concept and study of CAPHA can be extended to other Solar system planets, which have significant implications for future planet-based observations and explorations. In this work, we conduct numerical simulations that incorporate the Yarkovsky effect to study the transformation of main belt asteroids into CAPHAs of terrestrial planets, using precise nominal timesteps, especially to ensure the reliability of the results for Mercury and Venus. Our simulations predict a total of 1893 Mercury-CAPHAs, 3014 Venus-CAPHAs, 3791 Earth-CAPHAs and 18066 Mars-CAPHAs, with an occurrence frequency of about 1, 9, 15 and 66 per year, respectively. The values for Mars-CAPHAs are consistent with our previous work, which were based on simulations with a larger nominal timestep. The predicted occurrence frequency and velocity distribution of Earth-CAPHAs are in reasonable agreement with the observed population of Earth-CAPHAs. We also find that certain asteroids can be caught in close approach with different planets at different times, raising an interesting possibility of using them as transportation between terrestrial planets in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs) represent a late evolutionary stage of massive stars. Recent observations reveal that the observed luminosity range of RSGs in young open clusters is wider than expected from single star evolution models. Binary evolution effects have been suggested as a possible explanation. Here, we analyse 3670 detailed binary-evolution models, as well as corresponding single-star models, to probe the contribution of binary mass transfer and binary mergers on the luminosity distribution of RSGs in star clusters with ages up to 100 Myr. We confirm that the expected luminosity range of RSGs in a coeval population can span a factor of ten, as a consequence of mergers between two main-sequence stars, which reproduces the observed red supergiant luminosity ranges in rich clusters well. While the luminosity increase as consequence of mass transfer is more limited, it may help to increase the number of overluminous RSGs. However, our results also demonstrate that binary effects alone are insufficient to account for the number of RSGs found with luminosities of up to three times those predicted by current single-star models. We discuss observational accuracy, rotational mixing, age spread, and intrinsic RSG variability as possible explanations. Further observations of RSGs in young open clusters, in particular studies of their intrinsic brightness variability, appear crucial for disentangling these effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Utilizing the Press-Ryden-Spergel method, we numerically investigate the dynamics of domain walls with lattice simulations. We find notable differences in the dynamics of domain walls due to bias directions. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $\delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years, NICER data has enabled mass and radius inferences for various pulsars, and thus shed light on the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. This is achieved through a technique called pulse profile modeling. The importance of the results necessitates careful validation and testing of the robustness of the inference procedure. In this paper, we investigate the effect of sampler choice for X-PSI (X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference), an open-source package for pulse profile modeling and Bayesian statistical inference that has been used extensively for analysis of NICER data. We focus on the specific case of the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620. Using synthetic data that mimics the most recently analyzed NICER and XMM-Newton data sets of PSR J0740+6620, we evaluate the parameter recovery performance, convergence, and computational cost for MultiNest's multimodal nested sampling algorithm and UltraNest's slice nested sampling algorithm. We find that both samplers perform reliably, producing accurate and unbiased parameter estimation results when analyzing simulated data. We also investigate the consequences for inference using the real data for PSR J0740+6620, finding that both samplers produce consistent credible intervals.

          SEW: A full-spectrum linear fitting with stellar population synthesis method Based on "Equivalent Widths spectrum"

 - **Abstract**
 We present a full-spectrum linear fitting method, SEW, for stellar population synthesis based on equivalent widths (EWs) to extract galaxy properties from observed spectra. This approach eliminates the need for prior assumptions about dust attenuation curves, which are instead derived as outputs of the fitting process. By leveraging the invariance of EWs and employing the Discrete Penalised Least Squares (DPLS) method to extract EWs, we address the nonlinear aspects of the fitting process by linearising the matrix equations. This enables accurate recovery of key parameters, stellar age, metallicity and dust attenuation, even under systematic calibration biases and varying attenuation conditions. Rigorous testing with mock spectra across signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 5-30) and calibration biases demonstrates the robustness of method. The derived attenuation curves align closely with input models, and stellar population parameters are recovered with minimal bias. To facilitate adoption, we implement this method as a Python extension package for \texttt{pPXF} (\texttt{pPXF-SEW}). Our work addresses critical degeneracies in traditional spectral fitting and enhances the reliability of extragalactic studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and represent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems. Due to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the number of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected a sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the Herschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that stands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use molecular lines that trace dense gas (n>=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the exceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and to understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4 transitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We use the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the core's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five lines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very high densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We infer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect several other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also detect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of high-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and the fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing frequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall motions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or as the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO). *SHORTENED*

 - **Abstract**
 We present 83,717,159 light curves for 56,401,549 stars with T < 16 mag observed in the Full-Frame Images (FFIs) of Cycle 1 of the NASA TESS mission. These light curves were extracted from subtracted images produced by the Cluster Difference Imaging Survey (CDIPS; Bouma et al. 2019). We make public the raw image subtraction light curves, together with light curves detrended against instrumental systematics. We compare the light curves to other publicly available light curves from the TESS FFIs, finding that for a substantial fraction of stars with T < 16, the T16 project provides the highest precision FFI light curves available. We demonstrate that the detrended T16 light curves are generally as good as, or better than, the light curves from other projects for the known TOIs. We also show that the un-detrended light curves can be used to study high amplitude variable stars. The light curves are being made available through the NASA Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). Light curve production is underway for additional TESS Cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 The direction of extensive air showers can be used to determine the source of gamma quanta and plays an important role in estimating the energy of the primary particle. The data from an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detector stations HiSCORE in the TAIGA experiment registering the number of photoelectrons and detection time can be used to estimate the shower direction with high accuracy. In this work, we use artificial neural networks trained on Monte Carlo-simulated TAIGA HiSCORE data for gamma quanta to obtain shower direction estimates. The neural networks are multilayer perceptrons with skip connections using partial data from several HiSCORE stations as inputs; composite estimates are derived from multiple individual estimates by the neural networks. We apply a two-stage algorithm in which the direction estimates obtained in the first stage are used to transform the input data and refine the estimates. The mean error of the final estimates is less than 0.25 degrees. The approach will be used for multimodal analysis of the data from several types of detectors used in the TAIGA experiment.

          Examining the Potential for Methyl Halide Accumulation and Detectability in Possible Hycean-Type Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Some sub-Neptune planets may host habitable conditions; for example "Hycean" worlds with H2 envelopes over liquid water oceans can maintain potentially hospitable pressures and temperatures at their surface. Recent JWST observations of K2-18b and TOI-270d have shown that such worlds could be compelling targets for biosignature searches, given their extended scale heights and therefore large atmospheric signatures. Methylated biosignatures, a broad group of gases that can be generated by biological attachment of a CH3 group to an environmental substrate, have been proposed as candidate signs of life for Earth-like exoplanets. However, methyl halides (CH3 + halogen) have not yet been robustly examined with self-consistent photochemical and spectral models for planets with H2-dominated atmospheres. Here we demonstrate that methyl chloride (CH3Cl), predominantly produced by marine microbes, could be detected using JWST in tens of transits or fewer for Hycean planets, comparable to detection requirements for other potential atmospheric biosignatures. The threshold atmospheric mixing ratio for detectability is $\sim$10 ppm, which can accumulate with global fluxes comparable to moderately productive local environments on Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We characterize and quantify this multi-scale flow for a prototypical high-mass star-forming region. Methods: In a multi-scale analysis from parsec to ~50au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric observations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec (Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central cores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution multi-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of 0.027''x0.022'' or 50au. Results: This multi-scale study allows us to follow the gas from the environment of the high-mass star-forming region (~2pc) via intermediate-scale (~0.25pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores within the central few 1000au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect spatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost cores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around 10^-3M_sun/yr, feeding into the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow from the cloud via the filaments down to 10^4au appears relatively ordered, within the central 10^4au the kinematic structures become much more complicated and disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the converging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central protostars. Conclusions: This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies the hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a prototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an unprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a broad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures, likely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the space projects or large observatories do have official tools like simulators, end-to-end pipelines developed during years by a large team of contributors. They are like {\em cathedrals}. In this paper, we show that very simplistic code using basic operators provided by high level language like GDL allows to write quickly high quality code to process raw data into scientifically validated outputs. This is {\em bazaar}. In this paper we argument why we consider large infrastructure should be designed to allow small ones to benefit from it and allow to graft better alternative processing at very low cost.

 - **Abstract**
 Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) are recurring structures in the solar wind, characterized by interactions between fast and slow solar wind streams that compress and heat plasma. This study investigates the polytropic behavior of distinct regions in and around CIRs: uncompressed slow solar wind, compressed slow solar wind, compressed fast solar wind, and uncompressed fast solar wind. Using Wind spacecraft data and an established methodology for calculating the polytropic index ({\gamma}), we analyze 117 CIR events. Results indicate varying {\gamma} values across regions, with heating observed in compressed regions driven by Alfvén wave dissipation originating from fast streams. In the uncompressed fast solar wind, {\gamma} exceeds adiabatic values the most and correlates well with strong Alfvénic wave activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Dipole mode suppression is an observed behavior of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars. This study aims to search for depressed dipole modes in giant stars using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and investigate when the suppression starts to emerge. We study a sample of 8,651 TESS-evolved stars and find 179 stars with significant dipole mode depression by comparing the oscillation amplitudes of radial and dipole modes. Notably, 11 of them are located near the base of the red-giant branch, indicating that mode suppression appears earlier than the point inferred in previous studies with the Kepler data. These findings provide new evidence for the dipole mode suppression in giant stars, particularly in subgiants.

 - **Abstract**
 Microcalorimeter instruments aboard future X-ray observatories will require an anti-coincidence (anti-co) detector to veto charged particle events and reduce the non-X-ray background. We have developed a large-format, TES-based prototype anti-coincidence detector that is particularly suitable for use with spatially-extended (~ 10 cm^2}) TES microcalorimeter arrays, as would be used for a future large field-of-view X-ray missions. This prototype was developed in the context of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM) probe concept, which required a ~ 14 cm^2 anti-co detector with > 95% live time and a low-energy threshold below 20 keV. Our anti-co design employs parallel networks of quasiparticle-trap-assisted electrothermal feedback TESs (QETs) to detect the athermal phonon signal produced in the detector substrate by incident charged particles. We developed multiple prototype anti-co designs featuring 12 channels and up to 6300 QETs. Here we focus on a design utilizing tungsten TESs and present characterization results. Broad energy range measurements have been performed (4.1 keV -- 5.5 MeV). Based on noise and responsivity measurements, the implied low-energy threshold is < 1 keV and a live time fraction of > 96% can be achieved up to 5.5 MeV. We also find evidence of mm-scale-or-better spatial resolution and discuss the potential utility of this for future missions. Finally, we discuss the early development of a soild-state physics model of the anti-co towards understanding phonon propagation and quasiparticle production in the detector.
