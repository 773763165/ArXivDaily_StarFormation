 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the processes of planet formation and accretion in young systems is essential to unraveling the initial conditions of planetary systems. The PDS 70 system, which hosts two directly imaged protoplanets, provides a unique laboratory for studying these phenomena, particularly through H-alpha emission a commonly used accretion tracer. We present multi-epoch observations and examine the variability in accretion signatures within this system, focusing on PDS 70 b and c. Using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband H-alpha imaging from 2020 and 2024, we achieve high signal-to-noise ratio detections of these planets and reveal significant changes in H-alpha flux. For PDS 70 c, the H-alpha flux more than doubled between 2020 and 2024. The trend is consistent with the one identified in recently published MagAO-X data, further confirming that PDS 70 c has become significantly brighter in H between 2023 March and 2024 May. The observed variability suggests dynamic accretion processes, possibly modulated by circumplanetary disk properties or transient accretion bursts. High-amplitude variability in PDS 70 c motivates simultaneous monitoring of multiple accretion tracers to probe the mechanisms of mass growth of gas giant planets. We quantify the impact of variability on the detectability of protoplanets in imaging surveys and emphasize the need for continued and regular monitoring to accurately assess the occurrence and characteristics of young, forming planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Comparing composite models for multi-component observational data is a prevalent scientific challenge. When fitting composite models, there exists the potential for systematics from a poor fit of one model component to be absorbed by another, resulting in the composite model providing an accurate fit to the data in aggregate but yielding biased a posteriori estimates for individual components. We begin by defining a classification scheme for composite model comparison scenarios, identifying two categories: category I, where models with accurate and predictive components are separable through Bayesian comparison of the unvalidated composite models, and category II, where models with accurate and predictive components may not be separable due to interactions between components, leading to spurious detections or biased signal estimation. To address the limitations of category II model comparisons, we introduce the Bayesian Null Test Evidence Ratio-based (BaNTER) validation framework. Applying this classification scheme and BaNTER to a composite model comparison problem in 21-cm cosmology, where minor systematics from imperfect foreground modelling can bias global 21-cm signal recovery, we validate six composite models using mock data. We show that incorporating BaNTER alongside Bayes-factor-based comparison reliably ensures unbiased inferences of the signal of interest across both categories, positioning BaNTER as a valuable addition to Bayesian inference workflows with potential applications across diverse fields.

          Three Years of High-Contrast Imaging of the PDS 70 b and c Exoplanets at Hα with MagAO-X: Evidence of Strong Protoplanet Hα Variability and Circumplanetary Dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present 3 years of high-contrast imaging of the PDS 70 b and c accreting protoplanets with the new extreme AO system MagAO-X as part of the MaxProtoPlanetS survey of H$\alpha$ protoplanets. In 2023 and 2024 our sharp (25-27 mas FWHM); well AO corrected (20-26% Strehl), deep (2-3.6hr) images detect compact (r~30 mas; r~3 au) circumplanetary disks (CPDs) surrounding both protoplanets. Starlight scattering off the dusty outer edges of these CPDs is the likely source of the bright compact continuum light detected within ~30 mas of both planets in our simultaneously obtained continuum 668 nm filter images. After subtraction of contaminating continuum and PSF residuals with pyKLIP ADI and SDI we obtained high-contrast ASDI H$\alpha$ images of both planets in 2022, 2023 and 2024. We find the H$\alpha$ line flux of planet b fell by (8.1$\pm$1.6)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ a factor of 4.6 drop in flux from 2022 to 2023. In March 2024, planet b continued to be faint with just a slight 1.6x rise to an H$\alpha$ line flux of (3.64$\pm$0.87)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. For c we measure a significant increase of (2.74$\pm$0.51)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ from 2023 to 2024 which is a factor of 2.3x increase. So both protoplanets have recently experienced significant H$\alpha$ variability with ~1 yr sampling. In 2024, planet c is brighter than b: as c is brightening and b generally fading. We also tentatively detect one new point source "CC3" inside the inner disk (~49 mas; at PA~295 deg; 2024) with orbital motion roughly consistent with a ~5.6 au orbit.

          New accelerating cosmology without dark energy: The particle creation approach and the reduced relativistic gas

 - **Abstract**
 The standard procedure to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe is to assume the existence of an exotic component with negative pressure, generically called dark energy. Here, we propose a new accelerating flat cosmology without dark energy, driven by the negative creation pressure of a reduced relativistic gas (RRG). When the hybrid dark matter of the RRG is identified with cold dark matter, it describes the so-called CCDM cosmology whose dynamics is equivalent to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at both the background and perturbative levels (linear and nonlinear). This effect is quantified by the creation parameter $\alpha$. However, when the pressure from the RRG slightly changes the dynamics of the universe, as measured by a parameter $b$, the model departs slightly from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Therefore, this two-parametric model ($\alpha, b$) describes a new scenario whose dynamics is different but close to the late-time scenarios predicted by CCDM and $\Lambda$CDM models. The free parameters of the RRG model with creation are constrained based on SNe Ia data (Pantheon+SH0ES) and also using $H(z)$ from cosmic clocks. In principle, this mild distinction in comparison with both CCDM or $\Lambda$CDM may help alleviate some cosmological problems plaguing the current standard cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Current observations indicate that stars with higher rotation rates appear to maintain more surface lithium, and the majority of lithium-rich giants are indeed red clump stars. Hence, we investigate the mechanisms behind lithium enrichment in rotating red clump stars and the pathways to forming lithium-rich red clump stars. Meridional circulation is prevalent in the radiative zone of rotating giants. We model its radial mixing as a diffusion process and derive the corresponding diffusion coefficient based on its material transfer effect. Due to uncertainties in numerical calculations, we consider an average diffusion effect. Additionally, certain limiting conditions for the radial velocity of meridional circulation are incorporated. With varying input rotation velocities, we simulate the lithium evolution for red clump stars with this model. Our results indicate that the material transfer effect due to meridional circulation can efficiently transport beryllium, produced by H burning, into the convective envelope. This meridional circulation can lead to lithium enrichment, with a maximum lithium abundance increment approaching \(3.0\,\rm dex\). Consequently, it is capable of forming both lithium-rich and super lithium-rich red clump stars. The degree of lithium enrichment exhibits a strong positive correlation with the rotation velocity, i.e., faster red clump stars show more surface lithium. Furthermore, our models indicate that lithium-rich red clump stars are relatively young (\(\sim 10^6\,\rm yr\)), which aligns with observation evidences.

 - **Abstract**
 Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.

 - **Abstract**
 The feature of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) is frequently observed in the light curve of solar and stellar flares. In this letter, we investigated the QPP at a shorter period in high-energy channels of HXRs and Ggamma-ray continuum during an X9.0 flare on October 3, 2024 (SOL2024-10-03T12:08). The X9.0 flare was simultaneously measured by the Hard X-ray Imager, the Konus-Wind, and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays. The shorter period center at about 1 s was determined by the fast Fourier transform with a Bayesianbased Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the wavelet analysis method. The restructured images show that the HXR sources are mainly separated into two fragments, regarding as double footpoints. Moreover, the footpoints move significantly during the flare QPP. Our results suggest that the intermittent and impulsive energy releases during the powerful flare are mainly caused by the interaction of hot plasma loops that are rooted in double footpoints. Thus, the flare QPP at a shorter period of about 1 s in HXR and Gamma-ray continuum emissions can be well explained by the interacting loop model.

          Primordial black holes from the ultraslow-roll phase in the inflaton--curvaton mixed field inflation

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a promising candidate for dark matter, as they can form in the very early universe without invoking new particle physics. This work explores PBH formation within a curvaton scenario featuring an ultraslow-roll (USR) phase. An inflaton--curvaton mixed field model is presented, where the inflaton drives early inflation and then transits into the USR phase, amplifying the small-scale curvature perturbation. During inflation, the curvaton generates entropy perturbation, which later converts into curvature perturbation after the curvaton decays in the radiation-dominated era. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we compute the power spectrum of the total primordial curvature perturbation and analyze the relevant non-Gaussianity. Our results show that adding a curvaton field not only has a significant impact on primordial non-Gaussianity, but also introduces more complex inflationary dynamics, even saving the inflaton potentials that generate too low scalar spectral indices. Our model can produce PBHs with mass around $10^{-14}\,M_\odot$ that account for all dark matter, while remaining consistent with current observational constraints.

          The 4-400 GHz Survey for the 32 Class II Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We have compiled the $\sim$4-400 GHz broad spectra of 32 Class II protoplanetary disks in the Taurus-Auriga region, which represents the brightest one-third of sources detected in the submillimeter band in this region. The spectra at >20 GHz frequency can be described with a piecewise function: (1) a power law with a spectral index $\sim$2 at >200 GHz, (2) a power law with spectral index in the range 0.3-4.2 at 20-50 GHz, and (3) a transition region in between these two power laws which can be characterized by a sigmoid function. This suggests that the flux densities at >200 GHz and <50 GHz are dominated by distinct emission components. At >200 GHz, the emission is likely dominated by the optically thick dust thermal emission in the bulk of the disks. In some sources that were not detected at 6.8 GHz or 10 GHz, embedded high-density dust substructures may contribute to a significant fraction of the flux densities at 30-50 GHz, and the spectral indices are mostly consistent with 2.0. Although, at 30-50 GHz, free-free and/or synchrotron emission may be significant, and some sources in our sample have spectral indices < 2.0. Based on these results, we hypothesize that high-density dust substructures (e.g., vortices) are often found in resolved Class II protoplanetary disks, and are a precursor to the formation of kilometer-sized planetesimals and rocky planets. They may not present high contrast at >200 GHz frequencies owing to the high optical depth. To probe these dust substructures, high angular resolution observations at <100 GHz are necessary to distinguish them from free-free and synchrotron emission sources. Otherwise, in the analyses of the spatially unresolved spectra, one needs to simultaneously constrain the flux densities of free-free, synchrotron, and dust emission with the observations at $\sim$5-50 GHz.

 - **Abstract**
 AWSOM-type models (Van der Holst et al. 2014) have been very successful in describing the solar atmosphere by incorporating the Alfven wave driving as extra contributions in the global MHD equations. However, they lack the contributions from other wave modes. In this paper, we aim to write governing equations for the energy evolution equation of kink waves. In a similar manner as AWSOM, we combine the kink wave evolution equation with MHD. Our goal is to incorporate the extra heating provided by the uniturbulent damping of the kink waves. We attempt to construct the UAWSOM equations (uniturbulence and Alfven wave driven solar models). We have recently described the MHD equations in terms of the Q-variables. These latter variables allow to follow the evolution of waves in a co-propagating reference frame. We transform the Q-variable MHD equations into an energy evolution equation. First we do this generally, and then we specialise to the description of kink waves. We also couple this evolution equation to the slowly varying MHD formulation and solve the system in 1D. We find that the kink wave energy evolution equation contains non-linear terms, even in the absence of counterpropagating waves. The non-linear damping is expressed solely through equilibrium parameters, rather than an ad-hoc perpendicular correlation term, as in the case of the AWSOM models. A proof-of-concept numerical implementation in python shows that the kink wave driving indeed leads to radial outflow and heating. Thus, UAWSOM may have the necessary ingredients to drive the solar wind and heat the solar corona against losses. Not only does our current work constitute a pathway to fix shortcomings in heating and wind driving in the popular AWSOM model, it also provides the mathematical formalism to incorporate more wave modes for additional driving of the solar wind.

          Do Short GRBs Exhibit an Anticorrelation between Their Intrinsic Duration and Redshift?

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are violent stellar explosions that are traditionally divided into two groups: short bursts (SGRBs) with an observed duration T90 < 2 s, and long bursts (LGRBs) with an observed duration T90 > 2 s, where T90 refers to the time needed for 90% of the fluence to be detected. Studies of progenitor models suggest that LGRBs emanate from the core collapse of massive stars, while SGRBs result from the merging of two compact objects, like two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Recent studies have found evidence that there is an anticorrelation between the intrinsic duration and the redshift of long GRBs. In this study, we first check whether LGRBs exhibit an anticorrelation between their intrinsic duration and redshift using an expanded dataset of long bursts that we have compiled. Next, we investigate whether this anticorrelation applies to SGRBs as well using a sample of short GRBs that we have compiled. Our analysis confirms the results obtained by previous studies regarding the anticorrelation for LGRBs. On the other hand, our results indicate that short GRBs do not exhibit such an anticorrelation. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of how metallicity evolves with redshift and the role that it might play in the aforementioned anticorrelation.

          TOI-512: Super-Earth transiting a K-type star discovered by TESS and ESPRESSO

 - **Abstract**
 One of the goals of the ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTOs) at the ESO 8.2m telescope is to follow up on candidate planets from transit surveys such as the TESS mission. High-precision radial velocities are required to characterize small exoplanets. Aims. We intend to confirm the existence of a transiting super-Earth around the bright (V=9.74) K0-type star TOI-512 (TIC 119292328) and provide a characterization. Combining photometric data from TESS and 37 high-resolution spectroscopic observations from ESPRESSO in a joint Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, we determined the planetary parameters of TOI-512b and characterized its internal structure. We find that TOI-512b is a super-Earth, with a radius of $1.54 \pm 0.10$ R$_\oplus$ and mass of $3.57_{-0.55}^{+0.53}$~M$_\oplus$, on a $7.19_{-6.1\cdot 10^{-5}}^{+7\cdot 10^{-5}}$ day orbit. This corresponds to a bulk density of $5.62_{-1.28}^{+1.59}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Our interior structure analysis presents a small inner core representing $0.13^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ of the solid mass fraction for the planet, surrounded by a mantle with a mass fraction of $0.69^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$, and an upper limit of the water layer of $0.16$. The gas mass below $10^{-8.93}$ indicates a very small amount of gas on the planet. We find no evidence of the second candidate found by the TESS pipeline, TOI-512.02, neither in TESS photometry, nor in the ESPRESSO radial velocities. The low stellar activity makes it an interesting transmission spectroscopy candidate for future-generation instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Current- and next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments will measure polarization anisotropies with unprecedented sensitivities. The need for high precision in these measurements underscores the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of instrument properties, with a particular emphasis on the study of the beam properties and, in particular, their polarization characteristics, and the measurement of the polarization angle. In this context, a major challenge lies in the scarcity of millimeter polarized astrophysical sources with sufficient brightness and calibration knowledge to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of future CMB missions. This led to the development of a drone-borne calibration source designed for frequency band centered on approximately 90 GHz band, matching a commonly used channel in ground based CMB measurements. The PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, has undergone thorough in-lab testing, and its properties have been subsequently modeled through simulation software integrated into the standard Simons Observatory (SO) analysis pipeline. Moreover, the PROTOCALC system has been tested in the field, having been deployed twice on calibration campaigns with CMB telescopes in the Atacama desert. The data collected constrain the roll angle of the source with a statistical accuracy of $0.045^\circ$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spectral and temporal properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary MAXI J1820+070 during the 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT observations. The outburst of MAXI J1820+070 can be divided into three intervals. For the two intervals of the outburst, we find that low-energy (below 140 keV) photos lag high-energy (140-170 keV) ones, while in the decay of the outburst, high-energy photons lag low-energy photons, both with a time scale of the order of days. Based on these results, the canonical hysteresis effect of the 'q' shape in the hardness-intensity diagram can be reformed into a roughly linear shape by taking into account the lag corrections between different energy bands. Time analysis shows that the high-frequency break of hard X-rays, derived from the power density spectrum of the first interval of the outburst is, in general, larger and more variable than that of soft X-rays. The spectral fitting shows that the coverage fraction of the hard X-rays drops sharply at the beginning of the outburst to around 0.5, then increases slightly. The coverage fraction drops to roughly zero once the source steps into a soft state and increases gradually to unity when the source returns to a low hard state. We discuss the possible overall evolution scenario of corona hinted from these discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum nature of gravity remains one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics, with many unified theories predicting variations in fundamental constants across space and time. Here we present precise measurements of these variations at galactic dynamical timescales - a critical but previously unexplored regime. Using simultaneous observations of H \textsc{i} and OH lines in M31, we probe potential variations of fundamental constants at a lookback time of 2.5 million years. We obtained $\Delta(\mu\alpha^2g_p^{0.64})/(\mu\alpha^2g_p^{0.64}) < 3.6 \times 10^{-6}$, with complementary constraints on $\Delta(\mu\alpha^2)/(\mu\alpha^2) < 4.6 \times 10^{-3}$, and $\Delta g_p/g_p < 7.2 \times 10^{-3}$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $\mu$ is the proton-electron mass ratio, and $g_p$ is the proton $g$-factor. These results bridge the gap between laboratory tests and cosmological observations, providing unique insights into the coupling between local dynamics and fundamental physics. Our findings challenge theories predicting significant variations over galactic timescales, while demonstrating a powerful new probe of quantum gravity models.

          A primordial origin to cosmic tensions: towards a joint solution to the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with early dark energy and scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension between direct measurements of the expansion rate and the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model calibrated on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), is a strong motivation to explore alternative cosmological models. A popular class of such models includes an additional component of dark energy relevant in the early Universe, which solves the Hubble tension. These Early Dark Energy (EDE) models however typically worsen the $S_8$ tension between measurements of weak gravitational lensing and the $\Lambda$CDM expectation. Here, we show how combining EDE with scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities (sPNG) can in principle solve both tensions at once. Such sPNG are related to non-trivial inflationary physics, and observationally affect the non-linear regime of structure formation while leaving the linear regime mostly untouched. Depending on the amplitude of the sPNG, such models can either yield back the $\Lambda$CDM expectation for the PS in the non-linear regime, and hence an $S_8$ parameter compatible with $\Lambda$CDM, or can even reconcile the value of $S_8$ from weak-lensing measurements with the CMB, while solving the Hubble tension in all cases. In such models, both tensions would then be entirely related to pre-CMB physics of the early Universe.

 On a centennial timescale, solar activity was quantified based on records of instrumental sunspot observations. This article briefly discusses several aspects of the recent archival investigations of historical sunspot records in the 17th to 18th centuries. This article also reviews the recent updates for the active day fraction and positions of the reported sunspot groups of the Maunder Minimum to show their significance within the observational history.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential that induces a smooth shift in the effective cosmological constant (CC), encompassing transitions such as AdS-dS, 0-dS, and dS-dS, with the mirror AdS-dS as a particular case aligned with the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. In our construction, a phantom scalar field with a negative kinetic term drives a bottom-up transition from an AdS-like vacuum at high redshifts to a dS-like vacuum at low redshifts, thereby providing a physical underpinning for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. Our numerical integration of the equations of motion shows that the model is consistent with both CMB data and the SH0ES determination of $H_0$, thereby addressing the $H_0$ tension, with all key kinematical parameters-$H(z)$, $\dot{H}(z)$, and $q(z)$-evolving smoothly. The total energy density of the phantom and matter system remains positive at all times, and the effective EoS stays above -1, ensuring that the WEC is satisfied. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. We perform analysis of the transition period, demonstrating that the evolution of the DE density from a negative CC-like regime to a positive one does not exactly mirror the behavior of the potential-e.g., it lasts longer-as it also involves the kinetic term. We also show that analogous quintessence models featuring dS-dS transitions predict an $H_0$ value lower than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby failing to address the $H_0$ tension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} > 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the ``bulging'' distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the ``lopsided'' distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 This review provides an observational perspective on the fundamental properties of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes in quasars. It begins by outlining the selection criteria, particularly focusing on optical and UV broad-line intensity ratios, used to identify a population of unobscured super-Eddington candidates. Several defining features place these candidates at the extreme end of the Population A in main sequence of quasars: among them are the highest observed singly-ionized iron emission, extreme outflow velocities in UV resonance lines, and unusually high metal abundances. These key properties reflect the coexistence of a virialized sub-system within the broad-line region alongside powerful outflows, with the observed gas enrichment likely driven by nuclear or circumnuclear star formation. The most compelling evidence for the occurrence of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes comes from recent observations of massive black holes at early cosmic epochs. These black holes require rapid growth rates that are only achievable through radiatively inefficient super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, extreme Eddington ratios, close to or slightly exceeding unity, are consistent with the saturation of radiative output per unit mass predicted by accretion disk theory for super-Eddington accretion rates. The extreme properties of super-Eddington candidates suggest that these quasars could make them stable and well-defined cosmological distance indicators, leveraging the correlation between broad-line width and luminosity expected in virialized systems. Finally, several analogies with accretion processes around stellar-mass black holes, particularly in the high/soft state, are explored to provide additional insight into the mechanisms driving super-Eddington accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets generate accretion luminosity as they form. Much of this energy is radiated in strong H$\alpha$ line emission, which has motivated direct imaging surveys at optical wavelengths to search for accreting protoplanets. However, compact disk structures can mimic accreting planets by scattering emission from the host star. This can complicate the interpretation of H$\alpha$ point sources, especially if the host star itself is accreting. We describe an approach to distinguish accreting protoplanets from scattered-light disk features using "accretion light echoes." This method relies on variable H$\alpha$ emission from a stochastically accreting host star to search for a delayed brightness correlation with a candidate protoplanet. We apply this method to the candidate protoplanet AB Aur b with a dedicated Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 program designed to sequentially sample the host star and the candidate planet in H$\alpha$ while accounting for the light travel time delay and orbital geometry of the source within the protoplanetary disk. Across five epochs spanning 14 months, AB Aur b is over 20 times more variable than its host star; AB Aur's H$\alpha$ emission changes by 15% while AB Aur b varies by 330%. These brightness changes are not correlated, which rules out unobstructed scattered starlight from the host star as the only source of AB Aur b's H$\alpha$ emission and is consistent with tracing emission from an independently accreting protoplanet, inner disk shadowing effects, or a physically evolving compact disk structure. More broadly, accretion light echoes offer a novel tool to explore the nature of protoplanet candidates with well-timed observations of the host star prior to deep imaging in H$\alpha$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, the parameter quantifying the amplitude of local Primordial Non-Gaussianities (PNG), from a combined analysis of the tree-level power spectrum and bispectrum of Data Release $16$ (DR16) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) quasar sample. In our analysis, we use the power spectrum measured with the optimal redshift weights that maximize the local PNG information together with the bispectrum estimated with the standard Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock weights. In the modeling, we incorporate the global and radial integral constraint corrections both in the power spectrum and in the bispectrum, for which we observe that only the radial integral constraint correction has a significant impact. Our constraints read $-6 < f_{\rm NL} < 20$ at $68\%$ confidence level and improve by $\sim 16\%$ over the previous power spectrum analysis of the same dataset. We observe the same improvement over the power spectrum analysis when the quasar response to PNG is lower. In this case, we find $-23 < f_{\rm NL} < 14$ at $68\%$ confidence level. Our findings are consistent with the Fisher matrix expectations.

 - **Abstract**
 Voronoi diagrams are essential geometrical structures with numerous applications, particularly astrophysics-driven finite volume methods. While serial algorithms for constructing these entities are well-established, parallel construction remains challenging. This is especially true in distributed memory systems, where each host manages only a subset of the input points. This process requires redistributing points across hosts and accurately computing the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed construction algorithm, which is implemented in our open-source C++ 3-dimensional Voronoi construction framework. Our approach leverages Delaunay triangulation as an intermediate step, which is then transformed into a Voronoi diagram. We introduce the algorithms we implemented for the precise construction and our load-balancing approach and compare the running time with other state-of-the-art frameworks. MadVoro is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scientific domains, such as mesh decomposition, computational physics, chemistry, and machine learning.

          Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. In this paper, we compute full bispectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated during a contracting phase in a general bounce model. The general bounce model consists of two branches: one realizes scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes become constant on superhorizon scales, as in de Sitter inflation, while the other realizes scale-invariant power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes grow on superhorizon scales, as in matter bounce cosmology. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in these two branches. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of non-Gaussianities and find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. In particular, one of the branches in which the superhorizon perturbations are conserved reproduces the so-called Maldacena's consistency relation. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate predictions of weak lensing observables are essential for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and probing the nature of gravity. In this work, we present a lightcone implementation to generate maps of the weak lensing convergence field using the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method. The lightcone is constructed in spherical shells from the source to the observer following an onion representation of the Universe. We validate the COLA-generated convergence maps in General Relativity by comparing five statistics to those of maps obtained with the high-resolution $N$-body simulations presented in Takahashi $et\ al.$ (2017): the power spectrum, bispectrum, probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals. The convergence power spectrum is accurate to within $5\%$ up to $\ell\sim500$ and to within $10\%$ up to $\ell\sim750$, confirming the accuracy of this method on both linear and non-linear scales. For the probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals, we determine the map pixel resolution required for COLA to capture the statistical features of the $N$-body convergence maps. Our validation tests provide a baseline for the convergence map specifications at which we can trust COLA for each statistic considered. Using these map specifications, we extend our analyses to two representative theories of Modified Gravity, and demonstrate their imprints on the five convergence statistics considered. This work represents a step towards precise weak lensing predictions under both General Relativity and Modified Gravity with reduced computational cost, providing a robust framework to explore the nature of gravity using field-level inference.
