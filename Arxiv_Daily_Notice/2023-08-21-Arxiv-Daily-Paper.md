#### Dynamical masses across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

 - **Abstract**
 We infer the dynamical masses of stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram using wide binaries from the Gaia survey. Gaia's high-precision astrometry measures the wide binaries' orbital motion, which contains the mass information. Using wide binaries as the training sample, we measure the mass of stars across the two-dimensional H-R diagram using the combination of statistical inference and neural networks. Our results provide the dynamical mass measurements for main-sequence stars from 0.1 to 2 M$_\odot$, unresolved binaries and unresolved triples on the main sequence, and the mean masses of giants and white dwarfs. Two regions in the H-R diagram show interesting behaviors in mass, where one of them is pre-main-sequence stars, and the other one may be related to close compact object companions like M dwarf-white dwarf binaries. These mass measurements depend solely on Newtonian dynamics, providing independent constraints on stellar evolutionary models and the occurrence rate of compact objects.
#### Fast computation of non-Gaussian covariance of redshift-space galaxy  power spectrum multipoles

 - **Abstract**
 The non-Gaussian part of the covariance matrix of the galaxy power spectrum involves the connected four-point correlation in Fourier space, i.e. trispectrum. This paper introduces a fast method to compute the non-Gaussian part of the covariance matrix of the galaxy power spectrum multipoles in redshift space at tree-level standard perturbation theory. For the tree-level galaxy trispectrum, the angular integral between two wavevectors can be evaluated analytically by employing an FFTLog. The new implementation computes the non-Gaussian covariance of the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole, hexadecapole and their cross-covariance in O(10) seconds, for an effectively arbitrary number of instances of cosmological and galaxy bias parameters and redshift, without any parallelization or acceleration. It is a large advantage over conventional numerical integration. We demonstrate that the computation of the covariance at k = 0.005 - 0.4 h/Mpc gives results with 0.1 - 1% accuracy. The efficient computation of the analytic covariance can be useful for future galaxy surveys, especially utilizing multi-tracer analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, there has been a remarkable development of simulation-based inference (SBI) algorithms, and they have now been applied across a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological analyses. There are a number of key advantages to these methods, centred around the ability to perform scalable statistical inference without an explicit likelihood. In this work, we propose two technical building blocks to a specific sequential SBI algorithm, truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE). In particular, first we develop autoregressive ratio estimation with the aim to robustly estimate correlated high-dimensional posteriors. Secondly, we propose a slice-based nested sampling algorithm to efficiently draw both posterior samples and constrained prior samples from ratio estimators, the latter being instrumental for sequential inference. To validate our implementation, we carry out inference tasks on three concrete examples: a toy model of a multi-dimensional Gaussian, the analysis of a stellar stream mock observation, and finally, a proof-of-concept application to substructure searches in strong gravitational lensing. In addition, we publicly release the code for both the autoregressive ratio estimator and the slice sampler.
#### Star formation in the centre of NGC 1808 as observed by ALMA
 - **Authors:** Guangwen Chen, George J. Bendo, Gary A. Fuller, Christian Henkel, Xu Kong

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08598
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08598
 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 85.69 and 99.02 GHz continuum emission and H42$\alpha$ and H40$\alpha$ lines emission from the central 1~kpc of NGC 1808. These forms of emission are tracers of photoionizing stars but unaffected by dust obscuration that we use to test the applicability of other commonly star formation metrics. An analysis of the spectral energy distributions shows that free-free emission contributes about 60 to 90 per cent of the continuum emission in the 85-100 GHz frequency range, dependent on the region. The star formation rate (SFR) derived from the ALMA free-free emission is $3.1\pm0.3$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. This is comparable to the SFRs measured from the infrared emission, mainly because most of the bolometric energy from the heavily obscured region is emitted as infrared emission. The radio 1.5~GHz emission yields a SFR 25 per cent lower than the ALMA value, probably because of the diffusion of the electrons producing the synchrotron emission beyond the star-forming regions. The SFRs measured from the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ line emission are about 40 to 65 per cent of the SFR derived from the ALMA data, likely because this metric was not calibrated for high extinction regions. Some SFRs based on extinction-corrected ultraviolet emission are similar to those from ALMA and infrared data, but given that the ultraviolet terms in the extinction correction equations are very small, these metrics seem inappropriate to apply to this dusty starburst.
#### BCG alignment with the Locations of Cluster Members and the Large Scale  Structure out to 10 R$_{200}$

 - **Abstract**
 Using a sample of $>200$ clusters, each with typically $100-200$ spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, we search for a signal of alignment between the Position Angle (PA) of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and the distribution of cluster members on the sky about the cluster centre out to projected distances of 3~R$_{200}$. The deep spectroscopy, combined with corrections for spectroscopic incompleteness, makes our sample ideal to determine alignment signal strengths. We also use an SDSS based skeleton of the filamentary Large Scale Structure (LSS), and measure BCG alignment with the location of the LSS skeleton segments on the sky out to projected distances of 10~R$_{200}$. The alignment signal is measured using three separate statistical measures; Rao's spacing test (U), Kuiper's V parameter (V), and the Binomial probability test (P). The significance of the BCG alignment signal with both cluster members and LSS segments is extremely high (1 in a million chance or less to be drawn randomly from a uniform distribution). We investigate a wide set of parameters that may influence the strength of the alignment signal. Clusters with more elliptical-shaped BCGs show stronger alignment with both their cluster members and LSS segments. Also, selecting clusters with closely connected filaments, or using a luminosity-weighted LSS skeleton, increases the alignment signal significantly. Alignment strength decreases with increasing projected distance. Combined, these results provide strong evidence for the growth of clusters and their BCGs by preferential feeding along the direction of the filaments in which they are embedded.
#### $G$ Objects and primordial black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08623
 - **Abstract**
 We suggest that "$G$ objects" recently discovered in the Galactic Center may be clouds of gas bound by the gravitational field of stellar-mass black holes produced in the interactions of sublunar primordial black holes with neutron stars. If dark matter is composed of primordial black holes with masses $(10^{-16} - 10^{-10}) M_\odot$, these black holes can be captured by neutron stars in the Galactic Center, where the dark matter density is high. After the capture, the neutron star is consumed by the black hole, resulting in a population of $(1-2) M_\odot $ black holes. These stellar-mass black holes, accompanied by gaseous atmospheres, can account for the observed properties of the $G$ objects, including their resilience to tidal disruption by the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center while also producing emission consistent with inferred luminosities.
#### MWC 656 is unlikely to contain a black hole

 - **Abstract**
 Context. MWC 656 was reported as the first known Be star with a black-hole (BH) companion in a 60 d period. The mass of the proposed BH companion is estimated to be between 4 - 7 MSun. This estimate is based on radial velocity (RV) measurements derived from the Fe ii 4583 emission line of the Be star disc and from the He ii 4686 emission line, assumed to be formed in a disc around the putative BH. Aims. Using new high-resolution spectroscopic data, we investigate whether MWC 656 truly contains a BH. Methods. We used the cross-correlation method to calculate the RVs of both the Be star and the He ii 4686 emission line and we derive a new orbital solution. We also performed disentangling to look for the spectral signature of a companion. Results. We derive an orbital period of 59.028 +- 0.011 d and a mass ratio q = M_Heii/M_Be = 0.12 +- 0.03, much lower than the previously reported q = 0.41 +- 0.07. Adopting a mass of the Be star of M_Be = 7.8 +- 2.0MSun, the companion has a mass of 0.94 +- 0.34MSun. For the upper limit of M_Be = 16MSun and q = 0.15, the companion has a mass 2.4MSun. Performing disentangling on mock spectra shows that the spectral signature of a non-degenerate stellar companion with such a low mass cannot be retrieved using our data. Conclusions. Our measurements do not support the presence of a BH companion in MWC 656. The derived upper limit on the mass of the companion rather indicates that it is a neutron star, a white dwarf, or a hot helium star. Far-UV data will help to reject or confirm a hot helium-star companion.
#### Nuclear and Orbital Characterization of the Transition Object (4015)  107P/Wilson-Harrington

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 107P/Wilson-Harrington, cross-listed as asteroid 4015, is one of the original transition objects whose properties do not neatly fit into a cometary or asteroidal origin. Discovered in a period of apparently gas-dominated activity in 1949, it was subsequently lost and recovered as the inactive asteroid 1979 VA. We obtained new and re-analyzed archival observations of the object, compared to meteorites, and conducted new orbital integrations in order to understand the nature of this object and to understand where it falls on the asteroid-comet continuum. Wilson-Harrington's reflectance spectrum is approximately neutral from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, but has a reflectance maximum near 0.8-0.9 microns. The object's spectrum is well matched by laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites like the CM Murchison or the CI Ivuna. The object's phase curve is compatible with either an asteroidal or cometary origin, and its recent orbital history has no periods with high enough temperatures to have altered its surface. While it is possible that some unknown process has acted to change the surface from an originally cometary one, we instead prefer a fundamentally asteroidal origin for Wilson-Harrington which can explain its surface and orbital properties. However, this would require a way to maintain significant (hyper-)volatile supplies on the near-Earth objects beyond what is currently expected. Wilson-Harrington's similar meteorite affinity and possible orbital link to sample return targets (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu suggest that the returned samples from the Hayabusa-2 and OSIRIS-REx missions might hold the key to understanding this object.
#### The 107 GHz methanol transition is a dasar in G0.253+0.016

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of population anti-inversion in the $3_1 - 4_0\ A^+$ transition of CH$_3$OH (methanol) at 107.013831 GHz toward the Galactic Center cloud G0.253+0.016 ("The Brick"). Anti-inversion of molecular level populations can result in absorption lines against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in a phenomenon known as a "dasar." We model the physical conditions under which the 107 GHz methanol transition dases and determine that dasing occurs at densities below $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and column densities between $10^{13}$ and $10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also find that for this transition, dasing does not strongly depend on the gas kinetic temperature. We evaluate the potential of this tool for future deep galaxy surveys. We note that other works have already reported absorption in this transition (e.g., in NGC 253), but we provide the first definitive evidence that it is absorption against the CMB rather than against undetected continuum sources.
#### CHEOPS and TESS view of the ultra-short period super-Earth TOI-561 b

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short period planets (USPs) are a unique class of super-Earths with an orbital period of less than a day and hence subject to intense radiation from their host star. While most of them are consistent with bare rocks, some show evidence of a heavyweight envelope, which could be a water layer or a secondary metal-rich atmosphere sustained by an outgassing surface. Much remains to be learned about the nature of USPs. The prime goal of the present work is to study the bulk planetary properties and atmosphere of TOI-561b, through the study of its transits and occultations. We obtained ultra-precise transit photometry of TOI-561b with CHEOPS and performed a joint analysis of this data with four TESS sectors. Our analysis of TOI-561b transit photometry put strong constraints on its properties, especially on its radius, Rp=1.42 +/- 0.02 R_Earth (at ~2% error). The internal structure modelling of the planet shows that the observations are consistent with negligible H/He atmosphere, however requiring other lighter materials, in addition to pure iron core and silicate mantle to explain the observed density. We find that this can be explained by the inclusion of a water layer in our model. We searched for variability in the measured Rp/R* over time to trace changes in the structure of the planetary envelope but none found within the data precision. In addition to the transit event, we tentatively detect occultation signal in the TESS data with an eclipse depth of ~27 +/- 11 ppm. Using the models of outgassed atmospheres from the literature we find that the thermal emission from the planet can mostly explain the observation. Based on this, we predict that NIR/MIR observations with JWST should be able to detect silicate species in the atmosphere of the planet. This could also reveal important clues about the planetary interior and help disentangle planet formation and evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 The release of Gaia catalog is revolutionary to the astronomy of solar system objects. After some effects such as atmospheric refraction and CCD geometric distortion have been taken into account, the astrometric precision for ground-based telescopes can reach the level of tens of milli-arcseconds. If an object approaches a reference star in a small relative angular distance (less than 100 arcseconds), which is called close approach event in this work, the relative positional precision between the object and reference star will be further improved since the systematic effects of atmospheric turbulence and local telescope optics can be reduced. To obtain the precise position of a main-belt asteroid in an close approach event, a second-order angular velocity model with time is supposed in the sky plane. By fitting the relationship between the relative angular distance and observed time, we can derive the time of maximum approximation and calculate the corresponding position of the asteroid. In practice, 5 nights' CCD observations including 15 close approach events of main-belt asteroid (702) Alauda are taken for testing by the 1m telescope at Yunnan Observatory, China. Compared with conventional solutions, our results show that the positional precision significantly improves, which reaches better than 4 milli-arcseconds, and 1 milli-arcsecond in the best case when referenced for JPL ephemeris in both right ascension and declination.
#### Analysis of the interstellar matter at the periphery of the supershell  surrounding the CYG OB1 association in 2.12 micron molecular hydrogen line

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the vdB 130 cluster vicinity in a narrow-band filter centered at a $2.12\,\mu$m molecular hydrogen line performed at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. The observations reveal an H$_2$ emission shell around vdB 130, coincident with a bright infrared shell, visible in all \textit{Spitzer} bands. Also, numerous H$_{2}$ emission features are detected around infrared Blobs E and W and in the vicinity of a protocluster located to the east of the shell, in a tail of a cometary molecular cloud. H$_2$ emission in the vicinity of the vdB~130 cluster is mostly generated in well-developed \HII\ regions and is of fluorescent nature. In the protocluster area, isolated spots are observed, where H$_2$ emission is collisionally excited and is probably related to shocks in protostellar outflows. Obtained results are discussed in the context of possible sequential star formation in the vicinity of the vdB 130 cluster, triggered by the interaction of the expanding supershell surrounding the Cyg OB1 association with the molecular cloud and an associated molecular filament.

 - **Abstract**
 Over three thousand pulsars have been discovered, but none have been confirmed to be younger than a few hundred years. Observing a pulsar after a supernova explosion will help us understand the properties of newborn ones, including their capability to produce gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts. Here, the possible youngest pulsar wind nebula (PWN) at the center of the SN 1986J remnant is studied. We demonstrate that the 5 GHz flux of 'PWN 1986J', increasing with time, is consistent with a stochastic acceleration model of PWNe developed to explain the flat radio spectrum of the Crab Nebula. We obtain an acceleration time-scale of electrons/positrons and a decay time-scale of the turbulence responsible for the stochastic acceleration as about 10 and 70 years, respectively. Our findings suggest that efficient stochastic acceleration and rising radio/submm light curves are characteristic signatures of the youngest PWNe. Follow-up ${\it ALMA}$ observations of decades-old supernovae within a few tens of Mpc, including SN 1986J, are encouraged to reveal the origin of the flat radio spectrum of PWNe.
#### Toward a direct measurement of the cosmic acceleration: The first  observation of HI 21cm absorption line at FAST

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we report the first result from the investgation of Neutral atomic hydrogen(HI) 21cm absorption line in spectrum of PKS1413+135 as a associated type at redshift $z\approx 0.24670041$ observed by FAST using the observing time of 10 minutes for the absorber and the spectral resolution of the raw data was setted to 10 Hz. The full spectral profile is analysed by fitting the absorption line with single Gaussian function as the resolution of 10kHz in 2MHz bandwidth, eventually intending to illustrate the latest cosmic acceleration by the direct measurement of time evolution of the redshift of HI 21cm absorption line with Hubble flow toward a same background Quasar in the time interval of more than a decade or many years as a detectable signal that produced by the accelerated expansion of the Universe in the era of FAST at low redshift space,namely redshift drift $\dot{z}$ or SL effect. The obtained HI gas column density $\rm N_{HI} \approx 2.2867\times 10^{22}/cm^2$ of this DLA system, much equivalent to the originally observed value $\rm N_{HI} \approx 1.3\times 10^{19}\times(T_s/f)/cm^2$ within the uncertainties of the spin temperature of a spiral host galaxy, and the signal to noise ratio SNR highly reaching 57.4357 for the resolution of 10kHz evidently validates the opportunities of the HI 21cm absorption lines of DLA systems to enforce the awareness of the physical motivation of dark energy by the probe of $\rm\dot{z}$ with the enhancement of accuracy in the level of $\sim 10^{-10}$ per decade.
#### A New Look at the YY CrB Binary System

 - **Abstract**
 This study presented a new analysis for the TESS-observed W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) binary star YY Coronea Borealis (YY CrB). The light curve was analyzed by the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python version together with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The light curve solutions required a hot spot and l3. New eclipse times from the TESS observations were extracted, and the O-C curve of primary and secondary minima showed an anti-correlated manner. In order to study the O-C curve of minima, minima times between 1991 and 2023 were collected. This investigation reported a new linear ephemeris and by fitting a quadratic function to the O-C curve of minima, calculated the orbital period rate of \mathop P\limits^.\approx 5.786*{10^{-8}} day/year. Assuming mass conservation, a mass exchange rate of \mathop{{M_2}}\limits^.=2.472*{10^{-8}} calculated from the more massive component to the less massive one. Then, by using the light travel time function, the possible third body was determined in the binary and derived the mass of the third body as 0.498M_Sun with a period of \simeq 7351.018 days. The O-C curve analysis and the quantity of mass indicate that the presence of a third body is unlikely. This binary is expected to evolve into a broken-contact phase and is a good case to support the thermal relaxation oscillation model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high angular-resolution observations of Sakurai's object using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, shedding new light on its morpho-kinematical structure. The millimetre continuum emission, observed at an angular resolution of 20 milliarcsec (corresponding to 70 AU), reveals a bright compact central component whose spectral index indicates that it composed of amorphous carbon dust. Based on these findings, we conclude that this emission traces the previously suggested dust disc observed in mid-infrared observations. Therefore, our observations provide the first direct imaging of such a disc. The H$^{12}$CN($J$=4$\rightarrow$3) line emission, observed at an angular resolution of 300 milliarcsec (corresponding to 1000 AU), displays bipolar structure with a north-south velocity gradient. From the position-velocity diagram of this emission we identify the presence of an expanding disc and a bipolar molecular outflow. The inclination of the disc is determined to be $i$=72$^\circ$. The derived values for the de-projected expansion velocity and the radius of the disc are $v_{\rm exp}$=53 km s$^{-1}$ and $R$=277 AU, respectively. On the other hand, the de-projected expansion velocity of the bipolar outflow detected in the H$^{12}$CN($J$=4$\rightarrow$3) emission of approximately 1000 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the molecular outflow has an hourglass morphology with an opening angle of around 60$^{\circ}$. Our observations unambiguously show that an equatorial disc and bipolar outflows formed in Sakurai's object in less than 30 years after the born-again event occurred, providing important constraints for future modelling efforts of this phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 The H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS), carried out between 2004 and 2013, is the most extensive survey of our Galaxy at very-high energies that covers the southern sky. Since the first HPGS catalogue release, the new observations accumulated provide a deeper scan of many Galactic sources, and a number of improvements have been made at various stages of the data processing chain, notably on events reconstruction and background modeling techniques. In parallel a new catalog production workflow has been tested and optimized on simulations done in preparation for the future Galactic Plane survey to be conducted by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The development of a common data format and open scientific tools for gamma-ray astronomy allowed a smooth transition from the exploratory work done on CTA simulations to its application for H.E.S.S. data analysis. These elements offered a solid ground to build the second H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey catalogue (2HGPS). In the following we will focus on the description of the catalogue workflow and show few results along the way.

 The recent announcement of strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) by various pulsar timing array collaborations has highlighted this signal as a promising candidate for future observations. Despite its non-detection by ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, Callister \textit{et al.}~\cite{tom_nongr_method} developed a Bayesian formalism to search for an isotropic SGWB with non-tensorial polarizations, imposing constraints on signal amplitude in those components that violate general relativity using LIGO's data. Since our ultimate aim is to estimate the spatial distribution of gravitational-wave sources, we have extended this existing method to allow for anisotropic components in signal models. We then examined the potential benefits from including these additional components. Using injection campaigns, we found that introducing anisotropic components into a signal model led to more significant identification of the signal itself and violations of general relativity. Moreover, the results of our Bayesian parameter estimation suggested that anisotropic components aid in breaking down degeneracies between different polarization components, allowing us to infer model parameters more precisely than through an isotropic analysis. In contrast, constraints on signal amplitude remained comparable in the absence of such a signal. Although these results might depend on the assumed source distribution on the sky, such as the Galactic plane, the formalism presented in this work has laid a foundation for establishing a generalized Bayesian analysis for an SGWB, including its anisotropies and non-tensorial polarizations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \textit{JWST} images of the well-known planetary nebula NGC\,6720 (the Ring Nebula), covering wavelengths from 1.6$\mu$m to 25 $\mu$m. The bright shell is strongly fragmented with some 20\,000 dense globules, bright in H$_2$, with a characteristic diameter of 0.2~arcsec and density $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$\,cm$^{-3}$. The shell contains a thin ring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. H$_2$ is found throughout the shell and in the halo. H$_2$ in the halo may be located on the swept-up walls of a biconal polar flow. The central cavity is shown to be filled with high ionization gas and shows two linear structures. The central star is located 2~arcsec from the emission centroid of the cavity and shell. Linear features (`spikes') extend outward from the ring, pointing away from the central star. Hydrodynamical simulations are shown which reproduce the clumping and possibly the spikes. Around ten low-contrast, regularly spaced concentric arc-like features are present; they suggest orbital modulation by a low-mass companion with a period of about 280~yr A previously known much wider companion is located at a projected separation of about 15\,000~au; we show that it is an M2--M4 dwarf. The system is therefore a triple star. These features, including the multiplicity, are similar to those seen in the Southern Ring Nebula (NGC\,3132) and may be a common aspect of such nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the dust associated with the core-collapse supernova SN~1995N. Infrared emission detected 14--15 years after the explosion was previously attributed to thermally echoing circumstellar material associated with the SN progenitor. We argue that this late-time emission is unlikely to be an echo, and is more plausibly explained by newly formed dust in the supernova ejecta, indirectly heated by the interaction between the ejecta and the CSM. Further evidence in support of this scenario comes from emission line profiles in spectra obtained 22 years after the explosion; these are asymmetric, showing greater attenuation on the red wing, consistent with absorption by dust within the expanding ejecta. The spectral energy distribution and emission line profiles at epochs later than $\sim$5000 days are both consistent with the presence of about 0.4~M$_\odot$ of amorphous carbon dust. The onset of dust formation is apparent in archival optical spectra, taken between 700 and 1700 days after the assumed explosion date. As this is considerably later than most other instances where the onset of dust formation has been detected, we argue that the explosion date must be later than previously assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 According to Einstein's special relativity theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers. However, quantum gravity effects could introduce its dispersion depending on the energy of photons. The investigation of the spectral lags between the gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves recorded in distinct energy ranges could shed light on this phenomenon: the lags could reflect the variation of the speed of light if it is linearly dependent on the photon energy and a function of the GRB redshift. We propose a methodology to start investigating the dispersion law of light propagation in a vacuum using GRB light curves. This technique is intended to be fully exploited using the GRB data collected with THESEUS.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study shows, from an empirical deduction, that the number and the presence of the blue straggler stars (BSS) in an open cluster follow a function whose components are the ratio between age and the relaxation time, $\it f$, and a factor, $\varpi$ , which is an indicator of stellar collisions plus primordial binaries. The relation among the number of blue straggler stars, the factor $\it f$, and the factor $\varpi$ of each globular cluster allows for deriving the age of the respective globular clusters. This method has been applied individually over 56 globular clusters containing BSS. The values derived for the cluster ages from our methodology do not differ from those derived from other methods. A special case is cluster NGC 104 whose age exceeds 13.8 Gyr (its age is between 19.04 and 20.30 Gyr), which would have a very exotic explanation: the existence of an intermediate black hole in the center of the cluster. That black hole main-sequence star (BH-MS) binaries with an initial orbital period less than the bifurcation period can evolve into ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) that can be detected by LISA. On the other hand, if that age were true, it would call into question the expansion velocity for a flat Universe. This would call into question the case for dark energy dominated Universe.

 This invited memoir looks back on my scientific career that straddles the solar and stellar branches of astrophysics, with sprinklings of historical context and personal opinion. Except for a description of my life up to my Ph.D. phase, the structure is thematic rather than purely chronological, focusing on those topics that I worked on throughout substantial parts of my life: stars like the Sun and the Sun-as-a-star, surface field evolution, coronal structure and dynamics, heliophysics education, and space weather. Luck and a broadly inquisitive frame of mind shaped a fortunate life on two continents, taking me from one amazing mentor, colleague, and friend to another, working in stimulating settings to interpret data from state-of-the-art space observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 In the presence of (relatively) long-range forces, structures can form even during the radiation dominated era, leading to compact objects, such as Fermi balls or primordial black holes (PBH), which can account for all or part of dark matter. We present a detailed analysis of a model in which fermions are produced from the inflaton decay developing some particle-antiparticle asymmetry. These fermions undergo clustering and structure formation driven by a Yukawa interaction. The same interaction provides a cooling channel for the dark halos via scalar radiation, leading to rapid collapse and the formation of a compact object. We discuss the criteria for the formation of either PBHs and Fermi balls. In the PBH formation regime, supermassive PBHs can seed the active galactic nuclei or quasars found at high redshift. Alternatively, Fermi balls can account for all of the cold dark matter, while evading microlensing constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae are an important source of energy in the interstellar medium. Young remnants of supernovae have a peak emission in the X-ray region, making them interesting objects for X-ray observations. In particular, the supernova remnant SN1006 is of great interest due to its historical record, proximity and brightness. It has therefore been studied by several X-ray telescopes. Improving the X-ray imaging of this and other remnants is important but challenging as it requires to address a spatially varying instrument response in order to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we use Chandra observations to demonstrate the capabilities of Bayesian image reconstruction using information field theory. Our objective is to reconstruct denoised, deconvolved and spatio-spectral resolved images from X-ray observations and to decompose the emission into different morphologies, namely diffuse and point-like. Further, we aim to fuse data from different detectors and pointings into a mosaic and quantify the uncertainty of our result. Utilizing prior knowledge on the spatial and spectral correlation structure of the two components, diffuse emission and point sources, the presented method allows the effective decomposition of the signal into these. In order to accelerate the imaging process, we introduce a multi-step approach, in which the spatial reconstruction obtained for a single energy range is used to derive an informed starting point for the full spatio-spectral reconstruction. The method is applied to 11 Chandra observations of SN1006 from 2008 and 2012, providing a detailed, denoised and decomposed view of the remnant. In particular, the separated view of the diffuse emission should provide new insights into its complex small-scale structures in the center of the remnant and at the shock front profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Detector commanding, processing and readout of spaceborne instrumentation is often accomplished with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The ASIC designed for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission (NuASIC) enables future tiled CdZnTe (CZT) detector array readout for x-ray detectors such as the High Resolution Energetic X-ray Imager (HREXI). Modified NuASIC gain settings have been implemented for HREXI's broader targeted imaging energy range (3-300 keV) compared to NuSTAR (2-79 keV), which may require updated NuASIC internal parameters for optimal energy resolution. To reach HREXI's targeted low energy threshold, we have also enabled the NuASIC's "Charge Pump Mode" (CPM), which introduces an additional tuning parameter. In this paper, we describe the mechanics of the NuASIC's adjustable parameters and use our recently developed ASIC Test Stand (ATS) to probe a "bare" NuASIC using its internal test pulser. We record the effects of parameter tuning on the device's electronics noise and low energy threshold and report the optimal set of parameters for HREXI's updated gain setting. We detail a semi-automated procedure to derive the optimal parameters for each of HREXI's large area, closely tiled NuASIC/CZT detectors to expedite instrument integration.

 - **Abstract**
 Over a dozen transiting circumbinary planets have been discovered around eclipsing binaries. Transit detections are biased towards aligned planet and binary orbits, and indeed all of the known planets have mutual inclinations less than $4.5^{\circ}$. One path to discovering circumbinary planets with misaligned orbits is through eclipse timing variations (ETVs) of non-transiting planets. Borkovits et al. (2016) discovered ETVs on the 18.6 d binary Kepler-1660AB, indicative of a third body on a $\approx 236$ d period, with a misaligned orbit and a potentially planetary mass. Getley et al. (2017) agreed with the planetary hypothesis, arguing for a $7.7M_{\rm Jup}$ circumbinary planet on an orbit that is highly misaligned by $120^{\circ}$ with respect to the binary. In this paper, we obtain the first radial velocities of the binary. We combine these with an analysis of not only the ETVs but also the eclipse depth variations. We confirm the existence of a $239.5$ d circumbinary planet, but with a lower mass of $4.87M_{\rm Jup}$ and a coplanar orbit. The misaligned orbits proposed by previous authors are definitively ruled out by a lack of eclipse depth variations. Kepler-1660ABb is the first confirmed circumbinary planet found using ETVs around a main sequence binary.

 - **Abstract**
 The low-energy gamma-ray (0.1-30 MeV) sky has been poorly observed since the decommissioning of the COMPTEL instrument on board the Compton Gamma-ray Observer (CGRO) satellite in 2000. The study of photons from this energy band (the MeV "gap") is, however, crucial to answer many unsolved questions in high-energy and multi-messenger astrophysics. Although several MeV gamma-ray missions have been proposed (e.g. AMEGO, e-ASTROGAM), these are mostly in the planning phase, and their launch is not expected until the next decade, at the earliest. Recently, there has been a proliferation of CubeSat missions proposed as "pathfinder" alternatives due to their low cost and faster cycles of implementation. Indeed, a MeV CubeSat for gamma-ray astronomy can be a suitable demonstrator for future, larger-scale MeV payloads. In this paper, a gamma-ray payload design with a silicon tracker and CsI calorimeter is proposed. We report the results of simulations to assess the performance of this payload possibility and compare these with other previous gamma-ray instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the effects of uncertainties in the atmosphere models on the radius, mass, and other neutron star parameter constraints for the NICER observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. To date, NICER has applied the X-ray pulse profile modeling technique to two millisecond-period pulsars: PSR J0030+0451 and the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620. These studies have commonly assumed a deep-heated fully-ionized hydrogen atmosphere model, although they have explored the effects of partial-ionization and helium composition in some cases. Here we extend that exploration and also include new models with partially ionized carbon composition, externally heated hydrogen, and an empirical atmospheric beaming parametrization to explore deviations in the expected anisotropy of the emitted radiation. None of the studied atmosphere cases have any significant influence on the inferred radius of PSR J0740+6620, possibly due to its X-ray faintness, tighter external constraints, and/or viewing geometry. In the case of PSR J0030+0451 both the composition and ionization state could significantly alter the inferred radius. However, based on the evidence (prior predictive probability of the data), partially ionized hydrogen and carbon atmospheres are disfavored. The difference in the evidence for ionized hydrogen and helium atmospheres is too small to be decisive for most cases, but the inferred radius for helium models trends to larger sizes around or above 14-15 km. External heating or deviations in the beaming that are less than $5\,\%$ at emission angles smaller than 60 degrees, on the other hand, have no significant effect on the inferred radius.

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino detector at the geographic South Pole, has reached a number of milestones in the field of neutrino astrophysics: the discovery of a high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux, the temporal and directional correlation of neutrinos with a flaring blazar, and a steady emission of neutrinos from the direction of an active galaxy of a Seyfert II type and the Milky Way. The next generation neutrino telescope, IceCube-Gen2, currently under development, will consist of three essential components: an array of about 10,000 optical sensors, embedded within approximately 8 cubic kilometers of ice, for detecting neutrinos with energies of TeV and above, with a sensitivity five times greater than that of IceCube; a surface array with scintillation panels and radio antennas targeting air showers; and buried radio antennas distributed over an area of more than 400 square kilometers to significantly enhance the sensitivity of detecting neutrino sources beyond EeV. This contribution describes the design and status of IceCube-Gen2 and discusses the expected sensitivity from the simulations of the optical, surface, and radio components.
#### Disentangling patchy reionization signatures from primordial  gravitational waves using CMB $E$-mode and $B$-mode polarization

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of large angular scale $B$-mode in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization signal will open a direct window into not only the primary CMB anisotropies caused by the primordial gravitational waves (PGW) originating in the epoch of inflation, but also the secondary anisotropies imprinted during the epoch of cosmic reionization. The existence of patchiness in the electron density during reionization produces a unique distortion in the CMB $B$-mode polarization, which can be distinguished from the PGW signal with the aid of spatial frequency modes. In this work, we employ an $EB$ estimator by combining $E$-mode and $B$-mode polarization for the $\tau$ power spectrum signal generated in a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model called SCRIPT. We developed a Bayesian framework for the joint detection of the PGW and reionization signal from CMB observations and show the efficacy of this technique for upcoming CMB experiments. We find that, for our model, the $\tau$ power spectrum signal effectively tracks the inhomogeneous electron density field, allowing for robust constraints on the patchy $B$-mode signal. Further, our results indicate that employing the $EB$ estimator for the $\tau$ signal will facilitate ground-based CMB-S4 to detect the patchy $B$-mode signal at approximately $\geq 2\sigma$ confidence level while observations with space-based PICO will improve this detection to $\geq 3\sigma$ going as high as $\geq 7\sigma$ for extreme reionization models. These findings not only highlight the future potential of these experiments to provide an improved picture of the reionization process but also have important implications towards an unbiased measurement of $r$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of SiC$_2$ in the interstellar medium. The molecule was identified through six rotational transitions toward G\,+0.693$-$0.027, a molecular cloud located in the Galactic center. The detection is based on a line survey carried out with the GBT, the Yebes 40m, and the IRAM 30m telescopes covering a range of frequencies from 12 to 276 GHz. We fit the observed spectra assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and derive a column density of ($1.02\pm0.04)\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, which gives a fractional abundance of $7.5\times10^{-11}$ with respect to H$_2$, and an excitation temperature of $5.9\pm0.2$ K. We conclude that SiC$_2$ can be formed in the shocked gas by a reaction between the sputtered atomic silicon and C$_2$H$_2$, or it can be released directly from the dust grains due to disruption. We also search for other Si-bearing molecules and detect eight rotational transitions of SiS and four transitions of Si$^{18}$O. The derived fractional abundances are $3.9\times10^{-10}$ and $2.1\times10^{-11}$, respectively. All Si-bearing species toward G\,+0.693$-$0.027 show fractional abundances well below what is typically found in late-type evolved stars.
#### An updated mass-radius analysis of the 2017-2018 NICER data set of PSR  J0030+0451

 - **Abstract**
 In 2019 the NICER collaboration published the first mass and radius inferred for PSR J0030+0451, thanks to NICER observations, and consequent constraints on the equation of state characterising dense matter. Two independent analyses found a mass of $\sim 1.3-1.4\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and a radius of $\sim 13\,$km. They also both found that the hot spots were all located on the same hemisphere, opposite to the observer, and that at least one of them had a significantly elongated shape. Here we reanalyse, in greater detail, the same NICER data set, incorporating the effects of an updated NICER response matrix and using an upgraded analysis framework. We expand the adopted models and jointly analyse also XMM-Newton data, which enables us to better constrain the fraction of observed counts coming from PSR J0030+0451. Adopting the same models used in previous publications, we find consistent results, although with more stringent inference requirements. We also find a multi-modal structure in the posterior surface. This becomes crucial when XMM-Newton data is accounted for. Including the corresponding constraints disfavors the main solutions found previously, in favor of the new and more complex models. These have inferred masses and radii of $\sim [1.4 \mathrm{M_\odot}, 11.5$ km] and $\sim [1.7 \mathrm{M_\odot}, 14.5$ km], depending on the assumed model. They display configurations that do not require the two hot spots generating the observed X-rays to be on the same hemisphere, nor to show very elongated features, and point instead to the presence of temperature gradients and the need to account for them.
#### Understanding the Very High Energy γ-ray excess in nearby blazars  using leptonic model

 - **Abstract**
 The availability of simultaneous X-ray and Very High Energy (VHE) observations of blazars helps to identify the plausible radiative contributors to the VHE emission. Under leptonic scenario, the VHE emission from BL Lacs are attributed to the synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission. However, many BL Lacerate (BL Lacs) have shown significant hardening at VHE after correction for the Extra Galactic Background Light (EBL) attenuation. We study the spectral hardening of two nearby BL Lac objects, Mkn 421 and Mkn 501 having most number of simultaneous X-ray and VHE observations available among all the blazars. These BL Lacs are relatively close and the effect of EBL attenuation is relatively minimal/negligible. We study the scatter plot between the X-ray spectral indices and intrinsic VHE indices to identify the plausible origin of the VHE emission. For Mkn 501, the VHE spectral indices are steeper than X-ray spectra, suggesting the scattering process happening at extreme Klein-Nishina regime. On the other hand, for Mkn 421, the VHE spectra is remarkably harder than the X-ray spectra, which suggests an additional emission mechanism other than the SSC process. We show this hard VHE spectrum of Mkn 421 can be explained by considering the inverse Compton (IC) emission from a broken power law electron distribution with Maxwellian pileup. The possibility of the hadronic contribution at VHE {\gamma}-rays is also explored by modeling the hard spectrum under photomeson process.

These challenges include corrosion due to atomic oxygen, molecular degradation of materials and fluids due to radiation, temperature extremes influencing lubricant viscosity, and rapid evaporative loss of fluids in vacuum conditions. Therefore, lubricants for mechanisms and components such as bearings and gears for spacecraft should be tested extensively in both air and vacuum to ensure their continuous and accurate function. Literature on ground based tribo-testing is extensive and well-established. However, tribological investigations conducted in LEO are much fewer in number. The purpose of this paper is to draw together details of tribology experiments of this type, to try to clarify their purpose and value. This review presents these studies according to a thematic categorization of the mechanisms involved.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) There is a diverse chemical inventory in protostellar regions leading to the classification of extreme types of systems. Warm carbon chain chemistry sources, for one, are the warm and dense regions near a protostar containing unsaturated carbon chain molecules. Since the presentation of this definition in 2008, there is a growing field to detect and characterise these sources. The details are lesser known in relation to hot cores and in high-mass star-forming regions -- regions of great importance in galactic evolution. To investigate the prevalence of carbon chain species and their environment in high-mass star-forming regions, we have conducted targeted spectral surveys of two sources in the direction of Cygnus X -- AFGL 2591 and IRAS 20126+4104 -- with the Green Bank Telescope and the IRAM 30m Telescope. We have constructed a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) model using the observed molecular spectra to determine the physical environment in which these molecules originate. We map both the observed spatial distribution and the physical parameters found from the LTE model. We also determine the formation routes of these molecules in each source using the three-phase NAUTILUS chemical evolution code. We detect several lines of propyne, CH$_3$CCH, and cyclopropenylidene, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ as tracers of carbon chain chemistry, as well as several lines of formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and methanol, CH$_3$OH, as a precursor and a tracer of complex organic molecule chemistry, respectively. We find excitation temperatures of 20-30 K for the carbon chains and 8-85 K for the complex organics. The CH$_3$CCH abundances are reproduced by a warm-up model, consistent with warm carbon chain chemistry, while the observed CH$_3$OH abundances require a shock mechanism sputtering the molecules into the gas phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The K2-138 system hosts six planets and presents an interesting case study due to its distinctive dynamical structure. Its five inner planets are near a chain of 3/2 two-body mean-motion resonances, while the outermost body (planet {\it g}) is significantly detached, having a mean-motion ratio of $n_f/n_g \sim 3.3$ with its closest neighbor. We show that the orbit of $m_g$ is actually consistent with the first-order three-planet resonance (3P-MMR) characterized by the relation $2n_e - 4n_f + 3n_g = 0$ and is the first time a pure first-order 3P-MMR is found in a multi-planet system and tied to its current dynamical structure. Adequate values for the masses allow to trace the dynamical history of the system from an initial capture in a 6-planet chain (with $n_f/n_g$ in a 3/1 resonance), up to its current configuration due to tidal interactions over the age of the star. The increase in resonance offset with semi-major axis, as well as its large value for $n_f/n_g$ can be explained by the slopes of the pure three-planet resonances in the mean-motion ratio plane. The triplets slide outward over these curves when the innermost pair is pulled apart by tidal effects, in a \textit{pantograph-}like manner. The capture into the 3P-MMR is found to be surprisingly robust given similar masses for $m_g$ and $m_f$, and it is possible that the same effect may also be found in other compact planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The face-on projected density profile of the Miyamoto & Nagai disks of arbitrary flattening is obtained analytically in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals of first and second type, by using two complementary approaches, and then checked against the results of numerical integration. As computer algebra systems do not seem able to obtain the resulting formula in any straightforward way, the relevant mathematical steps are provided. During this study, three wrong identities in the Byrd & Friedman tables of elliptic integrals have been identified, and their correct expression is given.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has ushered in an era of unprecedented ability to characterize exoplanetary atmospheres. While there are over 5,000 confirmed planets, more than 4,000 TESS planet candidates are still unconfirmed and many of the best planets for atmospheric characterization may remain to be identified. We present a sample of TESS planets and planet candidates that we identify as "best-in-class" for transmission and emission spectroscopy with JWST. These targets are sorted into bins across equilibrium temperature $T_{\mathrm{eq}}$ and planetary radius $R{_\mathrm{p}}$ and are ranked by transmission and emission spectroscopy metric (TSM and ESM, respectively) within each bin. In forming our target sample, we perform cuts for expected signal size and stellar brightness, to remove sub-optimal targets for JWST. Of the 194 targets in the resulting sample, 103 are unconfirmed TESS planet candidates, also known as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We perform vetting and statistical validation analyses on these 103 targets to determine which are likely planets and which are likely false positives, incorporating ground-based follow-up from the TESS Follow-up Observation Program (TFOP) to aid the vetting and validation process. We statistically validate 23 TOIs, marginally validate 33 TOIs to varying levels of confidence, deem 29 TOIs likely false positives, and leave the dispositions for 4 TOIs as inconclusive. 14 of the 103 TOIs were confirmed independently over the course of our analysis. We provide our final best-in-class sample as a community resource for future JWST proposals and observations. We intend for this work to motivate formal confirmation and mass measurements of each validated planet and encourage more detailed analysis of individual targets by the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the long-term radio variability (timescales of months to years) of blazars enables us to gain a better understanding of the physical structure of these objects on sub-parsec scales, and the physics of super massive black holes. In this study, we focus on the radio variability of 1157 blazars observed at 15~GHz through the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) Blazar Monitoring Program. We investigate the dependence of the variability amplitudes and timescales, characterized based on model fitting to the structure functions, on the milliarcsecond core sizes measured by Very Long Baseline Interferometry. We find that the most compact sources at milliarcsecond scales exhibit larger variability amplitudes and shorter variability timescales than more extended sources. Additionally, for sources with measured redshifts and Doppler boosting factors, the correlation between linear core sizes against variability amplitudes and intrinsic timescales are also significant. The observed relationship between variability timescales and core sizes is expected, based on light travel-time arguments. This variability vs core size relation extends beyond the core sizes measured at 15\,GHz; we see significant correlation between the 15\,GHz variability amplitudes (as well as timescales) and core sizes measured at other frequencies, which can be attributed to a frequency-source size relationship arising from the intrinsic jet structure. At low frequencies of 1\,GHz where the core sizes are dominated by interstellar scattering, we find that the variability amplitudes have significant correlation with the 1~GHz intrinsic core angular sizes, once the scatter broadening effects are deconvoluted from the intrinsic core sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physical model and spin-state analysis of the potentially hazardous asteroid (23187) 2000 PN9. As part of a long-term campaign to make direct detections of the YORP effect, we collected optical lightcurves of the asteroid between 2006 and 2020. These observations were combined with planetary radar data to develop a detailed shape model which was used to search for YORP acceleration. We report that 2000 PN9 is a relatively large top-shaped body with a sidereal rotation period of 2.53216$\pm$0.00015 h. Although we find no evidence for rotational acceleration, YORP torques smaller than $\sim$10$^{-8}$$\,\rm rad/day^{2}$ cannot be ruled out. It is likely that 2000 PN9 is a YORP-evolved object, and may be an example of YORP equilibrium or self limitation.
#### Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). X. Detectability of  currently known exoplanets and synergies with future IR/O/UV  reflected-starlight imaging missions

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of space-based observatories will characterize the atmospheres of low-mass, temperate exoplanets with the direct-imaging technique. This will be a major step forward in our understanding of exoplanet diversity and the prevalence of potentially habitable conditions beyond the Earth. We compute a list of currently known exoplanets detectable with the mid-infrared Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) in thermal emission. We also compute the list of known exoplanets accessible to a notional design of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), observing in reflected starlight. With a pre-existing method, we processed the NASA Exoplanet Archive and computed orbital realizations for each known exoplanet. We derived their mass, radius, equilibrium temperature, and planet-star angular separation. We used the LIFEsim simulator to compute the integration time ($t_{int}$) required to detect each planet with LIFE. A planet is considered detectable if a broadband signal-to-noise ratio $S/N$=7 is achieved over the spectral range $4-18.5\mu$m in $t_{int}\leq$100 hours. We tested whether the planet is accessible to HWO in reflected starlight based on its notional inner and outer working angles, and minimum planet-to-star contrast. LIFE's reference configuration (four 2-m telescopes with 5% throughput and a nulling baseline between 10-100 m) can detect 212 known planets within 20 pc. Of these, 55 are also accessible to HWO in reflected starlight, offering a unique opportunity for synergies in atmospheric characterization. LIFE can also detect 32 known transiting exoplanets. Furthermore, 38 LIFE-detectable planets orbit in the habitable zone, of which 13 with $M_p<5M_\oplus$ and 8 with $5M_\oplus<M_p<10M_\oplus$. LIFE already has enough targets to perform ground-breaking analyses of low-mass, habitable-zone exoplanets, a fraction of which will also be accessible to other instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We introduce a new deep learning approach for the reconstruction of 3D dust density and temperature distributions from multi-wavelength dust emission observations on the scale of individual star-forming cloud cores (<0.2 pc). Methods: We construct a training data set by processing cloud cores from the Cloud Factory simulations with the POLARIS radiative transfer code to produce synthetic dust emission observations at 23 wavelengths between 12 and 1300 $\mu$m. We simplify the task by reconstructing the cloud structure along individual lines of sight and train a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for this purpose. The cINN belongs to the group of normalising flow methods and is able to predict full posterior distributions for the target dust properties. We test different cINN setups, ranging from a scenario that includes all 23 wavelengths down to a more realistically limited case with observations at only seven wavelengths. We evaluate the predictive performance of these models on synthetic test data. Results: We report an excellent reconstruction performance for the 23-wavelengths cINN model, achieving median absolute relative errors of about 1.8% in $\log(n_{dust}/m^{-3})$ and 1% in $\log(T_{dust}/K)$, respectively. We identify trends towards overestimation at the low end of the density range and towards underestimation at the high end of both density and temperature, which may be related to a bias in the training data. Limiting coverage to a combination of only seven wavelengths, we still find a satisfactory performance with average absolute relative errors of about 3.3% and 2.5% in $\log(n_{dust}/m^{-3})$ and $\log(T_{dust}/K)$. Conclusions: This proof of concept study shows that the cINN-based approach for 3D reconstruction of dust density and temperature is very promising and even feasible under realistic observational constraints.
