 - **Abstract**
 The search for rocky planet atmospheres with JWST has focused on planets transiting M dwarfs. Such planets have favorable planet-to-star size ratios, enhancing the amplitude of atmospheric features. Since the expected signal strength of atmospheric features is similar to the single-transit performance of JWST, multiple observations are required to confirm any detection. Here, we present two transit observations of the rocky planet GJ 1132 b with JWST NIRSpec G395H, covering 2.8-5.2 $\mu$m. Previous HST WFC3 observations of GJ 1132 b were inconclusive, with evidence reported for either an atmosphere or a featureless spectrum based on analyses of the same dataset. Our JWST data exhibit substantial differences between the two visits. One transit is consistent with either a H$_2$O-dominated atmosphere containing ~1% CH$_4$ and trace N$_2$O ($\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ = 1.13) or stellar contamination from unocculted starspots ($\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ = 1.36). However, the second transit is consistent with a featureless spectrum. Neither visit is consistent with a previous report of HCN. Atmospheric variability is unlikely to explain the scale of the observed differences between the visits. Similarly, our out-of-transit stellar spectra show no evidence of changing stellar inhomogeneity between the two visits - observed 8 days apart, only 6.5% of the stellar rotation rate. We further find no evidence of differing instrumental systematic effects between visits. The most plausible explanation is an unlucky random noise draw leading to two significantly discrepant transmission spectra. Our results highlight the importance of multi-visit repeatability with JWST prior to claiming atmospheric detections for these small, enigmatic planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and theory suggest that core-collapse supernovae can span a range of explosion energies, and when sub-energetic, the shockwave initiating the explosion can decelerate to speeds comparable to the escape speed of the progenitor. In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics and conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor star. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a perturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock into a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact object. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity, density, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the freefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within the progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that our model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately predicts (e.g.) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius at which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole formation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In particular, we propose that a ``phantom shock breakout'' -- where the outer edge of the star falls through a stalled shock -- can yield a burst of X-rays without a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs. This model predicts the rise time of the X-ray burst, $t_{\rm d}$, and the mean photon energy, $kT$, are anti-correlated, approximately as $T \propto t_{\rm d}^{-5/8}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing can be used to find otherwise invisible dark matter subhaloes. In such an analysis, the lens galaxy mass model is a significant source of systematic uncertainty. In this paper we analyse the effect of angular complexity in the lens model. We use multipole perturbations which introduce low-order deviations from pure ellipticity in the isodensity contours, keeping the radial density profile fixed. We find that, in HST-like data, multipole perturbations consistent with those seen in galaxy isophotes are very effective at causing false positive substructure detections. We show that the effectiveness of this degeneracy depends on the deviation from a pure ellipse and the lensing configuration. We find that, when multipoles of one per cent are allowed in the lens model, the area in the observation where a subhalo could be detected drops by a factor of three. Sensitivity away from the lensed images is mostly lost. However, the mass limit of detectable objects on or close to the lensed images does not change. We do not expect the addition of multipole perturbations to lens models to have a significant effect on the ability of strong lensing to constrain the underlying dark matter model. However, given the high rate of false positive detections, angular complexity beyond the elliptical power-law should be included for such studies to be reliable. We discuss implications for previous detections and future work.

 - **Abstract**
 The first all-sky maps of the diffuse emission of high ionization lines observed in X-rays by SRG/eROSITA, provide an excellent probe for the study of the warm-hot phase (T~10^6 K) of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW). In this work we analyse the O VIII line detected in the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey data (eRASS1). We fit a sky map made in a narrow energy bin around this line, with physical emission models embedded in a 3D geometry to constrain the density distribution of the warm-hot gas around our Galaxy, with a focus on mid and high (absolute) Galactic latitudes. By masking out the eROSITA bubbles and other bright extended foreground sources, we find that an oblate geometry of the warm-hot gas (T~0.15-0.17 keV), flattened around the Galactic disk with scale height z_h~1-3 kpc, best describes the eRASS1 O VIII map, with most of the observed emission resulting to be produced within a few kpc from the Sun. The additional presence of a large scale warm-hot spherical halo, while providing a minor contribute to the X-ray emission, accounts for the high O VII absorption column densities detected with XMM-Newton, as well as most of the baryon budget of the CGM of the MW. The eROSITA data carry the largest amount of information and detail of O VIII CGM intensities to date, allowing for a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainties of the inferred physical parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present DE-VAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to search for a compressed representation of dynamical dark energy (DE) models in observational studies of the cosmic large-scale structure. DE-VAE is trained on matter power spectra boosts generated at wavenumbers $k\in(0.01-2.5) \ h/\rm{Mpc}$ and at four redshift values $z\in(0.1,0.48,0.78,1.5)$ for the most typical dynamical DE parametrization with two extra parameters describing an evolving DE equation of state. The boosts are compressed to a lower-dimensional representation, which is concatenated with standard cold dark matter (CDM) parameters and then mapped back to reconstructed boosts; both the compression and the reconstruction components are parametrized as neural networks. Remarkably, we find that a single latent parameter is sufficient to predict 95% (99%) of DE power spectra generated over a broad range of cosmological parameters within $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) of a Gaussian error which includes cosmic variance, shot noise and systematic effects for a Stage IV-like survey. This single parameter shows a high mutual information with the two DE parameters, and these three variables can be linked together with an explicit equation through symbolic regression. Considering a model with two latent variables only marginally improves the accuracy of the predictions, and adding a third latent variable has no significant impact on the model's performance. We discuss how the DE-VAE architecture can be extended from a proof of concept to a general framework to be employed in the search for a common lower-dimensional parametrization of a wide range of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models and for different cosmological datasets. Such a framework could then both inform the development of cosmological surveys by targeting optimal probes, and provide theoretical insight into the common phenomenological aspects of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing a supernova explosion shortly after it occurs can reveal important information about the physics of stellar explosions and the nature of the progenitor stars of supernovae (SNe). When a star with a well-defined edge explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief shock-breakout flare. The duration of this flare can extend to at most a few hours even for nonspherical breakouts from supergiant stars, after which the explosion ejecta should expand and cool. Alternatively, for stars exploding within a distribution of sufficiently dense optically thick circumstellar material, the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge, and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating. The difficulty in detecting SN explosions promptly after the event has so far limited data regarding supergiant stellar explosions mostly to serendipitous observations that, owing to the lack of ultraviolet (UV) data, were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling, and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here, we report observations of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy M101, covering the early days of the event. Using UV spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as a comprehensive set of additional multiwavelength observations, we trace the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the event and are able to temporally resolve the emergence and evolution of the SN emission.
#### Population III star formation: multiple gas phases prevent the use of an  equation of state at high densities

 - **Abstract**
 Advanced primordial chemistry networks have been developed to model the collapse of metal-free baryonic gas within the gravitational well of dark matter (DM) halos and its subsequent collapse into Population III stars. At the low densities of 10^-26-10^-21 g cm-3 (10-3-10^2 cm-3) the collapse is dependent on H2 production, which is a function of the compressional heating provided by the DM potential. Once the gas decouples from the DM, the temperature-density relationship follows a well established path dictated by various chemical reactions until the formation of the protostar at 10^-4 g cm-3 (10^19 cm-3). Here we explore the feasibility of replacing the chemical network (CN) with a barotropic equation of state (EoS) just before the formation of the first protostar, to reduce the computational load of simulating the further fragmentation, evolution and characteristics of the very high density gas. We find a significant reduction in fragmentation when using the EoS. The EoS method produces a protostellar mass distribution that peaks at higher masses when compared to CN runs. The change in fragmentation behaviour is due to a lack of cold gas falling in through the disc around the first protostar when using an EoS. Despite this, the total mass accreted across all sinks was invariant to the switch to an EoS, hence the star formation rate (Msun yr^-1) is accurately predicted using an EoS. The EoS routine is approximately 4000 times faster than the CN, however this numerical gain is offset by the lack of accuracy in modelling secondary protostar formation and hence its use must be considered carefully.

 - **Abstract**
 We highlight the role of weak lensing measurements from current and upcoming stage-IV imaging surveys in the search for cosmic inflation, specifically in measuring the scalar spectral index $n_s$. To do so, we combine the Dark Energy Survey 3 years of observation weak lensing and clustering data with BICEP/Keck, Planck and Sloan Digital Sky Survey data in $r\Lambda$CDM where $r$ is the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While there is no significant improvement in constraining power, we obtain a 1$\sigma$ shift on $n_s$. Additionally, we forecast a weak lensing and clustering data vector from the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and show its combination with current data would improve their $n_s$ constraints by 25$\%$ in $r\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 In the flourishing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, accurately inferring binary black hole merger formation channels is paramount. The Bayesian hierarchical model selection analysis offers a promising methodology (see, e.g., One Channel to Rule Them All, Zevin et al. 2021). However, recently, Cheng et al. (2023) highlighted a critical caveat: observed channels absent in known models can bias branching fraction estimates. In this research note, we introduce a test to detect missing channels in such analyses. Our findings show a commendable success rate in identifying these elusive channels. Yet, in scenarios where missing channels closely overlap with recognized ones, discerning the difference remains challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Electron-molecule interaction is a fundamental process in radiation-driven chemistry in space, from the interstellar medium to comets. Therefore, knowledge of interaction cross-sections is key. While there has been a plethora of studies of total ionization cross-sections, data is often spread over many sources, or not public or readily available. We introduce the Astrochemistry Low-energy Electron Cross-Section (ALeCS) database, a public database for electron interaction cross-sections and ionization rates for molecules of astrochemical interest. In this work, we present the first data release comprising total ionization cross-sections and ionization rates for over 200 neutral molecules. We include optimized geometries and molecular orbital energies at various levels of theory, and for a subset of the molecules, the ionization potentials. We compute total ionization cross-sections using the binary-encounter Bethe model and screening-corrected additivity rule, and ionization rates and reaction network coefficients for molecular cloud environments for $>$200 neutral molecules ranging from diatomics to complex organics. We demonstrate that our binary-encounter Bethe cross-sections agree well with experimental data. We show that the ionization rates scale roughly linearly with the number of constituent atoms in the molecule. We introduce and describe the public ALeCS database. For the initial release, we include total ionization cross-sections for $>$200 neutral molecules and several cations and anions calculated with different levels of quantum chemistry theory, the chemical reaction rates for the ionization, and network files in the formats of the two most popular astrochemical networks, the KIDA and UMIST. The database will be continuously updated for more molecules and interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing is a powerful tool that, by accounting for every rotation of a pulsar, precisely measures the spin frequency, spin frequency derivatives, astrometric position, binary parameters when applicable, properties of the ISM, and potentially general relativistic effects. Typically, this process demands fairly stringent scheduling requirements for monitoring observations as well as deep domain knowledge to "phase connect" the timing data. We present an algorithm that automates the pulsar timing process for binary pulsars, whose timing solutions have an additional level of complexity, although the algorithm works for isolated pulsars as well. Using the statistical F-test and the quadratic dependence of the reduced $\chi ^2$ near a minimum, the global rotation count of a pulsar can be determined efficiently and systematically. We have used our algorithm to establish timing solutions for two newly discovered binary pulsars, PSRs J1748$-$2446aq and J1748$-$2446at, in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using $\sim$70 Green Bank Telescope observations from the last 13 years.
#### ALMA Observations of the Extraordinary Carina Pillars: A Complementary  Sample

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of six dusty and gaseous pillars (containing the HH 1004 and HH 1010 objects) and globules (that contain the HH 666, HH 900, HH 1006, and HH 1066 objects) localized in the Carina nebula using sensitive and high angular resolution ($\sim$0.3$''$) Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. This is a more extensive study that the one presented in \citet{Cortes}. As in this former study, we also analyzed the 1.3 mm continuum emission and C$^{18}$O(2$-$1), N$_2$D$^+$(3$-$2) and $^{12}$CO(2$-$1) spectral lines. These new observations revealed the molecular outflows emanating from the pillars, the dusty envelopes$+$disks that are exciting them, and the extended HH objects far from their respective pillars. We reveal that the masses of the disks$+$envelopes are in a range of 0.02 to 0.38 M$_\odot$, and those for the molecular outflows are of the order of 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, which suggests that their exciting sources might be low- or intermediate-mass protostars as already revealed in recent studies at infrared and submillimeter bands. In the regions associated with the objects HH 900 and HH 1004, we report multiple millimeter continuum sources, from where several molecular outflows emanate.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-amplitude accretion outbursts in young stars are expected to play a central role in proto-stellar assembly. Yet most outburst identifications and detailed studies have resulted from searches in optical time domain surveys, which are not sensitive to events located in heavily dust-obscured regions of the Galactic plane. Here, we present the discovery of WTP$\,$10aaauow, a large-amplitude mid-infrared (MIR) outburst identified in a systematic search of NEOWISE data using image subtraction techniques designed to recover transients in dense Galactic stellar fields. The new outburst is located towards the RCW$\,$49 star-forming region, and estimated to be at a distance of $\approx 4\,$kpc. Concurrent with the MIR brightening, we show that the source underwent a $\gtrsim5\,$mag outburst in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands around 2014-2015 reaching a peak luminosity of $\approx260\,$L$_\odot$, followed by a slow decline over the next 7 years. Analysis of the pre- and post-outburst spectral energy distributions reveal a pre-outburst stellar photosphere at a temperature of $3600-4400\,$K, surrounded by a likely two-component dust structure similar to that of a flat spectrum or Class I type YSO. We present optical and NIR follow-up spectroscopy of the source, that show a GK-type spectrum in the optical bands exhibiting complex line profiles in strong absorption features, and evidence for a wind reaching a terminal velocity of $\approx 400\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$. The NIR bands are characterized by a cooler M-type spectrum exhibiting a forest of atomic and molecular features. All together, the spectra demonstrate that WTP\,10aaauow is a new FU Ori outburst. Ongoing systematic infrared searches will continue to reveal the extent of this population in the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-Division Multiplexing is the readout architecture of choice for many ground and space experiments, as it is a very mature technology with proven outstanding low-frequency noise stability, which represents a central challenge in multiplexing. Once fully populated, each of the two BICEP Array high frequency receivers, observing at 150GHz and 220/270GHz, will have 7776 TES detectors tiled on the focal plane. The constraints set by these two receivers required a redesign of the warm readout electronics. The new version of the standard Multi Channel Electronics, developed and built at the University of British Columbia, is presented here for the first time. BICEP Array operates Time Division Multiplexing readout technology to the limits of its capabilities in terms of multiplexing rate, noise and crosstalk, and applies them in rigorously demanding scientific application requiring extreme noise performance and systematic error control. Future experiments like CMB-S4 plan to use TES bolometers with Time Division/SQUID-based readout for an even larger number of detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Relations between neutron star properties that do not depend on the nuclear equation of state offer insights on neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Such relations are obtained by fitting to a range of phenomenological or nuclear physics equation of state models, each of which may have varying degrees of accuracy. In this study we revisit commonly-used relations and re-assess them with a very flexible set of phenomenological nonparametric equation of state models that are based on Gaussian Processes. Our models correspond to two sets: equations of state which mimic hadronic models, and equations of state with rapidly changing behavior that resemble phase transitions. We quantify the accuracy of relations under both sets and discuss their applicability with respect to expected upcoming statistical uncertainties of astrophysical observations. We further propose a goodness-of-fit metric which provides an estimate for the systematic error introduced by using the relation to model a certain equation-of-state set. Overall, the nonparametric distribution is more poorly fit with existing relations, with the I--Love--Q relations retaining the highest degree of universality. Fits degrade for relations involving the tidal deformability, such as the Binary-Love and compactness-Love relations, and when introducing phase transition phenomenology. For most relations, systematic errors are comparable to current statistical uncertainties under the nonparametric equation of state distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 GMagAO-X is a visible to NIR extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) system that will be used at first light for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). GMagAO-X is designed to deliver diffraction-limited performance at visible and NIR wavelengths (6 to 10 mas) and contrasts on the order of $10^{-7}$. The primary science case of GMagAO-X will be the characterization of mature, and potentially habitable, exoplanets in reflected light. GMagAO-X employs a woofer-tweeter system and includes segment phasing control. The tweeter is a 21,000 actuator segmented deformable mirror (DM), composed of seven individual 3,000 actuator DMs. This new ExAO framework of seven DMs working in parallel to produce a 21,000 actuator DM significantly surpasses any current or near future actuator count for a monolithic DM architecture. Bootstrapping, phasing, and high order sensing are enabled by a multi-stage wavefront sensing system. GMT's unprecedented 25.4 m aperture composed of seven segments brings a new challenge of co-phasing massive mirrors to 1/100th of a wavelength. The primary mirror segments of the GMT are separated by large >30 cm gaps so there will be fluctuations in optical path length (piston) across the pupil due to vibration of the segments, atmospheric conditions, etc. We have developed the High Contrast Adaptive-optics Testbed (HCAT) to test new wavefront sensing and control approaches for GMT and GMagAO-X, such as the holographic dispersed fringe sensor (HDFS), and the new ExAO parallel DM concept for correcting aberrations across a segmented pupil. The CoDR for GMagAO-X was held in September 2021 and a preliminary design review is planned for early 2024. In this paper we will discuss the science cases and requirements for the overall architecture of GMagAO-X, as well as the current efforts to prototype the novel hardware components and new wavefront sensing and control concepts for GMagAO-X on HCAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Uncorrected wavefront errors create speckle noise in high-contrast observations at small inner-working angles. These speckles can be sensed and controlled by using coronagraph integrated wavefront sensors. Here, we will present how the Phase Induced Amplitude Apodized Complex Mask Corongraph (PIAACMC) can be integrated with both a Self-Coherent Camera (SCC) for focal plane wavefront sensing and an extremely sensitivity high-order pupil plane Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS). Non-common path aberrations can be completely erased by integrating both sensors into the PIAACMC, which is of extremely high importance in high-contrast imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 In data from the New Horizons encounter with Pluto in 2015, attention was called to a crater named Kiladze and its surroundings because of the water ice spectral properties, which contrast with the primarily methane ice regional surface composition. The water ice carries the spectral signature of an ammoniated compound, similar to that seen at two other sites on Pluto where cryovolcanism has been identified. The faulted structure of Kiladze, including shaping by numerous collapse pits and the distorted shape of the crater, are compatible with the surroundings in Hayabusa Terra, east of Spunik Planitia. They are further compatible with an interpretation as a resurgent caldera formed during a past era of active cryovolcanic period that appears to be significantly more recent than the overall age of the planet's surface, possibly in the last several million years. In view of the size of the caldera and the large scale of the surrounding distribution of water ice, we propose that Kiladze is a "supervolcano" in which one or more explosive events has scattered more than ~1000 km$^{3}$ of icy cryomagma erupted from the interior onto the surface.

 - **Abstract**
 RelativisticDynamics.jl is an open-source Julia package for relativistic spin-orbital dynamics in the gravitational strong-field of a Kerr spacetime. Existing codes for modelling the dynamics of spinning objects like pulsars in the strong-field regime are generally lacking, since such systems occupy an intermediate regime that is generally overlooked. At the "low" end of this regime there are post-Newtonian descriptions which neglect the influence of the pulsar spin on the underlying spacetime metric ("spin-curvature" coupling). At the "high" end there are the full numerical relativity solutions which are primarily applicable toe two black holes with a mass ratio $\mathcal{O}(1)$, and are computationally intractable for pulsar systems observed over a large number of orbital cycles. RelativisticDynamics.jl aims to bridge this gap by providing a modern, fast code for accurate numerical evolution of spinning relativistic systems via the Mathisson-Papetrou-Dixon formalism. Julia is a modern language that solves the "two language problem", enabling fast dynamic typing and JIT compilation on conjunction with petaflop performance, comparable with numerical languages that are better known in the astrophysics community such as C or Fortran. RelativisticDynamics.jl is written to be fully type flexible, being able to support arbitrary number formats, and fully differentiable via automatic differentiation.

 - **Abstract**
 While the most exciting explanation of the observed dust asymmetries in protoplanetary disks is the presence of protoplanets, other mechanisms can also form the dust features. This paper presents dual-wavelength Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of a large asymmetric dusty ring around the M-type star CIDA 9A. We detect a dust asymmetry in both 1.3 mm and 3.1 mm data. To characterize the asymmetric structure, a parametric model is used to fit the observed visibilities. We report a tentative azimuthal shift of the dust emission peaks between the observations at the two wavelengths. This shift is consistent with a dust trap caused by a vortex, which may be formed by an embedded protoplanet or other hydrodynamical instabilities, such as a dead zone. Deep high-spatial observations of dust and molecular gas are needed to constrain the mechanisms that formed the observed millimeter cavity and dust asymmetry in the protoplanetary disk around CIDA 9A.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the explicit role of negative local non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, in suppressing the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the single-field model of Galileon inflation. PBH formation requires significantly enhancing the scalar power spectrum, which greatly affects their abundance. The associated frequencies in the nHz regime are also sensitive to the generation of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) which may explain the current data from the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Our analysis using the threshold statistics on the compaction function demonstrates that Galileon theory not only avoids PBH overproduction using the curvature perturbation enhancements that give $f_{\rm NL} \sim {\cal O}(-6)$, but also generates SIGWs that conform well with the PTA data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program, that focuses on the characterization of planet forming disks in massive star forming regions. These regions are likely representative of the environment in which most planetary systems formed. Understanding the impact of environment on planet formation is critical in order to gain insights into the diversity of the observed exoplanet populations. XUE targets 15 disks in three areas of NGC 6357, which hosts numerous massive OB stars, among which some of the most massive stars in our Galaxy. Thanks to JWST we can, for the first time, study the effect of external irradiation on the inner ($< 10$ au), terrestrial-planet forming regions of proto-planetary disks. In this study, we report on the detection of abundant water, CO, CO$_2$, HCN and C$_2$H$_2$ in the inner few au of XUE 1, a highly irradiated disk in NGC 6357. In addition, small, partially crystalline silicate dust is present at the disk surface. The derived column densities, the oxygen-dominated gas-phase chemistry, and the presence of silicate dust are surprisingly similar to those found in inner disks located in nearby, relatively isolated low-mass star-forming regions. Our findings imply that the inner regions of highly irradiated disks can retain similar physical and chemical conditions as disks in low-mass star-forming regions, thus broadening the range of environments with similar conditions for inner disk rocky planet formation to the most extreme star-forming regions in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the first X-ray polarimetric observation of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1957+115, performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer IXPE in May 2023. The binary system resides in a high/soft spectral state since discovery and is thought to host a black hole. The $\sim$571 ks IXPE observation reveals a linear polarization degree of $1.9\% \pm 0.4$\% and a polarization angle of $-41.\!\!^\circ8 \pm 5.\!\!^\circ7$ in the 2-8 keV energy range. Spectral modelling is consistent with the dominant contribution from the standard accretion disc, while polarimetric data suggest a significant role of returning radiation, i.e. photons that are bent by strong gravity effects and forced to return to the disc surface, where they can be reflected before eventually reaching the observer. In this setting, we find that models with a black hole spin lower than 0.96 and inclination lower than 50$\hbox{$^\circ$}$ are disfavoured.

 - **Abstract**
 In warm (equilibrium temperature <1000 K) gas giant exoplanet atmospheres, the observation of trace species in abundances deviating from thermochemical equilibrium predictions could be used as an indicator of disequilibrium chemical processes, such as photochemistry. To predict which compounds could be used as such tracers, it is therefore essential to study how photochemical processes affect their abundances. For this purpose, we investigated experimentally the efficiency of the photochemical formation of hydrocarbons in gas mixtures representative of warm gas giant atmospheres as a function of the gas temperature at millibar pressures. We find that, compared to thermal reactions alone, photochemistry efficiently promotes, under the studied conditions, the formation of hydrocarbons, with the detection of acetylene, ethane, and propane, as well as carbon monoxide. Therefore, our results confirm the importance of photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres as a disequilibrium process. Ethane is the major hydrocarbon formed in our experiments, in apparent contradiction with the prediction by thermophotochemical models that acetylene should be the main hydrocarbon product. We also observe an evolution of the hydrocarbon production efficiency as a function of the temperature, a behavior not reproduced by a 0D thermophotochemical model. Additional studies are necessary to definitively understand the origin of the differences between the experimental and modeling results and to infer the importance of our results for understanding hydrocarbon formation in warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres. Finally, our work demonstrates the importance of experimental studies together with modeling studies to accurately interpret, understand, and predict observations of exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The Didymos binary asteroid was the target of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which intentionally impacted Dimorphos, the smaller member of the binary system. We used the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) instruments on JWST to measure the 0.6-5 $\mu$m and 5-20 $\mu$m spectra of Didymos approximately two months after the DART impact. These observations confirm that Didymos belongs to the S asteroid class and is most consistent with LL chondrite composition as was previously determined from its 0.6-2.5-$\mu$m reflectance spectrum. Measurements at wavelengths $>$ 2.5 $\mu$m show Didymos to have thermal properties typical for an S-complex asteroid of its size and to be lacking absorptions deeper than $\sim$2\% due to OH or H2O. Didymos' mid-infrared emissivity spectrum is within the range of what has been observed on S-complex asteroids observed with Spitzer Space Telescope and is most consistent with emission from small ($<$ 25 $\mu$m) surface particles. We conclude that the observed reflectance and physical properties make the Didymos system a good proxy for the type of ordinary chondrite asteroids that cross near-Earth space, and a good representative of likely future impactors.
#### Photospheric aluminium abundances of A-type main-sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 Although anomalous surface abundances are often observed in A-type main-sequence stars (known as chemically peculiar stars; e.g., metallic line stars or Am stars), our understanding about the behavior of aluminium is still insufficient. Actually, even whether Al is overabundant or underabundant in Am stars is not clarified. This is presumably because most of the previous studies employed the Al I 3944/3961 lines with the assumption of LTE, despite that a considerable non-LTE effect is expected in this resonance doublet. With an aim to shed light on this issue, extensive statistical-equilibrium calculations on Al I/Al II were carried out for a wide range of atmospheric parameters, based on which the non-LTE Al abundances were determined by applying the spectrum-fitting technique to the Al I 3944/3961 lines for 63 A-type dwarfs (7000 < Teff < 10000 K) of comparatively lower rotational velocities (vsini < 100 km/s). The following results were obtained. (1) The non-LTE corrections (Delta) are positive (reflecting the importance of overionization) and significantly large (0.3 < Delta < 1.0 dex depending on Teff; generally Delta_3944 < Delta_3961). (2) By applying these corrections (and indispensable inclusion of Balmer line wings as background opacity), consistent non-LTE abundances for both lines could be obtained, and the serious zero-point discrepancy (considerably negative [Al/H] for normal metallicity stars of [Fe/H]~ 0) found in old studies has been settled. (3) Al abundances of A-type stars are almost in proportion to [Fe/H] (tending to be overabundant in Am stars) with an approximate relation of [Al/H]~1.2[Fe/H]. which is qualitatively consistent with the prediction of the diffusion theory (suggesting an Al excess in the photosphere of Am stars).

 - **Abstract**
 Radial velocity surveys suggest that the Solar System may be unusual and that Jupiter-like planets have a frequency <20% around solar-type stars. However, they may be much more common in one of the closest associations in the solar neighbourhood. Young moving stellar groups are the best targets for direct imaging of exoplanets and four massive Jupiter-like planets have been already discovered in the nearby young beta Pic Moving Group (BPMG) via high-contrast imaging, and four others were suggested via high precision astrometry by the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite. Here we analyze 30 stars in BPMG and show that 20 of them might potentially host a Jupiter-like planet as their orbits would be stable. Considering incompleteness in observations, our results suggest that Jupiter-like planets may be more common than previously found. The next Gaia data release will likely confirm our prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of the stellar occultation by (UII) Umbriel on September 21st, 2020. The shadow crossed the USA and Canada, and 19 positive chords were obtained. A limb parameter accounted for putative topographic features in the limb fittings. Ellipse fittings were not robust - only upper limits were derived for the true size/shape of a putative Umbriel ellipsoid. The adopted spherical solution gives radius = 582.4 +/- 0.8 km, smaller/close to 584.7 +/- 2.8 km from Voyager II. The apparent ellipse fit results in a true semi-major axis of 584.9 +/- 3.8 km, semi-minor axes of 582.3 +/- 0.6 km and true oblateness of 0.004 +/- 0.008 for a putative ellipsoid. The geometric albedo was pV = 0.26 +/- 0.01. The density was rho = 1.54 +/- 0.04 g cm-3. The surface gravity was 0.251 +/- 0.006 m s-2 and the escape velocity 0.541 +/- 0.006 km s-1 . Upper limits of 13 and 72 nbar (at 1 sigma and 3 sigma levels, respectively) were obtained for the surface pressure of a putative isothermal CO2 atmosphere at T = 70 K. A milliarcsecond precision position was derived: RA = 02h 30m 28.84556s +/- 0.1 mas, DE = 14o 19' 36.5836" +/- 0.2 mas. A large limb parameter of 4.2 km was obtained, in striking agreement with opposite southern hemisphere measurements by Voyager II in 1986. Occultation and Voyager results indicate that the same strong topography variation in the surface of Umbriel is present on both hemispheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of a stochastic signal in the NANOGrav 15-year data set has aroused great interest in uncovering its origin. However, the evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlations, a key signature of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by general relativity, remains inconclusive. In this paper, we search for an isotropic non-tensorial GWB, allowed by general metric theories of gravity, in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Our analysis reveals a Bayes factor of approximately 2.5, comparing the quadrupolar (tensor transverse, TT) correlations to the scalar transverse (ST) correlations, suggesting that the ST correlations provide a comparable explanation for the observed stochastic signal in the NANOGrav data. We obtain the median and the $90\%$ equal-tail amplitudes as $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{ST} = 7.8^{+5.1}_{-3.5} \times 10^{-15}$ at the frequency of 1/year. Furthermore, we find that the vector longitudinal (VL) and scalar longitudinal (SL) correlations are weakly and strongly disfavoured by data, respectively, yielding upper limits on the amplitudes: $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{VL}^{95\%} \lesssim 1.7 \times 10^{-15}$ and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{SL}^{95\%} \lesssim 7.4 \times 10^{-17}$. Lastly, we fit the NANOGrav data with a general transverse (GT) correlations parameterized by a free parameter $\alpha$. Our analysis yields $\alpha=1.74^{+1.18}_{-1.41}$, thus excluding both the TT ($\alpha=3$) and ST ($\alpha=0$) models at the $90\%$ confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of f-mode frequencies has provided a measure of the radius of the Sun which is lower, by a few hundredths per cent, than the photospheric radius determined by direct optical measurement. Part of this difference can be understood by recognizing that it is primarily the variation of density well beneath the photosphere of the star that determines the structure of these essentially adiabatic oscillation modes, not some aspect of radiative intensity. In this paper we attempt to shed further light on the matter, by considering a differently defined, and dynamically more robust, seismic radius, namely one determined from p-mode frequencies. This radius is calibrated by the distance from the centre of the Sun to the position in the subphotospheric layers where the first derivative of the density scale height changes essentially discontinuously. We find that that radius is more- or-less consistent with what is suggested by the f modes. In addition, the interpretation of the radius inferred from p modes leads us to understand more deeply the role of the total mass constraint in the structure inversions. This enables us to reinterpret the sound-speed inversion, suggesting that the positions of the photosphere and the adiabatically stratified layers in the convective envelope differ nonhomologously from those of the standard solar model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Large spectroscopic surveys devoted to the study of the Milky Way, including Gaia, use automated pipelines to massively determine the atmospheric parameters of millions of stars. The Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars are reference stars with Teff and log g derived through fundamental relations, independently of spectroscopy, to be used as anchors for the parameter scale. The first and second versions of the sample have been extensively used for that purpose, and more generally to help constrain stellar models. Aims. We provide the third version of the Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars, an extended set intended to improve the calibration of spectroscopic surveys, and their interconnection. Methods. We have compiled about 200 candidates which have precise measurements of angular diameters and parallaxes. We determined their bolometric fluxes by fitting their spectral energy distribution. Masses were determined using two sets of stellar evolution models. In a companion paper we describe the determination of metallicities and detailed abundances. Results. We provide a new set of 192 Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars with their fundamental Teff and logg, and with uncertainties lower than 2% for most stars. Compared to the previous versions, the homogeneity and accuracy of the fundamental parameters are significantly improved thanks to the high quality of the Gaia data reflecting on distances and bolometric fluxes.
#### Shocking Sgr B2(N1) with its own outflow: A new perspective on  segregation between O- and N-bearing molecules

 - **Abstract**
 We want to investigate the influence of the powerful outflow driven by the hot core Sgr B2(N1) on the gas molecular inventory of the surrounding medium. We used the data taken as part of the 3 mm imaging spectral-line survey ReMoCA (Re-exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA). Integrated intensity maps of SO and SiO emission reveal a bipolar structure with blue-shifted emission dominantly extending to the SE from the centre of the hot core and red-shifted emission to the NW. This is also prominently observed in emission of other S-bearing molecules and species that only contain N as a heavy element, including COMs, but also CH3OH, CH3CHO, HNCO, and NH2CHO. For a selection of COMs and simpler species, spectra were modelled under the assumption of LTE and population diagrams were derived at two positions, one in each outflow lobe. From this analysis, we obtained rotational temperatures, which are in a range of ~100-200K, and column densities. Abundances were subsequently compared to predictions of astrochemical models and to observations of L1157-B1, a position located in the well-studied outflow of the low-mass protostar L1157, and the source G+0.693-0.027, located in the Sgr B2 molecular cloud complex. Given the short distance of the analysed outflow positions to the centre of Sgr B2(N1), we propose a scenario in which a phase of hot-core chemistry (i.e. thermal desorption of ice species and high-temperature gas-phase chemistry) preceded a shock wave. The subsequent compression and further heating of the material resulted in the accelerated destruction of (mainly O-bearing) molecules. Gas-phase formation of cyanides seems to be able to compete with their destruction in the post-shock gas. Abundances of HCnN (n=3,5) are enhanced in the outflow component pointing to (additional) gas-phase formation. To confirm such a scenario, appropriate chemical shock models need to be run.

 In this paper, we investigate the scalar-induced gravitational waves in single-field non-attractor inflation for the Pulsar Timing Arrays data. Our model comprises three phases of inflation: the first and third phases are slow-roll inflation, while the second phase is a period of non-attractor inflation. We analyze the model's predictions for various values of the sound speed $c_s$ and examine the sharp transitions to the final attractor phase. Furthermore, we study the model's predictions for NANOGrav observations and future gravitational wave observations. We also calculate the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$ for the non-attractor setup with a general sound speed and the sharpness parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 Aqueous chemistry within carbonaceous planetesimals is promising for synthesizing prebiotic organic matter essential to all life. Meteorites derived from these planetesimals delivered these life building blocks to the early Earth, potentially facilitating the origins of life. Here, we studied the formation of vitamin B$_3$ as it is an important precursor of the coenzyme NAD(P)(H), which is essential for the metabolism of all life as we know it. We propose a new reaction mechanism based on known experiments in the literature that explains the synthesis of vitamin B$_3$. It combines the sugar precursors glyceraldehyde or dihydroxyacetone with the amino acids aspartic acid or asparagine in aqueous solution without oxygen or other oxidizing agents. We performed thermochemical equilibrium calculations to test the thermodynamic favorability. The predicted vitamin B$_3$ abundances resulting from this new pathway were compared with measured values in asteroids and meteorites. We conclude that competition for reactants and decomposition by hydrolysis are necessary to explain the prebiotic content of meteorites. In sum, our model fits well into the complex network of chemical pathways active in this environment.
