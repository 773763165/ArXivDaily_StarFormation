 - **Abstract**
 We present the new Guided Moments ($\texttt{GM}$) formalism for neutrino modeling in astrophysical scenarios like core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The truncated moments approximation ($\texttt{M1}$) and Monte-Carlo ($\texttt{MC}$) schemes have been proven to be robust and accurate in solving the Boltzmann's equation for neutrino transport. However, it is well-known that each method exhibits specific strengths and weaknesses in various physical scenarios. The $\texttt{GM}$ formalism effectively solves these problems, providing a comprehensive scheme capable of accurately capturing the optically thick limit through the exact $\texttt{M1}$ closure and the optically thin limit through a $\texttt{MC}$ based approach. In addition, the $\texttt{GM}$ method also approximates the neutrino distribution function with a reasonable computational cost, which is crucial for the correct estimation of the different neutrino-fluid interactions. Our work provides a comprehensive discussion of the formulation and application of the $\texttt{GM}$ method, concluding with a thorough comparison across several test problems involving the three schemes ($\texttt{M1}$, $\texttt{MC}$, $\texttt{GM}$) under consideration.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we constrain the star-forming properties of all possible sites of incipient high-mass star formation in the Milky Way's Galactic Center. We identify dense structures using the CMZoom 1.3mm dust continuum catalog of objects with typical radii of $\sim$0.1pc, and measure their association with tracers of high-mass star formation. We incorporate compact emission at 8, 21, 24, 25, and 70um from MSX, Spitzer, Herschel, and SOFIA, catalogued young stellar objects, and water and methanol masers to characterize each source. We find an incipient star formation rate (SFR) for the CMZ of ~0.08 Msun yr^{-1} over the next few 10^5 yr. We calculate upper and lower limits on the CMZ's incipient SFR of ~0.45 Msun yr^{-1} and ~0.05 Msun yr^{-1} respectively, spanning between roughly equal to and several times greater than other estimates of CMZ's recent SFR. Despite substantial uncertainties, our results suggest the incipient SFR in the CMZ may be higher than previously estimated. We find that the prevalence of star formation tracers does not correlate with source volume density, but instead ~75% of high-mass star formation is found in regions above a column density ratio (N_{SMA}/N_{Herschel}) of ~1.5. Finally, we highlight the detection of ``atoll sources'', a reoccurring morphology of cold dust encircling evolved infrared sources, possibly representing HII regions in the process of destroying their envelopes.
#### Unsupervised Searches for Cosmological Parity-Violation: An  Investigation with Convolutional Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of the $4$-point correlation functions (4PCF) from spectroscopic surveys provide evidence for parity-violations in the large-scale structure of the Universe. If physical in origin, this could point to exotic physics during the epoch of inflation. However, searching for parity-violations in the 4PCF signal relies on a large suite of simulations to perform a rank test, or an accurate model of the 4PCF covariance to claim a detection, and this approach is incapable of extracting parity information from the higher-order $N$-point functions. In this work we present an unsupervised method which overcomes these issues, before demonstrating the approach is capable of detecting parity-violations in a few toy models using convolutional neural networks. This technique is complementary to the 4-point method and could be used to discover parity-violations in several upcoming surveys including DESI, Euclid and Roman.
#### WRAP: A Tool for Efficient Cross-Identification of Proper Motion Objects  Spanning Multiple Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Wide-field Retrieval of Astrodata Program (WRAP), a tool created to aid astronomers in gathering photometric and astrometric data for point sources that may confuse simple cross-matching algorithms because of their faintness or motion. WRAP allows astronomers to correctly cross-identify objects with proper motion across multiple surveys by wedding the catalog data with its underlying images, thus providing visual confirmation of cross-associations in real time. Developed within the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project, WRAP aims to aid in the characterization of faint, high motion sources by this collaboration (and others).

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of isolated self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos that undergo gravothermal collapse and are driven deep into the short-mean-free-path regime. We assume spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos as initial conditions and allow for elastic dark matter self-interactions. We discuss the structure of the halo core deep in the core-collapsed regime and how it depends on the particle physics properties of dark matter, in particular, the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section. We find an approximate universality deep in this regime that allows us to connect the evolution in the short- and long-mean-free-path regimes, and approximately map the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross sections to constant ones for the full gravothermal evolution. We provide a semi-analytic prescription based on our numerical results for halo evolution deep in the core-collapsed regime. Our results are essential for estimating the masses of the black holes that are likely to be left in the core of SIDM halos.

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of this work is to obtain a Hubble constant estimate through the study of the quadruply lensed, variable QSO SDSSJ1433+6007. To achieve this we combine multi-filter, archival $\textit{HST}$ data for lens modelling and a dedicated time delay monitoring campaign with the 2.1m Fraunhofer telescope at the $\textit{Wendelstein Observatory}$. The lens modelling is carried out with the public $\texttt{lenstronomy}$ Python package for each of the filters individually. Through this approach, we find that the data in one of the $\textit{HST}$ filters (F160W) contain a light contaminant, that would, if remained undetected, have severely biased the lensing potentials and thus our cosmological inference. After rejecting these data we obtain a combined posterior for the Fermat potential differences from the lens modelling in the remaining filters (F475X, F814W, F105W and F140W) with a precision of $\sim6\%$. The analysis of the $\textit{g'}$-band Wendelstein light curve data is carried out with a free-knot spline fitting method implemented in the public Python $\texttt{PyCS3}$ tools. The precision of the time delays between the QSO images has a range between 7.5 and 9.8$\%$ depending on the brightness of the images and their time delay. We then combine the posteriors for the Fermat potential differences and time delays. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we infer a Hubble parameter of $H_0=76.6^{+7.7}_{-7.0}\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{Mpc\;s}}$, reaching $9.6\%$ uncertainty for a single system.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09440
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the machine learning (ML) methods for reconstructing distance-redshift relation from the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a cosmology-independent way. The A219 GRB data set at low redshift are used to calibrate the Amati relation ($E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\rm iso}$) relation by the ML methods selected with the best performance %and the calibrated results are extrapolated to the high redshift data to construct the Hubble diagram at high redshift. We constrain cosmological models via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method with the GRBs at high redshift and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD). By the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) methods, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.29^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$, $h$ = $0.66^{+0.04}_{-0.07}$ , $w_0$ = $-0.83^{+0.66}_{-0.31}$, $w_a$ = $-0.91^{+0.87}_{-0.46}$ at 1-$\sigma$ confidence level for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model in a flat space, which favor the dark energy with a possible evolution ($w_a\neq0$) at 1-$\sigma$. These results are consistent with those obtained from GRBs calibrated via the Gaussian Process.
#### Model-independent confirmation of a constant speed of light over  cosmological distances

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09458
 - **Abstract**
 Recent attempts at measuring the variation of $c$ using an assortment of standard candles and the redshift-dependent Hubble expansion rate inferred from the currently available catalog of cosmic chronometers have tended to show that the speed of light appears to be constant, at least up to $z\sim 2$. A notable exception is the use of high-redshift UV $+$ X-ray quasars, whose Hubble diagram seems to indicate a $\sim 2.7\sigma$ deviation of c from its value $c_0$ ($\equiv 2.99792458 \times 10^{10}$ cm s$^{-1}$) on Earth. We show in this paper, however, that this anomaly is due to an error in the derived relation between the luminosity distance, $D_L$, and $H(z)$ when $c$ is allowed to vary with redshift, and an imprecise calibration of the quasar catalog. When these deficiences are addressed correctly, one finds that $c/c_0=0.95 \pm 0.14$ in the redshift range $0\lesssim z\lesssim 2$, fully consistent with zero variation within the measurement errors.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects of general relativity (GR) on the evolution and alignment of circumbinary disks around binaries on all scales. We implement relativistic apsidal precession of the binary into the hydrodynamics code {\sc phantom}. We find that the effects of GR can suppress the stable polar alignment of a circumbinary disk, depending on how the relativistic binary apsidal precession timescale compares to the disk nodal precession timescale. Studies of circumbinary disk evolution typically ignore the effects of GR which is an appropriate simplification for low mass or widely separated binary systems. In this case, polar alignment occurs providing that the disks initial misalignment is sufficiently large. However, systems with a very short relativistic precession timescale cannot polar align and instead move toward coplanar alignment. In the intermediate regime where the timescales are similar, the outcome depends upon the properties of the disk. Polar alignment is more likely in the wavelike disk regime (where the disk viscosity parameter is less than the aspect ratio, $\alpha<H/r$) since the disk is in good radial communication. In the viscous disk regime disk breaking is more likely. Multiple rings can destructively interact with one another resulting in short disk lifetimes, and the disk moving towards coplanar alignment. Around main-sequence star or stellar mass black hole binaries, polar alignment may be suppressed far from the binary but in general the inner parts of the disk can align to polar. Polar alignment may be completely suppressed for disks around supermassive black holes for close binary separations.
#### Doppler imaging of a southern ApSi star HD 152564

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the spectroscopic study of a chemically peculiar star HD 152564. Using medium-resolution ($R=37000$) observations obtained with the HRS spectrograph mounted on the South African Large Telescope we determined atmospheric parameters T$_{eff}$=11950$\pm200$ K and log g=3.6$\pm0.2$ dex. Abundance analysis revealed mild deficiency of the light elements and an overabundance of up to $\sim$2 dex of metals with greatest excess for the silicon. With these characteristics HD 152564 is a typical member of the silicon subgroup of Ap stars. Rotational modulation of the light curve and line profiles of HD 152564 are typical for inhomogeneous surface distribution of elements in its atmosphere. We performed multi-element Doppler imaging of the HD 152564 surface. Abundance maps constructed for He, O, Mg, Si, and Fe revealed concentration of these elements in a sequence of equatorial spots as well as in the circumpolar rings. The photometric maximum of the light curve coincided with the visibility of two most overabundant silicon spots. Abundances determined from the different ionisation stages of Fe and Si show clear evidence for vertical stratification of these elements in HD 152564 atmosphere. Meanwhile, the horizontal distribution of silicon reconstructed from the lines of different ionisation stages and excitation energies appeared to be identical with increasing average abundance deeper in atmosphere.
#### The bright black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543--47 during 2021 outburst: a  thick accretion disk inflated by high luminosity

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole X-ray binary source 4U 1543--47 experienced a super-Eddington outburst in 2021, reaching a peak flux of up to $\sim1.96\times10^{-7}\rm erg\ \rm cm^{-2}\ \rm s^{-1}$ ($\sim 8.2$ Crab) in the 2--10\,keV band. Soon after the outburst began, it rapidly transitioned into the soft state. Our goal is to understand how the accretion disk structure deviates from a standard thin disk when the accretion rate is near Eddington. To do so, we analyzed spectra obtained from quasi-simultaneous observations conducted by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT), the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). These spectra are well-fitted by a model comprising a disk, a weak corona, and a reflection component. We suggest that the reflection component is caused by disk self-irradiation, that is by photons emitted from the inner disk which return to the accretion disk surface, as their trajectories are bent by the strong gravity field. In this scenario, the best-fitting parameters imply that the reflected flux represents more than half of the total flux. Using general relativistic ray-tracing simulations, we show that this scenario is viable when the disk becomes geometrically thick, with a funnel-like shape, as the accretion rate is near or above the Eddington limit. In the specific case of 4U 1543--47, an angle $\gtrsim$ 45 deg between the disk surface and the equatorial plane can explain the required amount of self-irradiation.
#### Atomic Diffusion and Mixing in Old Stars VIII: Chemical abundance  variations in the globular cluster M4 (NGC 6121)

 - **Abstract**
 Variations in chemical abundances with evolutionary phase have been identified among stars in globular and open clusters with a wide range of metallicities. In the metal-poor clusters, these variations compare well with predictions from stellar structure and evolution models considering the internal diffusive motions of atoms and ions, collectively known as atomic diffusion, when moderated by an additional mixing process with a fine-tuned efficiency. We present here an investigation of these effects in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6121 (M4) ([Fe/H] = -1.13) through a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 86 stars using high-resolution ESO/VLT FLAMES spectroscopy. The stars range from the main-sequence turnoff point (TOP) to the red giant branch (RGB) just above the bump. We identify C-N-O and Mg-Al-Si abundance anti-correlations, and confirm the presence of a bimodal population differing by 1 dex in nitrogen abundance. The composition of the second-generation stars imply pollution from both massive (20-40 Msol) and asymptotic giant branch stars. We find evolutionary variations in chemical abundances between the TOP and RGB, which are robust to uncertainties in stellar parameters and modelling assumptions. The variations are weak, but match predictions well when employing efficient additional mixing. Without correcting for Galactic production of lithium, we derive an initial lithium abundance 2.63+-0.10, which is marginally lower than the predicted primordial BBN value.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly continuous, densely sampled, space-based photometry allows us to recover the finest details in the light variations of stars. The number of such light curves have been increasing rapidly in the last few years thanks to the extended mission of the Kepler space telescope and the launch of the TESS mission. This new era brings us new perspectives in RR Lyrae and Cepheid studies, where low amplitude phenomena can be studied in a wide range of individual stars and on a statistical basis. In this proceedings I review the recent investigations of the Kepler, K2 and TESS fields, as well as the challenges in accurately reducing high-quality photometry.
#### Improved models for near-Earth asteroids (2100) Ra-Shalom, (3103) Eger,  (12711) Tukmit & (161989) Cacus

 - **Abstract**
 We present 24 new dense lightcurves of the near-Earth asteroids (3103) Eger, (161989) Cacus, (2100) Ra-Shalom and (12711) Tukmit, obtained with the Instituto Astrof\'isico Canarias 80 and Telescopio Abierto Remoto 2 telescopes at the Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Spain) during 2021 and 2022, in the framework of projects visible NEAs observations survey and NEO Rapid Observation, Characterization and Key Simulations. The shape models and rotation state parameters ($P$, $\lambda$, $\beta$) were computed by applying the lightcurve inversion method to the new data altogether with the archival data. For (3013) Eger and (161989) Cacus, our shape models and rotation state parameters agree with previous works, though they have smaller uncertainties. For (2100) Ra-Shalom, our results also agree with previous studies. Still, we find that a Yarkovsky - O'Keefe - Radzievskii - Paddack acceleration of $\upsilon = (0.223\pm0.237)\times10^{-8}$ rad d$^{-2}$ slightly improves the fit of the lightcurves, suggesting that (2100) Ra-Shalom could be affected by this acceleration. We also present for the first time a shape model for (12711) Tukmit, along with its rotation state parameters ($P=3.484900 \pm 0.000031$ hr, $\lambda = 27^{\circ}\pm 8^{\circ}$, $\beta = 9^{\circ} \pm 15^{\circ}$).

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate non-gravitational signals of dark energy within the framework of gauge symmetry in the dark energy sector. Traditionally, dark energy has been primarily studied through gravitational effects within general relativity or its extensions. On the other hand, the gauge principles have played a central role in the standard model sector and dark matter sector. If the dark energy field operates under a gauge symmetry, it introduces the possibility of studying all major components of the present universe under the same gauge principle. This approach marks a significant shift from conventional methodologies, offering a new avenue to explore dark energy.

 A semi-empirical IR/Vis line list, SOLIS, for the sulphur monoxide molecule $^{32}$S$^{16}$O is presented. SOLIS includes accurate empirical rovibrational energy levels, uncertainties, lifetimes, quantum number assignments, and transition probabilities in the form of Einstein $A$ coefficients covering the $X\,{}^{3}\Sigma^{-}$, $a\,{}^{1}\Delta^{ }$, $b\,{}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$, $A\,{}^{3}\Pi$, $B\,{}^{3}\Sigma^{-}$, $X\,{}^{\prime\prime3}\Sigma^{+}$, $A\,{}^{\prime 3}\Delta$ and $e\,{}^{1}\Pi$ systems and wavenumber range up to 43303.5 cm$^{-1}$ ($\geq 230.93$ nm) with $J\le 69$. SOLIS has been computed by solving the rovibronic Schr\"{o}dinger equation for diatomics using the general purpose variational code Duo and starting from a published ab initio spectroscopic model of SO (including potential energy curves, coupling curves, (transition) dipole moment curves) which is refined to experimental data. To this end, a database of 50106 experimental transitions, 48972 being non-redundant, has been compiled through the analysis of 29 experimental sources, and a self-consistent network of 8558 rovibronic energy levels for the $X$, $a$, $b$, $A$, $B$, and $C$ electronic states has been generated with the MARVEL algorithm covering rotational and vibrational quantum numbers $J \leq 69$ and $v \leq 30$ and energies up to 52350.40 cm$^{-1}$. No observed transitions connect to the $ B\,{}^{3}\Sigma^{-} (v = 0)$ state which is required to model perturbations correctly, so we leave fitting the $B\,{}^3\Sigma^-$ and $C\,{}^3\Pi$ state UV model to a future project. The SO line list is available at ExoMol from www.exomol.com.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) outside of its main body is characterised by tidal branches resulting from its interactions mainly with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Characterising the stellar populations in these tidal components helps to understand the dynamical history of this galaxy and of the Magellanic system in general. We provide full phase-space vector information for Southern Bridge clusters. We performed a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of twelve SMC clusters, doubling the number of SMC clusters with full phase-space vector information known to date. We reclassify the sample considering 3D distances and 3D velocities. We found that some of the clusters classified as Southern Bridge objects according to the projected 2D classification actually belong to the Main Body and Counter-Bridge in the background. The comparison of the kinematics of the genuine foreground Bridge clusters with those previously analysed in the same way reveals that Southern Bridge clusters are moving towards the LMC and share the kinematics of the Northern Bridge. Adding to our sample clusters from the literature with CaT metallicity determinations we compare the age-metallicity relation of the Southern Bridge with the one of the Northern Bridge. We reinforce the idea that both regions do not seem to have experienced the same chemical enrichment history and that there is a clear absence of clusters in the Northern Bridge older than 3Gyr and more metal-poor than -1.1, which would not seem to be due to a selection effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Detection of the faint 21 cm line emission from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation will require not only exquisite control over instrumental calibration and systematics to achieve the necessary dynamic range of observations but also validation of analysis techniques to demonstrate their statistical properties and signal loss characteristics. A key ingredient in achieving this is the ability to perform high-fidelity simulations of the kinds of data that are produced by the large, many-element, radio interferometric arrays that have been purpose-built for these studies. The large scale of these arrays presents a computational challenge, as one must simulate a detailed sky and instrumental model across many hundreds of frequency channels, thousands of time samples, and tens of thousands of baselines for arrays with hundreds of antennas. In this paper, we present a fast matrix-based method for simulating radio interferometric measurements (visibilities) at the necessary scale. We achieve this through judicious use of primary beam interpolation, fast approximations for coordinate transforms, and a vectorised outer product to expand per-antenna quantities to per-baseline visibilities, coupled with standard parallelisation techniques. We validate the results of this method, implemented in the publicly-available matvis code, against a high-precision reference simulator, and explore its computational scaling on a variety of problems.

 - **Abstract**
 XTE J1946+274 is a Be/X-ray binary with a 15.8s spin period and 172 d orbital period. Using $\textit{RXTE/PCA}$ data of the 1998 outburst, a cyclotron line around 37 keV was reported. The presence of this line, its dependence on the pulse phase, and its variation with luminosity have been of some debate since. In this work, we present the reanalysis of two $\textit{AstroSat}$ observations: one made during the rising phase of the 2018 outburst and the other during the declining phase of the 2021 outburst. We also present a new analysis of the $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT observations of the source at the peak of the 2018 outburst. We find the source to be spinning up over the course of the outburst and spinning down between the two outbursts. We report the presence of a higher cyclotron line energy using the 2018 $\textit{AstroSat}$ observation ($\sim 45$ keV) and 2018 $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT observation ($\sim$ 50 keV) and a line at $\sim$ 40 keV during the declining phase of the 2021 outburst using data from $\textit{AstroSat}$. We also investigate the pulse phase dependence of the cyclotron line parameters and find that the line is significantly detected in all the phases of both $\textit{AstroSat}$ observations, along with showing variation with the pulse phase. This differs from the previous results reported using $\textit{BeppoSAX}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. We explain this behaviour of the cyclotron line to be due to photon spawning and different accretion column radii at the two poles of this neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated analysis of eleven cosmological models that may help reduce the Hubble tension, which now reaches the $6\sigma$ level when considering the latest SH0ES measurement versus recent CMB and BAO data, assuming $\Lambda$CDM. Specifically, we look at five classical extensions of $\Lambda$CDM (with massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, free-streaming or self-interacting relativistic relics, or dynamical dark energy) and six elaborate models featuring either a time-varying electron mass, early dark energy or some non-trivial interactions in the neutrino sector triggered by a light Majoron. We improve over previous works in several ways. We include the latest data from the South Pole Telescope as well as the most recent measurement of the Hubble rate by the SH0ES collaboration. We treat the summed neutrino mass as a free parameter in most of our models, which reveals interesting degeneracies and constraints. We define additional metrics to assess the potential of a model to reduce or even solve the Hubble tension. We validate an emulator that uses active learning to train itself during each parameter inference run for any arbitrary model. We find that the time-varying electron mass and the Majoron models are now ruled out at more than $3\sigma$. Models with a time-varying electron mass and spatial curvature or with early dark energy reduce the tension to 1.0-2.9$\sigma$. Nevertheless, none of the models considered in this work is favored with enough statistical significance to become the next concordance model of Cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 In X-ray observations of hard state black hole X-ray binaries, rapid variations in accretion disc and coronal power-law emission are correlated and show Fourier-frequency-dependent time lags. On short (~0.1 s) time-scales, these lags are thought to be due to reverberation and therefore may depend strongly on the geometry of the corona. Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are variations in X-ray flux that have been suggested to arise because of geometric changes in the corona, possibly due to General Relativistic Lense-Thirring precession. Therefore one might expect the short-term time lags to vary on the QPO time-scale. We performed novel spectral-timing analyses on NICER observations of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during the hard state of its outburst in 2018 to investigate how the short-term time lags between a disc-dominated and a coronal power-law-dominated energy band vary on different time-scales. Our method can distinguish between variability due to the QPO and broadband noise, and we find a linear correlation between the power-law flux and lag amplitude that is strongest at the QPO frequency. We also introduce a new method to resolve the QPO signal and determine the QPO-phase-dependence of the flux and lag variations, finding that both are very similar. Our results are consistent with a geometric origin of QPOs, but also provide evidence for a dynamic corona with a geometry varying in a similar way over a broad range of time-scales, not just the QPO time-scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to investigate the stellar population properties, ages, and metal content of the globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 3311, the central galaxy of the Hydra I cluster, to better constrain its evolution history. Methods. We used integral-field spectroscopic data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to identify 680 sources in the central region of NGC 3311 and extract their 1D spectra. An analysis of these sources in terms of morphologies, radial velocities, and emission lines allowed us to narrow down our selection to 49 bona fide GC candidates. We split these candidates into two groups depending on their projected distance to the galaxy center (R), namely inner (R<20arcsec) and outer (R>20arcsec) GCs. We stacked the extracted 1D spectra of the inner and outer GC populations to increase the signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) of the resulting spectra and hence allow full-spectrum fitting. In addition, we also created a stacked spectrum of all GCs in NGC 3311 and one of the two most central GC candidates. Using the code pPXF, we performed a stellar population analysis on the four stacked 1D spectra, obtaining mass-weighted integrated ages, metallicities, and [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances. Results. All GCs are old, with ages >13.5 Gyr, and they have super-solar metallicities. Looking at the color distribution, we find that the inner ones tend to be redder and more metal rich than the outer ones. This is consistent with the two-phase formation scenario. Looking at the full-spectral fitting results, at face value the outer GCs have a larger [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio, which is in line with what is found for the stars that dominate the surface brightness profile at the same radii. However, the values for outer and inner GCs are consistent within the uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The disagreement between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble parameter is emerging as a serious tension that challenges the standard model of cosmology. Here we focus not on the tension itself, but on a model-independent view of the Hubble parameter in a general spacetime. We define a covariant Hubble parameter that is in principle observable on the past lightcone. Then we present a careful analysis of the transformation of the Hubble parameter under a change of observer. To leading order in relative velocity, a moving observer will measure the same monopole and quadrupole as a matter-frame observer, but will also detect a dipole, generated by Doppler and aberration effects. The aberrated contribution to the dipole is neglected in a standard perturbative analysis. In order to connect the Hubble parameter to observables, we develop a covariant analysis of cosmic distances and their behaviour under boosts. This reveals that the standard relation between the Hubble parameter and luminosity distance is not invariant under boosts and holds only in the matter frame. A moving observer should correct the luminosity distance by a redshift factor -- otherwise an incorrect dipole and a spurious octupole are detected. In a standard perturbative analysis, this error leads to a false prediction of {\em no} dipole.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are helium core burning stars that have lost almost their entire hydrogen envelope due to binary interaction. Their assumed canonical mass of $\rm M_{\mathrm{sdB}}\sim0.47 M_{\odot}$ has recently been debated given a broad range found both from observations as well as from the simulations. Here, we revise and refine the mass range for sdBs derived two decades ago with the Eggleton code, using the stellar evolution code MESA, and discuss the effects of metallicity and the inclusion of core overshooting during the main sequence. We find an excellent agreement for low-mass progenitors, up to $\sim2.0 \rm M_{\odot}$. For stars more massive than $\sim2.5 \rm M_{\odot}$ we obtain a wider range of sdB masses compared to the simulations from the literature. Our MESA models for the lower metallicity predict, on average, slightly more massive sdBs. Finally, we show the results for the sdB lifetime as a function of sdB mass and discuss the effect this might have in the comparison between simulations and observational samples. This study paves the way for reproducing the observed Galactic mass distribution of sdB binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The accurate reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps and the measurement of its power spectrum are crucial for studying the early universe. In this paper, we implement a convolutional neural network to apply the Wiener Filter to CMB temperature maps, and use it intensively to compute an optimal quadratic estimation of the power spectrum. Our neural network has a UNet architecture as that implemented in WienerNet, but with novel aspects such as being written in python 3 and TensorFlow 2. It also includes an extra channel for the noise variance map, to account for inhomogeneous noise, and a channel for the mask. The network is very efficient, overcoming the bottleneck that is typically found in standard methods to compute the Wiener Filter, such as those that apply the conjugate gradient. It scales efficiently with the size of the map, making it a useful tool to include in CMB data analysis. The accuracy of the Wiener Filter reconstruction is satisfactory, as compared with the standard method. We heavily use this approach to efficiently estimate the power spectrum, by performing a simulation-based analysis of the optimal quadratic estimator. We further evaluate the quality of the reconstructed maps in terms of the power spectrum and find that we can properly recover the statistical properties of the signal. We find that the proposed architecture can account for inhomogeneous noise efficiently. Furthermore, increasing the complexity of the variance map presents a more significant challenge for the convergence of the network than the noise level does.

 Context. Accreting ultracompact binaries contain a white dwarf that is accreting from a degenerate object and have orbital periods shorter than 65 minutes. Aims. The aims of this letter are to report the discovery and the orbital period of four new eclipsing accreting ultracompact binaries found using the Zwicky Transient Facility, and to discuss their photometric properties. Methods. We searched through a list of 4171 dwarf novae compiled using the Zwicky Transient Facility and used the Box Least Square method to search for periodic signals in the data. Results. We found four new eclipsing accreting ultracompact binaries with orbital periods between 25.9-56 minutes, one of which is previously published as an AM CVn, while the other three systems are new discoveries. The other two shorter period systems are likely also AM CVn systems, while the longest period system with a period of 56 minutes shows multiple super-outbursts observed in two years which is more consistent with it being a Helium-CV.
#### The anomaly of the CMB power with the latest Planck data

 - **Abstract**
 The lack of power anomaly is an unexpected feature observed at large angular scales in the CMB maps by the COBE, WMAP and Planck satellites. This signature, which consists in a missing of power with respect to that predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model, might hint at a new cosmological phase before the standard inflationary era. The main point of this paper is taking the latest Planck polarisation data into account to investigate how CMB polarisation improves the understanding of this feature. With this aim, we apply to the last Planck data, both PR3 (2018) and PR4 (2020) releases, a new class of estimators able to evaluate this anomaly considering temperature and polarisation data both separately and in a jointly way. This is the first time that the PR4 dataset is used to study this anomaly. In order to critically evaluate this feature, taking into account the residuals of known systematic effects present in the Planck datasets, we analyse the cleaned CMB maps using different combinations of sky masks, harmonic range and binning on the CMB multipoles. Our analysis shows that the estimator based only on temperature data confirms the presence of a lack of power with a lower-tail-probability (LTP), depending on the component separation method, $\leq 0.33\%$ and $\leq 1.76\%$, for PR3 and PR4 respectively. To our knowledge the $LTP \leq 0.33\%$ for the PR3 dataset is the lowest one present in the literature obtained from Planck 2018 data considering the Planck confidence mask. We find significant differences between these two datasets when polarisation is taken into account. However, we also show that for the PR3 dataset the inclusion of the subdominant polarisation information provides estimates which are less likely accepted in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model than the only-temperature analysis on the whole harmonic-range considered.
