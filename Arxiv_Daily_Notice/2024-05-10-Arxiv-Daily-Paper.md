#### Title:
          Torsion-rotational transitions in methanol as a probe of fundamental physical constants -- electron and proton masses

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the using of torsion-rotational transitions in the CH3OH and (13)CH3OH molecules to evaluate possible variations of the physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - from spectral observations of emission lines detected in the microwave range towards the dense molecular cloud Orion-KL. An estimate of the upper limit on the relative changes in mu is obtained by two independent ways - with (13)CH3OH lines and with the combination of (13)CH3OH and CH3OH lines. The calculated upper limit Delta mu/mu < 1.1*10^{-8} (1 sigma) is in line with the most stringent constraints on the variability of fundamental physical constants established by other astrophysical methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this project is to recover the CMB anisotropies maps in temperature and polarized intensity by means of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which, after appropiate training, can remove the foregrounds from Planck and QUIJOTE data. The results are then compared with those obtained by COMMANDER, based on Bayesian parametric component separation. The CNN successfully recovered the CMB signal for both All Sky and Partial Sky maps showing frequency dependant results, being optimum for central frequencies where there is less contamination by foregrounds emissions such as galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Recovered maps in temperature are consistent with those obtained by Planck Collaboration, while polarized intensity has been recovered as a new observable. The polarized intensity maps recovered from QUIJOTE experiment are novel and of potential interest to the scientific community for the detection of primordial gravitational waves. The way forward will be to recover the maps at higher NSIDE and make them available to the scientific community.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the orbit of the binary system powering the most extreme ultraluminous X-ray pulsar known to date: NGC 5907 ULX-1 (hereafter ULX1). ULX1 has been the target of a substantial multi-instrument campaign, mainly in the X-ray band, but no clear counterparts are known in other bands. Although ULX1 is highly variable and pulsations can be transient (regardless of the source flux), the timing data collected so far allow us to investigate the orbit of this system. We find an orbital period $P_{orb}=5.7^{+0.1}_{-0.6}\text{ d}$ and a projected semi-axis $A_1 =3.1^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\text{ lts}$. The most likely ephemeris is: $P_{orb}=5.6585(6)\text{ d}$, $A_1 = 3.1(4)\text{ lts}$, and the epoch of ascending nodes passage is: $T_{asc} = 57751.37(5)\text{ MJD}$. However, there are 6 similar solutions, acceptable within $3\,\sigma$. We find further indications that ULX1 is a high-mass X-ray binary. This implies that we are observing its orbit face-on, with an inclination $<5\text{ deg}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mergers and accretion events have been crucial in shaping the evolution of the Milky Way (MW). These events have been dynamically identified and chemically characterised using red giants and main-sequence stars. RR Lyrae (RRL) variables can play a crucial role in tracing the early formation of the MW since they are ubiquitous, old (t$\ge$10 Gyr) low-mass stars and accurate distance indicators. We exploited Data Release 3 of the GALAH survey to identify 78 field RRLs suitable for chemical analysis. Using synthetic spectra calculations, we determined atmospheric parameters and abundances of Fe, Mg, Ca, Y, and Ba. Most of our stars exhibit halo-like chemical compositions, with an iron peak around [Fe/H]$\approx -$1.40, and enhanced Ca and Mg content. Notably, we discovered a metal-rich tail, with [Fe/H] values ranging from $-$1 to approximately solar metallicity. This sub-group includes almost ~1/4 of the sample, it is characterised by thin disc kinematics and displays sub-solar $\alpha$-element abundances, marginally consistent with the majority of the MW stars. Surprisingly, they differ distinctly from typical MW disc stars in terms of the s-process elements Y and Ba. We took advantage of similar data available in the literature and built a total sample of 535 field RRLs for which we estimated kinematical and dynamical properties. We found that metal-rich RRLs (1/3 of the sample) likely represent an old component of the MW thin disc. We also detected RRLs with retrograde orbits and provided preliminary associations with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Helmi, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and Thamnos stellar streams.

          Characterizing Exoplanetary Atmospheres: New Views on Exoplanet Composition and Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 I review the major open science questions in exoplanet atmospheres. These are mainly focused in the areas of understanding atmospheric physics, the atmosphere as a window into other realms of planetary physics, and the atmosphere is a window into understanding planet formation. For gas giant planets, high quality spectra have been delivered from JWST and from the ground, enabling the determination of atmospheric abundances. For the very common sub-Neptune planets, we are just beginning to obtain and interpret JWST spectra. For the terrestrial planets, which can be studied only around M stars, the field aims to determine if these planets even have long-lived atmospheres.

          UltraDark.jl: A Julia package for simulation of cosmological scalar fields

 - **Abstract**
 UltraDark.jl is a Julia package for the simulation of cosmological scalar fields. Scalar fields are proposed solutions to two of the fundamental questions in cosmology: the nature of dark matter and the universe's initial conditions. Modeling their dynamics requires solving the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, which is analytically challenging. This makes simulations essential to understanding the dynamics of cosmological scalar fields. UltraDark.jl is an open, performant and user friendly option for solving these equations numerically.

          Starspots and Undetected Binary Stars Have Distinct Signatures in Young Stellar Associations

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars form in associations, meaning that young stellar associations provide an ideal environment to measure the age of a nominally coeval population. Isochrone fitting, which is the typical method for measuring the age of a coeval population, can be impacted by observational biases that obscure the physical properties of a population. One feature in isochrone fits of star-forming regions is an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, where lower-mass stars appear systematically younger than higher-mass stars. Starspots and stellar multiplicity are proposed mechanisms for producing the mass-dependent age gradient, but the relative importance of starspots versus multiplicity remains unclear. We performed a synthetic red-optical low-resolution spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to a 10 Myr stellar association including mass-dependent multiplicity statistics and age-dependent starspot coverage fractions. We found that undetected starspots alone do not produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, but instead uniformly reduce the average measured age of the population. We also found that binaries continue to produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, and introduce more scatter in the age measurement than spots, but are easily removed from the population as long as there are good distance measurements to each target. We conclude that it is crucial to incorporate treatments of both starspots and undetected stellar multiplicity into isochrone fits of young stellar associations to attain reliable ages.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a high angular resolution (1.1") and sensitivity (maximum of ~0.1 mJy) radio survey at 1-2 GHz in the Galactic Bulge. This complements the X-ray Chandra Galactic Bulge Survey, and investigates the full radio source population in this dense Galactic region. Radio counterparts to sources at other wavelengths can aid in classification, as there are relatively few types of objects that are reasonably detectable in radio at kiloparsec distances, and even fewer that are detected in both X-rays and radio. This survey covers about 3 square degrees of the Galactic Bulge Survey area (spanning the Galactic coordinate range of -3deg < l < +3deg and +1.6deg < b < +2.1deg as a first look into this region of the Galaxy with this combination of frequency, resolution, and sensitivity. Spectral indices within the observed band of 1-2 GHz were calculated for each source to assist in determining its emission mechanism. We find 1617 unique sources in the survey, 25 of which are radio counterparts to X-ray sources, and about 100 of which are steep-spectrum (alpha <~ -1.4) point sources that are viable pulsar candidates. Four radio sources are of particular interest: a compact binary; an infrared transient with an inverted radio spectrum; a potential transitional millisecond pulsar candidate; and a very steep spectrum radio source with an X-ray and bright infrared counterpart. We discuss other notable sources, including possible radio transients, potential new planetary nebulae, and active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing rocky exoplanets is a central endeavor of astronomy, and yet the search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets has hitherto resulted in either tight upper limits on the atmospheric mass or inconclusive results. The 1.95-REarth and 8.8-MEarth planet 55 Cnc e, with a predominantly rocky composition and an equilibrium temperature of ~2000 K, may have a volatile envelope (containing molecules made from a combination of C, H, O, N, S, and P elements) that accounts for up to a few percent of its radius. The planet has been observed extensively with transmission spectroscopy, and its thermal emission has been measured in broad photometric bands. These observations disfavor a primordial H2/He-dominated atmosphere but cannot conclusively determine whether the planet has a secondary atmosphere. Here we report a thermal emission spectrum of the planet obtained by JWST's NIRCam and MIRI instruments from 4 to 12 {\mu}m. The measurements rule out the scenario where the planet is a lava world shrouded by a tenuous atmosphere made of vaporized rock, and indicate a bona fide volatile atmosphere likely rich in CO2 or CO. This atmosphere can be outgassed from and sustained by a magma ocean.

 - **Abstract**
 Runaway stars are OB-type stars ejected from their birthplace with large peculiar velocities. The leading hypothesis addressed in their formation includes the supernova ejection mechanism and the dynamic ejection scenario. Identification of runaway populations is the first step to investigating their formation and evolution. Here we present our work of searching for Galactic runaway candidate stars from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR8 database. After studying the kinematic properties for a collection of 4,432 early-type stars, predominantly B-type stars, using the radial velocity measurements from LAMOST DR8 and astrometric solutions made by Gaia DR3, we identified 229 runaway candidate stars. They span a wide distribution in projected rotational velocities. We investigated the Galactic spatial distribution of the runaway population and noticed that most of them likely reside within the Galactic thin disk. Based upon analyzing the Doppler shifts of the candidate stars, we found two binary runaway candidates displaying velocity variation with estimated orbital periods of 40 and 61 days.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed the X-ray, Gamma-ray and Relativistic Electron detector (XGRE) onboard the TARANIS satellite, to investigate high-energy phenomena associated with lightning discharges such as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and terrestrial electron beams. XGRE consisted of three sensors. Each sensor has one layer of LaBr$_{3}$ crystals for X-ray/gamma-ray detections, and two layers of plastic scintillators for electron and charged-particle discrimination. Since 2018, the flight model of XGRE was developed, and validation and calibration tests, such as a thermal cycle test and a calibration test with the sensors onboard the satellite were performed before the launch of TARANIS on 17 November 2020. The energy range of the LaBr$_{3}$ crystals sensitive to X-rays and gamma rays was determined to be 0.04-11.6 MeV, 0.08-11.0 MeV, and 0.08-11.3 MeV for XGRE1, 2, and 3, respectively. The energy resolution at 0.662 MeV (full width at half maximum) was to be 20.5%, 25.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Results from the calibration test were then used to validate a simulation model of XGRE and TARANIS. By performing Monte Carlo simulations with the verified model, we calculated effective areas of XGRE to X-rays, gamma rays, electrons, and detector responses to incident photons and electrons coming from various elevation and azimuth angles.

          Does Metallicity affect Protoplanetary Disk Fraction? Answers from the Outer Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The role of metallicity in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution remains poorly comprehended. This study analyzes the disk fraction of 10 young (0.9-2.1 Myr) and low-metallicity (0.34-0.83 Z$_{\odot}$) clusters located in the outer Milky Way with Galactocentric distances between 10 and 13 kpc. Using $JHK$ data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2-2 M$_{\odot}$) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25-0.85 Z$_{\odot}$ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low-metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average $2.6\pm0.2$ times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in sub-solar metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3-1.4 and 1.4-2.5 Myr. We emphasize that both cluster age and metallicity significantly affect the fraction of stars with evidence of inner disks.

          Coronal modulation in the ultra-fast rotator LO Peg

 - **Abstract**
 We present coronal imaging of the ultra-fast rotator, LO Peg, using the X-ray observations from XMM-Newton. The X-ray light curves show one strong flare at the end of observation, as reported in an earlier study. On removal of flaring events, the quiescent state light curve shows rotational modulations, which are modelled using a maximum likelihood model. The results obtained from modelling show the corona of LO Peg is not uniform. Active regions are concentrated around two longitudes, where one active region appears to be compact. The large coronal area that covers almost 60 degrees along longitude from the poles to the equator does not consist of active regions.

          Sedimentary rocks from Mediterranean drought in the Messinian age as a probe of the past cosmic ray flux

 - **Abstract**
 We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.

          The dynamical age of the LMC globular cluster NGC 1835 using the "dynamical clock"

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the study of the size-age relationship observed in star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the investigation of its origin, here we present the determination of the structural parameters and the dynamical age of the massive cluster NGC 1835. We have used a powerful combination of optical and near-ultraviolet images acquired with the WFC3 onboard the HST to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, determining the values of the core, half-mass and tidal radii through the comparison with the King model family. The same data also allowed us to evaluate the dynamical age of the cluster by using the 'dynamical clock'. This is an empirical method that quantifies the level of central segregation of blue stragglers stars (BSSs) within the cluster half-mass radius by means of the A+ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. The results confirm that NGC 1835 is a very compact cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The estimated value of A+ ($0.30\pm 0.04$) is the largest measured so far in the LMC clusters, providing evidence of a highly dynamically evolved stellar system. NGC 1835 nicely fits into the correlation between A+ and the central relaxation time and in the anti-correlation between A+ and the core radius defined by the Galactic and the Magellanic Cloud clusters investigated to date.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the similarity solutions for the Marshak wave problem, in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) diffusion approximation and in the supersonic regime. Self-similar solutions exist for a temporal power law surface temperature drive and a material model with power law temperature dependent opacity and energy density. The properties of the solutions in both linear and nonlinear conduction regimes are studied as a function of the temporal drive, opacity and energy density exponents. We show that there exists a range of the temporal exponent for which the total energy in the system decreases, and the solution has a local maxima. For nonlinear conduction, we specify the conditions on the opacity and energy density exponents under which the heat front is linear or even flat, and does posses its common sharp character; this character is independent of the drive exponent. We specify the values of the temporal exponents for which analytical solutions exist and employ the Hammer-Rosen perturbation theory to obtain highly accurate approximate solutions, which are parameterized using only two numerically fitted quantities. The solutions are used to construct a set of benchmarks for supersonic LTE radiative heat transfer, including some with unusual and interesting properties such as local maxima and non sharp fronts. The solutions are compared in detail to implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations as well gray diffusion simulations, showing a good agreement, which highlights their usefulness as a verification test problem for radiative transfer simulations.

          Potential Surface Ice Distribution on Close-in Terrestrial Exoplanets around M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies suggested that surface ice could be distributed on close-in terrestrial exoplanets around M-dwarfs if heat redistribution on the planets is very inefficient. In general, orbital and atmospheric parameters play an important role in the climate on terrestrial planets, including the cold-trap region where the permanent surface water reservoir can potentially be distributed. Here, we develop a simple coupled land-atmosphere model to explore the potential surface ice distribution on close-in terrestrial planets with various orbital and atmospheric parameters, assuming that the planets are airless or have a thin \ce{N2} atmosphere. We find that the most significant factors in deciding the surface cold trap region are the spin-orbit ratio and obliquity. The incident stellar flux and the surface pressure play a limited role in the thin \ce{N2} simulations for incident flux smaller than Mercury's and surface pressure lower than 10$^4$ Pa. Our result illustrates the possible distribution of surface ice on arid terrestrial planets and can help to understand the climate of these exoplanets.

          A dusty rain falls on the nova V959 Monocerotis

 - **Abstract**
 We present archival and ground-based infrared observations of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon, covering the period 100-4205 days after the 2012 eruption. We use these data to determine that the secondary in the nova system is a G5 main sequence star. Data from the NEOWISE survey reveal a significant increase in the emission at 3.4 microns and 4.6 microns at late (>~600 days) times, which we interpret as emission by dust. Other interpretations are considered but cannot be reconciled with the data. The presence of such late dust emission, and in particular its variation with time, are unprecedented in the context of novae. The behaviour of the dust emission suggests a qualitative interpretation in which ejecta from the 2012 eruption encounter denser pre-eruption circumbinary material, giving rise to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that cause clumps of dust-bearing material to fall back towards the central binary, the dust undergoing destruction by chemisputtering as it does so. The observed rise in the dust temperature, the decline in the nova-dust distance and in the dust mass, are consistent with this interpretation. Not all novae are expected to show this behaviour, but inspection of resources such as NEOWISE might reveal other novae post-eruption that do.

          More than 200 Globular Clusters in the Milky Way, and still no super-Solar metallicity ones

 - **Abstract**
 Many globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) have been studied in recent years, especially in hidden regions such as those of the Galactic bulge. Our main goal is to understand what we can learn if we include these new objects into the MWGC system that we know today. We catalogue 37 recently discovered GCs. We use different distributions for investigating the MWGC system: metallicity distribution (MD), luminosity function (LF), and age distribution. We first treat separately the new GCs sample from the known and well-characterised GCs. We merge these two samples, upgrading the MWGC system. We performed a comparison between our clusters sample and field star (FS) population. We find a double peaked distribution for the LF, which shows an elongated faint end tail. Considering the "merged" sample, the LF and the MDs display a bimodality trend. We construct the MD for the FS sample, and comparing this with that one of the GCs, we learn that a high percentage of FS show [Fe/H]$>0$, whereas we do not detect any GCs in the same metallicity range. In order to understand this inconsistency, we construct the age-metallicity diagram for both samples, noting that the old and metal-poor population (age$\geq8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$\leq -1.0$) is represented by GCs, while the young and metal-rich population (age$<8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$>-1.0$) corresponds to FS. From the analysis of the GC LF and MD, we can conclude that many GCs, probably those very faint, have survived strong dynamical processes, typical of the Bulge regions. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of them have been accreted during past merging events, especially the metal-poor component, whereas the metal-rich population may be related to the formation of the bulge and/or disk. Finally, the difference that we notice between the GC and FS samples should be sought in the evolutionary difference between these two stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a future ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy providing unparalleled sensitivity in the energy range from 20 GeV up to 300 TeV. CTA will consist of telescopes with three different sizes. The Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) will have 12 m reflectors with a tessellated mirror design of 86 mirror facets each. Each mirror facet is mounted on the mirror support structure with two actuators that are adjustable in length to align the mirrors, and a freely rotating fixpoint. Image resolution and pointing accuracy constraints impose limits on the backlash and deformation of the actuators and the fixpoint under various weight and wind loads. In this contribution, the test stand to measure the backlash and deformation behaviour of actuators and fixpoints is described and the measurement procedure is explained.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is aimed at exploring implications of velocity dispersion scalings on high-mass star formation in molecular clouds, including the scalings of Larson's linewidth--size ($\sigma$--$R$) and ratio--mass surface density ($\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$; here $\cal{L}$$=\sigma/R^{0.5}$). We have systematically analyzed the $\sigma$ parameter of well-selected 221 massive clumps, complemented with published samples of other hierarchical density structures of molecular clouds over spatial scales of 0.01--10 pc. Those massive clumps are classified into four phases: quiescent, protostellar, HII region, and PDR clumps in an evolutionary sequence. The velocity dispersion of clumps increases overall with the evolutionary sequence, reflecting enhanced stellar feedback in more evolved phases. The relations of $\sigma$--$R$ and $\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$ are weak with the clump sample alone, but become evident when combined with others spanning a much wider spatial scales. For $\sigma$--$R$, its tight relation indicates a kinematic connection between hierarchical density structures, supporting theoretical models of multiscale high-mass star formation. From the $\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$ relation, cloud structures can be found to transition from over-virial state ($\alpha_\mathrm{vir} > 2$) to sub-virial state ($\alpha_\mathrm{vir} < 2$) as they become smaller and denser, indicating a possible shift in the governing force from turbulence to gravity. This implies that the multiscale physical process of high-mass star formation hinges on the self-gravity of sub-virial molecular clouds. However, the influence of turbulence may not be dismissed until large-scale clouds attain a sub-virial state. This is pending confirmation from future multiscale kinematic observations of molecular clouds with uniform observing settings.

 - **Abstract**
 As of 2023, over 5500 planets are known to orbit stars other than our Sun. We can measure their sizes and orbital periods, infer their masses and temperatures, and constrain their compositions. Based on these data, about 1% of extrasolar planets are potentially habitable for life as we know it, implying that of the billions of planets in our Galaxy, some may actually be inhabited, at least by microbes. However, recognizing signs of alien life forms is a major challenge for current technology, because of the wide range of conditions on extrasolar planets, and because of the wide range of forms that life may take. This chapter reviews observations of exoplanets and discusses astrobiological definitions of habitability and the likelihood of finding life beyond the Earth, both within and outside the Solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on spin variations in the intermediate polar and cataclysmic variable CC Scl, as seen by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). By studying both the spin period and its harmonic, we find that the spin has varied since it was first observed in 2011. We find the latest spin value for the source to be 389.473(6)s, equivalent to 0.00450779(7) days, 0.02s shorter than the first value measured. A linear fit to these and intermediate data give a rate of change of spin ~-4.26(2.66)e10^-11 and a characteristic timescale tau~2.90e10^5 years, in line with other known intermediate polars with varying spin. The spin profile of this source also matches theoretical spin profiles of high-inclination intermediate polars, and furthermore, appears to have changed in shape over a period of three years. Such `spin-up' in an intermediate polar is considered to be from mass accretion onto the white dwarf (the primary), and we note the presence of dwarf nova eruptions in this source as being a possible catalyst of the variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are small, icy bodies in the outer solar system. They are observed to have a complex orbital distribution that was shaped by the early dynamical history and migration of the giant planets. Comparisons between the different dynamical classes of modeled and observed TNOs can help constrain the history of the outer solar system. Because of the complex dynamics of TNOs, particularly those in and near mean motion resonances with Neptune, classification has traditionally been done by human inspection of plots of the time evolution of orbital parameters. This is very inefficient. The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to increase the number of known TNOs by a factor of $\sim$10, necessitating a much more automated process. In this chapter we present an improved supervised machine learning classifier for TNOs. Using a large and diverse training set as well as carefully chosen, dynamically motivated data features calculated from numerical integrations of TNO orbits, our classifier returns results that match those of a human classifier 98% of the time, and dynamically relevant classifications 99.7% of the time. This classifier is dramatically more efficient than human classification, and it will improve classification of both observed and modeled TNO data.

          ContEvol formalism: possibly a new twist on computational physics

 - **Abstract**
 We present the ContEvol (continuous evolution) formalism, a family of implicit numerical methods which only need to solve linear equations and are almost symplectic. Combining values and derivatives of functions, ContEvol outputs allow users to recover full history and render full distributions. Using classic harmonic oscillator as a prototype case, we show that ContEvol methods lead to lower-order errors than two commonly used Runge--Kutta methods. Applying first-order ContEvol to simple celestial mechanics problems, we demonstrate that deviation from equation(s) of motion of ContEvol tracks is still $\mathcal{O}(h^5)$ ($h$ is the step length) by our definition. Numerical experiments with an eccentric elliptical orbit indicate that first-order ContEvol is a viable alternative to classic Runge--Kutta or the symplectic leapfrog integrator. Solving stationary Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics, we manifest ability of ContEvol to handle boundary value or eigenvalue problems. Important directions for future work, including mathematical foundation, higher dimensions, and technical improvements, are discussed at the end of this article.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the LISA Pathfinder differential acceleration performance over the entire mission . We show that the Brownian noise level, detected for frequencies $f\gtrsim \SI{1}{mHz}$, has been evolving consistently with the outgassing of a single gaseous species, with an activation temperature of $(7.0\pm 0.2)\,\text{kK}$. In excess to the Brownian noise, the acceleration amplitude spectral density (ASD) always shows a sub-mHz tail which is reasonably well fit, between $f=\SI{36}{\micro\hertz}$ and $\SI{1}{\milli\hertz}$, to $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}(1\, \text{mHz}/f)$. A Bayesian estimate of $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}$ on a partition of the entire set of measurements in 27 data stretches, each 2.75\,d long, gives $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}=(1.1\pm0.3)\,\si{\femto\meter\,\second^{-2}/\rtHz}$, with no particular time pattern over the course of the mission. The width the posterior contains, in excess of the statistical uncertainty, a true physical fluctuation of $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}$ from run to run, of about $\SI{0.2}{\femto\meter\,\second^{-2}/\rtHz}$, with no correlation with specific operating conditions. At the lowest considered frequency of $f=\SI{18}{\micro\hertz}$, the ASD significantly deviates from the $1/f$ behavior, because of temperature fluctuations that appear to modulate a quasi-static pressure gradient, sustained by the asymmetries of outgassing . We also present a projection of acceleration noise on the sources for which we had either a correlation measurement, or an estimate from dedicated experiments.These sources account for about 40\% of the noise power the $1/f$ tail. We discuss the possible sources of the unaccounted-for fraction, present a series of analyses that rule many of them out, and identify the possible measures that may be taken to keep the remaining ones under control in LISA.

          DanceCam: atmospheric turbulence mitigation in wide-field astronomical images with short-exposure video streams

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel technique to mitigate the adverse effects of atmospheric turbulence on astronomical imaging. Utilizing a video-to-image neural network trained on simulated data, our method processes a sliding sequence of short-exposure ($\sim$0.2s) stellar field images to reconstruct an image devoid of both turbulence and noise. We demonstrate the method with simulated and observed stellar fields, and show that the brief exposure sequence allows the network to accurately associate speckles to their originating stars and effectively disentangle light from adjacent sources across a range of seeing conditions, all while preserving flux to a lower signal-to-noise ratio than an average stack. This approach results in a marked improvement in angular resolution without compromising the astrometric stability of the final image.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusion generative models have excelled at diverse image generation and reconstruction tasks across fields. A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives -- as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to the addition of noise than baseline parameter inference networks.
