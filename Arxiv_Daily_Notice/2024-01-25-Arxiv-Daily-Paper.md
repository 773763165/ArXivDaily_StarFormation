 - **Abstract**
 With significantly improved sensitivity, the Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other upcoming gravitational wave detectors, will mark the beginning of precision gravitational wave astronomy. However, the pursuit of surpassing current detector capabilities requires careful consideration of technical constraints inherent in existing designs. The significant improvement of ET lies in the low-frequency range, where it anticipates a one million-fold increase in sensitivity compared to current detectors. Angular control noise is a primary limitation for LIGO detectors in this frequency range, originating from the need to maintain optical alignment. Given the expected improvements in ET's low-frequency range, precise assessment of angular control noise becomes crucial for achieving target sensitivity. To address this, we developed a model of the angular control system of Advanced Virgo, closely matching experimental data and providing a robust foundation for modeling future-generation detectors. Our model, for the first time, enables replication of the measured coupling level between angle and length. Additionally, our findings confirm that Virgo, unlike LIGO, is not constrained by alignment control noise, even under full power operation.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still poorly understood how their chemical composition and cloud properties vary with longitude. Theoretical models predict that clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here we report a phase-resolved emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b measured from 5-12 $\mu$m with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). The spectra reveal a large day-night temperature contrast (with average brightness temperatures of 1524$\pm$35 and 863$\pm$23 Kelvin, respectively) and evidence for water absorption at all orbital phases. Comparisons with three-dimensional atmospheric models show that both the phase curve shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence of nightside clouds which become optically thick to thermal emission at pressures greater than ~100 mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless atmosphere above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations from equilibrium chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium kinetics models, methane is not detected on the nightside (2$\sigma$ upper limit of 1-6 parts per million, depending on model assumptions).

 - **Abstract**
 The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker (1999) derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front-back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with the Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way reducing the dynamical friction compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.
#### The Effects of $r$-Process Enrichment in Hydrogen-Rich Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are candidate sites for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). We explore the effects of enrichment from $r$-process nuclei on the light-curves of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe IIP) and assess the detectability of these signatures. We modify the radiation transport code $\texttt{SNEC}$ to include the approximate effects of opacity and radioactive heating from $r$-process elements in the SN ejecta. We present models spanning a range of total $r$-process masses $M_{\rm r}$ and their assumed radial distribution within the ejecta, finding that $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$ is sufficient to induce appreciable differences in their light-curves as compared to ordinary SNe IIP (without any $r$-process elements). The primary photometric signatures of $r$-process enrichment include a shortening of the plateau phase, coinciding with the hydrogen-recombination photosphere retreating to the $r$-process-enriched layers, and a steeper post-plateau decline associated with a reddening of the SN colors. We compare our $r$-process-enriched models to ordinary IIP models and observational data, showing that yields of $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$ are potentially detectable across several of the metrics used by transient observers, provided that the $r$-process rich layers are mixed $\gtrsim$ halfway to the ejecta surface. This detectability threshold can roughly be reproduced analytically using a two-zone ("kilonova within a supernova") picture. Assuming that a small fraction of SNe produce a detectable $r$-process yield $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2}M_\odot$, and respecting constraints on the total Galactic production rate, we estimate that $\gtrsim 10^{3}-10^4$ SNe need be observed to find one $r$-enriched event, a feat that may become possible with the Vera Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the nature of spiral arms is essential for understanding the formation of the intricate disc structure of the Milky Way. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has provided revolutionary observational data that have uncovered detailed kinematical features of stars in the Milky Way. However, so far the nature of spiral arms continues to remain a mystery. Here we present that the stellar kinematics traced by the classical Cepheids around the Perseus and Outer spiral arms in the Milky Way shows strikingly different kinematical properties from each other: the radial and azimuthal velocities of Cepheids with respect to the Galactic centre show positive and negative correlations in the Perseus and Outer arms, respectively. We also found that the dynamic spiral arms commonly seen in an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy can naturally explain the observed kinematic trends. Furthermore, a comparison with such a simulation suggests that the Perseus arm is being disrupted while the Outer arm is growing. Our findings suggest that two neighbouring spiral arms in distinct evolutionary phases - growing and disrupting phases - coexist in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution predicts the existence of a mass gap for black hole remnants produced by pair-instability supernova dynamics, whose lower and upper edges are very uncertain. We study the possibility of constraining the location of the upper end of the pair-instability mass gap, which is believed to appear around ${m_\text{min}} \sim130M_\odot$, using gravitational wave observations of compact binary mergers with next-generation ground-based detectors. While high metallicity may not allow for the formation of first-generation black holes on the "far side" beyond the gap, metal-poor environments containing Population III stars could lead to such heavy black hole mergers. We show that, even in the presence of contamination from other merger channels, next-generation detectors will measure the location of the upper end of the mass gap with a relative precision close to $\Delta {m_\text{min}}/{m_\text{min}} \simeq 4\% (N_\text{det}/100 )^{-1/2}$ at 90% C.L., where $N_\text{det} $ is the number of detected mergers with both members beyond the gap. These future observations could reduce current uncertainties in nuclear and astrophysical processes controlling the location of the gap.

 - **Abstract**
 The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.

 - **Abstract**
 The detailed design and operation of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's EBIT are described for the first time, including recent design upgrades that have led to improved system stability and greater user control, increasing the scope of possible experiments. Measurements of emission from highly charged Ar were taken to determine the spatial distribution of the ion cloud and electron beam. An optical setup consisting of two lenses, a narrow band filter, and a CCD camera was used to image visible light, while an X-ray pinhole and CCD camera were used to image X-rays. Measurements were used to estimate an effective electron density of 1.77 x 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Additionally, observations of X-ray emission from background EBIT gases were measured with a Silicon Lithium detector. Measurements indicate the presence of Ba and Si, which are both easily removed by dumping the trap every 2 s or less.

 - **Abstract**
 Potential contribution from gamma-ray sources to the Galactic diffuse gamma rays observed above 100 TeV (sub-PeV energy range) by the Tibet AS{\gamma} experiment is an important key to interpreting recent multi-messenger observations. This paper reveals a surprising fact: none of the 23 Tibet AS{\gamma} diffuse gamma-ray events above 398TeV within the Galactic latitudinal range of |b| < 10 deg. come from the 43 sub-PeV gamma-ray sources reported in the 1LHAASO catalog, which proves that these sources are not the origins of the Tibet AS{\gamma} diffuse gamma-ray events. No positional overlap between the Tibet AS{\gamma} diffuse gamma-ray events and the sub-PeV LHAASO sources currently supports the diffusive nature of the Tibet AS{\gamma} diffuse gamma-ray events, although their potential origin in the gamma-ray sources yet unresolved in the sub-PeV energy range cannot be ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two directly imaged, giant planet candidates orbiting the metal-rich DAZ white dwarfs WD 1202-232 and WD 2105-82. JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) data on these two stars show a nearby resolved source at a projected separation of 11.47 and 34.62 au, respectively. Assuming the planets formed at the same time as their host stars, with total ages of 5.3 and 1.6Gyr, the MIRI photometry is consistent with giant planets with masses about 1-7 Jupiter Masses. The probability of both candidates being false positives due to red background sources is approximately 1 in 3000. If confirmed, these would be the first directly imaged planets that are similar in both age and separation to the giant planets in our own solar system, and they would demonstrate that widely separated giant planets like Jupiter survive stellar evolution. Giant planet perturbers are widely used to explain the tidal disruption of asteroids around metal-polluted white dwarfs. Confirmation of these two planet candidates with future MIRI imaging would provide evidence that directly links giant planets to metal pollution in white dwarf stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) slitless spectroscopic survey poses a challenge of flux calibration, which requires a large number of flux-standard stars. In this work, we design an uncertainty-aware residual attention network, the UaRA-net, to derive the CSST SEDs with a resolution of R = 200 over the wavelength range of 2500-10000 \AA using LAMOST normalized spectra with a resolution of R = 2000 over the wavelength range of 4000-7000 \AA. With the special structure and training strategy, the proposed model can not only provide accurate predictions of SEDs but also their corresponding errors. The precision of the predicted SEDs depends on effective temperature (Teff), wavelength, and the LAMOST spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), particularly in the GU band. For stars with Teff = 6000 K, the typical SED precisions in the GU band are 4.2%, 2.1%, and 1.5% at SNR values of 20, 40, and 80, respectively. As Teff increases to 8000 K, the precision increases to 1.2%, 0.6%, and 0.5%, respectively. The precision is higher at redder wavelengths. In the GI band, the typical SED precisions for stars with Teff = 6000 K increase to 0.3%, 0.1%, and 0.1% at SNR values of 20, 40, and 80, respectively. We further verify our model using the empirical spectra of the MILES and find good performance. The proposed method will open up new possibilities for optimal utilization of slitless spectra of the CSST and other surveys.
#### Study of solar brightness profiles in the 18-26 GHz frequency range with  INAF radio telescopes I: solar radius

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is an extraordinary workbench, from which several fundamental astronomical parameters can be measured with high precision. Among these parameters, the solar radius $R_{\odot}$ plays an important role in several aspects, such as in evolutionary models. Despite the efforts in obtaining accurate measurements of $R_{\odot}$, the subject is still debated and measurements are puzzling and/or lacking in many frequency ranges. We aimed to determine the mean, equatorial, and polar radii of the Sun ($R_c$, $R_{eq}$, and $R_{pol}$) in the frequency range 18.1 - 26.1 GHz. We employed single-dish observations from the newly-appointed Medicina "Gavril Grueff" Radio Telescope and the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) throughout 5 years, from 2018 to mid-2023, in the framework of the SunDish project for solar monitoring. Two methods to calculate the radius at radio frequencies are considered and compared. To assess the quality of our radius determinations, we also analysed the possible degrading effects of the antenna beam pattern on our solar maps, using two 2D-models. We carried out a correlation analysis with the evolution of the solar cycle through the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$. We obtained several values for the solar radius - ranging between 959 and 994 arcsec - and $\rho$, with typical errors of a few arcsec. Our $R_{\odot}$ measurements, consistent with values reported in literature, suggest a weak prolatness of the solar limb ($R_{eq}$ > $R_{pol}$), although $R_{eq}$ and $R_{pol}$ are statistically compatible within 3$\sigma$ errors. The correlation analysis using the solar images from Grueff shows (1) a positive correlation between the solar activity and the temporal variation of $R_c$ (and $R_{eq}$) at all observing frequencies, and (2) a weak anti-correlation between the temporal variation of $R_{pol}$ and the solar activity at 25.8 GHz.
#### An Extremely Young Protostellar Core, MMS 1/ OMC-3: Episodic Mass  Ejection History Traced by the Micro SiO Jet

 - **Abstract**
 We present ${\sim}0.2$ arcsec ($\sim$80 au) resolution observations of the CO (2-1) and SiO (5-4) lines made with the Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array toward an extremely young intermediate-mass protostellar source (t$_{\rm dyn}<$1000 years), MMS 1 located in the Orion Molecular Cloud-3 region. We have successfully imaged a very compact CO molecular outflow associated with MMS 1, having deprojected lobe sizes of $\sim$18000 au (red-shifted lobe) and $\sim$35000 au (blue-shifted lobe). We have also detected an extremely compact ($\lesssim$1000 au) and collimated SiO protostellar jet within the CO outflow. The maximum deprojected jet speed is measured to be as high as 93 km s$^{-1}$. The SiO jet wiggles and displays a chain of knots. Our detection of the molecular outflow and jet is the first direct evidence that MMS 1 already hosts a protostar. The position-velocity diagram obtained from the SiO emission shows two distinct structures: (i) bow-shocks associated with the tips of the outflow, and (ii) a collimated jet, showing the jet velocities linearly increasing with the distance from the driving source. Comparisons between the observations and numerical simulations quantitatively share similarities such as multiple-mass ejection events within the jet and Hubble-like flow associated with each mass ejection event. Finally, while there is a weak flux decline seen in the 850 $\mu$m light curve obtained with JCMT/SCUBA 2 toward MMS 1, no dramatic flux change events are detected. This suggests that there has not been a clear burst event within the last 8 years.

 - **Abstract**
 Although red clump stars function as reliable standard candles, their surface characteristics (i.e. T$_{\text{eff}}$, log~$g$, and [Fe/H]) overlap with those of red giant branch stars, which are not standard candles. Recent results have revealed that spectral features containing carbon (e.g. CN molecular bands) carry information correlating with the ''gold-standard'' asteroseismic classifiers that distinguish red clump from red giant branch stars. However, the underlying astrophysical processes driving the correlation between these spectroscopic and asteroseismic quantities in red giants remain inadequately explored. This study aims to enhance our understanding of this ''spectro-seismic'' effect, by refining the list of key spectral features predicting red giant evolutionary state. In addition, we conduct further investigation into those key spectral features to probe the astrophysical processes driving this connection. We employ the data-driven The Cannon algorithm to analyse high-resolution ($R\sim80,000$) Veloce spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope for 301 red giant stars (where asteroseismic classifications from the TESS mission are known for 123 of the stars). The results highlight molecular spectroscopic features, particularly those containing carbon (e.g. CN), as the primary indicators of the evolutionary states of red giant stars. Furthermore, by investigating CN isotopic pairs (that is, $^{12}$C$^{14}$N and $^{13}$C$^{14}$N) we find statistically significant differences in the reduced equivalent widths of such lines, suggesting that physical processes that change the surface abundances and isotopic ratios in red giant stars, such as deep mixing, are the driving forces of the ''spectro-seismic'' connection of red giants.

 - **Abstract**
 We have undertaken a deep investigation of a well defined sample of 136 PNe located in a 10x10 degree central region of the Galactic Bulge observed with the ESO VLT and supplemented by archival HST imagery. These studies have provided precise morphologies, major axes position angles and the most robust sample of consistently derived chemical abundances available to date. Using these data we have statistically confirmed, at 5-sigma, the precise PNe population that provides the PNe alignment of major axes previously suggested in the Galactic Bulge, revealed a partial solution to the sulfur anomaly and uncovered interesting morphological, abundance and kinematic features. We summarise the most significant findings here with detailed results appearing in a series of related publications.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar coronal sources have been observed in the past not only for their astrophysical interest in the field of binary system evolution and interaction, but also for their invaluable roles as benchmarks for plasma spectral models and as calibration sources for high resolution spectroscopic X-ray instruments. These include the gratings on-board Chandra and XMM-Newton, as well as the new generation of high resolution capable-detectors recently flown on-board XRISM and planned for the future also on-board the Athena and the LEM missions. In our previous paper exploiting Chandra/HETG observations of the prototypical coronal source Capella, it has been shown that the centroid energies of the many X-ray emission lines detected in the spectrum of this object change as a function of time due to the Doppler modulation within the binary. This is an effect that needs to be corrected while performing calibrations of high resolution X-ray instruments. In this paper, we extend our previous work on Capella to other known stellar coronal sources which have been observed with the Chandra/HETG (11 objects in total). We measure in several objects clear trends in the velocity shifts along the orbit of the primary star, meaning that in these sources one of the two star components is largely dominating the high energy emission. In a number of systems the trend in the velocity shift is not obvious. This can be ascribed to the fact that both stellar components contribute significantly to the X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumplanetary environments in our Solar System host a stunning array of moon and ring systems. Study of these environs has yielded valuable insights into planetary system formation and evolution, and there is every reason to believe that we will have much to learn from the moons and rings that are likely to exist in exoplanetary systems as well. This has motivated a small but growing number of researchers to investigate questions related to the formation, stability, long-term viability, composition, and observability of these exomoons and exorings. Still, due to a range of significant observational challenges, we remain at a relatively early stage of this work. As a result, we continue to face a number of difficult, unanswered questions, but this also means there are myriad opportunities for fundamental contributions to the field. In this review we will examine a variety of important issues for the astronomical community to consider, with an aim of providing a comprehensive understanding of ongoing efforts to identify and characterize exomoons and exorings, while also increasing interest and engagement. We begin with an overview of what we expect from systems hosting moons and/or rings in terms of their architectures, habitability, and observational signatures. We then highlight the contributions from a variety of works that have been aimed at detecting and characterizing them. We conclude by examining the outlook for finding these objects and discussing a number of ongoing challenges that we will want to overcome in the years ahead.

 Convective storms (CS) on Saturn appear as bright clouds, irregular in shape and rapidly changing over time, accompanied by lightning phenomena. They cover a wide range of size scales, from 500 km or less and up to sizes that encircle the planet. In this chapter we focus on medium or synoptic-scale events (typical sizes 2,000 - 7,000 km) and planetary-scale major storms known as Great White Spots (GWS). In general, the storms emerge in westward jets and in the peak of the strong eastward equatorial jet. They have been observed preferentially in the northern hemisphere and seem to occur in the same latitude in intervals of 30 and 60 years coinciding with the times of maximum insolation within the seasonal cycle. Moist convection models locate the origin of the storms in the water clouds (at about 10 bars of pressure) and to some extent in ammonia clouds, and their thermodynamics explain the possible periodicity of the phenomena. Once triggered, the storms grow and expand, and their interaction with the zonal wind system gives rise to anticyclonic ovals and to disturbances that propagate zonally covering an entire latitude band in the case of the GWS.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinetic exospheric models revealed that the solar wind is accelerated by an ambipolar electric field up to supersonic velocities. The presence of suprathermal Strahl electrons at the exobase can further increase the velocity to higher values, leading to profiles comparable to the observations in the fast and slow wind at all radial distances. Such suprathermal electrons are observed at large distances and recently at low distances as well. Those suprathermal electrons were introduced into the kinetic exospheric model using Kappa distributions. Here, the importance of the exobase's altitude is also underlined for its ability to maintain the electric potential to a higher level for slower winds, conversely to what is induced through the effect of a lower kappa index only. In fact, the exobase is located at lower altitude in the coronal holes where the density is smaller than in the other regions of the corona, allowing the wind originating from the holes to be accelerated from lower distances to higher velocities. The new observations of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) from launch to mid-2023 are here used to determine the characteristics of the plasma in the corona so that the model fits best to the averaged observed profiles for the slow and fast winds. The observations at low radial distances show suprathermal electrons already well present in the Strahl in the antisunward direction and a deficit in the sunward direction, confirming the exospheric feature of almost no incoming particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on 2-minute cadence TESS data, we investigate pulsations of TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 and discover them to be two new HADS stars with equally spaced g modes. We recognize the radial fundamental mode $f_1$ = 18.3334 c/d and the first overtone $f_3$ = 23.6429 c/d for TIC 65138566, and identify the highest peak $f_1$ = 19.0955 c/d as the radial fundamental mode for TIC 139729335. For g modes, both stars display a regular period spacing of 2413 s. Through detailed seismological analysis, we deduce that these period spacing patterns correspond to modes with $\ell$ = 1. Moreover, our analysis reveals that with the increase in masses and metallicities, the star should display a higher degree of evolution to match a specific period spacing $\Pi_0$. Conversely, the star should have a lower extent of evolution to match the radial fundamental mode. These two contradictory behaviors allow us to precisely obtain stellar physical parameters. TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 are determined to be two main sequence stars that have almost the same range of masses and metallicities, with $M$ = 1.36 $\pm$ 0.06 $M_{\odot}$ and $Z$ = 0.005 $\pm$ 0.002. The hydrogen abundance in the core of TIC 65138566 is estimated to be about 0.28, while TIC 139729335 has a slightly higher value of around 0.31. Finally, we suggest that the HADS $\delta$ Scuti-$\gamma$ Doradus star TIC 308396022 is a main sequence star with $M$ = 1.54 $\pm$ 0.08 $M_{\odot}$, $Z$ = 0.007 $\pm$ 0.001, and $X_{\rm c}$ = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.02.

 - **Abstract**
 In Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), signals from multiple antennas combine to create a sparsely sampled virtual aperture, its effective diameter determined by the largest antenna separation. The inherent sparsity makes VLBI imaging an ill-posed inverse problem, prompting the use of algorithms like the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm by Decomposition (MOEA/D), as proposed in the first paper of this series. This study focuses on extending MOEA/D to polarimetric and time dynamic reconstructions, particularly relevant for the VLBI community and the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC). MOEA/D's success in providing a unique, fast, and largely unsupervised representation of image structure serves as the basis for exploring these extensions. The extension involves incorporating penalty terms specific to total intensity imaging, time-variable, and polarimetric variants within MOEA/D's multiobjective, evolutionary framework. The Pareto front, representing non-dominated solutions, is computed, revealing clusters of proximities. Testing MOEA/D with synthetic datasets representative of EHTC's main targets demonstrates successful recovery of polarimetric and time-dynamic signatures despite sparsity and realistic data corruptions. MOEA/D's extension proves effective in the anticipated EHTC setting, offering an alternative and independent claim to existing methods. It not only explores the problem globally but also eliminates the need for parameter surveys, distinguishing it from Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) methods. MOEA/D emerges as a novel and useful tool for robustly characterizing polarimetric and dynamic signatures in VLBI datasets with minimal user-based choices. Future work aims to address the last remaining limitation of MOEA/D, specifically regarding the number of pixels and numerical performance, to establish it within the VLBI data reduction pipeline.

 The following results of dissertation are submitted for defense: 1. Precise measurements of coordinates and proper motion of the pulsar PSR 0329+54 using the VLBI method. 2. Establishing of the reason for the discrepancy between the coordinates of pulsars measured by VLBI and timing methods, which comes down to the influence of low-frequency noise at the time of pulse arrivals (TOAs) from the pulsar. 3. A special method for processing timing observations that allows you to correct TOA - coordinates of pulsars. 4. Theoretical dependencies of the behavior of dispersion of pulsar parameter depending on the observation interval and the type of correlated noise, on the basis of which it became possible to propose a new time scale BPT based on the orbital motion of pulsar in binary system stable over long periods of time (more than 10 years). 5. A theory that explains spontaneous changes in the rotational frequency of pulsars through their interaction with the passing gravitating mass and the theoretical power spectrum of low-frequency fluctuations of the pulsar rotational phase caused by gravitational disturbances from the passage of bodies near the pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 GK Dra is a detached eclipsing binary system containing two early-F stars, one evolved, in an orbit with a period of 9.974 d and a small eccentricity. Its eclipsing nature was discovered using Hipparcos data, and pulsations were found in follow-up ground-based data. Extensive observations have been obtained using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and we use these and published spectroscopy to perform a detailed reanalysis of the system. We determine masses of $1.421 \pm 0.012$ and $1.775 \pm 0.028$ Msun, and radii of $1.634 \pm 0.011$ and $2.859 \pm 0.028$ Rsun. The secondary component is more massive, larger, and slightly cooler than its companion; the eclipses are total. The properties of the system can be matched by theoretical predictions for an age of 1.4 Gyr and a slightly sub-solar metallicity. We measure 15 significant pulsation frequencies in the TESS light curve, of which three are in the frequency domain of $\gamma$ Doradus pulsations and the remaining 12 are $\delta$ Scuti pulsations; the system is thus a hybrid pulsator. The strongest pulsation can be definitively assigned to the secondary star as it has been detected in radial velocities of this object. TESS will observe GK Dra again for ten consecutive sectors in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 CW Eri is a detached eclipsing binary system of two F-type stars with an orbital period of 2.728 d. Light curves from two sectors of observations with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and previously published radial velocity data are analysed to determine the system's physical properties to high precision. We find the masses of the two stars to be $1.568 \pm 0.016$ Msun and $1.314 \pm 0.010$ Msun, the radii to be $2.105 \pm 0.007$ Rsun and $1.481 \pm 0.005$ Rsun, and the system's orbit to have an eccentricity of $0.0131 \pm 0.0007$. The quality of the TESS photometry allows the definition of a new high-precision orbital ephemeris, however no evidence of pulsation is found. We derive a distance to the system of $191.7\pm 3.8$ pc, a value consistent with the Gaia DR3 parallax which yields a distance of $187.9^{+0.6}_{-0.9}$ pc. The measured parameters of both stellar components are found to be in agreement with theoretical predictions for a solar chemical composition and an age of 1.7 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 A new generative technique is presented in this paper that uses Deep Learning to reconstruct stellar spectra based on a set of stellar parameters. Two different Neural Networks were trained allowing the generation of new spectra. First, an autoencoder is trained on a set of BAFGK synthetic data calculated using ATLAS9 model atmospheres and SYNSPEC radiative transfer code. These spectra are calculated in the wavelength range of Gaia RVS between 8 400 and 8 800 {\AA}. Second, we trained a Fully Dense Neural Network to relate the stellar parameters to the Latent Space of the autoencoder. Finally, we linked the Fully Dense Neural Network to the decoder part of the autoencoder and we built a model that uses as input any combination of $T_{eff}$, $\log g$, $v_e \sin i$, [M/H], and $\xi_t$ and output a normalized spectrum. The generated spectra are shown to represent all the line profiles and flux values as the ones calculated using the classical radiative transfer code. The accuracy of our technique is tested using a stellar parameter determination procedure and the results show that the generated spectra have the same characteristics as the synthetic ones.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a signal-foreground separation algorithm for filtering observational data to extract spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Our linear method, called the least response method (LRM), is based on the idea of simultaneously minimizing the response to all possible foregrounds with poorly defined spectral shapes and random noise while maintaining a constant response to the signal of interest. This idea was introduced in detail in our previous paper. Here, we have expanded our analysis by taking into consideration all the main foregrounds. We draw a detailed comparison between our approach and the moment internal linear combination method, which is a modification of the internal linear combination technique previously used for CMB anisotropy maps. We demonstrate advantages of LRM and evaluate the prospects for measuring various types of spectral distortions. Besides, we show that LRM suggests the possibility of its improvements if we use an iterative approach with sequential separation and partial subtraction of foreground components from the observed signal. In addition, we estimate the optimal temperature that the telescope's optical system should have in order to detect the chemical type $\mu$ distortions. We present a design of an instrument where, according to our estimates, the optimal contrast between its thermal emission and the CMB allows us to measure such distortions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present candl, an automatically differentiable python likelihood for analysing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum measurements. candl is powered by JAX, which makes it fast and easy to calculate derivatives of the likelihood. This facilitates, for example, robust Fisher matrices without finite-difference methods. We show the benefits of candl through a series of example calculations, covering forecasting, robustness tests, and gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. These also include optimising the band power bin width to minimise parameter errors of a realistic mock data set. Moreover, we calculate the correlation of parameter constraints from correlated and partially overlapping subsets of the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data release. In a traditional analysis framework, these tasks are slow and require careful fine-tuning to obtain stable results. As such, a fully differentiable pipeline allows for a higher level of scrutiny; we argue that this is the paradigm shift required to leverage incoming data from ground-based experiments, which will significantly improve the cosmological parameter constraints from the Planck mission. candl comes with the latest primary and lensing power spectrum data from the South Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaborations and will be used as part of the upcoming SPT-3G $TT/TE/EE$ and $\phi\phi$ data releases. Along with the core code, we release a series of auxiliary tools, which simplify common analysis tasks and interface the likelihood with other cosmological software. candl is pip-installable and publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/candl .

 The SAAO Cape Town campus was declared a National Heritage Site in December 2018, just short of its 200th anniversary, but is now in a run-down condition. As the former Royal Observatory, it is the oldest scientific institution in South Africa and probably in all Africa. It has a fascinating and well-documented history and surely deserves better. For many years maintenance has been neglected and many of the old telescopes and buildings are in a poor state. They are beginning to show signs of serious decay. Some examples are given.

 - **Abstract**
 With the recent radioastronomical detection of cis-trans-carbonic acid (H$_2$CO$_3$) in a molecular cloud toward the galactic center, the more stable but currently unobserved cis-cis conformer is shown here to have strong IR features. While the higher-energy cis-trans-carbonic acid was detected at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, owing to its larger dipole moment, the vibrational structure of cis-cis-carbonic acid is more amenable to its observation at micron wavelengths. Even so, both conformers have relatively large IR intensities, and some of these fall in regions not dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Water features may inhibit observation near the 2.75 $\mu$m hydride stretches, but other vibrational fundamentals and even overtones in the 5.5 $\mu$m to 6.0 $\mu$m range may be discernible with JWST data. This work has employed high-level, accurately benchmarked quantum chemical anharmonic procedures to compute exceptionally accurate rotational spectroscopic data compared to experiment. Such performance implies that the IR absorption and even cascade emission spectral features computed in this work should be accurate and will provide the needed reference for observation of either carbonic acid conformer in various astronomical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Hybrid neutron stars, the compact objects consisting hadronic matter and strange quark matter, can be considered as the probes for the scalar tensor gravity. In this work, we explore the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars in the scalar tensor gravity. For the hadronic phase, we apply a piecewise polytropic equation of state constrained by the observational data of GW170817 and the data of six low-mass X-ray binaries with thermonuclear burst or the symmetry energy of the nuclear interaction. In addition, to describe the strange quark matter inside the hybrid neutron star, different MIT bag models are employed. We study the effects of the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter, and the density jump at the surface of quark-hadronic phase transition on the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars. Our results confirm that the scalarization is more sensitive to the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, and the density jump compared to the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides a continuous suite of new planet candidates that need confirmation and precise mass determination from ground-based observatories. This is the case for the G-type star TOI-1710, which is known to host a transiting sub-Saturn planet ($\mathrm{M_p}=$28.3$\pm$4.7$\mathrm{M}_\oplus$) in a long-period orbit (P=24.28\,d). Here we combine archival SOPHIE and new and archival HARPS-N radial velocity data with newly available TESS data to refine the planetary parameters of the system and derive a new mass measurement for the transiting planet, taking into account the impact of the stellar activity on the mass measurement. We report for TOI-1710b a radius of $\mathrm{R_p}$$=$5.15$\pm$0.12$\mathrm{R}_\oplus$, a mass of $\mathrm{M_p}$$=$18.4$\pm$4.5$\mathrm{M}_\oplus$, and a mean bulk density of $\rho_{\rm p}$$=$0.73$\pm$0.18$\mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, which are consistent at 1.2$\sigma$, 1.5$\sigma$, and 0.7$\sigma$, respectively, with previous measurements. Although there is not a significant difference in the final mass measurement, we needed to add a Gaussian process component to successfully fit the radial velocity dataset. This work illustrates that adding more measurements does not necessarily imply a better mass determination in terms of precision, even though they contribute to increasing our full understanding of the system. Furthermore, TOI-1710b joins an intriguing class of planets with radii in the range 4-8 $\mathrm{R}_\oplus$ that have no counterparts in the Solar System. A large gaseous envelope and a bright host star make TOI-1710b a very suitable candidate for follow-up atmospheric characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 The Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a Chinese-French mission dedicated to the study of the transient sky. It is scheduled to start operations in 2024. ECLAIRs is a coded-mask telescope with a large field of view. It is designed to detect and localize gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the energy range from 4 keV up to 120 keV. In 2021, the ECLAIRs telescope underwent various calibration campaigns in vacuum test-chambers to evaluate its performance. Between 4 and 8 keV, the counting response of the detection plane shows inhomogeneities between pixels from different production batches. The efficiency inhomogeneity is caused by low-efficiency pixels (LEPs) from one of the two batches, together with high-threshold pixels (HTPs) whose threshold was raised to avoid cross-talk effects. In addition, some unexpected noise was found in the detection plane regions close to the heat pipes. We study the impact of these inhomogeneities and of the heat-pipe noise at low energies on the ECLAIRs onboard triggers. We propose different strategies in order to mitigate these impacts and to improve the onboard trigger performance. We analyzed the data from the calibration campaigns and performed simulations with the ground model of the ECLAIRs trigger software in order to design and evaluate the different strategies. Most of the impact of HTPs can be corrected for by excluding HTPs from the trigger processing. To correct for the impact of LEPs, an efficiency correction in the shadowgram seems to be a good solution. An effective solution for the heat-pipe noise is selecting the noisy pixels and ignoring their data in the 4--8 keV band during the data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Anharmonicity strongly influences the absorption and emission spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. Here, ion-dip spectroscopy experiments together with detailed anharmonic computations reveal the presence of fundamental, overtone, as well as 2- and 3-quanta combination band transitions in the far- and mid-infrared absorption spectrum of phenylacetylene and its singly deuterated isotopologue. Strong absorption features in the 400-900 cm$^{\rm -1}$ range originate from CH(D) in-plane and out-of-plane (OOP) wags and bends, as well as bending motions including the C$\equiv$C and CH bonds of the acetylene substituent and the aromatic ring. For phenylacetylene, every absorption feature is assigned either directly or indirectly to a single or multiple vibrational mode(s). The measured spectrum is dense, broad, and structureless in many regions but well characterized by computations. Upon deuteration, large isotopic shifts are observed. At frequencies above 1500 cm$^{\rm -1}$ for d$_1$-phenylacetylene, a one-to-one match is seen when comparing computations and experiment with all features assigned to combination bands and overtones. The C$\equiv$C stretch observed in phenylacetylene is not observed in d$_1$-phenylacetylene due to a computed 40-fold drop in intensity. Overall, a careful treatment of anharmonicity that includes 2- and 3-quanta modes is found to be crucial to understand the rich details of the infrared spectrum of phenylacetylene. Based on these observations it can be expected that such an all-inclusive anharmonic treatment will also be key for unraveling the infrared spectra of PAHs in general.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical phase curves of hot Jupiters can reveal global scattering properties. We implement a Bayesian inference framework for optical phase curves with flux contributions from: reflected light from a potentially inhomogeneous atmosphere, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler beaming, and stellar rotation via a Gaussian process in the time domain. We probe for atmospheric homogeneity and time-variability using the reflected light inferences for highly precise Kepler light curves of five hot Jupiters. We also investigate the scattering properties which constrain the most likely condensates in the inhomogeneous atmospheres. Cross validation prefers inhomogeneous albedo distributions for Kepler-7 b and Kepler-41 b, and a weak preference for inhomogeneity for KOI-13 b. None of the five planets exhibit significant variations in geometric albedo on one-year timescales, in agreement with theoretical expectations. We show that analytic reflected light phase curves with isotropic multiple scattering are in excellent agreement with full Rayleigh multiple scattering calculations, allowing for accelerated and analytic inference. In a case study of Kepler-41 b, we identify perovskite, forsterite, and enstatite as possible scattering species consistent with the reflected light phase curves, with condensate particle radii in the range 0.01-0.1 micron.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the joint detection prospects of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts by the current and upcoming high-energy GRB and GW facilities from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We consider two GW detector networks: (1) A four-detector network comprising LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and Kagra, (IGWN4) and (2) a future five-detector network including the same four detectors and LIGO India (IGWN5). For the sGRB detection, we consider existing satellites Fermi and Swift and the proposed all-sky satellite Daksha. Most of the events for the joint detection will be off-axis, hence, we consider a broad range of sGRB jet models predicting the off-axis emission. Also, to test the effect of the assumed sGRB luminosity function, we consider two different functions for one of the emission models. We find that for the different jet models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for Fermi and Swift with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.07-0.62$\mathrm{\ yr^{-1}}$ (0.8-4.0$\mathrm{\ yr^{-1}}$) and 0.02-0.14$\mathrm{\ yr^{-1}}$ (0.15-1.0$\mathrm{\ yr^{-1}}$), respectively, when the BNS merger rate is taken to be 320$\mathrm{\ Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$. With Daksha, the rates increase to 0.2-1.3$\mathrm{\ yr^{-1}}$ (1.3-8.3$\mathrm{\ yr^{-1}}$), which is 2-9 times higher than the existing satellites. We show that such a mission with higher sensitivity will be ideal for detecting a higher number of fainter events observed off-axis or at a larger distance. Thus, Daksha will boost the joint detections of sGRB and GW, especially for the off-axis events. Finally, we find that our detection rates with optimal SNRs are conservative, and noise in GW detectors can increase the rates further.
