#### Modeling Current and Future High-Cadence Surveys of Repeating FRB  Populations

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment) interferometer has revealed a large number of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), including a sizable population that demonstrates repeating behavior. This transit facility, employing a real-time FRB search pipeline, continually scans the sky with declinations between $-10^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ for events with fluences $\gtrapprox 0.4$ Jy ms. We simulate a population of repeating FRBs by performing Monte Carlo simulations of underlying source populations processed through a mock CHIME/FRB observing pipeline. Assuming intrinsic repeater rates follow a Poisson distribution, we test assumptions about the burst populations of the repeater sample, and construct models of the FRB sample assuming various cosmological distributions. We infer the completeness of CHIME/FRB observations as a function of observing cadence and redshifts out to 0.5. We find that, if all simulated bursts have a fixed Poisson probability of repetition over their integrated time of observation, repeating burst detections across comoving volume should continue to grow near linearly on the order of decades. We predict that around 170 of the current CHIME/FRB one-off sources will ultimately repeat. We also make projections for FRB repeaters by future facilities and demonstrate that the number of repeaters they find could saturate on a $\sim$3 yr timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 K2 photometry is suitable for the exploitation of mode variability on short timescales in hot B subdwarf stars, which is important to constrain nonlinear quantities addressed by the stellar theory of high-order perturbation in the future. We analyze the $\sim80$~d high-quality K2 data collected on PG~0101+039 and extract the frequency content of oscillation. We then determine its rotational and orbital properties, as well as characterize the dynamics of amplitude and frequency. The frequencies are extracted from light curves via a standard prewhitening technique. The binary information is obtained from variations both in brightness and radial velocities. Amplitude and frequency modulation of oscillation modes are measured by piece-wise light curves and characterized by EMCMC method. We have extracted 137 independent frequencies in PG~0101+039 and derived period spacing of ~252s and 144s for the dipole and quadruple modes, respectively. We derive a rotation rate of 8.81+-0.06d and ~8.60+-0.16d based on g- and p-mode multiplets, implying a marginally differential rotation with a probability of ~ 60%. We find that the rotation period is much shorter than the orbital period of ~0.57d, indicating that this system is not synchronized. Amplitude and frequency modulation are measurable for 44 frequencies with high enough amplitude, including 12 rotational components. We characterize their modulating patterns and find a clear correlation between amplitude and frequency variation, which is linked to nonlinear resonant couplings. In general, the modulating scale and timescale are on an order of a few dozen of nano hertz and a few tens of days, respectively, whose values are important constraints to future calculations of nonlinear amplitude equations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive re-calibration of medium- and broad-band photometry from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) by leveraging two approaches: an improved Gaia XP Synthetic Photometry (XPSP) method with corrected Gaia XP spectra, the Stellar Color Regression (SCR) method with corrected Gaia EDR3 photometric data and spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR7. Through the use of millions of stars as standards per band, we demonstrate the existence of position-dependent systematic errors, up to 23 mmag for the Main Survey region, in the S-PLUS DR4 photometric data. A comparison between the XPSP and SCR methods reveals minor differences in zero-point offsets, typically within the range of 1 to 6 mmag, indicating the accuracy of the re-calibration, and a two- to three-fold improvement in the zero-point precision. During this process, we also verified and corrected for the systematic errors related to CCD position. The corrected S-PLUS DR4 photometric data will provide a solid data foundation for conducting scientific research that relies on high-calibration precision. Our results underscore the power of the XPSP method in combination with the SCR method, showcasing their effectiveness in enhancing calibration precision for wide-field surveys when combined with Gaia photometry and XP spectra, to be applied for other S-PLUS sub-surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Matched-filtering detection techniques for gravitational-wave (GW) signals in ground-based interferometers rely on having well-modeled templates of the GW emission. Such techniques have been traditionally used in searches for compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and have been employed in all known GW detections so far. However, interesting science cases aside from compact mergers do not yet have accurate enough modeling to make matched filtering possible, including core-collapse supernovae and sources where stochasticity may be involved. Therefore the development of techniques to identify sources of these types is of significant interest. In this paper, we present a method of anomaly detection based on deep recurrent autoencoders to enhance the search region to unmodeled transients. We use a semi-supervised strategy that we name Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK). While the semi-supervised nature of the problem comes with a cost in terms of accuracy as compared to supervised techniques, there is a qualitative advantage in generalizing experimental sensitivity beyond pre-computed signal templates. We construct a low-dimensional embedded space using the GWAK method, capturing the physical signatures of distinct signals on each axis of the space. By introducing signal priors that capture some of the salient features of GW signals, we allow for the recovery of sensitivity even when an unmodeled anomaly is encountered. We show that regions of the GWAK space can identify CBCs, detector glitches and also a variety of unmodeled astrophysical sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We build a model to predict from first principles the properties of major mergers. We predict these from the coalescence of peaks and saddle points in the vicinity of a given larger peak, as one increases the smoothing scale in the initial linear density field as a proxy for cosmic time.To refine our results, we also ensure, using a suite of $\sim 400$ power-law Gaussian random fields smoothed at $\sim 30$ different scales, that the relevant peaks and saddles are topologically connected: they should belong to a persistent pair before coalescence. Our model allows us to (a) compute the probability distribution function of the satellite-merger separation in Lagrangian space: they peak at three times the smoothing scale; (b) predict the distribution of the number of mergers as a function of peak rarity: halos typically undergo two major mergers ($>$1:10) per decade of mass growth; (c) recover that the typical spin brought by mergers: it is of the order of a few tens of per cent.
#### From Out of the Blue: Swift Links 2002es-like, 2003fg-like, and  Early-Time Bump Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We collect a sample of 42 SNe Ia with Swift UV photometry and well-measured early-time light curve rises and find that 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia have different pre-peak UV color evolutions compared to normal SNe Ia and other spectroscopic subtypes. Specifically, 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia are cleanly separated from other SNe Ia subtypes by UVM2-UVW1>=1.0~mag at 10 days prior to B-band maximum. Furthermore, the SNe Ia that exhibit non-monotonic bumps in their rising light curves, to date, consist solely of 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia. We also find that SNe Ia with two-component power-law rises are more luminous than SNe Ia with single-component power-law rises at pre-peak epochs. Given the similar UV colors, along with other observational similarities, we discuss a possible progenitor scenario that places 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia along a continuum and may explain the unique UV colors, early-time bumps, and other observational similarities between these objects. Ultimately, further observations of both subtypes, especially in the near-infrared, are critical for constraining models of these peculiar thermonuclear explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework to study regolith segregation on rubble-pile asteroids (self-gravitating granular aggregates) due to seismic shaking induced by impacts sustained during their lifetimes. We first relate the amplitude and frequency of surface vibrations to the location and severity of an impact, and the rubble body's geometry and bulk properties. For clarity, the body is taken to be an ellipsoid with size and spin close to that of Itokawa, although other asteroids are also easily incorporated. We then model the body's collisional history stochastically given the variability in the impact activity on an asteroid. Finally, we utilize discrete element simulations to investigate the regolith's response to impacts. In these simulations, in any sample collisional history, every time an impact occurs, a bin filled with a grain mixture and located at the region of interest on the asteroid is vibrated at that impact's associated amplitude and frequency. Utilizing this framework we find that impact-driven seismicity is sufficient to drive size segregation on small rubble-piles, but the segregation quality depends on several aspects, e.g. total impact energy supplied, placement of the region of interest, bulk wave speed, and seismic diffusivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-Earth supernova blasts which engulf the solar system have left traces of their ejecta in the geological and lunar records. There is now a wealth of data on live radioactive ${}^{60}$Fe pointing to a supernova at 3 Myr ago, as well as the recent discovery of an event at 7 Myr ago. We use the available measurements to evaluate the distances to these events. For the better analyzed supernova at 3 Myr, samples include deep-sea sediments, ferromanganese crusts, and lunar regolith; we explore the consistency among and across these measurements, which depends sensitively on the uptake of iron in the samples as well as possible anisotropies in the ${}^{60}$Fe fallout. There is also significant uncertainty in the astronomical parameters needed for these calculations. We take the opportunity to perform a parameter study on the effects that the ejected ${}^{60}$Fe mass from a core-collapse supernova and the fraction of dust that survives the remnant have on the resulting distance. We find that with an ejected ${}^{60}$Fe mass of $3\times10^{-5} M_\odot$ and a dust fraction of 10%, the distance range for the supernova 3 Myr ago is $D \sim 20 - 140$ pc, with the most likely range between $50 - 65$ pc. Using the same astrophysical parameters, the distance for the supernova at 7 Myr ago is $D \sim 110$ pc. We close with a brief discussion of geological and astronomical measurements that can improve these results.
#### Tidal Dissipation in Satellites Prevents Hill Sphere Escape

 - **Abstract**
 The transit method is a promising means to detect exomoons, but few candidates have been identified. For planets close to their stars, the dynamical interaction between a satellite's orbit and the star must be important in their evolution. Satellites beyond synchronous orbit spiral out due to the tide raised on their planet, and it has been assumed that they would likely escape the Hill sphere. Here we follow the evolution with a three-body code that accounts for tidal dissipation within both the planet and the satellite. We show that tidal dissipation in satellites often keeps them bound to their planet, making exomoons more observable than previously thought. The probability of escape depends on the ratio of tidal quality factors Q'/Q; when this ratio exceeds 0.5, escape is usually avoided. Instead, the satellite moves to an equilibrium in which the spin angular momentum of the planet is not transferred into the orbit of the satellite, but is transferred into the orbit of the planet around the star. While the planet continues spinning faster than the satellite orbits, the satellite maintains a semi-major axis of ~0.41 Hill radii. These states are accompanied with modest satellite eccentricity ~0.1 and from stability analysis are found to be stable over long timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of a de Sitter Universe is the base for both the accelerated Universe and the late stationary Universe. So how do we differentiate between both universes? In this paper, we state that it is not possible to design an experiment using luminous or angular distances to distinguish between both cases because they are the same during the de Sitter phase. However, this equivalence allows us to predict a signal of it a constant dark energy emission with a signal peak around 29.5 MeV, in where according to our astrophysical test of survival probability, the radiation must be non-standard photons. Remarkably, experiments beyond EGRET and COMPTEL could observe an excess of gamma photons in this predicted region, coming from a possible decay process of the dark energy emission, which might constitute the possible smoking gun of a late stationary Universe with the continuous creation of non-standard radiation, an alternative approach to understand the current stages of the Universe evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The known Mega and Hyper Metal-Poor (MMP-HMP) stars with [Fe/H]<-6.0 and <-5.0, respectively, likely belong to the CEMP-no class, i.e. carbon-enhanced stars with low or absent second peak neutron capture elements. They are likely second generation stars and the few elements measurable in their atmospheres are used to infer the properties of single or very few progenitors. The high carbon abundance in the CEMP-no stars offers a unique opportunity to measure the carbon isotopic ratio, which directly monitors the presence of mixing between the He and H-burning layers either within the star or in the progenitor(s). By means of high-resolution spectra acquired with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT we aim to derive values for the 12C/13C ratio at the lowest metallicities. A spectral synthesis technique based on the SYNTHE code and on ATLAS models is used within a Markov-chain Monte Carlo methodology to derive 12C/13C in the stellar atmospheres of five of the most metal poor stars. These are the Mega Metal-Poor giant SMS J0313-6708 ([Fe/H]<-7.1), the Hyper Metal-Poor dwarf HE1327-2326 ([Fe/H]=-5.8),the Hyper Metal-Poor giant SDSS J1313-0019 ([Fe/H] = -5.0) and the Ultra Metal-Poor subgiant HE0233-0343 ([Fe/H]=-4.7). We also revise a previous value for the Mega Metal-Poor giant SMSS J1605-1443 with ([Fe/H] = -6.2). In four stars we derive an isotopic value while for HE1327-2326 we provide a lower limit. All Measurements are in the range 39<12C/13C<100 showing that the He- and H-burning layers underwent partial mixing either in the stars or, more likely, in their progenitors. This provides evidence of a primary production of 13C at the dawn of chemical evolution. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will play a crucial role in the study of transient gamma-ray sources, such as gamma-ray bursts and flaring active galactic nuclei. The low energy threshold of LSTs makes them particularly well suited for the detection of these phenomena. The ability to detect and analyze gamma-ray transients in real-time is essential for quickly identifying and studying these rare and fleeting events. In this conference, we will present recent advances in the real-time analysis of data from the LST-1, the first prototype of LST located in the Canary island of La Palma. We will discuss in particular the development of new algorithms for event reconstruction and background rejection. These advances will enable rapid identification and follow-up observation of transient gamma-ray sources, making the LST-1 a powerful tool for the study of the dynamic universe. The implementation of this framework in the future Array Control and Data Acquisition System (ACADA) of CTAO will be discussed as well, based on the experience with LST.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's moon Europa has a subsurface ocean, the chemistry of which is largely unknown. Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) has previously been detected on the surface of Europa, but it was not possible to determine whether it originated from subsurface ocean chemistry, was delivered by impacts, or was produced on the surface by radiation processing of impact-delivered material. We map the distribution of CO$_2$ on Europa using observations obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and find a concentration of CO$_2$ within Tara Regio, a recently resurfaced terrain. This indicates the CO$_2$ is derived from an internal carbon source. We propose the CO$_2$ formed in the internal ocean, though we cannot rule out formation on the surface by radiolytic conversion of ocean-derived organics or carbonates.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for exoplanets with different methods has always been the focus of astronomers over the past few years. Among multiple planet detection techniques, astrometry stands out for its capability to accurately determine the orbital parameters of exoplanets. In this study, we examine the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligent civilizations detecting planets in our solar system using the astrometry method. By conducting injection-recovery simulations, we investigate the detectability of the four giant planets in our solar system under different observing baselines and observational errors. Our findings indicate that extraterrestrial intelligence could detect and characterize all four giant planets, provided they are observed for a minimum of 90 years with signal-noise ratios exceeding 1. For individual planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, a baseline that surpasses half of their orbital periods is necessary for detection. However, Uranus requires longer observing baselines since its orbital period is roughly half of that of Neptune. If the astrometry precision is equal to or better than 10 $\mu$as, all 8,707 stars located within 30 pcs of our solar system possess the potential to detect the four giant planets within 100 years. Additionally, our prediction suggests that over 300 stars positioned within 10 pcs from our solar system could detect our Earth if they achieve an astrometry precision of 0.3 $\mu$as.

 - **Abstract**
 We study structure formation in the late Universe within the Vlasov kinetic self-consistent field approach. Our work is principally focused on the use of the modified gravitational potential with a repulsive term of the cosmological constant, which is directly linked to observations that enable characterizations of the Hubble tension as the result of local and global flows. We formulate the criteria for the formation of the semi-periodic gravitating structures, along with the predictions of their quantitative scales associated with observable parameters. Our principal conclusion is that filament formation in the Local (late) Universe can proceed as a deterministic process that is distinct from the structures at larger scales that result from the essentially stochastic dynamics of density perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 Uranus and Saturn share similarities in terms of their atmospheric composition, which is primarily made up of hydrogen and helium, as well as their ring systems. Uranus has 13 known rings, which are divided into narrow main rings, dusty rings, and outer rings. Unlike Saturn's broad ring system, Uranus' inner narrow main rings are relatively narrow, and likely consist of dark, radiation-processed organics that range from centimeters to meters in size. We assume that Uranus may have a mechanism similar to Saturn where tiny particles fall on-to the planet due to its gravity and the dragging force of the upper atmosphere. The uncharged nano-dust particles in Uranus' inner narrow rings will collide with neutral gas molecules in the exosphere and fall onto the planet. This work derives a Monte Carlo simulation of the orbital behavior of nano-dust particles in the inner narrow rings of Uranus. The model shows that the braking of the dust grain motion takes place at altitudes between 6000 km and 8000 km, and the dust particles are gradually captured into corotation with the planetary atmosphere below 4000 km altitude. The larger the dust particles are, the lower the altitude at which they will be assimilated into co-rotation. The lifetime of 1-nm dust particles to 1000 km-altitudes is estimated to be about 32.5 $\pm$ 18.8 hours, and that of 30 nm is about 2770.0 $\pm$ 213.9 hours.

 - **Abstract**
 A supermassive black hole can launch a relativistic jet when it violently disrupts a star that passes too close. Such jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare and unique tool to investigate quiescent supermassive black hole, jet physics and circumnuclear environment at high redshift. The newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc ($z\sim 1.193$) providing rich multi-band (X-ray, UV, optical, sub-millimeter and radio) data, has been interpreted as the fourth on-axis jetted TDE. In this work, we constrain the circumnuclear medium (CNM) density profile with both closure relation (CR) test and detailed forward shock model fit with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to the multi-band (optical, sub-millimeter and radio) data of AT2022cmc. We find that the CNM density profile of AT2022cmc is $n\propto R^{-k}$ with $k \sim 1.69$, implying a Bondi accretion in history. Furthermore, our model fit result suggests a two-component jet in AT2022cmc, indicating a similar jet physics to well-studied jetted TDE Sw J1644+57.

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to test the validity of general relativity (GR) on kiloparsec scales by employing a newly compiled galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) sample. We utilize the distance sum rule within the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric to obtain cosmology-independent constraints on both the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_{\rm PPN}$ and the spatial curvature $\Omega_{k}$, which overcomes the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a cosmological model grounded in GR. To calibrate the distances in the SGL systems, we introduce a novel nonparametric approach, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct a smooth distance--redshift relation from the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae. Our results show that $\gamma_{\rm PPN}=1.16_{-0.12}^{+0.15}$ and $\Omega_k=0.89_{-1.00}^{+1.97}$, indicating a spatially flat universe with the conservation of GR (i.e., $\Omega_k=0$ and $\gamma_{\rm PPN}=1$) is basically supported within $1\sigma$ confidence level. Assuming a zero spatial curvature, we find $\gamma_{\rm PPN}=1.09_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$, representing an agreement with the prediction of 1 from GR to a 9.6\% precision. If we instead assume GR holds (i.e., $\gamma_{\rm PPN}=1$), the curvature parameter constraint can be further improved to be $\Omega_k=0.11_{-0.47}^{+0.78}$. These resulting constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in testing GR on galactic scales by combining observations of strong lensing and the distance--redshift relation reconstructed by ANN.

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-ray observations of the recent outburst of 2022 from the neutron star low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) source 1A 1744-361. Spectral properties of the source have been analyzed using joint NuSTAR and NICER observations. During our observations, the source happens to be in the banana state (soft state) of the hardness intensity diagram (HID). In addition to a power-law with a high energy cutoff, the spectrum is found to exhibit broad iron $K_{\alpha}$ emission along with distinct absorption features. A prominent absorption feature observed at 6.92 keV may be interpreted as $K_{\alpha}$ absorption line from hydrogen-like iron. The absorption feature observed at 7.98 keV may be interpreted as a blend of Fe XXV and Ni XXVII transitions. We have summarized the evidence of variability of the spectral features observed in the X-ray continuum by time-resolved spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we report the results of the detailed temporal and spectral studies of the BeXRB J21347+4737 based on the data from the NuSTAR and \textit{SWIFT/XRT} in a wide energy range of 0.5-50 keV. Coherent pulsation with a period of 322.738$\;\pm\;0.018$ s was found in the light curve, implying, the source pulsation has spun down by 0.341 s $yr^{-1}$ when compared with the coherent pulsation estimated from XMM Newton more than 7 years ago. The pulse profile of the source demonstrates energy dependence and has evolved with time. The pulse fraction of the source observed by NuSTAR initially decreases with energy upto $\sim$15 keV, followed by a non-monotonic increasing trend above 15 keV. The source spectrum can be well approximated by an absorbed power-law model with modification by an exponential cutoff at high energies. The absorbed flux of the source is $4\times10^{-11}\;erg\;cm^{-2}\;s^{-1}$ and its corresponding luminosity is $3.5\times10^{35}\;erg\;s^{-1}$. The study of pulse-phase resolved spectroscopy shows a strong variation of spectral parameters on the phase. No additional emission or absorption features in the form of Fe line or Cyclotron lines were observed both in the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra of IGR J21347+4737.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings (CS) are one-dimensional cosmological-size objects predicted in realistic models of the early Universe. Analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck surveys revealed several CS candidates. One of the candidates, CSc-1, was found to be most reliable because of the statistically significant chains of gravitational lensing (GL) candidates in its field. We observed the brightest of the objects in the CSc-1 field, a galaxy pair SDSSJ110429.61+233150.3. The significant correlation between the spectra of the two components indicates the possible GL nature of the pair. Our simulations of observational data in the CSc-1 field shows that a large number of pairs can be explained by the complex geometry of the CS. Simulations of the SDSSJ110429 galaxy pair has shown that the observed angle between the components of the pair can be explained if the CS is strongly inclined and, possibly, bent in the image plane. In our preliminary data, we also detected the sign of the sharp isophotal edge in one image, which along with CMB and spectral data strongly suggests the possibility of a CS detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the robustness of the calibration of stellar models achievable with Ai Phe binary system. By means of the SCEPtER pipeline, we investigated the impact of different assumptions about the surface efficiency of microscopic diffusion. In the reference scenario, we allowed modification of the surface metallicity due to microscopic diffusion, while in the alternative scenario we assumed that competing mixing from other sources cancels out this effect. Due to the fact that the primary star has already experienced the first dredge-up while the secondary has not, the tested scenarios show interesting differences. While the estimated age is quite robust ($4.70^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$ Gyr and $4.62^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ Gyr), the calibration of the convective core overshooting parameter $\beta$ reveals noticeable differences. The reference scenario suggests a wide multi-modal range of possible values of $\beta$ around 0.10; the alternative scenario computations point towards a sharp and lower $\beta$, around 0.04. The impossibility to obtain an unambiguous fit confirms the difficulty in achieving a sensible calibration of the free parameters of stellar models using binary systems, even when very accurate masses and radii are available.

 - **Abstract**
 Ro-vibrational spectra of the $\nu_3$ and $\nu_6$ bands of chloromethane ($\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$) were recorded in the 650--1130 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range using a Fourier transform spectrometer at the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. Two isotopologues ($\mathrm{CH_3^{35}Cl}$ and $\mathrm{CH_3^{37}Cl}$) have been analyzed with the tensorial formalism developed in Dijon and a total of 6753 lines were assigned. We derived 23 tensorial parameters for the lines positions (4 for the ground state, 6 for $\nu_3$, and 13 for $\nu_6$), and 7 for the lines intensities (4 for $\nu_3$, 3 for $\nu_6$). From those parameters and self-broadening coefficients found in the literature, we simulated spectra of both isotopologues. The derived parameters were converted in the Watson formalism to be compared with a previous study. Using these results, we set up a new database of calculated chloromethane spectral lines (ChMeCaSDa).

 - **Abstract**
 The present report summarizes the main theory and implementation steps associated with SELENA (SEmi-anaLytical intEgrator for a luNar Artificial satellite), i.e. the semi-analytical propagator for lunar satellite orbits developed in the framework of the the R&T R-S20/BS-0005-062 CNES research activity in collaboration between the University of Padova (UniPd), and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), both acting as contractors with CNES. A detailed account of the method, algorithms and symbolic manipulations employed in the derivation of the final theory are described in detail in this report: they invoke the use of canonical perturbation theory in the form of Lie series computed in `closed form', i.e., without expansions in the satellite's orbital eccentricity. These algorithms are provided in the form of a symbolic package accompanying the present report. The package contains symbolic algebra programs, as well as explicit data files containing the final Hamiltonian, equations of motion and transformations (i.e. the coefficients and exponents of each variable in each term) leading to the averaging of the short-periodic terms in the satellite's equations of motion.

 - **Abstract**
 Electrons densities in different locations of our galaxy are obtained in pulsar astronomy by dividing the dispersion Measure by the distance of the pulsar to Earth. In order that such measurements will be reliable these distances should be obtained by methods which are independent of the electron density model and the results of such measurements are used in the present article to derive plasma mass densities. Our main analysis is based on the idea that the pulsars measurements are obtained for completely ionized hydrogen plasma. We use the electrons densities to derive the plasma mass densities and compare it with dark matter mass densities which are found to be much larger. But some factors which may reduce this difference are discussed. The properties of the low-density plasma are analyzed by using Saha equation.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing systems enable unique tests of departures from general relativity at the kpc-Mpc scale. In this work, the gravitational slip parameter $\gamma_{\rm PN}$, measuring the amplitude of a hypothetical fifth force, is constrained using 130 elliptical galaxy lens systems. We implement a lens model with a power-law total mass density and a deprojected De Vaucouleurs luminosity density, favored over a power-law luminosity density. To break the degeneracy between the lens velocity anisotropy, $\beta$, and the gravitational slip, we introduce a new prior on the velocity anisotropy based on recent dynamical data. For a constant gravitational slip, we find $\gamma_{\rm PN}=0.90^{+0.18}_{-0.14}$ in agreement with general relativity at the 68\% confidence level. Introducing a Compton wavelength $\lambda_g$, effectively screening the fifth force at small and large scales, the best fit is obtained for $\lambda_g \sim 0.2$ Mpc and $\gamma_{\rm PN} = 0.77^{+0.25}_{-0.14}$. A local minimum is found at $\lambda_g \sim 100$ Mpc and $\gamma_{\rm PN}=0.56^{0.45}_{-0.35}$. We conclude that there is no evidence in the data for a significant departure from general relativity and that using accurate assumptions and having good constraints on the lens galaxy model is key to ensure reliable constraints on the gravitational slip.
#### Beyond the Drake Equation: A Time-Dependent Inventory of Habitable  Planets and Life-Bearing Worlds in the Solar Neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a mathematical framework for statistical exoplanet population and astrobiology studies that may help directing future observational efforts and experiments. The approach is based on a set of differential equations and provides a time-dependent mapping between star formation, metal enrichment, and the occurrence of exoplanets and potentially life-harboring worlds over the chemo-population history of the solar neighborhood. Our results are summarized as follows: 1) the formation of exoplanets in the solar vicinity was episodic, starting with the emergence of the thick disk about 11 Gyr ago; 2) within 100 pc from the Sun, there are as many as 11,000 (eta/0.24) Earth-size planets in the habitable zone ("temperate terrestrial planets" or TTPs) of K-type stars. The solar system is younger than the median TTP, and was created in a star formation surge that peaked 5.5 Gyr ago and was triggered by an external agent; 3) the metallicity modulation of the giant planet occurrence rate results in a later typical formation time, with TTPs outnumbering giant planets at early times; 4) the closest, life-harboring Earth-like planet would be < 20 pc away if microbial life arose as soon as it did on Earth in > 1 % of the TTPs around K stars. If simple life is abundant (fast abiogenesis), it is also old, as it would have emerged more than 8 Gyr ago in about one third of all life-bearing planets today. Older Earth analogs are more likely to have developed sufficiently complex life capable of altering the environment and producing detectable oxygenic biosignatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotational dynamics of the Earth, over geological timescales, have profoundly affected local and global climatic evolution, probably contributing to the evolution of life. To better retrieve the Earth's rotational history, and motivated by the published hypothesis of a stabilized length of day during the Precambrian, we examine the effect of thermal tides on the evolution of planetary rotational motion. The hypothesized scenario is contingent upon encountering a resonance in atmospheric Lamb waves, whereby an amplified thermotidal torque cancels the opposing torque of the oceans and solid interior, driving the Earth into a rotational equilibrium. With this scenario in mind, we construct an ab initio model of thermal tides on rocky planets describing a neutrally stratified atmosphere. The model takes into account dissipative processes with Newtonian cooling and diffusive processes in the planetary boundary layer. We retrieve from this model a closed-form solution for the frequency-dependent tidal torque which captures the main spectral features previously computed using 3D general circulation models. In particular, under longwave heating, diffusive processes near the surface and the delayed thermal response of the ground prove to be responsible for attenuating, and possibly annihilating, the accelerating effect of the thermotidal torque at the resonance. When applied to the Earth, our model prediction suggests the occurrence of the Lamb resonance in the Phanerozoic, but with an amplitude that is insufficient for the rotational equilibrium. Interestingly, though our study was motivated by the Earth's history, the generic tidal solution can be straightforwardly and efficiently applied in exoplanetary settings.
#### The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE): Prospects for  Spatially-Resolved X-ray Polarimetry of Extended Sources and In-Orbit  Calibrations

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis focuses on X-ray polarimetry and its recent resurgence due to the NASA/ASI Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission launched in December 2021. It aims to address two critical tasks: in-orbit calibrations and observing faint extended celestial sources. For in-orbit calibrations, IXPE carries polarized and unpolarized calibration sources because known celestial sources, like the Crab Nebula, aren't suitable due to variability. Tests were performed on Flight Models of these calibration sources, ensuring their functionality in thermal vacuum when combined with IXPE detectors. Concerning observing faint extended sources, instrumental and diffuse backgrounds pose challenges. The impact of various background sources, such as instrumental, diffuse Galactic plane emission, and cosmic X-ray background, on X-ray polarimetry of faint, extended sources was examined. The feasibility study also covered observing two extended sources: the Tycho supernova remnant and the molecular clouds of the Sgr A complex. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the detectability of polarization. Results show that the on-board calibration system will assess and verify the GPD's functionality in orbit. Background mitigation techniques will be required for faintest extended sources. For sources like Cas A, Tycho, and PSW MSH 15-52, background effects are negligible. In conclusion, the IXPE mission opens up spatially resolved X-ray polarimetry, enabling the determination of polarization angles and degrees. Preliminary data after launch indicates that on-board calibration sources are performing as expected, and imaging capabilities meet requirements. This research is essential for advancing X-ray polarimetry and understanding high-energy celestial sources.
#### Collisional excitation of methyl (iso)cyanide by He atoms: rate  coefficients and isomerism effects

 - **Abstract**
 Among all closed-shell species observed in molecular clouds, molecules with C$_{3v}$ symmetry play a crucial role, as their rotational spectroscopy allows them to behave as a gas thermometer. In the interstellar medium, methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is the second most abundant of those (after ammonia, NH$_3$). Its isomer, methyl isocyanide (CH$_3$NC) is less abundant but has been detected in many astrophysical sources. In order to assess their absolute and relative abundances, it is essential to understand their collisional excitation properties. This paper reports the calculation of rate coefficients for rotational excitation of CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC molecules with He atoms, from low (5 K) to moderate (100 K) temperatures. We include the first 74 and 66 rotational states of both $para$ and $ortho$ symmetries of CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC, respectively. A propensity for $\Delta j=2$ transitions is observed in the case of CH$_3$CN-He collisions, whereas in the case of CH$_3$NC-He a propensity for $\Delta j=1$ is observed for transitions involving low values of $j$ and at low temperatures, while a propensity for $\Delta j=2$ is observed for higher values of $j$ and at high temperatures. A comparison of rate coefficients shows differences up to a factor of 3, depending on temperature and on the $ortho$/$para$ symmetries for dominant transitions. This confirms the importance of having specific collisional data for each isomer. We also examined the effect of these new rates on the CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC excitation in molecular clouds by performing radiative transfer calculations of the excitation and brightness temperatures for several detected lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion luminosity of young star FU Ori increased from undetectable levels to hundreds of Solar luminosities in 1937 and remains nearly as high at the present time. In a recent paper we showed how Extreme Evaporation (EE) of a young gas giant planet that migrated to a 10 day orbit around the star may power FU Ori. However, our model assumed a power-law mass-radius relation for the evaporating planet. Here we employ a stellar evolution code to model mass losing planets. We find that adiabatic planets expand rapidly, which results in runaway FUOR bursts. Super-adiabatic planets contract while losing mass; their outbursts are dimming with time. Long steadily declining bursts such as FU Ori require relatively fine tuned internal planetary structure, which may be rare. More commonly we find that super-adiabatic planets contract too rapidly and their EE falters, leading to FUOR burst stutter. This stutter allows a single planet to produce many short repeating bursts, which may be relevant to bursts observed in V346 Nor, V899, V1647. We compute broad band spectra of our best fitting scenario for FU Ori. Since the outburst is triggered behind the planet location, the mid-IR emission rises many months before the optical, similar to bursts in Gaia-17bpi and Gaia-18dvy. We show that in outbursts powered by the classic thermal instability, mid-IR lags the optical, whereas the dead zone activation models predict mid-IR light precede the optical burst by many years to decades. We comment on the stellar flyby scenario for FU Ori.

 - **Abstract**
 Convergence of the Rosseland Mean Opacity (RMO) is investigated with respect to the equation-of-state (EOS) and the number of atomic levels of iron ions prevalent at the solar radiative/convection boundary. The "chemical picture" Mihalas-Hummer-D\"{a}ppen MHD-EOS, and its variant QMHD-EOS, are studied at two representative temperature-density sets at the base of the convection zone (BCZ) and the Sandia Z experiment: $(2 \times 10^6K, \ 10^{23}/cc)$ and $(2.11 \times 10^6K, \ 3.16 \times 10^{22}/cc)$, respectively. It is found that whereas the new atomic datasets from accurate R-matrix calculations for opacities (RMOP) are vastly overcomplete, involving hundreds to over a thousand levels of each of the three Fe ions considered -- FeXVII, FeXVIII and FeXIX -- the EOS constrains contributions to RMOs by relatively fewer levels. The RMOP iron opacity spectrum is quite different from the Opacity Project distorted wave model and shows considerably more plasma broadening effects. This work points to possible improvements needed in the EOS for opacities in high-energy-density (HED) plasma sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental physical constants need not be constant, neither spatially nor temporally. -- This seeming simple statement has profound implications for a wide range of physical processes and interactions, and can be probed through a number of observations. In this chapter, we highlight how CMB measurements can constrain variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron rest mass during the cosmological recombination era. The sensitivity of the CMB anisotropies to these constants arises because they directly affect the cosmic ionization history and Thomson scattering rate, with a number of subtle atomic physics effects coming together. Recent studies have revealed that variations of the electron rest mass can indeed alleviate the Hubble tension, as we explain here. Future opportunities through measurements of the cosmological recombination radiation are briefly mentioned, highlighting how these could provide an exciting avenue towards uncovering the physical origin of the Hubble tension experimentally.

 - **Abstract**
 We have estimated the spiral pattern speed in the Galaxy $\Omega_p$ from a large sample of young open star clusters (OSCs). For this purpose, we have used 2494 OSCs younger than 50 Myr. Their mean proper motions, line-of-sight velocities, and distances were calculated by Hunt and Reffert (2023) based on data from the Gaia~DR3 catalogue. Three methods have been applied to estimate $\Omega_p$. They all are based on the linear Lin-Shu spiral density wave theory. We have obtained an estimate of $\Omega_p=24.26\pm0.52$~km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ by the first method, which is most reliable in our view, using the velocity perturbations $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ found through a spectral analysis of the radial, $V_R$, and residual rotation, $\Delta V_{\rm circ},$ velocities. Using the second method, we have found the velocity perturbations $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ by solving the basic kinematic equations together with the Galactic rotation parameters and obtained an estimate of $\Omega_p= 23.45\pm0.53$~km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. We have found $\Omega_p= 28.9\pm2.8$~km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ by the third method based on an analysis of the position angles of OSCs at their birth time $\theta_{\rm birth}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The EUSO-TA ground-based fluorescence detector of the JEM-EUSO program, which operates at the Telescope Array (TA) site in Utah (USA), is being upgraded. In the previous data acquisition campaigns, it detected the first nine ultra-high energy cosmic ray events with the external trigger provided by the Black Rock Mesa fluorescence detectors of the Telescope Array (TA-BRM-FDs). Among the upgrades, there is the installation of a trigger algorithm for the independent detection of cosmic ray air showers and upgraded electronics. A simulation study was developed to understand the performance of EUSO-TA in the new setup and different background conditions. This study allowed us to estimate the detection limit of the ground-based detector, which can be used to extrapolate the detection limit for a balloon-based detector. Moreover, it provided estimations of the expected trigger rates for ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this work, the description of the simulation setup, the method developed to rescale the energy of the cosmic rays to account for the portion of air shower actually observed rather than the whole one, and the results in terms of detection limit and trigger rates, are reported.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube alert events are neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of having astrophysical origin. In this study, we analyze 11 years of IceCube data and investigate 122 alert events and a selection of high-energy tracks detected between 2009 and the end of 2021, searching for additional continuous and transient neutrino emission within their error regions. We find no evidence for significant continuous neutrino emission from any of the alert event directions. The only locally significant neutrino emission is the transient emission associated with the blazar TXS~0506+056, with a local significance of $ 3 \sigma$, which confirms previous IceCube studies. When correcting for 122 test positions, the global p-value is $0.156$ and is compatible with the background hypothesis. We constrain the total continuous flux emitted from all 122 test positions at 100~TeV to be below $1.2 \times 10^{-15}$~(TeV cm$^2$ s)$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence assuming an $E^{-2}$ spectrum, which corresponds to 4.5\% of IceCube's astrophysical diffuse flux. Overall, we find no indication that alert events, in general, are linked to lower-energetic continuous or transient neutrino emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the high-mass gamma-ray binary LS 2883/PSR B1259--63 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory during the 2011--2014 and 2014--2017 binary cycles have shown X-ray emitting clumps, presumably ejected from the binary during periastron passages. These clumps traveled at projected velocities of $\sim0.1 c$ and have shown evidence of being accelerated. The clumps also evolved in shape, size, and flux. We monitored this binary with Chandra during the 2017--2021 binary cycle to search for additional X-ray emitting ejections. While we find evidence of extended emission in two of the six observations, it is unlike the clumps observed in the previous three binary cycles. More specifically, the extended emission is not well localized and no bright clump is observed moving away from the binary. It is still unclear what caused the lack of X-ray emitting clump in this orbital cycle, but it may be due to changes in the decretion disk of the Be star.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, a time-dependent modeling is developed to study the emission properties of blazars in the low state. Motivated by various observations, we speculate and assume that numerous discrete radiation zones throughout the jet of a blazar contribute to the broadband emission. We model the temporal evolution of the electron spectrum in each emission zone taking into account the injection, cooling and escape of relativistic electrons. By doing so, we are able to calculate the multi-wavelength emission of each radiation zone. The observed emission of a blazar is then the superposition of the emission from all discrete radiation zones. We revisit the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions, light curves and polarisation under the model, and discuss its potential to reproduce the flat radio spectra, the core-shift phenomena, the minute-scale gamma-ray variability, and the large polarisation-angle swings, which are difficult to explain under the conventional one-zone models simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new mechanism, the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs), for the cosmological production of sterile neutrinos mixing with Standard Model active neutrinos, contributing to the dark matter. PBH sterile neutrinogenesis can produce a significant relic abundance with arbitrarily small active-sterile mixing. We concentrate on PBHs that matter dominate the Universe and identify the parameter space where decays of these sterile neutrinos could explain the putative 3.5 keV signal or potential signals in future experiments e.g. XRISM or beyond NuSTAR. The association of X-ray and gravitational wave signals is a unique feature of this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 On 12 December 2023, the star $\alpha$ Orionis (Betelgeuse) will be occulted by the asteroid (319) Leona. This represents an extraordinary and unique opportunity to analyze the diameter and brightness distribution of Betelgeuse's photosphere with extreme angular resolution by studying the light curve as the asteroid occults the star from different points on Earth and at different wavelengths. Here we present observations of another occultation by Leona on 13 September 2023 to determine its projected shape and size in preparation for the December 12th event. The occultation observation campaign was highly successful. The effective diameter in projected area derived from the positive detections at 17 sites turned out to be 66 km $\pm$ 2 km using an elliptical fit to the instantaneous limb. The body is highly elongated, with dimensions of 79.6 $\pm$ 2.2 km x 54.8 $\pm$ 1.3 km in its long and short axis, respectively, at the occultation time. Also, an accurate position coming from the occultation, to improve the orbit determination of Leona for December 12 is provided.

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of our study is to assess the environmental impact of the installation and use of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) prototype detection units, based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and to propose recommendations that contribute to reduce the environmental impacts of the project at later stages. The functional unit, namely the quantified description of the studied system and of the performance requirements it fulfills, is to detect radio signals autonomously during 20 years, with 300 detection units deployed over 200 km^2 in the Gansu province in China (corresponding to the prototype GRANDProto300). We consider four main phases: the extraction of the materials and the production of the detection units (upstream phases), the use and the end-of-life phases (downstream phases), with transportation between each step. An inventory analysis is performed for the seven components of each detection unit, based on transparent assumptions. Most of the inventory data are taken from the Idemat2021 database (Industrial Design & Engineering Materials). Our results show that the components with the highest environmental impact are the antenna structure and the battery. The most pregnant indicators are `resource use', mineral and metals'; `resource use, fossils'; `ionizing radiation, human health'; `climate change'; and `acidification'. Therefore, the actions that we recommend in the first place aim at reducing the impact of these components. They include limiting the mass of the raw material used in the antenna, changing the alloy of the antenna, considering another type of battery with an extended useful life, and the use of recycled materials for construction. As a pioneering study applying the LCA methodology to a large-scale physics experiment, this work can serve as a basis for future assessments by other collaborations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological tensions, in particular, to infer the local value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, have developed new independent techniques to constrain cosmological parameters in several cosmologies. Moreover, even when the concordance Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained with local observables, its physics has shown deviations from a flat background. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a flat $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the $H_0$ value in tension with other techniques, in this paper we study new cosmological constraints in spatial curvature dark energy models. Additionally, to standard current Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) catalogs, we extend the empirical distance ladder method through an SNIa sample using the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to forecast SNIa up to $z \sim 6$, with information on the star formation rates at high redshift. Furthermore, we found that our constraints provide an improvement in the statistics associated with $\Omega_{m}$ when combining SNIa Pantheon and SNIa Pantheon+ catalogs with JW forecasting data.

 Based on recent data about the history of the Hubble factor, it is argued that the second law of thermodynamics holds at the largest scales accessible to observation. This is consistent with previous studies of the same question.
