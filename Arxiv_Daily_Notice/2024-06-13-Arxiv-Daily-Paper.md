          Stellar-Mass Black Holes with Dark Matter Mini-Spikes: Evidence of a Primordial Origin?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of three nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility that these stellar-mass black holes may actually have a primordial origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The scaling of galaxy properties with halo mass suggests that feedback loops regulate star formation, but there is no consensus yet about how those feedback loops work. To help clarify discussions of galaxy-scale feedback, Paper I presented a very simple model for supernova feedback that it called the minimalist regulator model. This followup paper interprets that model and discusses its implications. The model itself is an accounting system that tracks all of the mass and energy associated with a halo's circumgalactic baryons--the central galaxy's atmosphere. Algebraic solutions for the equilibrium states of that model reveal that star formation in low-mass halos self-regulates primarily by expanding the atmospheres of those halos, ultimately resulting in stellar masses that are insensitive to the mass-loading properties of galactic winds. What matters most is the proportion of supernova energy that couples with circumgalactic gas. However, supernova feedback alone fails to expand galactic atmospheres in higher-mass halos. According to the minimalist regulator model, an atmospheric contraction crisis ensues, which may be what triggers strong black-hole feedback. The model also predicts that circumgalactic medium properties emerging from cosmological simulations should depend largely on the specific energy of the outflows they produce, and we interpret the qualitative properties of several numerical simulations in light of that prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars can be detected from very large distances due to their high luminosity. However, the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars beyond $z=3$ has only been confirmed for a small number of sources. Such observations probe the growth of supermassive black holes close to the peak of star formation in the history of galaxy evolution. As a result from a continuous monitoring of a sample of 80 $z>3$ blazars with Fermi-LAT, we present the first detection of a $\gamma$-ray flare from the $z=4.31$ blazar TXS 1508+572. This source showed high $\gamma$-ray activity from February to August 2022, reaching a peak luminosity comparable to the most luminous flares ever detected with Fermi -LAT. We conducted a multiwavelength observing campaign involving XMM-Newton, Swift, the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array. In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and NEOWISE at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily time scales. The spectral energy distribution collected during our campaign is well described by a one-zone leptonic model, with the $\gamma$-ray flare originating from an increase of external Compton emission as a result of a fresh injection of accelerated electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the structures of open clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Based on Gaia DR3 data, we apply the hierarchical clustering algorithm to a young open cluster NGC 6530 and group its members into 5 substructures. By linear tracing with the kinematic information of their members, we find that: Sub 1 is the core of the cluster. It is expanding slowly. Sub 2 consists of less bound members, which began escaping from the core about 0.78 Myr ago. Sub 3 is associated with a young star forming region. It will merge with the core after 0.72 Myr; Sub 4, as an outskirt group, is also moving towards the core, but won't end up falling in. While Sub 5 is composed of less-bound members with field contamination. This work reveals the complex internal structure and evolutionary trends of the cluster NGC 6530. It also shows the potential of the hierarchical clustering algorithm in star cluster structure analysis.

          Influence of Orbit and Mass Constraints on Reflected Light Characterization of Directly Imaged Rocky Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Survey strategies for upcoming exoplanet direct imaging missions have considered varying assumptions of prior knowledge. Precursor radial velocity surveys could have detected nearby exo-Earths and provided prior orbit and mass constraints. Alternatively, a direct imaging mission performing astrometry could yield constraints on orbit and phase angle of target planets. Understanding the impact of prior mass and orbit information on planetary characterization is crucial for efficiently recognizing habitable exoplanets. To address this question, we use a reflected-light retrieval tool to infer the atmospheric and bulk properties of directly imaged Earth-analogs while considering varying levels of prior information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Because of the strong correlation between the orbit-related parameters and the planetary radius, prior information on the orbital distance and planetary phase yield tight constraints on the planetary radius: from $R_{\rm{p}}=2.95^{+2.69}_{-1.95}~R_{\oplus}$ without prior knowledge, to $R_{\rm{p}}=1.01^{+0.33}_{-0.19}~R_{\oplus}$ with prior determination of the orbit for $\rm{SNR}=20$ in the visible/near-infrared spectral range, thus allowing size determination from reflected light observations. However, additional knowledge of planet mass does not notably enhance radius ($R_{\rm{p}}=0.98^{+0.17}_{-0.14}~R_{\oplus}$) or atmospheric characterization. Also, prior knowledge of the mass alone does not yield a tight radius constraint ($R_{\rm{p}}=1.64^{+1.29}_{-0.80}~R_{\oplus}$) nor improves atmospheric composition inference. By contrast, because of its sensitivity to gas column abundance, detecting a Rayleigh scattering slope or bounding Rayleigh opacity helps to refine gas mixing ratio inferences without requiring prior mass knowledge. Overall, apart from radius determination, increasing the SNR is more beneficial than additional prior observations.

          Rocky planet formation in compact disks around M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planets in compact configurations are the most common ones around M dwarfs. Many disks around very low mass stars (between 0.1 and 0.5 M$_\odot$) are rather compact and small (without observable substructures and radius less than 20 au), which favours the idea of an efficient radial drift that could enhance planet formation in compact orbits. We aim to investigate the potential formation paths of the observed close-in rocky exoplanet population around M dwarfs, assuming that planet formation could take place in compact disks with an efficient dust radial drift. We developed N-body simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by pebble accretion exposed to planet-disk interactions, star-planet tidal interactions and general relativistic corrections. For a star of 0.1 M$_\odot$ we considered different gas disk viscosity and initial embryo distributions. We also explore planet formation by pebble accretion around stars of 0.3 and 0.5 M$_\odot$. Lastly, for each stellar mass, we run simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by planetesimal accretion. Our main result is that the sample of simulated planets that grow by pebble accretion in a gas disk with low viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) can reproduce the close-in low-mass exoplanet population around M dwarfs in terms of multiplicity, masses and semi-major axis. Furthermore, we found that a gas disk with high viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-3}$) can not reproduce the observed planet masses. Also, we show that planetesimal accretion favours the formation of smaller planets than the ones formed by pebble accretion. Rocky planet formation around M dwarfs can take place in compact and small dust disks driven by an efficient radial drift in a gas disk with low viscosity. This result points towards a new approach in the direction of the disk conditions needed for rocky planet formation around very low mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet direct imaging using adaptive optics (AO) is often limited by non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) and aberrations that are invisible to traditional pupil-plane wavefront sensors (WFSs). This can be remedied by focal-plane (FP) WFSs that characterize aberrations directly from a final science image. Photonic lanterns (PLs) can act as low-order FPWFSs with the ability to direct some light to downstream science instruments. Using a PL on the SEAL (Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory) high-contrast imaging testbed, we demonstrate (1) linear ranges and (2) closed-loop control. Additionally, we simulate the use of the PL in a multi-wavefront sensor AO system, in which multiple WFSs feed back to the same common-path deformable mirror. Building on previous multi-WFS AO demonstrations on SEAL, we simulate a modulated pyramid WFS to sense aberrations of high spatial order and large amplitude, and the PL to sense low order aberrations including NCPAs. We assess adaptive optics performance in this setting using three different PL wavefront reconstruction algorithms. We also provide a new method to experimentally identify the propagation matrix of a PL, making advanced model-based algorithms practical. This work demonstrates the role of photonic technologies and multi-stage wavefront sensing in the context of extreme AO and high contrast imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN\,2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim\,4\,\times\,10^{14}$\,cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times\, 10^{-3}$\,\Msun\,yr$^{-1}$\,is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 \kms, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur chemistry in the formation process of low-mass stars and planets remains poorly understood. The protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are the birthplace of planets and its distinctive environment provides an intriguing platform for investigating models of sulfur chemistry. We analyzed the ALMA observations of CS 7-6 transitions in the HD 163296 disk and perform astrochemical modeling to explore its sulfur chemistry. We simulated the distribution of sulfur-containing molecules and compared it with observationally deduced fractional column densities. We have found that the simulated column density of CS is consistent with the observationally deduced fractional column densities, while the simulated column density of C$_2$S is lower than the observationally deduced upper limits on column densities. This results indicate that we have a good understanding of the chemical properties of CS and C$_2$S in the disk. We also investigated the influence of the C/O ratio on sulfur-containing molecules and found that the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S near the central star are dependent on the C/O ratio. Additionally, we found that the $N$[CS]/$N$[SO] ratio can serve as a promising indicator of the disk's C/O ratio in the HD 163296. Overall, the disk of HD 163296 provides a favorable environment for the detection of sulfur-containing molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets are celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our Solar System. Although historically they posed detection challenges, Kepler's data has revolutionized our understanding. By analyzing flux values from the Kepler Mission, we investigate the intricate patterns in starlight that may indicate the presence of exoplanets. This study investigates a novel approach for exoplanet classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) applied to data obtained from the NASA Kepler mission. SNNs offer a unique advantage by mimicking the spiking behavior of neurons in the brain, allowing for more nuanced and biologically inspired processing of temporal data. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN architecture, excelling in various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

          Probing the filamentary nature of star formation in the California giant molecular cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that filamentary structures are representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds and support a filament paradigm for star formation, potentially accounting for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Using Herschel imaging observations of the California giant molecular cloud, we aim to further investigate the filament paradigm for low- to intermediate-mass star formation and to better understand the exact role of filaments in the origin of stellar masses. Using the multiscale, multiwavelength extraction method getsf, we identify starless cores, protostars, and filaments in the Herschel data set and separate these components from the background cloud contribution to determine accurate core and filament properties. Both the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the distribution of filament masses per unit length or filament line mass function (FLMF) are consistent with power-law distributions at the high-mass end, $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log}M\propto M^{-1.4 \pm 0.2}$ at $M > 1\,M_\odot$ for the CMF and $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log} {M}_{\rm line} \propto {M}_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.2}$ for the FLMF at $M_{\rm line} > 10\,M_\odot {\rm pc^{-1}}$, which are both consistent with the Salpeter power-law IMF. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for the origin of the CMF in filaments, whereby the global prestellar CMF in a molecular cloud arises from the integration of the CMFs generated by individual thermally supercritical filaments within the cloud. Our findings support the existence a tight connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF and suggests that filamentary structures represent a critical evolutionary step in establishing a Salpeter-like mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of $10^{38\sim39}$ erg/s. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circum-nuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow-diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2$\sim0.8$ c, the total mass of $10^{-3}\sim10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are $0.1\sim1$ pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.

          A Census of Sun's Ancestors and their Contributions to the Solar System Chemical Composition

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we compute the rates and numbers of different types of stars and phenomena (SNe, novae, white dwarfs, merging neutron stars, black holes) that contributed to the chemical composition of the Solar System. Stars die and restore the newly formed elements into the interstellar gas. This process is called "chemical evolution". In particular, we analyse the death rates of stars of all masses, dying either quiescently or explosively. These rates and total star numbers are computed in the context of a revised version of the two-infall model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, which reproduces fairly well the observed abundance patterns of several chemical species, as well as the global solar metallicity. We compute also the total number of stars ever born and still alive as well as the number of stars born up to the formation of the Solar System and with a mass and metallicity like the Sun. This latter number will account for all the possible existing Solar Systems which can host life in the solar vicinity. Among all the stars (from 0.8 to 100 M$_{\odot}$) born and died from the beginning up to the Solar System formation epoch, which contributed to its chemical composition, 93.00$\%$ are represented by stars dying as single white dwarfs (without interacting significantly with a companion star) and originating in the mass range 0.8-8 M$_{\odot}$, while 5.24$\%$ are neutron stars and 0.73$\%$ are black holes, both originating from SNe core-collapse (M>8 M$_{\odot}$); 0.64$\%$ are Type Ia SNe and 0.40$\%$ are nova systems, both originating from the same mass range as the white dwarfs. The number of stars similar to the Sun born from the beginning up to the Solar System formation, with metallicity in the range 12+log(Fe/H)= 7.50 $\pm$ 0.04 dex is 3.1732$\cdot$ 10$^{7}$, and in particular our Sun is the 2.6092$\cdot$ 10$^7$-th star of this kind, born in the solar vicinity.

          MOCCA: Global properties of tidally filling and underfilling globular star clusters with multiple stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the evolution of various properties of multiple-population globular clusters (GCs) for a broad range of initial conditions. We simulated over 200 GC models using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code and find that present-day properties (core and half-light radii, ratio of the number of second-generation (SG) stars to the total number of stars, NSG/NTOT) of these models cover the observed values of these quantities for Milky Way GCs. Starting with a relatively small value of the SG fraction (NSG/NTOT ~ 0.25) and a SG system concentrated in the inner regions of the cluster, we find, in agreement with previous studies, that systems in which the first-generation (FG) is initially tidally filling or slightly tidally underfilling best reproduce the observed ratios of NSG/NTOT and have values of the core and half-light radii typical of those of many Galactic globular clusters. Models in which the FG is initially tidally underfilling retain values of NSG/NTOT close to their initial values. These simulations expand previous investigations and serve to further constrain the viable range of initial parameters and better understand their influence on present-day GC properties. The results of this investigation also provide the basis for our future survey aimed at building specific models to reproduce the observed trends (or lack thereof) between the properties of multiple stellar populations and other clusters properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiters south polar region was observed by JWST Mid Infrared Instrument in December 2022. We used the Medium Resolution Spectrometer mode to provide new information about Jupiters South Polar stratosphere. The southern auroral region was visible and influenced the atmosphere in several ways. 1: In the interior of the southern auroral oval, we retrieved peak temperatures at two distinct pressure levels near 0.01 and 1 mbar, with warmer temperatures with respect to non auroral regions of 12 pm 2 K and 37 pm 4 K respectively. A cold polar vortex is centered at 65S at 10 mbar. 2: We found that the homopause is elevated to 590+25-118 km above the 1-bar pressure level inside the auroral oval compared to 460+60-50 km at neighboring latitudes and with an upper altitude of 350 km in regions not affected by auroral precipitation. 3: The retrieved abundance of C2H2 shows an increase within the auroral oval, and it exhibits high abundances throughout the polar region. The retrieved abundance of C2H6 increases towards the pole, without being localized in the auroral oval, in contrast with previous analysis. We determined that the warming at 0.01 mbar and the elevated homopause might be caused by the flux of charged particles depositing their energy in the South Polar Region. The 1 mbar hotspot may arise from adiabatic heating resulting from auroral driven downwelling. The cold region at 10 mbar may be caused by radiative cooling by stratospheric aerosols. The differences in spatial distribution seem to indicate that the hydrocarbons analyzed are affected differently by auroral precipitation.

 - **Abstract**
 We are probing the gravitational force perpendicular to the Galactic plane at the position of the Sun with a sample of red giants whose measurements are taken from the DR3-Gaia catalogue. Measurements far out of the Galactic plane up to 3.5 kpc allow us to determine directly the total mass density where dark matter is dominant, while stellar and gas densities are very low. In a complementary way, we are also using a new determination of the local baryonic mass density to help us determine the density of dark matter in the Galactic plane at the solar position. We obtain for the local mass density of dark matter $\rho_\mathrm{dm}$=0.0128$\pm $0.0008 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$ = 0.486 $\pm$0.030 Gev cm$^{-3}$, for the flattening of the gravitational potential of the dark halo $q_\mathrm{\phi,h}$=0.843$\pm0.035$, and for its density $q_\mathrm{\rho,h}$=0.781$\pm$0.055.

          Exploring the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b. Constraints on atmospheric chemistry and dynamics from a joint retrieval of VLT/CRIRES$^+$ and space photometric data

 - **Abstract**
 Despite recent progress in the spectroscopic characterization of individual exoplanets, the atmospheres of key ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) still lack comprehensive investigations. These include WASP-178b, one of the most irradiated UHJs known to date. We observed the dayside emission signal of this planet with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K-band. By applying the cross-correlation technique and a Bayesian retrieval framework to the high-resolution spectra, we identified the emission signature of $^{12}$CO (S/N = 8.9) and H$_2$O (S/N = 4.9), and a strong atmospheric thermal inversion. A joint retrieval with space-based secondary eclipse measurements from TESS and CHEOPS allows us to refine our results on the thermal profile and thus to constrain the atmospheric chemistry, yielding a solar to super-solar metallicity (1.4$\pm$1.6 dex) and a solar C/O ratio (0.6$\pm$0.2). We infer a significant excess of spectral line broadening and identify a slight Doppler-shift between the $^{12}$CO and H$_2$O signals. These findings provide strong evidence for a super-rotating atmospheric flow pattern and suggest the possible existence of chemical inhomogeneities across the planetary dayside hemisphere. In addition, the inclusion of photometric data in our retrieval allows us to account for stellar light reflected by the planetary atmosphere, resulting in an upper limit on the geometric albedo (0.23). The successful characterization of WASP-178b's atmosphere through a joint analysis of CRIRES$^+$, TESS, and CHEOPS observations highlights the potential of combined studies with space- and ground-based instruments and represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.

          Why does the Milky Way have a metallicity floor?

 - **Abstract**
 The prevalence of light element enhancement in the most metal-poor stars is potentially an indication that the Milky Way has a metallicity floor for star formation around $\sim$10$^{-3.5}$ Z$_{\odot}$. We propose that this metallicity floor has its origins in metal-enriched star formation in the minihalos present during the Galaxy's initial formation. To arrive at this conclusion, we analyze a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows the concurrent evolution of multiple Population III star-forming minihalos. The main driver for the central gas within minihalos is the steady increase in hydrostatic pressure as the halos grow. We incorporate this insight into a hybrid one-zone model that switches between pressure-confined and modified free-fall modes to evolve the gas density with time according to the ratio of the free-fall and sound-crossing timescales. This model is able to accurately reproduce the density and chemo-thermal evolution of the gas in each of the simulated minihalos up to the point of runaway collapse. We then use this model to investigate how the gas responds to the absence of H$_{2}$. Without metals, the central gas becomes increasingly stable against collapse as it grows to the atomic cooling limit. When metals are present in the halo at a level of $\sim$10$^{-3.7}$ Z$_{\odot}$, however, the gas is able to achieve gravitational instability while still in the minihalo regime. Thus, we conclude that the Galaxy's metallicity floor is set by the balance within minihalos of gas-phase metal cooling and the radiation background associated with its early formation environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a complete numerical model of the afterglow of a laterally-structured relativistic ejecta from radio to very high energy (VHE). This includes a self-consistent calculation of the synchrotron radiation, with its maximum frequency, and of Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) scatterings taking into account the Klein-Nishina regime. The attenuation due to pair production is also included. This model is computationally-efficient, allowing for multi-wavelength data fitting. As a validation test, the radiative model is used to fit the broad-band spectrum of GRB 190114C at 90 s up to the TeV range. The full model is then used to fit the afterglow of GW 170817 and predict its VHE emission. We find that the SSC flux at the peak was much dimmer than the upper limit from H.E.S.S. observations. However, we show that either a smaller viewing angle or a larger external density would make similar off-axis events detectable in the future at VHE, even above 100 Mpc with the sensitivity of the CTA. Large external densities are expected in the case of fast mergers, but the existence of a formation channel for such binary neutron stars is still uncertain. We highlight that VHE afterglow detections would help probing efficiently such systems.

          Yellow hypergiant V509 Cas -- stable in the 'yellow void'

 - **Abstract**
 The yellow hypergiant star V509 Cas is currently undergoing an extreme phase of evolution. Having experienced eruptive mass-loss outbursts in the 20th century, the star's effective temperature reached record high values in the early 2000s. However, since then, the star's behaviour has displayed an unprecedented level of stability. In spite of that, the star could be traversing through the 'yellow void' instability region. To describe the current evolutionary state of V509 Cas, we analysed its variability using photometric and spectroscopic data collected over recent years. By comparing our findings with historical records, we aim to determine whether the star's surface shows signs of stabilisation. Additionally, we investigate the variability of emission components in the wings of certain spectral lines to highlight the contribution of the circumstellar gaseous disc to this phenomenon. Our spectroscopic monitoring observations were carried out at Tartu Observatory over the course of seven years, supplemented by echelle spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope, as well as publicly available photometric data from Gaia, AAVSO, and AAVSO's Bright Star Monitor programme. We estimated the variability of effective temperature and radial velocity from the spectral time series and correlated it with the brightness variability of V509 Cas. The results indicate that the star's average brightness level has remained stable throughout the observed period, with an amplitude of variability ~0.1 mag. While the amplitude of short-term temperature fluctuations has decreased compared to the early 2000s, the variability of the radial velocity remains similar to historical values from the early 20th century. Moreover, we show how the variable radial velocity affects the emission components in some absorption lines (e.g. Sc II) and how that follows the hypothesis of a disc surrounding the star.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate flux density calibration is essential for precise analysis and interpretation of observations across different observation modes and instruments. In this research, we firstly introduce the flux calibration model incorporated in HIFAST pipeline, designed for processing HI 21-cm spectra. Furthermore, we investigate different calibration techniques and assess the dependence of the gain parameter on the time and environmental factors. A comparison is carried out in various observation modes (e.g. tracking and scanning modes) to determine the flux density gain ($G$), revealing insignificant discrepancies in $G$ among different methods. Long-term monitoring data shows a linear correlation between $G$ and atmospheric temperature. After subtracting the $G$--Temperature dependence, the dispersion of $G$ is reduced to $<$3% over a one-year time scale. The stability of the receiver response of FAST is considered sufficient to facilitate HI observations that can accommodate a moderate error in flux calibration (e.g., $>\sim5\%$) when utilizing a constant $G$ for calibration purposes. Our study will serve as a useful addition to the results provided by Jiang et al. (2020). Detailed measurement of $G$ for the 19 beams of FAST, covering the frequency range 1000 MHz -- 1500 MHz can be found on the HIFAST homepage: this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity model, formulated as \( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (\texttt{OHD}); ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (\texttt{SNIa}); iii) a combined dataset (\texttt{OHD+SNIa}); and large scale structure datasets, including iv) 14 growth rate data points (\texttt{f}); and v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (\texttt{f}$\sigma_8$). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the \(\Lambda\)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model's efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher or NIRPS is a precision radial velocity spectrograph developed through collaborative efforts among laboratories in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, France, Portugal and Spain. NIRPS extends to the 0.98-1.8 $\mu$m domain of the pioneering HARPS instrument at the La Silla 3.6-m telescope in Chile and it has achieved unparalleled precision, measuring stellar radial velocities in the infrared with accuracy better than 1 m/s. NIRPS can be used either stand-alone or simultaneously with HARPS. Commissioned in late 2022 and early 2023, NIRPS embarked on a 5-year Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program in April 2023, spanning 720 observing nights. This program focuses on planetary systems around M dwarfs, encompassing both the immediate solar vicinity and transit follow-ups, alongside transit and emission spectroscopy observations. We highlight NIRPS's current performances and the insights gained during its deployment at the telescope. The lessons learned and successes achieved contribute to the ongoing advancement of precision radial velocity measurements and high spectral fidelity, further solidifying NIRPS' role in the forefront of the field of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for atmospheric constituents for the UHJ WASP-178 b with two ESPRESSO transits using the narrow-band and cross-correlation techniques, focusing on the detections of NaI, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, MgI, FeI and FeII. Additionally, we show parallel photometry used to obtain updated and precise stellar, planetary and orbital parameters. We report the resolved line detections of NaI (5.5 and 5.4 $\sigma$), H$\alpha$ (13 $\sigma$), H$\beta$ (7.1 $\sigma$), and tentatively MgI (4.6 $\sigma$). In cross-correlation, we confirm the MgI detection (7.8 and 5.8 $\sigma$) and additionally report the detections of FeI (12 and 10 $\sigma$) and FeII (11 and 8.4 $\sigma$), on both nights separately. The detection of MgI remains tentative, however, due to the differing results between both nights, as well as compared with the narrow-band derived properties. None of our resolved spectral lines probing the mid- to upper atmosphere show significant shifts relative to the planetary rest frame, however H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ exhibit line broadenings of 39.6 $\pm$ 2.1 km/s and 27.6 $\pm$ 4.6 km/s, respectively, indicating the onset of possible escape. WASP-178 b differs from similar UHJ with its lack of strong atmospheric dynamics in the upper atmosphere, however the broadening seen for FeI (15.66 $\pm$ 0.58 km/s) and FeII (11.32 $\pm$ 0.52 km/s) could indicate the presence of winds in the mid-atmosphere. Future studies on the impact of the flux variability caused by the host star activity might shed more light on the subject. Previous work indicated the presence of SiO cloud-precursors in the atmosphere of WASP-178 b and a lack of MgI and FeII. However, our results suggest that a scenario where the planetary atmosphere is dominated by MgI and FeII is more likely. In light of our results, we encourage future observations to further elucidate these atmospheric properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to differentiate between cosmological models, especially in the case where they are nested and the additional model parameters are close to zero, making it difficult to discriminate them with traditional approaches. Our method complements Bayesian analyses for cosmological model selection, which heavily depend on the chosen priors and average the unnormalized posterior over potentially large prior volumes. By analyzing simulated realistic data sets of the growth rate of the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, based on current galaxy-clustering survey specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model, we demonstrate the potential of NNs to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from cosmological LSS data. We find that the NN can successfully distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and the $f(R)$ models, by predicting the correct model with approximately $97\%$ overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that NNs can maximise the potential of current and next generation surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2$\sigma$ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ~6 to 230 days and ~10$^{38}$ to 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of 0.80$^{+0.31}_{-0.23}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing data is frequently collected at low resolution due to instrumental limitations and observing conditions. Machine learning-based super-resolution techniques offer a method to enhance the resolution of these images, enabling more precise measurements of lensing effects and a better understanding of the matter distribution in the lensing system. This enhancement can significantly improve our knowledge of the distribution of mass within the lensing galaxy and its environment, as well as the properties of the background source being lensed. Traditional super-resolution techniques typically learn a mapping function from lower-resolution to higher-resolution samples. However, these methods are often constrained by their dependence on optimizing a fixed distance function, which can result in the loss of intricate details crucial for astrophysical analysis. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DiffLense}$, a novel super-resolution pipeline based on a conditional diffusion model specifically designed to enhance the resolution of gravitational lensing images obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Our approach adopts a generative model, leveraging the detailed structural information present in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) counterparts. The diffusion model, trained to generate HST data, is conditioned on HSC data pre-processed with denoising techniques and thresholding to significantly reduce noise and background interference. This process leads to a more distinct and less overlapping conditional distribution during the model's training phase. We demonstrate that $\texttt{DiffLense}$ outperforms existing state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution techniques, particularly in retaining the fine details necessary for astrophysical analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 In our previous work, we introduced a method that combines two unsupervised algorithms: DBSCAN and GMM. We applied this method to 12 open clusters based on Gaia EDR3 data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying reliable cluster members within the tidal radius. However, for studying cluster morphology, we need a method capable of detecting members both inside and outside the tidal radius. By incorporating a supervised algorithm into our approach, we successfully identified members beyond the tidal radius. In our current work, we initially applied DBSCAN and GMM to identify reliable members of cluster stars. Subsequently, we trained the Random Forest algorithm using DBSCAN and GMM-selected data. Leveraging the random forest, we can identify cluster members outside the tidal radius and observe cluster morphology across a wide field of view. Our method was then applied to 15 open clusters based on Gaia DR3, which exhibit a wide range of metallicity, distances, members, and ages. Additionally, we calculated the tidal radius for each of the 15 clusters using the King profile and detected stars both inside and outside this radius. Finally, we investigated mass segregation and luminosity distribution within the clusters. Overall, our approach significantly improved the estimation of the tidal radius and detection of mass segregation compared to previous work. We found that in Collinder 463, low-mass stars do not segregate in comparison to high-mass and middle-mass stars. Additionally, we detected a peak of luminosity in the clusters, some of which were located far from the center, beyond the tidal radius.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CLP) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w_{\rm eff}<-1$ at early times that are challenging to realize in theoretically consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CLP at early times, possibly with $w_{\rm eff}>-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CLP at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the big advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, the diversity of strong lens modeling methods has exploded, from being purely analytical to pixelated and non-parametric, or based on deep learning. We embrace this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we use the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we study the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. In particular, we simulate and infer parameters of an elliptical power-law mass distribution with external shear for the lens while each modeling method reconstructs the source differently. We find that overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigate a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.
