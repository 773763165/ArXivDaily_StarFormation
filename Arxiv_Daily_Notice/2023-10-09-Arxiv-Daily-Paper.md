 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star enters the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If the star only grazes the tidal radius, a fraction of the stellar mass will be accreted in a partial TDE (pTDE). The remainder can continue orbiting and may re-disrupted at pericenter, causing a repeating pTDE. pTDEs may be as or more common than full TDEs (fTDEs), yet few are known. In this work, we present the discovery of the first repeating pTDE from a systematically-selected sample, AT\,2020vdq. AT\,2020vdq was originally identified as an optically- and radio-flaring TDE. Around $3$ years after its discovery, it rebrightened dramatically and rapidly in the optical. The optical flare was remarkably fast and luminous compared to previous TDEs. It was accompanied by extremely broad (${\sim}0.1c$) optical/UV spectral features and faint X-ray emission ($L_X \sim 3\times10^{41}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), but no new radio-emitting component. Based on the transient optical/UV spectral features and the broadband light curve, we show that AT\,2020vdq is a repeating pTDE. We then use it to constrain TDE models; in particular, we favor a star originally in a very tight binary system that is tidally broken apart by the Hills mechanism. We also constrain the repeating pTDE rate to be $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, with uncertainties dominated by the unknown distribution of pTDE repeat timescales. In the Hills framework, this means the binary fraction in the galactic nucleus is of the order few percent.

 - **Abstract**
 An important characteristic of cosmic reionization is the growth of ionized gas bubbles surrounding early luminous objects. Understanding the connections between the formation and coalescence of these bubbles and their originating astrophysical sources is equally critical. We present results from a study of bubble sizes using the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation. We employ the mean-free path method, and track the evolution of the effective ionized bubble size at each point ($R_{\rm eff}$) throughout the Epoch of Reionization. We show there is a slow growth period for regions ionized early, but a rapid flash ionization process for regions ionized later as they immediately enter a large, pre-existing bubble. We also find that bright sources are preferentially in larger bubbles, and find consistency with recent observational constraints at $z \gtrsim 9$, but tension with idealized Lyman-alpha damping-wing models at $z \approx 7$ when the size distribution is complex. We find that high overdensity regions have larger characteristic bubble sizes, but the correlation decreases as reionization progresses, likely due to the runaway formation of large percolated bubbles. Finally, we compare the redshift at which a region transitions from neutral to ionized ($z_{\rm reion}$) with the time it takes to reach a given bubble size and conclude that $z_{\rm reion}$ is a reasonable local probe of small-scale bubble size statistics ($R_\text{eff} \lesssim 1$ cMpc). However, for larger bubbles, the correspondence between $z_{\rm reion}$ and size statistics weakens due to the time delay between the onset of reionization and the expansion of a large bubble, particularly at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first analysis of JWST near-infrared spectroscopy of stellar flares from TRAPPIST-1 during transits of rocky exoplanets. Four flares were observed from 0.6--2.8 $\mu$m with NIRISS and 0.6--3.5 $\mu$m with NIRSpec during transits of TRAPPIST-1b, f, and g. We discover P$\alpha$ and Br$\beta$ line emission and characterize flare continuum at wavelengths from 1--3.5 $\mu$m for the first time. Observed lines include H$\alpha$, P$\alpha$-P$\epsilon$, Br$\beta$, He I $\lambda$0.7062$\mu$m, two Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) lines, and the He I IRT. We observe a reversed Paschen decrement from P$\alpha$-P$\gamma$ alongside changes in the light curve shapes of these lines. The continuum of all four flares is well-described by blackbody emission with an effective temperature below 5300 K, lower than temperatures typically observed at optical wavelengths. The 0.6--1 $\mu$m spectra were convolved with the TESS response, enabling us to measure the flare rate of TRAPPIST-1 in the TESS bandpass. We find flares of 10$^{30}$ erg large enough to impact transit spectra occur at a rate of 3.6$\substack{+2.1 \\ -1.3}$ flare d$^{-1}$, $\sim$10$\times$ higher than previous predictions from K2. We measure the amount of flare contamination at 2 $\mu$m for the TRAPPIST-1b and f transits to be 500$\pm$450 and 2100$\pm$400 ppm, respectively. We find up to 80% of flare contamination can be removed, with mitigation most effective from 1.0--2.4 $\mu$m. These results suggest transits affected by flares may still be useful for atmospheric characterization efforts.
#### A MeerKAT view of the pulsars in the globular cluster NGC 6522

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of observations aimed at discovering and studying pulsars in the core-collapsed globular cluster (GC) NGC 6522 performed by the MeerTIME and TRAPUM Large Survey Project with the MeerKAT telescope. We have discovered two new isolated pulsars bringing the total number of known pulsars in the cluster to six. PSR J1803$-$3002E is a mildly recycled pulsar with spin period of 17.9 ms while pulsar PSR J1803$-$3002F is a slow pulsar with spin period of 148.1 ms. The presence of isolated and slow pulsars is expected in NGC 6522 and confirms the predictions of previous theories for clusters at this stage in evolution. We further present a tentative timing solution for the millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1803$-$3002C combining older observations taken with the Parkes 64m radio telescope, Murriyang. This solution implies a relatively small characteristic age of the pulsar in contrast with the old age of the GC. The presence of a slow pulsar and an apparently young MSP, both rare in GCs, suggests that their formation might be linked to the evolutionary stage of the cluster.
#### Not So Fast Kepler-1513: A Perturbing Planetary Interloper in the  Exomoon Corridor

 - **Abstract**
 Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) can be induced by a range of physical phenomena, including planet-planet interactions, planet-moon interactions, and stellar activity. Recent work has shown that roughly half of moons would induce fast TTVs with a short period in the range of two-to-four orbits of its host planet around the star. An investigation of the Kepler TTV data in this period range identified one primary target of interest, Kepler-1513 b. Kepler-1513 b is a $8.05^{+0.58}_{-0.40}$ $R_\oplus$ planet orbiting a late G-type dwarf at $0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ AU. Using Kepler photometry, this initial analysis showed that Kepler-1513 b's TTVs were consistent with a moon. Here, we report photometric observations of two additional transits nearly a decade after the last Kepler transit using both ground-based observations and space-based photometry with TESS. These new transit observations introduce a previously undetected long period TTV, in addition to the original short period TTV signal. Using the complete transit dataset, we investigate whether a non-transiting planet, a moon, or stellar activity could induce the observed TTVs. We find that only a non-transiting perturbing planet can reproduce the observed TTVs. We additionally perform transit origami on the Kepler photometry, which independently applies pressure against a moon hypothesis. Specifically, we find that Kepler-1513 b's TTVs are consistent with an exterior non-transiting $\sim$Saturn mass planet, Kepler-1513 c, on a wide orbit, $\sim$5$\%$ outside a 5:1 period ratio with Kepler-1513 b. This example introduces a previously unidentified cause for planetary interlopers in the exomoon corridor, namely an insufficient baseline of observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating Protostellar Accretion (IPA) is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI IFUs to obtain 2.9--28 $\mu$m spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2 to 10,000 L$_{\odot}$ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9--5.3 $\mu$m data of the inner 840-9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28-300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission, deep ice absorption, emission from H$_{2}$, H~I, and [Fe~II], and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe~II] for the four $< 320$~L$_{\odot}$ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Br-$\alpha$. Knots of [Fe~II] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [FeII] emission with dynamical times of $< 30$~yrs are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H$_2$, knots of H$_2$ and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H$_2$ is seen extending through the cavities showing they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H$_2$ emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities, narrow shells of H$_2$ emission are found, one of which has an [Fe~II] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets.

 - **Abstract**
 $\eta$ Carinae is an extremely luminous and energetic colliding-wind binary. The combination of its orbit and orientation, with respect to our line of sight, enables direct investigation of the conditions and geometry of the colliding winds. We analyse optical He I 5876 and 7065 $\unicode{x212B}$ line profiles from the Global Jet Watch observatories covering the last 1.3 orbital periods. The sustained coverage throughout apastron reveals the distinct dynamics of the emitting versus absorbing components: the emission lines follow orbital velocities whilst one of the absorption lines is detected only around apastron ($0.08 < \phi < 0.95$) and exhibits velocities that deviate substantially from the orbital motion. To interpret these deviations, we conjecture that this He I absorption component is formed in the post-shock primary wind, and is only detected when our line of sight intersects with the shock cone formed by the collision of the two winds. We formulate a geometrical model for the colliding winds in terms of a hyperboloid in which the opening angle and location of its apex are parameterised in terms of the ratio of the wind momentum of the primary star to that of companion. We fit this geometrical model to the absorption velocities, finding results that are concordant with the panchromatic observations and simulations of $\eta$ Carinae. The model presented here is an extremely sensitive probe of the exact geometry of the wind momentum balance of binary stars, and can be extended to probe the latitudinal dependence of mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos in dense environments like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs) can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFCs) once the angular distribution of neutrino lepton number crosses zero along a certain direction. Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) in detecting these crossings. In this study, we enhance prior research in two significant ways. Firstly, we utilize realistic data from CCSN simulations, where neutrino transport is solved using the full Boltzmann equation. We evaluate the ML methods' adaptability in a real-world context, enhancing their robustness. In particular, we demonstrate that when working with artificial data, simpler models outperform their more complex counterparts, a noteworthy illustration of the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of ML. We also explore methods to improve artificial datasets for ML training. In addition, we extend our ML techniques to detect the crossings in the heavy-leptonic channels, accommodating scenarios where $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$ may differ. Our research highlights the extensive versatility and effectiveness of ML techniques, presenting an unparalleled opportunity to evaluate the occurrence of FFCs in CCSN and NSM simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 While it is now known that double neutron star binary systems (DNSs) are copious producers of heavy elements, there remains much speculation about whether they are the sole or even principal site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, one of the primary ways in which heavy elements are produced. The occurrence rates, delay times, and galactic environments of DNSs hold sway over estimating their total contribution to the elemental abundances in the Solar system and the Galaxy. Furthermore, the expected elemental yield for DNSs may depend on the merger parameters themselves -- such as their stellar masses and radii -- which is not currently considered in many galactic chemical evolution models. Using the characteristics of the observed sample of DNSs in the Milky Way as a guide, we predict the expected nucleosynthetic yields that a population of DNSs would produce upon merger, and we compare that nucleosynthetic signature to the heavy-element abundance pattern of the Solar system elements. We find that with our current models, the present DNS population favors production of the lighter r-process elements, while underproducing the heaviest elements relative to the Solar system. This inconsistency could imply an additional site for the heaviest elements or a population of DNSs much different from that observed today.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of a spectral survey of the region of massive star formation DR21OH in the 4-mm wavelength range are presented. Sixty-nine molecules and their isotopologues have been detected, ranging from simple diatomic or triatomic species such as SO, SiO and CCH, to complex organic molecules such as CH$_3$OCHO or CH$_3$OCH$_3$. The obtained results qualitatively repeat the results of the survey of the same source at 3~mm. The inventories of molecules found at 3mm and 4mm overlap to a great extent. However, at 4 mm we found a number of species that have no allowed transitions in the 3-mm wavelength range, e.g. DCN, DNC, or SO$^+$. The bulk of the molecules detected at 4~mm are those that are common for dense cores, e.g., HC$_3$N or CH$_3$CCH, but some of the detected species are typical for hot cores. The latter include complex organic molecules CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, etc. However, the detected emission of these molecules probably arises in a gas heated to 30 K only. Nine molecules, including complex species CH$_3$C$_3$N, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_3$COCH$_3$, were found by spectral line stacking. This demonstrates the prospects of the method in the study of molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a cosmological dark matter production mechanism in the form of a longitudinal massive vector boson. We build upon the work of Graham et.al. including non-minimal couplings of the massive vector with gravity, developing a well motivated set-up from an effective field theory perspective. We carefully track the dynamics of vector field in passing from inflation to radiation dominated universe to show that the late time abundance of longitudinal modes -- excited initially by the quantum fluctuations during inflation -- can provide the observed dark matter abundance for sufficiently weak non-minimal coupling and wide range of vector masses $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim m\, [{\rm eV}] \lesssim 5 \times 10^{3}$. The final abundance of dark matter depends on two parameter, the vector mass and its non-minimal coupling with gravity. We discuss experimental venues to probe this framework, including the production of a stochastic gravitational wave background. The latter is especially interesting, as the same mechanism that generates dark matter can potentially lead to the production of gravitational waves in the LISA frequency band, through the second-order effects of large dark matter iso-curvature perturbations at small scales. We take a first step in this direction, identifying the potential information that gravitational wave experiments can provide on the parameter space of dark matter within this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the results of a new reverberation mapping program focused on the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 3227. Photometric and spectroscopic monitoring were carried out from 2022 December to 2023 June with the Las Cumbres Observatory network of telescopes. We detected time delays in several optical broad emission lines, with H$\beta$ having the longest delay at $\tau_{\rm cent}=4.0^{+0.9}_{-0.9}$ days and He II having the shortest delay with $\tau_{\rm cent}=0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$ days. We also detect velocity-resolved behavior of the H$\beta$ emission line, with different line-of-sight velocities corresponding to different observed time delays. Combining the integrated H$\beta$ time delay with the width of the variable component of the emission line and a standard scale factor suggests a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}=1.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$. Modeling of the full velocity-resolved response of the H$\beta$ emission line with the phenomenological code CARAMEL finds a similar mass of $M_{\rm BH}=1.2^{+1.5}_{-0.7} \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$, and suggests that the H$\beta$-emitting broad line region (BLR) may be represented by a biconical or flared disk structure that we are viewing at an inclination angle of $\theta_i \approx 33^{\circ}$ and with gas motions that are dominated by rotation. The new photoionization-based BLR modeling tool BELMAC finds general agreement with the observations when assuming the best-fit CARAMEL results, however BELMAC prefers a thick disk geometry and kinematics that are equally comprised of rotation and inflow. Both codes infer a radially extended and flattened BLR that is not outflowing.
#### Multi-year characterisation of the broad-band emission from the  intermittent extreme BL Lac 1ES~2344+514

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lac 1ES 2344+514 is known for temporary extreme properties (e.g., a shift of the synchrotron SED peak energy $\nu_{synch,p}$ above 1keV). While those extreme states were so far observed only during high flux levels, additional multi-year observing campaigns are required to achieve a coherent picture. Here, we report the longest investigation of the source from radio to VHE performed so far, focusing on a systematic characterisation of the intermittent extreme states. While our results confirm that 1ES 2344+514 typically exhibits $\nu_{synch,p}>$1keV during elevated flux periods, we also find periods where the extreme state coincides with low flux activity. A strong spectral variability thus happens in the quiescent state, and is likely caused by an increase of the electron acceleration efficiency without a change in the electron injection luminosity. We also report a strong X-ray flare (among the brightest for 1ES 2344+514) without a significant shift of $\nu_{synch,p}$. During this particular flare, the X-ray spectrum is among the softest of the campaign. It unveils complexity in the spectral evolution, where the common harder-when-brighter trend observed in BL Lacs is violated. During a low and hard X-ray state, we find an excess of the UV flux with respect to an extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum to lower energies. This UV excess implies that at least two regions contribute significantly to the infrared/optical/ultraviolet/X-ray emission. Using the simultaneous MAGIC, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and AstroSat observations, we argue that a region possibly associated with the 10 GHz radio core may explain such an excess. Finally, we investigate a VHE flare, showing an absence of simultaneous variability in the 0.3-2keV band. Using a time-dependent leptonic modelling, we show that this behaviour, in contradiction to single-zone scenarios, can instead be explained by a two-component model.

 - **Abstract**
 From the formation mechanisms of stars and compact objects to nuclear physics, modern astronomy frequently leverages surveys to understand populations of objects to answer fundamental questions. The population of dark and isolated compact objects in the Galaxy contains critical information related to many of these topics, but is only practically accessible via gravitational microlensing. However, photometric microlensing observables are degenerate for different types of lenses, and one can seldom classify an event as involving either a compact object or stellar lens on its own. To address this difficulty, we apply a Bayesian framework that treats lens type probabilistically and jointly with a lens population model. This method allows lens population characteristics to be inferred despite intrinsic uncertainty in the lens-class of any single event. We investigate this method's effectiveness on a simulated ground-based photometric survey in the context of characterizing a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an average mass of $30 M_{\odot}$. On simulated data, our method outperforms current black hole (BH) lens identification pipelines and characterizes different subpopulations of lenses while jointly constraining the PBH contribution to dark matter to ${\approx}25$\%. Key to robust inference, our method can marginalize over population model uncertainty. We find the lower mass cutoff for stellar origin BHs, a key observable in understanding the BH mass gap, particularly difficult to infer in our simulations. This work lays the foundation for cutting-edge PBH abundance constraints to be extracted from current photometric microlensing surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune's Trojan asteroids have been observed to have a variety of optical colors, most notably red (g $-$ r < 0.75) vs. ultra-red (g $-$ r > 0.75), but the underlying cause of these different color classifications is unknown. Near-IR spectroscopy can be used as a probe of the surface composition of these objects, as broad ice bands for a variety of materials are present in the near-IR. Here, we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of Neptune's Trojan asteroids using the NIRSpec instrument on JWST. We compare the near-IR spectra of eight Neptune Trojans (NTs) based on different optical color classifications and with model spectra of different ices. We find that most of our targets are consistent with a surface covered in a thin layer of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ices, while the only NT to reliably be classified as ultra-red is covered in ice tholins in addition to CO$_2$. Ice tholins are a known reddening agent when subjected to irradiation, so these results support the hypothesis that differences in optical color are due to differences in irradiation of the surfaces of these bodies. Since NTs have very similar orbits and therefore generally similar levels of irradiation at the current time, our results suggest that these objects have unique origins or there is ongoing processing of the surfaces of these objects through stochastic disturbances such as impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA sub-arcsecond-resolution observations of both continuum and molecular lines at 345 GHz towards the massive star-forming region IRAS 16351-4722 (hereafter I16351). A total of 12 dust cores were detected based on high spatial resolution observations of the continuum. Among them, a high-mass core (11.6 Msun) and a low-mass core (1.7 Msun) show abundant molecular line emissions. 164 molecular transitions from 29 species and 104 molecular transitions from 25 species are identified in the high-mass and low-mass cores, respectively. Complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH3OH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, and C2H5CN are detected in the two cores. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), rotational temperatures and column densities of the COMs are derived with the XCLASS software. The maximum rotation temperature values in the low-mass core and the high-mass core were found to be approximately 130 K and 198 K, respectively. Additionally, the line widths in the high-mass core are larger than those in the low-mass one. Abundant complex organic molecular line transitions, high gas temperatures, and smaller line widths indicate the presence of a low-mass line-rich core in the massive star formation region for the first time, while the high-mass line-rich core shows hot core property. When comparing the molecular abundances of CH3OH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3 and C2H5OH of the two cores with other hot cores and hot corinos reported in the literature, we further confirm that both a hot core and a low-mass line-rich core are simultaneously detected in I16351.

 - **Abstract**
 ESA's Rosetta spacecraft at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) was the first mission that accompanied a comet over a substantial fraction of its orbit. On board was the ROSINA mass spectrometer suite to measure the local densities of the volatile species sublimating from the ices inside the comet's nucleus. Understanding the nature of these ices was a key goal of Rosetta. We analyzed the primary cometary molecules at 67P, namely H$_2$O and CO$_2$, together with a suite of minor species for almost the entire mission. Our investigation reveals that the local abundances of highly volatile species, such as CH$_4$ and CO, are reproduced by a linear combination of both H$_2$O and CO$_2$ densities. These findings bear similarities to laboratory-based temperature programmed desorption experiments of amorphous ices and imply that highly volatile species are trapped in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ices. Our results do not show the presence of ices dominated by these highly volatile molecules. Most likely, they were lost due to thermal processing of 67P's interior prior to its deflection to the inner solar system. Deviations in the proportions co-released with H$_2$O and CO$_2$ can only be observed before the inbound equinox, when the comet was still far from the sun and the abundance of highly volatile molecules associated with CO$_2$ outgassing were lower. The corresponding CO$_2$ is likely seasonal frost, which sublimated and lost its trapped highly volatile species before re-freezing during the previous apparition. CO, on the other hand, was elevated during the same time and requires further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new approach to the pointing determination of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). This method is universal and can be applied to any IACT with minor modifications. It uses the trajectories of the stars in the field of view of the IACT's main camera and requires neither dedicated auxiliary hardware nor a specific data taking mode. The method consists of two parts: firstly, we reconstruct individual star positions as a function of time, taking into account the point spread function of the telescope; secondly, we perform a simultaneous fit of all reconstructed star trajectories using the orthogonal distance regression method. The method does not assume any particular star trajectories, does not require a long integration time, and can be applied to any IACT observation mode. The performance of the method is assessed with commissioning data of the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1), showing the method's stability and remarkable pointing performance of the LST-1 telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf systems are of great astrophysical importance in the field of gravitational wave and Type Ia supernova. While the binary fraction of CO core white dwarf is about a few percents, the extremely low mass white dwarfs are all thought to be within binary systems. In this work, we report the orbital solution of a double degenerate system: J033847.06+413424.24, an extremely low mass He core white dwarf orbiting a CO core white dwarf. With LAMOST and P200, time domain spectroscopic observations have been made and spectral atmosphere parameters are estimated to be $T_{\rm eff}\sim22500$ K and log $g\sim5.6$ dex. Combining Gaia parallax, 3D extinction, and evolution tracks, we estimate a radius of $\sim0.12$ $R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $\sim0.22$ $M_{\odot}$. With the 37 single exposure spectra, the radial velocities are measured and the orbital parameters are estimated to be $P=0.1253132(1)$ days, $K1=289\pm4$ km/s and $V_{sys}=-41\pm3$ km/s. The radial velocity based system ephemeris is also provided. The light curves from several photometric surveys show no orbital modulation. The orbital solution suggests that the invisible companion has a minimum mass of about 0.60 $M_{\odot}$ and is $\sim0.79$ $M_{\odot}$ for an inclination of $60.0^{\circ}$, indicating most probably a CO core white dwarf. The system is expected to merge in about 1 Gyr. With present period and distance ($\sim596$ pc) it can not irradiate strong enough gravitational wave for LISA. More double degenerate systems are expected to be discovered and parameterized as the LAMOST survey goes on.
#### An Updated Line List for Spectroscopic Investigation of G Stars- I:  Redetermination of the Abundances in the Solar Photosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a line list that may be useful for the abundance analysis of G-type stars in the wavelength range 4080 -- 6780 A. It is expected that the line list will be useful for surveys/libraries with overlapping spectral regions (e.g. ELODIE/SOPHIE libraries, UVES-580 setting of Gaia-ESO), and in particular for the analysis of F- and G-type stars in general. The atomic data are supplemented by detailed references to the sources. We estimated the Solar abundances using stellar lines and the high-resolution Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) spectra of the Sun to determine the uncertainty in the log gf values. By undertaking a systematic search that makes use of the lower excitation potential and gf-values and using revised multiplet table as an initial guide, we identified 363 lines of 24 species that have accurate gf-values and are free of blends in the spectra of the Sun and a Solar analogue star, HD 218209 (G6V), for which accurate and up-to-date abundances were obtained from both ELODIE and PolarBASE spectra of the star. For the common lines with the Gaia-ESO line list v.6 provided by the Gaia-ESO collaboration, we discovered significant inconsistencies in the gf-values for certain lines of varying species.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-correlation techniques have been used since 1974 and, since 1979, the analysis based on the Fourier Method has been applied. However, we are currently obtaining data with spectral resolution higher than those for which this technique was developed, hence some revision seems timely. The principal aim of this work is to adapt Tonry and Davis' method and implementing it for the treatment of very high spectral resolution data. We have applied this technique to two different sets of spectroscopic data of moderate and high resolutions obtained with the MUSE and MEGARA spectrographs respectively. Using stellar spectra obtained with these two instruments (i) we have optimised the input parameters; (ii) we have analysed the method assumptions; and (iii) we have compared the results for the two sets of data. The optimal method parameters applied to MUSE data are $k_{min}$ $\sim$ 3, $k_{max}$ $\sim$ 60 and 512 bins, which correspond to a uniform velocity shift value of $\Delta $v = 27.1 km/s. For MEGARA data, we propose the values $k_{min}$ $\sim$ 3, $k_{max}$ $\sim$ 350 and 4096 bins finding that the cross-correlation function lost its Gaussian behavior at higher resolutions. Thus, we have developed an equivalent mathematical method that can be used for this kind of data. Additionally, the velocity dispersion error analysis suggests that the greatest error introduced in this method is due to the subtraction or masking of the nebular lines. For the application cross-correlation techniques to high spectral resolution data, we propose to calculate the galaxy-galaxy and star-galaxy correlations, with widths $\mu_{gg}$ and $\mu_{gt}$ respectively. Then, the width of the broadening function can be calculated as $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu_{gg}^2 - \mu_{gt}^2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that avoids any dependence on specific inflationary features or exotic physics. In this scenario, the required large curvature fluctuations leading to PBH formation are generated after inflation by the quantum fluctuations of a light stochastic spectator field during inflation, when this field transiently dominates the energy density. We calculate the dynamics of such a spectator field during and after inflation, the distribution of induced curvature perturbations and their non-Gaussian tails leading to the copious production of PBHs. For a plateau-like potential, this scenario produces an extended PBH mass distribution with a peak at the solar-mass scale when one takes into account the effects of the thermal history. What is remarkable in this scenario is the absence of parameter fine-tuning. Instead, it invokes an anthropic selection over all the realizations of PBH abundances predicted by the field stochasticity. This scenario offers a novel perspective for the formation of PBHs with minimal ingredients and without the need of fine-tuning. It is amenable to observational tests, notably with the gravitational-wave observations of black hole mergers and of a background at nanoHertz frequency, as recently observed by pulsar timing arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of the IMEGIN Large Program, we used the NIKA2 camera on the IRAM 30-m telescope to observe the edge-on galaxy NGC 891 at 1.15 mm and 2 mm and at a FWHM of 11.1" and 17.6", respectively. Multiwavelength data enriched with the new NIKA2 observations fitted by the HerBIE SED code (coupled with the THEMIS dust model) were used to constrain the physical properties of the ISM. Emission originating from the diffuse dust disk is detected at all wavelengths from mid-IR to mm, while mid-IR observations reveal warm dust emission from compact HII regions. Indications of mm excess emission have also been found in the outer parts of the galactic disk. Furthermore, our SED fitting analysis constrained the mass fraction of the small (< 15 Angstrom) dust grains. We found that small grains constitute 9.5% of the total dust mass in the galactic plane, but this fraction increases up to ~ 20% at large distances (|z| > 3 kpc) from the galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the spectral and timing characteristics of a 7-Hz type-A quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) detected in NICER observations of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during its high-soft state. The QPO is broad and weak, with an integrated fractional rms amplitude of 0.9 per cent in the 0.5-10 keV band. Thanks to the large effective area of NICER, combined with the high flux of the source and a relatively long accumulative exposure time, we construct the first rms and phase-lag spectra for a type-A QPO. Our analysis reveals that the fractional rms amplitude of the QPO increases with energy from below 1 per cent at 1 keV to 3 per cent at 6 keV. The shape of the QPO spectrum is similar to that of the Comptonised component, suggesting that the Comptonised region is driving the variability. The phase lags at the QPO frequency are always soft taking the lowest energy as reference. By jointly fitting the time-averaged spectrum of the source and the rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO with the time-dependent Comptonisation model vkompthdk, we find that the radiative properties of the type-A QPO can be explained by a vertically extended Comptonised region with a size of 2300 km.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flare electron acceleration is an efficient process, but its properties (mechanism, location) are not well constrained. Via hard X-ray (HXR) emission, we routinely observe energetic electrons at the Sun, and sometimes we detect energetic electrons in interplanetary space. We examine if the plasma properties of an acceleration region (size, temperature, density) can be constrained from in-situ observations, helping to locate the acceleration region in the corona, and infer the relationship between electrons observed in-situ and at the Sun. We model the transport of energetic electrons, accounting for collisional and non-collisional effects, from the corona into the heliosphere (to 1.0 AU). In the corona, electrons are transported through a hot, over-dense region. We test if the properties of this region can be extracted from electron spectra (fluence and peak flux) at different heliospheric locations. We find that cold, dense coronal regions significantly reduce the energy at which we see the peak flux and fluence for distributions measured out to 1.0 AU, the degree of which correlates with the temperature and density of plasma in the region. Where instrument energy resolution is insufficient to differentiate the corresponding peak values, the spectral ratio of [7-10) to [4-7) keV can be more readily identified and demonstrates the same relationship. If flare electrons detected in-situ are produced in, and/or transported through hot, over-dense regions close to HXR-emitting electrons, then this plasma signature should be present in their lower-energy spectra (1-20 keV), observable at varying heliospheric distances with missions such as Solar Orbiter.

 - **Abstract**
 It is a challenge to study the formation process of massive stars: their formation time is short, they are few, often deeply embedded, and at relatively large distances. Our strategy is to study the outcome of the star formation process and to look for signatures remnant of the formation. We have access to a unique sample of (massive) pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the giant HII region M17, showing a photosphere and circumstellar disk. The aim is to determine the variability properties of the hot gaseous disks to understand the physical origin of the emission lines and identify dominant physical processes in these disks. We have obtained multiple-epoch (4-5 epochs) VLT/X-shooter spectra of six young stars in M17 covering about a decade. Using stacked spectra we update the spectral classification and identify circumstellar features. With the temporal variance method (TVS) we determine the extent and amplitude of the spectral line variations. The double-peaked emission lines in the PMS stars with gaseous disks are used to determine peak-to-peak velocities, V/R-ratios and the radial velocity of the systems. We identify many disk features, under which a new detection of CO bandhead and CI emission. In three of the stars we detect spectral variability, mainly in lines originating in the circumstellar disk, in a velocity range up to 320 km/s. In two PMS stars the ratio between the blue and red peaks shows a correlation with the peak-to-peak velocity, possibly explained by a spiral-arm structure in the disk. The PMS stars with variability are at similar positions in the HRD but show significant differences in disk lines and variability. The extent and timescale of the variability differs for each star and per line (sets). We find indications for an accretion flow, slow disk winds and/or disk structures in the hot gaseous inner disk as the cause of the variability in these PMS stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to investigate the polarisation convention of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and understand whether these follow the standard IAU/IEEE convention. The GMRT antennas are prime focus antennas, i.e. the radiation falling on the feed reverses its circular polarisation. If this reflection is not taken into account, it will result in a reversal of circular polarisation. We carried out several tests to understand the GMRT polarisation convention. The observations were carried out on several strong and highly polarised pulsars with known polarisation properties at GMRT wavelengths, mainly covering bands 2, 3 and 4. In addition, we tracked the polarisation from the GMRT feed to the fibre optic system, and fibre optic system to the user end. The study indicates that GMRT channels 1 and 2 are true R and L, however, since GMRT is a prime focus instrument, the reflection due to the dish reverses the sense of polarisation and converts RCP into LCP and vice versa. This has not been taken into account and because of this reason, GMRT Stokes V and U signs need to be reversed to make them consistent with the IAU/IEEE convention. This objective can be achieved by reassigning channel 1 to L and channel 2 to R for all circular feeds, i.e. bands 2, 3, and 4. The study remains inconclusive for band 5, which has linear feeds.

 We present an implementation of a Bayesian mixture model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) techniques to search for spatial separation of Galactic dust components. Utilizing intensity measurements from \Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI), we apply this model to high-latitude Galactic dust emission. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for a spatially-varying two-population dust model in intensity, with each population being well characterized by a single-component dust spectral-energy distribution (SED). While no spatial information is built into the likelihood, our investigation unveils spatially coherent structures with high significance, pointing to a physical origin for the observed spatial separation. These results are robust to our choice of likelihood and of input data. Furthermore, they are favored over a single-component dust model by Bayesian evidence calculations. Incorporating \IRAS 100\,$\mu m$ to constrain the Wein-side of the blackbody function, we find the dust populations differ at the $2.5\sigma$ level on the spectral index ($\beta_d$) vs. temperature $(T_d)$ plane. The presence of a multi-population dust has implications for component separation techniques frequently employed in the recovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background.
