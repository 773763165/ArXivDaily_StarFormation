 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming surveys will measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) weak lensing power spectrum in exquisite detail, allowing for strong constraints on the sum of neutrino masses among other cosmological parameters. Standard CMB lensing power spectrum estimators aim to extract the connected non-Gaussian trispectrum of CMB temperature maps. However, they are generically dominated by a large Gaussian noise bias which thus needs to be subtracted at high accuracy. This is currently done with realistic map simulations of the CMB and noise, whose finite accuracy currently limits our ability to recover the CMB lensing on small-scale. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator which instead avoids this large Gaussian bias. This estimator relies only on the data and avoids the need for bias subtraction with simulations. Thus our bias avoidance method is (1) insensitive to misestimates in simulated CMB and noise models and (2) avoids the large computational cost of standard simulation-based methods like "realization-dependent $N^{(0)}$" (${\rm RDN}^{(0)}$). We show that our estimator is as robust as standard methods in the presence realistic inhomogeneous noise (e.g. from scan strategy) and masking. Moreover, our method can be combined with split-based methods, making it completely insensitive to mode coupling from inhomogeneous atmospheric and detector noise. We derive the corresponding expressions for our estimator when estimating lensing from CMB temperature and polarization. Although in this paper we specifically consider CMB weak lensing power spectrum estimation, we illuminate the relation between our new estimator, ${\rm RDN}^{(0)}$ subtraction, and general optimal trispectrum estimation. Through this discussion we conclude that our estimator is applicable to analogous problems in other fields which rely on estimating connected trispectra/four-point functions like large-scale structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new class of hilltop and plateau potentials which can successfully unify inflation and dark energy resulting in Quintessential Inflation (QI). Interestingly these new potentials are related through an inverse transformation. Namely, if $V(\phi) = V_0 \, v(\phi)$ is a plateau potential then the inverse potential $V(\phi) = V_0 \, \left[v(\phi)\right]^{-1}$ describes hilltop QI. A simple example is provided by the KKLT-inspired potential $v(\phi) = \left\lbrack \frac{M^{2n} + \phi^{2n}}{N^{2n} + \phi^{2n}}\right\rbrack \,$. When $M/N \ll 1$ this potential describes plateau QI, while its inverse, $\left[v(\phi)\right]^{-1}$ describes hilltop QI. Other simple models of QI arise for the class of potentials $V(\phi) \sim \exp\left\lbrack\mp f(\phi)\right\rbrack$, where the $-$ ($+$) sign is associated with a plateau (hilltop). A key feature of this new class of QI models is the near absence of small parameters which are usually associated with the presence of dark energy. A forecast for the gravitational wave background generated in these models is provided.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer (RT) models are critical in the interpretation of exoplanetary spectra, in simulating exoplanet climates and when designing the specifications of future flagship observatories. However, most models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to significantly different spectra. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the MALBEC (Modeling Atmospheric Lines By the Exoplanet Community) project. MALBEC is an exoplanet model intercomparison project (exoMIP) that belongs to the CUISINES (Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies) framework which aims to provide the exoplanet community with a large and diverse set of comparison and validation of models. The proposed protocol tests include a large set of initial participating RT models, a broad range of atmospheres (from Hot Jupiters to temperate terrestrials) and several observation geometries, which would allow us to quantify and compare the differences between different RT models used by the exoplanetary community. Two types of tests are proposed: transit spectroscopy and direct imaging modeling, with results from the proposed tests to be published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an example, we present simulation results for one specific transit case (GJ-1214 b), in which we find notable differences in how the various codes handle the discretization of the atmospheres (e.g., sub-layering), the treatment of molecular opacities (e.g., correlated-k, line-by-line) and the default spectroscopic repositories generally used by each model (e.g., HITRAN, HITEMP, ExoMol).

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion and ejection sets the outcome of the star and planet formation process. The mid-infrared wavelength range offers key tracers of those processes that were difficult to detect and spatially resolve in protostars until now. We aim to characterize the interplay between accretion and ejection in the low-mass Class I protobinary system TMC1, comprising two young stellar objects: TMC1-W and TMC1-E with 85 au separation. With the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) - Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations in 5 - 28 $\mu$m range, we measure intensities of emission lines of H$_2$, atoms and ions, e.g., [Fe II] and [Ne II], and HI recombination lines. We detect H$_2$ outflow coming from TMC1-E, with no significant H$_2$ emission from TMC1-W. The H$_2$ emission from TMC1-E outflow appears narrow and extends to wider opening angles with decreasing E$_{up}$ from S(8) to S(1) rotational transitions, indicating a disk wind origin. The outflow from TMC1-E protostar shows spatially extended emission lines of [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ar II], and [Ar III], with their line ratios consistent with UV radiation as a source of ionization. With ALMA, we detect accretion streamer infalling from $>$ 1000 au scales onto the TMC1-E component. TMC1-W protostar powers a collimated jet, detected with [Fe II] and [Ni II] consistent with energetic flow. A much weaker ionized jet is observed from TMC1-E. TMC1-W is associated with strong emission from hydrogen recombination lines, tracing the accretion onto the young star. Observations of a binary Class I protostellar system show that the two processes are clearly intertwined, with accretion from the envelope onto the disk influencing a wide-angle wind ejected on disk scales, while accretion from the protostellar disk onto the protostar is associated with the source launching a collimated high-velocity jet within the innermost regions of the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We report here on a project that has developed a practical approach to processing all-sky image collections on cloud platforms, using as an exemplar application the creation of three-color Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) maps of the 2MASS data set with the Montage Image Mosaic Engine on Amazon Web Services. We will emphasize issues that must be considered by scientists wishing to use cloud platforms to perform such parallel processing, so providing a guide for scientists wishing to exploit cloud platforms for similar large-scale processing. A HiPS map is based on the HEALPix sky-tiling scheme. Progressive zooming of a HiPS map reveals an image sampled at ever smaller or larger spatial scales that are defined by the HEALPix standard. Briefly, the approach used by Montage involves creating a base mosaic at the lowest required HEALPix level, usually chosen to match as closely as possible the spatial sampling of the input images, then cutting out the HiPS cells in PNG format from this mosaic. The process is repeated at successive HEALPix levels to create a nested collection of FITS files, from which PNG files are created that are shown in HiPS viewers. Stretching FITS files to produce PNGs is based on an image histogram. For composite regions (up and including the whole sky), the histograms for each tile can be combined to create a composite histogram for the region. Using this single histogram for each of the individual FITS files means all the PNGs are on the same brightness scale and displaying them side by side in a HiPS viewer produces a continuous uniform map across the entire sky.

 - **Abstract**
 For all active instruments, the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) now ingests raw data from the Keck Telescopes within 1 minute of acquisition, quick-look reduced data within 5 minutes of creation, and science ready reduced data for four instruments as they are created by their automated pipelines. On August 1, 2023, KOA released the Observers Data Access Portal (ODAP), which enables observers at the telescope and their collaborators anywhere in the world to securely monitor and download science, calibration, and quick-look data as they are ingested into the archive. The portal is built using Python Socket IO.WebSockets that ensure metadata appear in the portal as the data themselves are ingested. The portal itself is a dynamic web interface built with React. It enables users to view and customize metadata fields, filter metadata according to data type, and download data as they are ingested or in bulk through wget scripts. Observers have used the ODAP since its release and have provided feedback that will guide future releases.

 - **Abstract**
 The two most favored explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) are millisecond pulsars and self annihilation of the smooth dark matter halo of the galaxy. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we would like to optimally use all information in the available data, including photon direction and energy information. To date, analyses of the GCE have generally treated directional and energy information separately, or have ignored one or the other completely. Here, we develop a method for analyzing the GCE that relies on simulation-based inference with neural posterior models to jointly analyze photon directional and spectral information while correctly accounting for the spatial and energy resolution of the telescope, here assumed to be the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our results also have implications for analyses of the diffuse gamma-ray background, which we discuss.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised machine learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 7.6-8 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9<z<2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z<1$.

 - **Abstract**
 Most, if not all, sun-like stars host one or more planets, making multi-planetary systems commonplace in our galaxy. We utilize hundreds of multi-planet simulations to explore the origin of such systems, focusing on their orbital architecture. The first set of simulations assumes in-situ assembly of planetary embryos, while the second explores planetary migration. After applying observational biases to the simulations, we compare them to 250+ observed multi-planetary systems, including 13 systems with planets in the habitable zone. For all of the systems, we calculate two of the so-called statistical measures: the mass concentration ($S_{c}$) and orbital spacing ($S_{s}$). After analytic and empirical analyses, we find that the measures are related to first-order with a power law: $S_{c} \sim S_{s}^\beta$. The in-situ systems exhibit steeper power-law relations relative to the migration systems. We show that different formation scenarios cover different regions in the $S_{s} - S_{c}$ diagram with some overlap. Furthermore, we discover that observed systems with $S_{s} < 30$ are likely dominated by the migration scenario, while those with $S_{s} \geq 30$ are likely dominated by the in-situ scenario. We apply these criteria to determine that a majority (62%) of observed multi-planetary systems formed via migration, whereas most systems with currently observed habitable planets formed via in-situ assembly. This work provides methods of leveraging the statistical measures ($S_{s}$ and $S_{c}$) to disentangle the formation history of observed multi-planetary systems based on their present-day architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the detection of extended $\gamma$-ray emission from lobes in the radio galaxy NGC 6251 using observation data of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The maximum likelihood analysis results show that a radio morphology template provides a better fit than a point-like source description for the observational data at a confidence level of 8.1$\sigma$, and the contribution of lobes accounts for more than 50\% of the total $\gamma$-ray flux. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-ray energy spectra show a significant disparity in shape between the core and lobe regions, with a curved log-parabola shape observed in core region and a power-law form observed in lobes. Neither the core region nor the northwest lobe displays the significant flux variations in the long-term $\gamma$-ray light curves. The broadband spectral energy distributions of both core region and northwest lobe can be will explained with a single-zone leptonic model. The $\gamma$-rays of core region are due to the synchrotron-self-Compton process while the $\gamma$-rays from northwest lobe are interpreted as inverse Compton emission of the cosmic microwave background.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be isotopic measurements preliminarily reported by the AMS-02 Collaboration have reached an unprecedented energy of 12 GeV/$n$. As secondary cosmic rays (CRs), the Be isotopes include both stable and unstable species, which are crucial for constraining the propagation parameters of Galactic CRs. However, uncertainties in their production cross sections can skew the interpretation of the CR data, especially when cross-section measurements are of significantly lower quality than CR measurements. In this work, we consider the uncertainties of the cross sections to interpret the Be isotopic data by adopting a cross-section parametrization that fully utilizes the available experimental data. Owing to the high-quality measurements of the $^7$Be production cross section, we innovatively employ $^7$Be instead of $^9$Be to constrain propagation parameters. Notably, the diffusion halo thickness is constrained to $5.67\pm0.76$~kpc, representing a moderate value compared to previous analogous works. Combining the well-constrained CR propagation model and the precise CR measurements of $^9$Be, we conversely constrain the major production cross section of $^9$Be and find that it ought to be remarkably lower than previously thought. Our analysis also questions the reliability of certain cross sections measured by some experiments, potentially marking the first time CR data has been used to identify dubious nucleon production cross sections. The method presented in this work holds promise for analyzing upcoming isotopic data from other nuclei.
#### Signatures of X-ray dominated chemistry in the spectra of exoplanetary  atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy radiation from stars impacts planetary atmospheres deeply affecting their chemistry, providing departures from chemical equilibrium. While the upper atmospheric layers are dominated by ionizations induced by extreme ultraviolet radiation, deeper into the atmosphere molecular abundances are controlled by a characteristic X-ray dominated chemistry, mainly driven by an energetic secondary electron cascade. In this work, we aim at identifying molecular photochemically induced fingerprints in the transmission spectra of a giant planet atmosphere. We have developed a numerical code capable of synthesizing transmission spectra with arbitrary spectral resolution, exploiting updated infrared photoabsorption cross sections. Chemical mixing ratios are computed using a photochemical model, tailored to investigate high energy ionization processes. We find that in case of high levels of stellar activity, synthetic spectra in both low and high resolutions show significant, potentially observable out-of-equilibrium signatures arising mainly from CO, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN.
#### Filling the radio transients gap (or: The case for a dedicated radio  transients monitoring array in the southern hemisphere)

 - **Abstract**
 In this short paper we outline the case for a small radio telescope array in the southern hemisphere with operations dedicated to rapid follow-up and monitoring of astrophysical transients. We argue that the science harvest from such a facility would be very large, using AMI-LA as an outstanding example of how such a programme is already being operated in the north with an enormous track record of success. A southern radio transients facility would in turn take pressure off the Square Kilometre Array and the other world class larger arrays with 10-100 times more collecting area, which will never have the programme time available to comprehensively pursue this science. We discuss comparisons with the development of transient surveys and follow up in optical astronomy, and also how single millimetre dishes can contribute to radio transients science in the south. This paper is not a funding proposal aimed at any particular body, but rather a concept and discussion piece, and the authors welcome comments and feedback.
#### The Galactic center excess at the highest energies: morphology and  photon-count statistics

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the GeV gamma-ray Galactic center excess (GCE) in the data of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is still to be unveiled. We present a new analysis of the inner Galaxy Fermi-LAT data at energies above 10 GeV, based on an innovative method which combines the skyFACT adaptive template fitting with and the 1pPDF pixel-count statistics. We find a strong evidence for the GCE also at high energies, $\sigma > 5$ regardless of the GCE spatial template. Remarkably, our fits prefer the bulge morphological model over the dark matter one at high significance, and show no evidence for an additional dark matter template on top of the bulge component. Through the 1pPDF analysis, we find that the model best describing the gamma-ray data requires a smooth, diffuse GCE following a bulge morphology, together with sub-threshold point sources. The 1pPDF fit reconstructs a consistent population of faint point sources down at least to $10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Between $10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ the 1pPDF measures a number of point sources significantly higher than the ones in the Fermi 4FGL catalog. The robustness of our results brings further support to the attempt of explaining, at least partially, the high-energy tail of the GCE in terms of a population of point sources, likely corresponding to millisecond pulsars.
#### Performance and first measurements of the MAGIC Stellar Intensity  Interferometer

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a new generation of optical intensity interferometers has emerged, leveraging the existing infrastructure of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The MAGIC telescopes host the MAGIC-SII system (Stellar Intensity Interferometer), implemented to investigate the feasibility and potential of this technique on IACTs. After the first successful measurements in 2019, the system was upgraded and now features a real-time, dead-time-free, 4-channel, GPU-based correlator. These hardware modifications allow seamless transitions between MAGIC's standard very-high-energy gamma-ray observations and optical interferometry measurements within seconds. We establish the feasibility and potential of employing IACTs as competitive optical Intensity Interferometers with minimal hardware adjustments. The measurement of a total of 22 stellar diameters are reported, 9 corresponding to reference stars with previous comparable measurements, and 13 with no prior measurements. A prospective implementation involving telescopes from the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory's northern hemisphere array, such as the first prototype of its Large-Sized Telescopes, LST-1, is technically viable. This integration would significantly enhance the sensitivity of the current system and broaden the UV-plane coverage. This advancement would enable the system to achieve competitive sensitivity with the current generation of long-baseline optical interferometers over blue wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for neutrinos with energies greater than $10^{17}~$eV is being actively pursued. Although normalization of the dominant neutrino flux is highly uncertain, a floor level is guaranteed by the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays with Milky Way gas. We estimate that this floor level gives an energy flux of $E^2\phi_\nu\simeq 10^{-13^{+0.5}_{-0.5}}~$GeV~cm$^{-2}$~sr$^{-1}$~s$^{-1}$ at $10^{18}~$eV, where uncertainties arise from the modeling of the gas distribution and the experimental determination of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays on Earth. Based on a minimal model of cosmic-ray production to explain the mass-discriminated energy spectra observed on Earth above $5{\times}10^{18}$~eV, we also present generic estimates of the neutrino fluxes expected from extragalactic production that generally exceed the aforementioned guaranteed floor. The prospects for detecting neutrinos above $10^{18}$~eV remain however challenging, unless proton acceleration to the highest energies is at play in a sub-dominant population of cosmic-ray sources or new physical phenomena are at work.

 - **Abstract**
 $\Lambda$CDM tensions are by definition model dependent; one sees anomalies through the prism of $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, progress towards tension resolution necessitates checking the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model to localise missing physics either in redshift or scale. Since the Universe is dynamical and redshift is a proxy for time, it is imperative to first perform consistency checks involving redshift, then consistency checks involving scale, as the next steps to settle the ``systematics versus new physics" debate and foster informed model building. We present a review of the hierarchy of assumptions underlying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and comment on whether relaxing them can address the tensions. We focus on the lowest lying fruit of identifying missing physics through the identification of redshift dependent $\Lambda$CDM model fitting parameters. We highlight recent progress made on ${S_8:= \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ tension and elucidate how similar progress can be made on $H_0$ tension. Our discussions indicate that $H_0$ tension, equivalently a redshift dependent $H_0$, and a redshift dependent $S_8$ imply a problem with background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2022 the DART mission spacecraft impacted the asteroid Dimorphos, the secondary body of the binary Didymos system, ejecting a large number of dust particles, rocks and boulders. The ESA Hera mission will reach the system in 2026 for post--impact studies and possible detection of orbiting fragments. We investigate the long term dynamics of the large boulders ejected by DART to test if any of these objects survive in orbit until the arrival of the Hera mission. To model the dynamics of the boulders we use a numerical model which includes the gravity of non-spherical Didymos and Dimorphos, the solar gravity and the radiation pressure. The SPICE kernels are used to define the correct reference frame for the integration. The dynamics of the boulders is highly chaotic and 1% of the initial boulders survive at least for 4 years on quasi--stable orbits. These orbits are characterised by wide oscillations in eccentricity in antiphase with those in inclination (including spin flips), a mechanism similar to the Kozai one. This behaviour may protect these bodies from close encounters with both asteroids. We also compute the distribution on the surfaces of the asteroids of sesquinary impacts which may influence the dust emission, after the initial DART impact, and the surface composition of the asteroids. The probability of observing boulders by the mission Hera is small but not negligible and an almost constant flux of escaping boulders is expected in the coming years since their lifetime after the DART impact covers a large time interval. Most of re--impacts on Dimorphos occur in the hemisphere opposite to the impact site, preferentially close to the equatorial plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the phase shift in the gravitational wave signal induced by fast oscillations of scalar dark matter surrounding binary systems, which could be probed by the future experiments LISA and DECIGO. This effect depends on the local matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle. We compare it to the phase shift due to a standard dynamical friction term, which should generically be present. We find that the effect associated with the oscillations only dominates over the dynamical friction for dark matter masses below $10^{-21}$ eV, with masses below $10^{-23}$ eV implying cloud sizes that are too large to be realistic. Moreover, for masses of the order of $10^{-21}$ eV, LISA and DECIGO would only detect this effect for dark matter densities greater than that in the solar system by a factor $10^5$ or $10^4$ respectively. We conclude that this signal can be ignored for most dark matter scenarios unless very dense clouds of very light dark matter are created early in the Universe at a redshift $z\sim 10^4$.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar object population of the Milky Way is a product of its stars. However, what is in fact a complex structure in the Solar neighbourhood has traditionally in ISO studies been described as smoothly distributed. Using a debiased stellar population derived from the Gaia DR3 stellar sample, we infer that the velocity distribution of ISOs is far more textured than a smooth Gaussian. The moving groups caused by Galactic resonances dominate the distribution. 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have entirely normal places within these distributions; 1I is within the non-coeval moving group that includes the Matariki (Pleiades) cluster, and 2I within the Coma Berenices moving group. We show that for the composition of planetesimals formed beyond the ice line, these velocity structures also have a chemodynamic component. This variation will be visible on the sky. We predict that this richly textured distribution will be differentiable from smooth Gaussians in samples that are within the expected discovery capacity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Solar neighbourhood ISOs will be of all ages and come from a dynamic mix of many different populations of stars, reflecting their origins from all around the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS), aided by the all-sky coverage of TESS, are starting to stretch theories of planet formation through the core-accretion scenario. Recent upper limits on their occurrence suggest that they decrease with lower stellar masses, with fewer GEMS around lower-mass stars compared to solar-type. In this paper, we discuss existing GEMS both through confirmed planets, as well as protoplanetary disk observations, and a combination of tests to reconcile these with theoretical predictions. We then introduce the \textit{Searching for GEMS} survey, where we utilize multi-dimensional nonparameteric statistics to simulate hypothetical survey scenarios to predict the required sample size of transiting GEMS with mass measurements to robustly compare their bulk-density with canonical hot-Jupiters orbiting FGK stars. Our Monte-Carlo simulations predict that a robust comparison requires about 40 transiting GEMS (compared to the existing sample of $\sim$ 15) with 5-$\sigma$ mass measurements. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing occurrence estimates for GEMS, and provide a brief description of our planned systematic search to improve the occurrence rate estimates for GEMS.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual-field interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY sometimes require the use of a "binary calibrator", a binary star whose individual components remain unresolved by the interferometer, with a separation between 400 and 2000 mas for observations with the Units Telescopes (UTs), or 1200 to 3000 mas for the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs). The separation vector also needs to be predictable to within 10 mas for proper pointing of the instrument. Up until now, no list of properly vetted calibrators was available for dual-field observations with VLTI/GRAVITY on the UTs. Our objective is to compile such a list, and make it available to the community. We identify a list of candidates from the Washington Double Star (WDS) catalogue, all with appropriate separations and brightness, scattered over the Southern sky. We observe them as part of a dedicated calibration programme, and determine whether these objects are true binaries (excluding higher multiplicities resolved interferometrically but unseen by imaging), and extract measurements of the separation vectors. We combine these new measurements with those available in the WDS to determine updated orbital parameters for all our vetted calibrators. We compile a list of 13 vetted binary calibrators for observations with VLTI/GRAVITY on the UTs, and provide orbital estimates and astrometric predictions for each of them. We show that our list guarantees that there are always at least two binary calibrators at airmass < 2 in the sky over the Paranal observatory, at any point in time. Any Principal Investigator wishing to use the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY with the UTs can now refer to this list to select an appropriate calibrator. We encourage the use of "whereistheplanet" to predict the astrometry of these calibrators, which seamlessly integrates with "p2Gravity" for VLTI/GRAVITY dual-field observing material preparation.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors will observe mergers of black holes and neutron stars throughout cosmic time. A large number of the binary neutron star merger events will be observed with extreme high fidelity, and will provide stringent constraints on the equation of state of nuclear matter. In this paper, we investigate the systematic improvement in the measurability of the equation of state with increase in detector sensitivity by combining constraints obtained on the radius of a $1.4 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ neutron star from a simulated source population. Since the measurability of the equation of state depends on its stiffness, we consider a range of realistic equations of state that span the current observational constraints. We show that a single 40km Cosmic Explorer detector can pin down the neutron star radius for a soft, medium and stiff equation of state to an accuracy of 10m within a decade, whereas the current generation of ground-based detectors like the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network would take $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ years to do so for a soft equation of state.
#### Nature of the diffuse emission sources in the H I supershell in the  galaxy IC 1613

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxy IC 1613, focusing on the search for massive stars and related feedback processes, as well as for faint supernova remnants (SNR) in late stages of evolution. We obtained the deepest images of IC 1613 in the narrow-band H{\alpha}, He II and [S II] emission lines and new long-slit spectroscopy observations using several facilities (6-m BTA, 2.5m SAI MSU, and 150RTT telescopes), in combination with the multi-wavelength archival data from MUSE/VLT, VLA, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT. Our deep narrow-band photometry identifies several faint shells in the galaxy, and we further investigate their physical characteristics with the new long-slit spectroscopy observations and the archival multi-wavelength data. Based on energy balance calculations and assumptions about their possible nature, we propose that one of the shells is a possible remnant of a supernova explosion. We study five out of eight Wolf-Rayet (WR) star candidates previously published for this galaxy using the He ii emission line mapping, MUSE/VLT archival spectra, and new long-slit spectra. Our analysis discards the considered WR candidates and finds no new ones. We found P Cyg profiles in H{\alpha} line in two stars, which we classify as Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star candidates. Overall, the galaxy IC 1613 may have a lower rate of WR star formation than previously suggested.
