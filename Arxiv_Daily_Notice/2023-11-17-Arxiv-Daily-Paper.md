#### On the existence of a very metal-poor disc in the Milky Way
 - **Authors:** Hanyuan Zhang, Anke Ardern-Arentsen, Vasily Belokurov

 - **Abstract**
 There has been a discussion for many years on whether the disc in the Milky Way extends down to low metallicity. We aim to address the question by employing a large sample of giant stars with radial velocities and homogeneous metallicities based on the Gaia DR3 XP spectra. We study the 3D velocity distribution of stars in various metallicity ranges, including the very-metal poor regime (VMP, [M/H] $<-2.0$). We find that a clear disc population starts to emerge only around [M/H] $\sim -1.3$, and is not visible for [M/H] $<-1.6$. Using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM), we show that there are two halo populations in the VMP regime: one stationary and one with a net prograde rotation of $\sim80\,\mathrm{km/s}$. In this low-metallicity range, we are able to place constraints on the contribution of a rotation-supported disc sub-population to a maximum of $\sim 3$\%. We compare our results to previous claims of discy VMP stars in both observations and simulations and find that having a prograde halo component could explain most of these.

 - **Abstract**
 We study, analytically and numerically, the structure and evolution of relativistic jetted blast waves that propagate in uniform media, such as those that generate afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Similar to previous studies, we find that the evolution can be divided into two parts: (i) a pre-spreading phase, in which the jet core angle is roughly constant, $\theta_{c,0}$, and the shock Lorentz factor along the axis, $\Gamma_a$, evolves as a part of the Blandford-Mckee solution, and (ii) a spreading phase, in which $\Gamma_a$ drops exponentially with the radius and the core angle, $\theta_c$, grows rapidly. Nevertheless, the jet remains collimated during the relativistic phase, where $\theta_c(\Gamma_a\beta_a=1)\simeq 0.4\theta_{c,0}^{1/3}$. The transition between the phases takes place when $\Gamma_a\simeq 0.2\theta_{c,0}^{-1}$. We find that the "wings" of jets with initial "narrow" structure ($\frac{d \log\,E_{iso}}{d\log\,\theta}<-3$ outside of the core, where $E_{iso}$ is isotropic equivalent energy), start evolving during the pre-spreading phase. By the spreading phase these jets evolve to a self-similar profile, which is independent of the initial structure, where in the wings $\Gamma(\theta)\propto\theta^{-1.5}$ and $E_{iso}(\theta)\propto \theta^{-2.6}$. Jets with initial "wide" structure roughly keep their initial profile during their entire evolution. We provide analytic description of the jet lateral profile evolution for a range of initial structures, as well as the evolution of $\Gamma_a$ and $\theta_c$. For off-axis GRBs, we present a relation between the initial jet structure and the light curve rising phase. Applying our model to GW170817, we find that initially the jet had $\theta_{c,0}=0.4-4.5~\deg$ and wings which are consistent with $E_{iso} \propto \theta^{-3}-\theta^{-4}$.
#### Delayed X-ray brightening accompanied by variable ionized absorption  following a tidal disruption event

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultra-fast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. Here we report on the discovery of transient absorption-like signatures in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of $z$=0.092), following an X-ray brightening $\sim 230$ days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days, and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial covering, low velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times, but fails at late times. A high velocity (v$_w$ $\sim$ 42000 km s$^{-1}$, or -0.15c), ionized absorber (ultra-fast outflow) provides a good fit to all data. The few day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.
#### Ultralight vector dark matter, anisotropies and cosmological adiabatic  modes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09373
 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study the early-time behavior and the background evolution of ultra-light vector dark matter. We present a model for vector dark matter in an anisotropic Bianchi type I universe. Vector fields source anisotropies in the early universe characterized by a shear tensor which rapidly decays once the fields start oscillating, making them viable dark matter candidates. We present the set of equations needed to evolve scalar cosmological perturbations in the linear regime, both in Synchronous gauge and Newtonian gauge. We show that the shear tensor has to be taken into account in the calculation of adiabatic initial conditions.
#### All We Are Is Dust In The WIM: Constraints on Dust Properties in the  Milky Way's Warm Ionized Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparison of the presence and properties of dust in two distinct phases of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the warm neutral medium (WNM) and the warm ionized medium (WIM). Using distant pulsars at high Galactic latitudes and vertical distance ($|b| > 40\deg$, $D \sin|b| > 2 \mathrm{\,\, kpc}$) as probes, we measure their dispersion measures and the neutral hydrogen component of the warm neutral medium ($\text{WNM}_\text{HI}$) using HI column density. Together with dust intensity along these same sightlines, we separate the respective dust contributions of each ISM phase in order to determine whether the ionized component contributes to the dust signal. We measure the temperature ($T$), spectral index ($\beta$), and dust opacity ($\tau/N_{H}$) in both phases. We find $T~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}=20^{+3}_{-2}$~K, $\beta~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})} = 1.5\pm{0.4}$, and $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}=(1.0\pm0.1)\times 10^{-26}$~cm$^2$. Assuming that the temperature and spectral index are the same in both the WNM$_\text{HI}$ and WIM, and given our simple model that widely separated lines-of-sight can be fit together, we find evidence that there is a dust signal associated with the ionized gas and $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~\text{(WIM)}=(0.3\pm0.3)\times 10^{-26}$, which is about three times smaller than $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}$. We are 80% confident that $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~\text{(WIM)}$ is at least two times smaller than $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae are a class of astronomical transients observed as counterparts to mergers of compact binary systems, such as a binary neutron star (BNS) or black hole-neutron star (BHNS) inspirals. They serve as probes for heavy-element nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments, while together with gravitational wave emission constraining the distance to the merger itself, they can place constraints on the Hubble constant. Obtaining the physical parameters (e.g. ejecta mass, velocity, composition) of a kilonova from observations is a complex inverse problem, usually tackled by sampling-based inference methods such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or nested sampling techniques. These methods often rely on computing approximate likelihoods, since a full simulation of compact object mergers involve expensive computations such as integrals, the calculation of likelihood of the observed data given parameters can become intractable, rendering the likelihood-based inference approaches inapplicable. We propose here to use Simulation-based Inference (SBI) techniques to infer the physical parameters of BNS kilonovae from their spectra, using simulations produced with KilonovaNet. Our model uses Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (ANPE) together with an embedding neural network to accurately predict posterior distributions from simulated spectra. We further test our model with real observations from AT2017gfo, the only kilonova with multi-messenger data, and show that our estimates agree with previous likelihood-based approaches.
#### First Sagittarius A* Event Horizon Telescope Results. III: Imaging of  the Galactic Center Supermassive Black Hole
 - **Authors:** Authors: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09479
 - **Abstract**
 We present the first event-horizon-scale images and spatiotemporal analysis of Sgr A* taken with the Event Horizon Telescope in 2017 April at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. Imaging of Sgr A* has been conducted through surveys over a wide range of imaging assumptions using the classical CLEAN algorithm, regularized maximum likelihood methods, and a Bayesian posterior sampling method. Different prescriptions have been used to account for scattering effects by the interstellar medium towards the Galactic Center. Mitigation of the rapid intra-day variability that characterizes Sgr A* has been carried out through the addition of a "variability noise budget" in the observed visibilities, facilitating the reconstruction of static full-track images. Our static reconstructions of Sgr A* can be clustered into four representative morphologies that correspond to ring images with three different azimuthal brightness distributions, and a small cluster that contains diverse non-ring morphologies. Based on our extensive analysis of the effects of sparse $(u,v)$-coverage, source variability and interstellar scattering, as well as studies of simulated visibility data, we conclude that the Event Horizon Telescope Sgr A* data show compelling evidence for an image that is dominated by a bright ring of emission with a ring diameter of $\sim$ 50 $\mu$as, consistent with the expected "shadow" of a $4\times10^6 M_\odot$ black hole in the Galactic Center located at a distance of 8 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 I examine the applicability of ecological concepts in discussing issues related to space environmentalism. Terms such as "ecosystem"", "carrying capacity"", and "tipping point" are either ambiguous or well defined but not applicable to orbital space and its contents; using such terms uncritically may cause more confusion than enlightenment. On the other hand, it may well be fruitful to adopt the approach of the Planetary Boundaries Framework, defining trackable metrics that capture the damage to the space environment. I argue that the key metric is simply the number of Anthropogenic Space Objects (ASOs), rather than for example their reflectivity, which is currently doubling every 1.7 years; we are heading towards degree scale separation. Overcrowding of the sky is a problem astronomers and satellite operators have in common.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of a new, iterative density reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm uses a decreasing smoothing scale to better reconstruct the density field in Lagrangian space. We implement this algorithm to run on the Quijote simulations, and extend it to (a) include a smoothing kernel that smoothly goes from anisotropic to isotropic, and (b) a variant that does not correct for redshift space distortions. We compare the performance of this algorithm with the standard reconstruction method. Our examinations of the methods include cross-correlation of the reconstructed density field with the linear density field, reconstructed two-point functions, and BAO parameter fitting. We also examine the impact of various parameters, such as smoothing scale, anisotropic smoothing, tracer type/bias, and the inclusion of second order perturbation theory. We find that the two reconstruction algorithms are comparable in most of the areas we examine. In particular, both algorithms give consistent fittings of BAO parameters. The fits are robust over a range of smoothing scales. We find the iterative algorithm is significantly better at removing redshift space distortions. The new algorithm will be a promising method to be employed in the ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys.
#### Warp and flare of the old Galactic disc as traced by the red clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 Our study aims to investigate the outer disc structure of the Milky Way galaxy using the red clump (RC) stars. We analysed the distribution of the largest sample of RC stars to date, homogeneously covering the entire Galactic plane in the range of $40^\circ \le \ell \le 340^\circ$ and $-10^\circ \le b \le +10^\circ$. This sample allows us to model the RC star distribution in the Galactic disc to better constrain the properties of the flare and warp of the Galaxy. Our results show that the scale length of the old stellar disc weakly depends on azimuth, with an average value of $1.95 \pm0.26$ kpc. On the other hand, a significant disc flaring is detected, where the scale height of the disc increases from 0.38 kpc in the solar neighbourhood to $\sim 2.2$ kpc at R $\approx 15$ kpc. The flare exhibits a slight asymmetry, with $\sim 1$ kpc more scale height below the Galactic plane as compared to the Northern flare. We also confirm the warping of the outer disc, which can be modelled with $Z_w = (0.0057 \pm 0.0050)~ [R-(7358 \pm 368) (pc)]^{1.40 \pm 0.09} \sin(\phi - (-2^\circ.03 \pm 0^\circ .18))$. Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the warp, with a greater amplitude observed in the southern direction compared to the northern. Comparing our findings with younger tracers from the literature, we observe an age dependency of both the flare and warp. An increase in flare strength with age suggests the secular evolution of the disc as the preferred mechanism for forming the flare. The increase of the maximum warp amplitude with age indicates that the warp dynamics could be the possible cause of the variation in the warp properties with age.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the differential rotation in the chromosphere of the Sun is of significant importance as it provides valuable insights into the rotational behaviour of the solar atmosphere at higher altitudes and the coupling mechanism between the various layers of the solar atmosphere. In this work, we employed the image correlation technique, explicitly focusing on plages, intending to estimate the chromospheric differential rotation. For this purpose, we have utilized Ca II K spectroheliograms (1907-2007) from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO), recently calibrated with a better technique to ensure accuracy. Our analysis indicates that plages in the chromosphere exhibit faster rotation and a smaller latitudinal gradient when compared to the rotation rate obtained through sunspot tracking. Furthermore, we investigate the temporal analysis of the chromospheric differential rotation parameters across various solar cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 Semi-detached binaries are in the stage of mass transfer and play a crucial role in studying mass transfer physics between interacting binaries. Large-scale time-domain surveys provide massive light curves of binary systems, while Gaia offers high-precision astrometric data. In this paper, we develop, validate, and apply a pipeline that combines the MCMC method with a forward model and DBSCAN clustering to search for semi-detached binary and estimate its inclination, relative radius, mass ratio, and temperature ratio using light curve. We train our model on the mock light curves from PHOEBE, which provides broad coverage of light curve simulations for semi-detached binaries. Applying our pipeline to TESS sectors 1-26, we have identified 77 semi-detached binary candidates. Utilizing the distance from Gaia, we determine their masses and radii with median fractional uncertainties of ~26% and ~7%, respectively. With the added 77 candidates, the catalog of semi-detached binaries with orbital parameters has been expanded by approximately 20%. The comparison and statistical results show that our semi-detached binary candidates align well with the compiled samples and the PARSEC model in Teff-L and M-R relations. Combined with the literature samples, comparative analysis with stability criteria for conserved mass transfer indicates that ~97.4% of samples are undergoing nuclear-timescale mass transfer, and two samples (GO Cyg and TIC 454222105) are located within the limits of stability criteria for dynamical- and thermal-timescale mass transfer, which are currently undergoing thermal-timescale mass transfer. Additionally, one system (IR Lyn) is very close to the upper limit of delayed dynamical-timescale mass transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars like company. They are mostly formed in clusters and their lives are often altered by the presence of one or more companions. Interaction processes between components may lead to complex outcomes like Algols, blue stragglers, chemically altered stars, type Ia supernovae, as well as progenitors of gravitational wave sources, to cite a few. Observational astronomy has entered the era of big data, and thanks to large surveys like spatial missions Kepler, TESS, Gaia, and ground-based spectroscopic surveys like RAVE, Gaia-ESO, APOGEE, LAMOST, GALAH (to name a few) the field is going through a true revolution, as illustrated by the recent detection of stellar black holes and neutron stars as companions of massive but also low-mass stars. In this review, I will present why it is important to care about stellar multiples, what are the main large surveys in which many binaries are harvested, and finally present some features related to the largest catalogue of astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries provided by the Non-Single Star catalogue of Gaia, which is, to date, the largest homogeneous catalogue of stellar binaries.
#### PSR J$0952-0607$ and GW170817: Direct Multimessenger Constraints on  Neutron Star Equation of State through a Novel Wide-ranging Correlation

 - **Abstract**
 Our knowledge about neutron star (NS) masses is renewed once again due to the recognition of the heaviest NS PSR J$ 0952-0607 $. By taking advantage of both mass observations of super massive neutron stars and the tidal deformability derived from event GW170817, a joint constraint on tidal deformability is obtained. A wide-ranging correlation between NS pressure and tidal deformability within the density range from saturation density $\rho_0$ to $5.6\rho_0$ is discovered, which directly yields a constrained NS EoS. The newly constrained EoS has a small uncertainty and a softer behavior at high densities without the inclusion of extra degrees of freedom, which shows its potential to be used as an indicator for the component of NS core.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09826
 - **Abstract**
 We use a large set of halo mass function (HMF) models in order to investigate their ability to represent the observational Cluster Mass Function (CMF), derived from the $\mathtt{GalWCat19}$ cluster catalogue, within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We apply the $\chi^2$ minimization procedure to constrain the free parameters of the models, namely $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. We find that all HMF models fit well the observational CMF, while the Bocquet et. al. model provides the best fit, with the lowest $\chi^2$ value. Utilizing the {\em Index of Inconsistency} (IOI) measure, we further test the possible inconsistency of the models with respect to a variety of {\em Planck 2018} $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, resulting from the combination of different probes (CMB - BAO or CMB - DES). We find that the HMF models that fitted well the observed CMF provide consistent cosmological parameters with those of the {\em Planck} CMB analysis, except for the Press $\&$ Schechter, Yahagi et. al., and Despali et. al. models which return large IOI values. The inverse $\chi_{\rm min}^2$-weighted average values of $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, over all 23 theoretical HMF models are: ${\bar \Omega_{m,0}}=0.313\pm 0.022$ and ${\bar \sigma_8}=0.798\pm0.040$, which are clearly consistent with the results of {\em Planck}-CMB, providing $S_8=\sigma_8\left(\Omega_m/0.3\right)^{1/2}= 0.815\pm 0.05$. Within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and independently of the selected HMF model in the analysis, we find that the current CMF shows no $\sigma_8$-tension with the corresponding {\em Planck}-CMB results.

 - **Abstract**
 Exclusion zones in the cross-correlations between critical points (peak-void, peak-wall, filament-wall, filament-void) of the density field define quasi-standard rulers that can be used to constrain dark matter and dark energy cosmological parameters. The average size of the exclusion zone is found to scale linearly with the typical distance between extrema. The latter changes as a function of the matter content of the universe in a predictable manner, but its comoving size remains essentially constant in the linear regime of structure growth on large scales, unless the incorrect cosmology is assumed in the redshift-distance relation. This can be used to constrain the dark energy parameters when considering a survey that scans a range of redshifts. The precision of the parameter estimation is assessed using a set of cosmological simulations, and is found to be a 4$\sigma$ detection of a change in matter content of 5%, or about 3.8$\sigma$ detection of 50% shift in the dark energy parameter using a full sky survey up to redshift 0.5.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisional (de-)excitation of H$_{2}$ by helium plays an important role in the thermal balance and chemistry of various astrophysical environments, making accurate rate coefficients essential for the interpretation of observations of the interstellar medium. Our goal is to utilize a state-of-the-art potential energy surface (PES) to provide comprehensive state-to-state rate coefficients for He-induced transitions among rovibrational levels of H$_{2}$. We perform quantum scattering calculations for the H$_{2}$-He system and provide state-to-state rate coefficients for 1 089 transitions between rovibrational levels of H$_{2}$ with internal energies up to 15 000 cm$^{-1}$ for temperatures ranging from 20 to 8 000 K. Our results show good agreement with previous calculations for pure rotational transitions between low-lying rotational levels, but we find significant discrepancies for rovibrational processes involving highly-excited rotational and vibrational states. We attribute these differences to two key factors: the broader range of intramolecular distances covered by ab initio points, and the superior accuracy of the PES, resulting from the utilization of the state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods, compared to the previous lower-level calculations. Radiative transfer calculations performed with the new collisional data indicate that the population of rotational levels in excited vibrational states experiences significant modifications, highlighting the critical need for this updated dataset in models of high-temperature astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar system Centaurs originate in transneptunian space from where planet orbit crossing events inject their orbits inside the giant planets' domain. Here, we examine this injection process in the three-body problem by studying the orbital evolution of transneptunian asteroids located at Neptune's collision singularity as a function of the Tisserand invariant, T. Two injection modes are found, one for T>0.1, or equivalently prograde inclinations far from the planet, where unstable motion dominates injection, and another for T<= 0.1, or equivalently polar and retrograde inclinations far from the planet, where stable motion dominates injection. The injection modes are independent of the initial semi-major axis and the dynamical time at the collision singularity. The simulations uncovered a region in the polar corridor where the dynamical time exceeds the solar system's age suggesting the possibility of long-lived primordial polar transneptunian reservoirs that supply Centaurs to the giant planets' domain.

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed the Didymos-Dimorphos binary system with the MUSE integral field unit spectrograph mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) pre and post-DART impact, and captured the ensuing ejecta cone, debris cloud, and tails at sub-arcsecond resolutions. We targeted the Didymos system over 11 nights from 26 September to 25 October 2022, and utilized both narrow and wide-field observations with and without adaptive optics, respectively. We took advantage of the spectral-spatial coupled measurements and produced both white-light images and spectral maps of the dust reflectance. We identified and characterized numerous dust features, such as the ejecta cone, spirals, wings, clumps, and tails. We found that the base of the Sunward edge of the wings, from 03 to 19 October, consistent with maximum grain sizes on the order of 0.05-0.2 mm, and that the earliest detected clumps have the highest velocities on the order of 10 m/s. We also see that three clumps in narrow-field mode (8x8'') exhibit redder colors and slower speeds, around 0.09 m/s, than the surrounding ejecta, likely indicating that the clump is comprised of larger, slower grains. We measured the properties of the primary tail, and resolved and measured the properties of the secondary tail earlier than any other published study, with first retrieval on 03 October. Both tails exhibit similarities in curvature and relative flux, however, the secondary tail appears thinner, which may be caused by lower energy ejecta and possibly a low energy formation mechanism such as secondary impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundances of the slow neutron-capture (s-) process elements observed in barium stars can be explained by considering mass transfer in a binary system from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star onto a smaller mass and less evolved binary companion star. Based on the abundances of neutron-capture elements the barium stars are broadly divided into two categories, "strong" and "mild" barium stars. However, an understanding of the role of the characteristic properties of the companion AGBs on the formation of the different types of barium stars is still lacking. This work focuses on investigating the role of the mass of the companion AGB stars in this context. In a recent high-resolution spectroscopic study, we studied in detail the chemical composition of a few barium stars that we have identified. In order to understand the nature and the mass of the companion stars, we first estimated the mass of these objects and then used a parametric model-based analysis to derive the masses of the primary companion stars. The calculation is extended to 205 barium stars taken from literature. An analysis of the mass distribution revealed that both the strong and the mild barium stars occupy the same range of masses. However, their companion AGB stars' mass distributions peak at two different values 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ and 3.7 M$_{\odot}$, for the strong and the mild barium stars respectively. This provides clear evidence that the formation of mild and strong Ba stars is greatly influenced by the initial masses of the companion AGB stars. It remains, however, to be seen the possible impact of other factors such as orbital period and metallicity on the formation scenarios of barium stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the evolution of Betti curves obtained by persistent-homological analysis of pointclouds formed by halos in different cosmological $N$-body simulations. We show that they can be approximated with a scaled log-normal distribution function with reasonable precision. Our analysis shows that the shapes and maximums of Betti curves exhibit dependence on the mass range of the selected subpopulation of halos, but at the same time, the resolution of a simulation does not play any significant role, provided that the mass distribution of simulated halos is complete down to a given mass scale. Besides, we study how Betti curves change with the evolution of the Universe, i.e., their dependence on redshift. Sampling subpopulations of halos within certain mass ranges up to redshift $z=2.5$ yields a surprisingly small difference between corresponding Betti curves. We propose that this may be an indicator of the existence of a new specific topological invariant in the structure of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The low-mass metal-poor stars in the Galaxy that preserve in their atmosphere, the chemical imprints of the gas clouds from which they were formed can be used as probes to get insight into the origin and evolution of elements in the early galaxy, early star formation and nucleosynthesis. Among the metal-poor stars, a large fraction, the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars exhibits high abundance of carbon. These stars exhibit diverse abundance patterns, particularly for heavy elements, based on which they are classified into different groups. The diversity of abundance patterns points at different formation scenarios. Hence, accurate classification of CEMP stars and knowledge of their distribution is essential to understand the role and contribution of each group. While CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars can be used to get insight into binary interactions at very low metallicity, CEMP-no stars can be used to probe the properties of the first stars and early nucleosynthesis. To exploit the full potential of CEMP stars for Galactic archaeology a homogeneous analysis of each class is extremely important. Our efforts towards, and contributions to providing an improved classification scheme for accurate classification of CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars and in characterizing the companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of CH, CEMP-no, CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s binary systems are discussed. Some recent results obtained based on low- and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a large number of potential CH and CEMP star candidates are highlighted.

 - **Abstract**
 The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 41 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly to be considered a "living document", to provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.
