 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have long been suggested to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). Nevertheless, despite their expected ubiquity and sustained searching efforts, identifying specific interstellar PAH molecules from their infrared (IR) spectroscopy has so far been unsuccessful. However, due to its unprecedented sensitivity, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may change this. Meanwhile, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in detecting specific PAH molecules (e.g., indene, cyanoindene, and cyanonaphthalene) through their rotational lines in the radio frequencies. As JWST holds great promise for identifying specific PAH molecules in the ISM based on their vibrational spectra in the IR, in this work we model the vibrational excitation of indene, a molecule composed of a six-membered benzene ring fused with a five-membered cyclopentene ring, and calculate its IR emission spectra for a number of representative astrophysical regions. This will facilitate JWST to search for and identify indene in space through its vibrational bands and to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on its abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-puffs are planets with exceptionally low densities ($\rho \lesssim 0.1$~g~cm$^{-3}$) and core masses ($M_c \lesssim 5 M_\oplus$). Many lower-mass ($M_p\lesssim10M_\oplus$) super-puffs are expected to be unstable to catastrophic mass loss via photoevaporation and/or boil-off, whereas the larger gravitational potentials of higher-mass ($M_p\gtrsim10M_\oplus$) super-puffs should make them more stable to these processes. We test this expectation by studying atmospheric loss in the warm, higher-mass super-puff TOI-1420b ($M = 25.1M_\oplus$, $R = 11.9R_\oplus$, $\rho = 0.08$~g~cm$^{-3}$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 960$~K). We observed one full transit and one partial transit of this planet using the metastable helium filter on Palomar/WIRC and found that the helium transits were $0.671\pm0.079\%$ (8.5$\sigma$) deeper than the TESS transits, indicating an outflowing atmosphere. We modeled the excess helium absorption using a self-consistent 1D hydrodynamics code to constrain the thermal structure of the outflow given different assumptions for the stellar XUV spectrum. These calculations then informed a 3D simulation which provided a good match to the observations with a modest planetary mass-loss rate of $10^{10.82}$~g~s$^{-1}$ ($M_p/\dot{M}\approx70$~Gyr). Super-puffs with $M_p\gtrsim10M_\oplus$, like TOI-1420b and WASP-107b, appear perfectly capable of retaining atmospheres over long timescales; therefore, these planets may have formed with the unusually large envelope mass fractions they appear to possess today. Alternatively, tidal circularization could have plausibly heated and inflated these planets, which would bring their envelope mass fractions into better agreement with expectations from core-nucleated accretion.
#### Damping Obliquities of Hot Jupiter Hosts by Resonance Locking

 - **Abstract**
 When orbiting hotter stars, hot Jupiters are often highly inclined relative to their host star equator planes. By contrast, hot Jupiters orbiting cooler stars are more aligned. Prior attempts to explain this correlation between stellar obliquity and effective temperature have proven problematic. We show how resonance locking -- the coupling of the planet's orbit to a stellar gravity mode (g mode) -- can solve this mystery. Cooler stars with their radiative cores are more likely to be found with g-mode frequencies increased substantially by core hydrogen burning. Strong frequency evolution in resonance lock drives strong tidal evolution; locking to an axisymmetric g mode damps semi-major axes, eccentricities, and as we show for the first time, obliquities. Around cooler stars, hot Jupiters evolve into spin-orbit alignment and avoid engulfment. Hotter stars lack radiative cores, and therefore preserve congenital spin-orbit misalignments. We focus on resonance locks with axisymmetric modes, supplementing our technical results with simple physical interpretations, and show that non-axisymmetric modes also damp obliquity.
#### A Ratio-Preserving Approach to Cosmological Concordance

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological observables are particularly sensitive to key ratios of energy densities and rates, both today and at earlier epochs of the Universe. Well-known examples include the photon-to-baryon and the matter-to-radiation ratios. Equally important, though less publicized, are the ratios of pressure-supported to pressureless matter and the Thomson scattering rate to the Hubble rate around recombination, both of which observations tightly constrain. Preserving these key ratios in theories beyond the $\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model ensures broad concordance with a large swath of datasets when addressing cosmological tensions. We demonstrate that a mirror dark sector, reflecting a partial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry with the Standard Model, in conjunction with percent level changes to the visible fine-structure constant and electron mass which represent a \textit{phenomenological} change to the Thomson scattering rate, maintains essential cosmological ratios. Incorporating this ratio preserving approach into a cosmological framework significantly improves agreement to observational data ($\Delta\chi^2=-35.72$) and completely eliminates the Hubble tension with a cosmologically inferred $H_0 = 73.80 \pm 1.02$ km/s/Mpc when including the S$H_0$ES calibration in our analysis. While our approach is certainly nonminimal, it emphasizes the importance of keeping key ratios constant when exploring models beyond $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 We quantify for the first time the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift appearing in the waveform of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems. For this, we have developed a novel numerical method where we construct a reference binary, by evolving the post-Newtonian (PN) evolution equations backwards from a point near merger without the inclusion of the third object, that can be compared to the real binary that evolves under the influence from the third BH. From this we quantify how the interplay between dynamical tides, PN-effects, and the time-dependent Doppler shift of the eccentric GW source results in unique observable GW phase shifts that can be mapped to the gravitational dynamics taking place at formation. We further find a new analytical expression for the GW phase shift, which surprisingly has a universal functional form that only depends on the time-evolving BBH eccentricity. The normalization scales with the BH masses and initial separation, which can be linked to the underlying astrophysical environment. GW phase shifts from a chaotic 3-body BH scattering taking place in a cluster, and from a BBH inspiraling in a disk migration trap near a super-massive BH, are also shown for illustration. When current and future GW detectors start to observe eccentric GW sources with high enough signal-to-noise-ratio, we propose this to be among the only ways of directly probing the dynamical origin of individual BBH mergers using GWs alone.
#### Fast Methods for Computing Photometric Variability of Eccentric  Binaries: Boosting, Lensing, and Variable Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze accretion-rate time series for equal-mass binaries in co-planar gaseous disks spanning a continuous range of orbital eccentricities up to 0.8, for both prograde and retrograde systems. The dominant variability timescales match that of previous investigations; the binary orbital period is dominant for prograde binaries with $e \gtrsim 0.1$, with a 5 times longer "lump" period taking over for $e\lesssim 0.1$. This lump period fades and drops from 5 times to 4.5 times the binary period as $e$ approaches 0.1, where it vanishes. For retrograde orbits, the binary orbital period dominates at $e \lesssim 0.55$ and is accompanied by a 2 times longer-timescale periodicity at higher eccentricities. The shape of the accretion-rate time series varies with binary eccentricity. For prograde systems, the orientation of an eccentric disk causes periodic trading of accretion between the binary components in a ratio that we report as a function of binary eccentricity. We present a publicly available tool, binlite, that can rapidly ($\lesssim 0.01$~sec) generate templates for the accretion-rate time series, onto either binary component, for choice of binary eccentricity below 0.8. As an example use-case, we build lightcurve models where the accretion rate through the circumbinary disk and onto each binary component sets contributions to the emitted specific flux. We combine these rest-frame, accretion-variability lightcurves with observer-dependent Doppler boosting and binary self-lensing. This allows a flexible approach to generating lightcurves over a wide range of binary and observer parameter space. We envision binlite as the access point to a living database that will be updated with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations as they advance.
#### Discovery of a Rare Eclipsing Be/X-ray Binary System, Swift  J010902.6-723710 = SXP 182

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of Swift J010902.6-723710, a rare eclipsing Be/X-ray Binary system by the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). Swift J010902.6-723710 was discovered via weekly S-CUBED monitoring observations when it was observed to enter a state of X-ray outburst on 10 October 2023. X-ray emission was found to be modulated by a 182s period. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the presence of a highly-inclined circumstellar disk surrounding a B0-0.5Ve optical companion. Historical UV and IR photometry are then used to identify strong eclipse-like features re-occurring in both light curves with a 60.623 day period, which is adopted as the orbital period of the system. Eclipsing behavior is found to be the result of a large accretion disk surrounding the neutron star. Eclipses are produced when the disk passes in front of the OBe companion, blocking light from both the stellar surface and circumstellar disk. This is only the third Be/X-ray Binary to have confirmed eclipses. We note that this rare behavior provides an important opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of a Be/X-ray Binary with greater accuracy than is possible in non-eclipsing systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets are expected to form within circumplanetary disks, which shape their formation history and the local environment. Here, we consider the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks that arise during the late stages of giant planet formation. During this phase, when most of the final mass is accumulated, incoming material enters the Hill sphere and falls toward the planet. In the absence of torques, the falling parcels of gas conserve their specific angular momentum and collect into a circumplanetary disk. Generalizing previous work, we consider a range of possible geometries for the flow entering the sphere of influence of the planet. Specifically, we consider five geometric patterns for the inward flow, ranging from concentration toward the rotational poles of the system to isotropic flow to concentration along the equatorial plane. For each case, we derive analytic descriptions for the density field of the infall region, the disk surface density in the absence of viscosity, and steady-state solutions for viscous disks. These results, in turn, specify the luminosity contributions of the planet, the circumplanetary disk, and the envelope. These power sources, in conjunction with the surrounding material, collectively determine the observational appearance of the forming planet. We conclude with an approximate determination of these radiative signatures.
#### The XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP) II: The  Multi-scale Temperature Structures in the Milky Way Hot Gas

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the multi-scale temperature structures in the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as part of the XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP), surveying the O VII, O VIII, and Fe-L band emission features in the XMM-Newton archive. In particular, we define two temperature tracers, $I_{\rm OVIII}/I_{\rm OVII}$ (O87) and $I_{\rm FeL}/(I_{\rm OVII}+I_{\rm OVIII})$ (FeO). These two ratios cannot be explained simultaneously using single-temperature collisional ionization models, which indicates the need for multi-temperature structures in hot gas. In addition, we show three large-scale features in the hot gas: the eROSITA bubbles around the Galactic center (GC); the disk; and the halo. In the eROSITA bubbles, the observed line ratios can be explained by a log-normal temperature distribution with a median of $\log T/{\rm K} \approx 6.4$ and a scatter of $\sigma_T \approx 0.2$ dex. Beyond the bubbles, the line ratio dependence on the Galactic latitude suggests higher temperatures around the midplane of the MW disk. The scale height of the temperature variation is estimated to be $\approx$2 kpc assuming an average distance of $5$ kpc for the hot gas. The halo component is characterized by the dependence on the distance to the GC, showing a temperature decline from $\log\,T/{\rm K}\,\approx\, 6.3$ to $5.8$. Furthermore, we extract the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions to investigate the small-scale structures. O87 and FeO ratios show a consistent auto-correlation scale of $\approx$$ 5^\circ$ (i.e., $\approx$$ 400$ pc at 5 kpc), which is consistent with expected physical sizes of X-ray bubbles associated with star-forming regions or supernova remnants. Finally, we examine the cross-correlation between the hot and UV-detected warm gas, and show an intriguing anti-correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 A new fine grid of nonlinear convective pulsation models for the so-called "bump Cepheids" is presented to investigate the Hertzprung progression (HP) phenomenon shown by their light and radial pulsation velocity curves. The period corresponding to the center of the HP is investigated as a function of various model assumptions, such as the efficiency of super-adiabatic convection, the mass-luminosity relation, and the metal and helium abundances. The assumed mass-luminosity relation is found to significantly affect the phenomenon but variations in the chemical composition as well as in the stellar mass (at fixed mass-luminosity relation) also play a key role in determining the value of the HP center period. Finally, the predictive capability of the presented theoretical scenario is tested against observed light curves of bump Cepheids in the ESA Gaia database, also considering the variation of the pulsation amplitudes and of the Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $\Phi_{21}$ with the pulsation period. A qualitative agreement between theory and observations is found for what concerns the evolution of the light curve morphology as the period moves across the HP center, as well for the pattern in period-amplitude, period-$R21$ and period-$\Phi_{21}$ planes. A larger sample of observed Cepheids with accurate light curves and metallicities is required in order to derive more quantitative conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted an all-sky imaging transient search with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) data collected during the Perseid meteor shower in 2018. The data collection during the meteor shower was motivated to conduct a search for intrinsic radio emission from meteors below 60 MHz known as the meteor radio afterglows (MRAs). The data collected were calibrated and imaged using the core array to obtain lower angular resolution images of the sky. These images were input to a pre-existing LWA transient search pipeline to search for MRAs as well as cosmic radio transients. This search detected 5 MRAs and did not find any cosmic transients. We further conducted peeling of bright sources, near-field correction, visibility differencing and higher angular resolution imaging using the full array for these 5 MRAs. These higher angular resolution images were used to study their plasma emission structures and monitor their evolution as a function of frequency and time. With higher angular resolution imaging, we resolved the radio emission size scales to less than 1 km physical size at 100 km heights. The spectral index mapping of one of the long duration event showed signs of diffusion of plasma within the meteor trails. The unpolarized emission from the resolved radio components suggest resonant transition radiation as the possible radiation mechanism of MRAs.

 Spatial template is important to study the nearby supernova remnant (SNR). For SNR G332.5-5.6, we report a gaussian disk with radius of about 1.06 degrees to be a potential good spatial model in the gamma-ray band. Employing this new gaussian disk, its GeV lightcurve shows a significant variability of about 7 sigma. The $\gamma$-ray observations of this SNR could be explained well either by a leptonic model or a hadronic model, in which a flat spectrum for the ejected electrons/protons.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In Gaia era, atmospheric turbulence, which causes stochastic wander of a star image, is a fundamental limitation to the astrometric accuracy of ground-based optical imaging. However, the positional bias caused by turbulence (called turbulence error here) can be effectively reduced by measuring a target relative to another reference (a star or a fast-moving target) which locates in the range of only several tens of arcsec, since they suffer from similar turbulence errors. This phenomenon is called the precision premium and has been effectively applied to the astrometry of solar system. Further investigation for the precision premium shows that, the precision premium works at less than about 100 arcsec for two specific objects and the relative positional precision as a function of their angular seperation can be well fitted by a sigmoidal function, called the precision premium curve (PPC). Aims. We want to reduce the turbulence error of a target if it is imaged in an area of high stellar density of a ground-based observation by taking advantage of more Gaia reference stars. Methods. Based on the PPC, we proposed a high-precision astrometric solution called precision premium transformation (PPT) in this paper, which takes advantage of high similarity of turbulence errors in a small region and the dense Gaia reference stars in the region to reduce the turbulence errors on the observation, through a weighted solution. Results. Through systematic analysis, the PPT method exhibits significant advantages in terms of not only precision but also applicability when a target is imaged in an area of high stellar density. The PPT method is also applied to the determination of the proper motion of an open cluster, and the results demonstrate and quantify benefits that the PPT method bestows on ground-based astrometry.
#### Flares during Eclipses of High Mass X-ray Binary Systems Vela X-1, 4U  1700-37, and LMC X-4

 - **Abstract**
 In eclipsing X-ray binary systems, the direct X-ray emission is blocked by the companion star during the eclipse. We observe only reprocessed emission that contains clues about the environment of the compact object and its chemical composition, ionization levels, etc. We have found flares in some X-ray binaries during their eclipses. The study of eclipse flares provides additional clues regarding the size of the reprocessing region and helps distinguish between different components of the X-ray spectrum observed during the eclipse. In the archival data, we searched for flares during eclipses of high-mass X-ray binaries and found flares in three sources: Vela X-1, LMC X-4, and 4U 1700-37. Comparing spectral properties of the eclipse flare and non-flare data, we found changes in the power-law photon index in all three sources and multiple emission lines in Vela X-1 and 4U 1700-37. The fluxes of prominent emission lines showed a similar increase as the overall X-ray flux during the eclipse flare, suggesting the lines originate in the binary environment and not in the interstellar medium. We also observed a soft excess in 4U 1700-37 that remains unchanged during both eclipse flare and non-flare states. Our analysis suggests that this emission originates from the extremely thin shell of the stellar wind surrounding the photosphere of its companion star. The detection of short (100-200 seconds) count-rate doubling timescale in 4U 1700-37 and LMC X-4 indicates that the eclipse reprocessing occurs in a region larger than, but comparable to the size of the companion star.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we present the analysis of six solar flare events that occurred in 2022, using new data from the third-generation Miniature X-Ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS), also known as the Dual-zone Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS). The primary focus of this study is on the flare's "onset phase", which is characterized by elevated soft X-ray emissions even before the flare's impulsive phase. We analyze the temporal evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and elemental abundance factors during the flare onset phase, by fitting the DAXSS spectra with the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC) model. The model fitting results indicate that the flaring-plasma is already at a high temperature (10-15 MK) during the onset period. The temperature rises during the onset phase, followed by a decrease and subsequent increase during the impulsive phase. Elemental abundance factors show a trend of falling below pre-flare values during the onset phase, with some recovery before the impulsive phase. During the impulsive phase, the abundance factors decrease from elevated coronal values to about photospheric values. We also analyze images from the 193 Angstrom channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), highlighting the formation or brightening of coronal loop structures during the onset phase. Two distinct onset loop configurations are observed which are referred to as 1-loop and 2-loop onsets. Both DAXSS and AIA observations indicate that the flare onset phase exhibits similar hot coronal plasma properties as the impulsive phase, suggesting that the onset phase may act as a preconditioning effect for some flares.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially originating from the pulsar wind nebula in CTA 1 by analyzing about 15 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. By selecting an energy range from 50 GeV to 1 TeV to remove contamination from the $\gamma$-ray pulsar PSR J0007+7303, we have discovered an extended $\gamma$-ray source with a TS value of $\sim$ 44.94 in the region of CTA 1. The obtained flux is measured to be 6.71 $\pm$ 2.60 $\times$ $10^{-12}$ erg $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with a spectral index of 1.61 $\pm$ 0.36, which allows for a smooth connection with the flux in the TeV band. CTA 1 is also considered to be associated with 1LHAASO J0007+7303u, which is an Ultra-High-Energy source listed in the recently published catalog of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory. We assume that the radiation originates from the pulsar wind nebula and that its multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution can be explained well with a time-dependent one-zone model.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the broadband spectral energy distribution of the high energy peaked (HBL) blazar Mkn 501 using $\textit{Swift}$-XRT/UVOT, NuSTAR and $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT observations taken between 2013 and 2022. The spectra were fitted with a one-zone leptonic model using synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from different particle energy distributions such as a broken power-law, log-parabola, as well as distributions expected when the diffusion or the acceleration time scale are energy dependent. The jet power estimated for a broken power-law distribution was $ \sim 10^{47} (10^{44})$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a minimum electron energy $\gamma_\text{min} \sim 10 (10^3)$. However, for electron energy distributions with intrinsic curvature (such as the log-parabola form), the jet power is significantly lower at a few times $ 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is a few percent of the Eddington luminosity of a $10^7$ M$_\odot$ black hole, suggesting that the jet may be powered by accretion processes. We discuss the implications of these results.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a Kernel Density Estimator method to evaluate the stellar velocity dispersion in the open cluster NGC 2571. We derive the 3-D velocity dispersion using both proper motions as extracted from Gaia DR3 and single epoch radial velocities as obtained with the instrument FLAMES at ESO VLT. The mean-square velocity along the line-of-sight is found to be larger than the one in the tangential direction by a factor in the interval [6,8]. We argue that the most likely explanation for such an occurrence is the presence of a significant quantity of unresolved binary and multiple stars in the radial velocity sample. Special attention should be paid to single line spectroscopic binaries (SB1) since in this case we observe the spectral lines of the primary component only, and therefore the derived radial velocity is not the velocity of the binary system center of mass. To investigate this scenario, we performed numerical experiments at varying the fractional abundance of SB1 in the observed sample. These experiments show that the increase of the mean-square radial velocity depends actually on the fractional abundance of SB1 to a power in the range of [0.39,0.45]. We used the 3-D velocity dispersion obtained by the dispersions in the tangential directions and the assumption that the radial velocity dispersion is the same as a tangential one to estimate the virial cluster mass and the cluster mass taking into account the gravitational field of the Galaxy and the non-stationarity of the cluster. These estimates are $650\pm30 \; M_\odot$ and $310\pm80 \; M_\odot$, respectively, and they are in substantial agreement with the photometric cluster mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the mock 21cm maps from the post-reionization epoch to show that the $\Lambda$CDM and warm dark matter (WDM) model can be distinguished for WDM particle masses $m_{FD}<3$ keV, under the assumption of thermal production of WDM following the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution. We demonstrate that the CNN is a potent tool in distinguishing the dark matter masses, highlighting its sensitivity to the subtle differences in the 21cm maps produced by varying dark matter masses. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to encompass different WDM production mechanisms, recognizing that the dark matter production mechanism in the early Universe is among the sources of the most significant uncertainty for the dark matter model building. In this work, given the mass of the dark matter, we discuss the feasibility of discriminating four different WDM models: Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution model, neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\nu$MSM), Dodelson-Widrow (DW), and Shi-Fuller (SF) model. For instance, when the WDM mass is 2 keV, we show that one can differentiate between CDM, FD, $\nu$MSM, and DW models while discerning between the DW and SF models turns out to be challenging. Our results reinforce the viability of the CNN as a robust analysis for 21cm maps and shed light on its potential to unravel the features associated with different dark matter production mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Among Neptunian mass planets exoplanets ($20-50$ M$_\oplus$), puffy hot Neptunes are extremely rare, and their unique combination of low mass and extended radii implies very low density ($\rho < 0.3$ g cm$^{-3}$). Over the last decade, only a few puffy planets have been detected and precisely characterized with both transit and radial velocity observations, most notably including WASP-107 $b$, TOI-1420 $b$, and WASP-193 $b$. In this paper, we report the discovery of TOI-1173 A $b$, a low-density ($\rho = 0.269_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$) super-Neptune with $P = 7.06$ days in a nearly circular orbit around the primary G-dwarf star in the wide binary system TOI-1173 A/B. Using radial velocity observations with the MAROON-X spectrograph and transit photometry from TESS, we determined a planet mass of $M_{\rm{p}} = 26.1\pm1.9\ M_{\oplus}$ and radius of $R_{\rm{p}} = 8.10\pm0.17\ R_{\oplus}$. TOI-1173 A $b$ is the first puffy Super-Neptune planet detected in a wide binary system (separation $\sim 11,400$ AU). We explored several mechanisms to understand the puffy nature of TOI-1173 A $b$, and showed that tidal heating is the most promising explanation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TOI-1173 A $b$ likely has maintained its orbital stability over time and may have undergone von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration followed by tidal circularization given its present-day architecture, with important implications for planet migration theory and induced engulfment into the host star. Further investigation of the atmosphere of TOI-1173 A $b$ will shed light on the origin of close-in low-density Neptunian planets in field and binary systems, while spin-orbit analyses may elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in non-vacuum space would be affected by both the non-zero mass $m_{\gamma}$ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to $m_{\gamma}^2\nu^{-4}$, which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to $\nu^{-2}$). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a non-zero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The de-dispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of $9.52\times 10^{-46} \, \rm kg \,\,(5.34 \times 10^{-10}\, \rm eV/c^2$). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wide-band spectra are detected by UWB receivers.
#### Spectroscopic Searches for Evolutionary Orbital Period Changes in WR+OB  Binaries: the Case of WR 127 (Hen 3-1772)

 - **Abstract**
 We aim at searching for secular evolution of the orbital period in the short-period binary system WR 127 (WN3b+O9.5V, $P = 9.555^d$). We performed new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of WR 127 on 2.5-m CMO SAI telescope to construct the radial velocity curves of the components suggesting the component masses $M_\mathrm{WR}\sin^3(i) = 11.8\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{O}\sin^3(i)=17.2\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$. The comparison with archival radial velocity curves enabled us to calculate the $(O-C)$ plot with accuracy sufficient to search for the orbital period change in WR 127. We report on the reliable detection of a secular increase in the orbital period of WR 127 at a rate of $\dot{P} = 0.83\pm0.14~\mbox{s~yr}^{-1}$ corresponding to the dynamical mass-loss rate from the WR star $\dot{M}_\mathrm{WR} = (2.6\pm0.5)\times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass-loss rate from WR stars in three WR+OB binaries (WR 127, CX Cep and V444 Cyg) as inferred from spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggests a preliminary empirical correlation between the WR star mass and the dynamical mass-loss rate $\dot M_\mathrm{WR}\sim M_\mathrm{WR}^{1.8}$. This relation is important for the understanding of the evolution of massive close binaries with WR stars -- precursors of gravitational-wave binary merging events with neutron stars and black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity fields of molecular clouds (MCs) can provide crucial information on the merger and split between clouds, as well as their internal kinematics and maintenance, energy injection and redistribution, even star formation within clouds. Using the CO spectral lines data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, we measure the relative velocities along the line of sight ($\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$) between $^{13}$CO structures within $^{12}$CO MCs. Emphasizing MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures, we find that approximately 70$\%$ of $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ values are less than $\sim$ 1 km s$^{-1}$, and roughly 10$\%$ of values exceed 2 km s$^{-1}$, with a maximum of $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ with the internal velocity dispersion of $^{13}$CO structures ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$) and find that about 40$\%$ of samples in either double or triple regime display distinct velocity discontinuities, i.e. the relative velocities between $^{13}$CO structures are larger than the internal linewidths of $^{13}$CO structures. Among these 40$\%$ samples in the triple regime, 33$\%$ exhibit signatures of combinations through the two-body motion, whereas the remaining 7$\%$ show features of configurations through the multiple-body motion. The $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ distributions for MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures are similar, as well as their $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$ distributions. This suggests that relative motions of $^{13}$CO structures within MCs are random and independent of cloud complexities and scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present first-order models for tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in LISA, both for the individual interferometers as well as in the time-delay interferometry (TDI) Michelson observables. These models include the noise contributions from angular and lateral jitter coupling of the six test masses, six movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and three spacecraft. We briefly discuss which terms are considered to be dominant and reduce the TTL model for the second-generation TDI Michelson X observable to these primary noise contributions to estimate the resulting noise level. We show that the expected TTL noise will initially violate the entire mission displacement noise budget, resulting in the known necessity to fit and subtract TTL noise in data post-processing. By comparing the noise levels for different assumptions prior to subtraction, we show why noise mitigation by realignment prior to subtraction is favorable. We then discuss that the TTL coupling in the individual interferometers will have noise contributions that will not be present in the TDI observables. Models for TTL coupling noise in TDI and in the individual interferometers are therefore different, and commonly made assumptions are valid as such only for TDI but not for the individual interferometers. Finally, we analyze what implications can be drawn from the presented models for the subsequent fit-and-subtraction in post-processing. We show that noise contributions from the test mass and inter-satellite interferometers are indistinguishable, such that only the combined coefficients can be fit and used for subtraction. However, a distinction is considered not necessary. Additionally, we show a correlation between coefficients for transmitter and receiver jitter couplings in each individual TDI Michelson observable. This full correlation can be resolved by using all three Michelson observables for fitting the TTL coefficients.

 We discuss the possibility to observe neutrinos emitted from a failed core collapse Supernova in the various experiments at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We show that the veto regions of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments can be used as a network of small detectors to measure Supernova neutrinos. In addition we show that this network can measure very precisely the moment of black hole formation, which can be then used in the nearby VIRGO detector and future Einstein Telescope to look for the gravitational wave counterpart to the neutrino signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurements of energy spectra of different cosmic ray species were obtained in recent years, by particularly the AMS-02 experiment on the International Space Station. It has been shown that apparent differences exist in different groups of the primary cosmic rays. However, it is not straightforward to conclude that the source spectra of different particle groups are different since they will experience different propagation processes (e.g., energy losses and fragmentations) either. In this work, we study the injection spectra of different nuclear species using the measurements from Voyager-1 outside the solar system, and ACR-CRIS and AMS-02 on top of atmosphere, in a physical framework of cosmic ray transportation. Two types of injection spectra are assumed, the broken power-law and the non-parametric spline interpolation form. The non-parametric form fits the data better than the broken power-law form, implying that potential structures beyond the constrained spectral shape of broken power-law may exist. For different nuclei the injection spectra are overall similar in shape but do show some differences among each other. For the non-parametric spectral form, the helium injection spectrum is the softest at low energies and the hardest at high energies. For both spectral shapes, the low-energy injection spectrum of neon is the hardest among all these species, and the carbon and oxygen spectra have more prominent bumps in 1-10 GV in the R2dN/dR presentation. Such differences suggest the existence of differences in the sources or acceleration processes of various nuclei of cosmic rays.

 We present point-source photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope's final survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We mapped 30 square degrees in two epochs in 2017, with the second extending to early 2018 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns using the Infrared Array Camera. This survey duplicates the footprint from the SAGE-SMC program in 2008. Together, these surveys cover a nearly 10 yr temporal baseline in the SMC. We performed aperture photometry on the mosaicked maps produced from the new data. We did not use any prior catalogs as inputs for the extractor in order to be sensitive to any moving objects (e.g., foreground brown dwarfs) and other transient phenomena (e.g., cataclysmic variables or FU Ori-type eruptions). We produced a point-source catalog with high-confidence sources for each epoch as well as combined-epoch catalog. For each epoch and the combined-epoch data, we also produced a more complete archive with lower-confidence sources. All of these data products will be available to the community at the Infrared Science Archive.

 - **Abstract**
 Among multi-messenger observations of the next galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. On 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd's real-time supernova monitoring system (Abe te al. 2016b) has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on December 13, 2021, and is available through GCN Notices (Barthelmy et al. 2000). When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd's response to a simulated galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd's pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3-7$^\circ$ depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.
#### Coupled geophysical and thermal constraints link between Mars basal  molten layer and the planet viscosity profile

 - **Abstract**
 Computing the tidal deformations of Mars, we explored various Mars internal structures by examining profiles that include or exclude a basal molten layer within the mantle and a solid inner core. By assessing their compatibility with a diverse set of geophysical observations we show that despite the very short periods of excitation, tidal deformation is very efficient to constraint the Mars interior. We calculated densities and thicknesses for Martian lithosphere, mantle, {core-mantle boundary} layer and core and {found them} coherent with preexisting results from other methods. We also estimated new viscosities for these layers. We demonstrated that the geodetic record associated with thermal constraint is very sensitive to the {presence} of a basal molten layer in deep Martian mantle, and less sensitive to the solid core. Our results also indicate that the existence of the basal molten layer necessarily comes together with an inversion of viscosity between the lithosphere and the mantle. In this case, we could attribute this reverse viscosity contrast to the poor hydration state of Martian mantle and we underlined that this result prevents a strict Earth-like plate tectonics on Mars. The existence of the basal molten layer is also associated with a non-inversion of viscosity between the core-mantle boundary layer and the liquid core. Finally, in our results, a basal molten layer is incompatible with the existence of a solid inner core. Efforts to detect basal molten layer are then of prime importance to decipher the Martian interior. {Inversely, viscosity profiles appear to be very good tools for probing the existence of such molten layer at the base of the Mars mantle.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, by using tensor virial equations, we show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a 3D General Circulation Model, the Unified Model, we present results from simulations of a tidally-locked TRAPPIST-1e with varying carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 gas concentrations, and their corresponding prescribed spherical haze profiles. Our results show that the presence of CO2 leads to a warmer atmosphere globally due to its greenhouse effect, with the increase of surface temperature on the dayside surface reaching up to ~14.1 K, and on the nightside up to ~21.2 K. Increasing presence of CH4 first elevates the surface temperature on the dayside, followed by a decrease due to the balance of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. A thin layer of haze, formed when the partial pressures of CH4 to CO2 (pCH4/pCO2) = 0.1, leads to a dayside warming of ~4.9K due to a change in the water vapour H2O distribution. The presence of a haze layer that formed beyond the ratio of 0.1 leads to dayside cooling. The haze reaches an optical threshold thickness when pCH4/pCO2 ~0.4 beyond which the dayside mean surface temperature does not vary much. The planet is more favourable to maintaining liquid water on the surface (mean surface temperature above 273.15 K) when pCO2 is high, pCH4 is low and the haze layer is thin. The effect of CO2, CH4 and haze on the dayside is similar to that for a rapidly-rotating planet. On the contrary, their effect on the nightside depends on the wind structure and the wind speed in the simulation.

 We present a catalog that we named MODEST containing depth-dependent information on the atmospheric conditions inside sunspot groups of all types. The catalog is currently composed of 942 observations of 117 individual active regions with sunspots that cover all types of features observed in the solar photosphere. We use the SPINOR-2D code to perform spatially coupled inversions of the Stokes profiles observed by Hinode/SOT-SP at high spatial resolution. SPINOR-2D accounts for the unavoidable degradation of the spatial information due to the point spread function of the telescope. The sunspot sample focuses on complex sunspot groups, but simple sunspots are also part of the catalog for completeness. Sunspots were observed from 2006 to 2019, covering parts of solar cycles 23 and 24. The catalog is a living resource, as with time, more sunspot groups will be included.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) represent a particular class of primordial signals which are sourced at second-order in perturbation theory whenever a scalar fluctuation of the metric is present. They form a guaranteed Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) that, depending on the amplification of primordial scalar fluctuations, can be detected by GW detectors. The amplitude and the frequency shape of the scalar-induced SGWB can be influenced by the statistical properties of the scalar density perturbations. In this work we study the intuitive physics behind SIGWs and we analyze the imprints of local non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation on the GW spectrum. We consider all the relevant non-Gaussian contributions up to fifth-order in the scalar seeds without any hierarchy, and we derive the related GW energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis to understand to which accuracy non-Gaussianity can be constrained with the LISA detector, which will be sensitive in the milli-Hertz frequency band. We find that LISA, neglecting the impact of astrophysical foregrounds, will be able to measure the amplitude, the width and the peak of the spectrum with an accuracy up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, while non-Gaussianity can be measured up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our non-Gaussianity expansion on the fraction of Primordial Black Holes.
#### Tidal synchronization trapping in stars and planets with convective  envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a "pseudosynchronous" ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for "inertial" waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes, and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable "synchronization traps" at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict, but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.
