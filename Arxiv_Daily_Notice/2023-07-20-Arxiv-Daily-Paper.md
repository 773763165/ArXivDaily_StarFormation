 - **Abstract**
 Presented here are NOEMA interferometric observations of the neighboring hot cores W3(H$_{2}$O) and W3(OH). The presence of two star-forming cores at different evolutionary stages within the same parent cloud presents a unique opportunity to study how the physics of the source and its evolutionary stage impact the chemistry. Through spectral analysis and imaging, we identify over twenty molecules in these cores. Most notably, we have detected HDO and CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$CN in W3(OH), which were previously not detected in this core. We have imaged the molecular emission, revealing new structural features within these sources. W3(OH) shows absorption in a "dusty cocoon" surrounded by molecular emission. These observations also reveal extended emission that is potentially indicative of a low-velocity shock. From the information obtained herein, we have constructed column density and temperature maps for methanol and compared this information to the molecular images. By comparing the spatial distribution of molecules which may be destroyed at later stages of star formation, this work demonstrates the impact of physical environment on chemistry in star-forming regions at different evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first integrated light, TESS-based light curves for star clusters in the Milky Way, Small Magellanic Cloud, and Large Magellanic Cloud. We explore the information encoded in these light curves, with particular emphasis on variability. We describe our publicly available package ELK, which is designed to extract the light curves by applying principal component analysis to perform background light correction, and incorporating corrections for TESS systematics, allowing us to detect variability on time scales shorter than ~10 days. We perform a series of checks to ensure the quality of our light curves, removing observations where systematics are identified as dominant features, and deliver light curves for 348 previously-cataloged open and globular clusters. Where TESS has observed a cluster in more than one observing sectors, we provide separate light curves for each sector (for a total of 2204 light curves). We explore in detail the light curves of star clusters known to contain high-amplitude Cepheid and RR Lyrae variable stars, and confirm that the variability of these known variables is still detectable when summed together with the light from thousands of other stars. We also demonstrate that even some low-amplitude stellar variability is preserved when integrating over a stellar population.
#### Probing the Conditions for the Hı-to-H$_{2}$ Transition in the  Interstellar Medium
 - **Authors:** Gyueun Park, Min-Young Lee, Shmuel Bialy, Blakesley Burkhart, J. R. Dawson, Carl Heiles, Di Li, Claire Murray, Hiep Nguyen, Anita Hafner, Daniel R. Rybarczyk, Snežana Stanimirović

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the conditions for the HI-to-H$_{2}$ transition in the solar neighborhood by analyzing HI emission and absorption measurements toward 58 Galactic lines of sight (LOSs) along with $^{12}$CO(1$-$0) (CO) and dust data. Based on the accurate column densities of the cold and warm neutral medium (CNM and WNM), we first perform a decomposition of gas into atomic and molecular phases and show that the observed LOSs are mostly HI-dominated. In addition, we find that the CO-dark H$_{2}$, not the optically thick HI, is a major ingredient of the dark gas in the solar neighborhood. To examine the conditions for the formation of CO-bright molecular gas, we analyze the kinematic association between HI and CO and find that the CNM is kinematically more closely associated with CO than the WNM. When CNM components within CO line widths are isolated, we find the following characteristics: spin temperature $<$ 200 K, peak optical depth $>$ 0.1, CNM fraction of $\sim$0.6, and $V$-band dust extinction $>$ 0.5 mag. These results suggest that CO-bright molecular gas preferentially forms in environments with high column densities where the CNM becomes colder and more abundant. Finally, we confront the observed CNM properties with the steady-state H$_{2}$ formation model of Sternberg et al. and infer that the CNM must be clumpy with a small volume filling factor. Another possibility would be that missing processes in the model, such as cosmic-rays and gas dynamics, play an important role in the HI-to-H$_{2}$ transition.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar jets and outflows are essential ingredients of the star formation process. A better understanding of this phenomenon is important in its own right as well as for many fundamental aspects of star formation. Jets and outflows associated with O-type protostars are rarely studied with observations reaching the close vicinity of the protostars. In this work, we report high-resolution ALMA and VLBA observations to reveal a clear and consistent picture of an outflow associated with an O-type protostar candidate in the G26.50+0.28 region. These observations reveal, for the first time, a collimated jet located in the middle of the outflow cavity. The jet is found to be perpendicular to an elongated disk/toroid and its velocity gradient. The collimated jet appears to show a small amplitude ($\alpha$$\approx$0$\,.\!\!^{\circ}$06) counterclockwise precession, when looking along the blueshifted jet axis from the strongest continuum source MM1, with a precession length of 0.22 pc. The inclination of the jet is likely to be very low ($\approx$8$^{\circ}$), which makes it a promising target to study its transverse morphologies and kinematics. However, no clear evidence of jet rotation is found in the ALMA and VLBA observations. The three-dimensional velocities of the water maser spots appear to show the same absolute speed with respect to different opening angles, suggesting the jet winds may be launched in a relatively small region. This favors the X-wind model, that is, jets are launched in a small area near the inner disk edge.

 - **Abstract**
 Transit spectroscopy is the most frequently used technique to reveal the atmospheric properties of exoplanets, while that at high resolution has the advantage to resolve the small Doppler shift of spectral lines, and the trace signal of the exoplanet atmosphere can be separately extracted. We obtain the transmission spectra of the extrasolar planet WASP-85Ab, a hot Jupiter in a 2.655-day orbit around a G5, V=11.2 mag host star, observed by high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope array for three transits. We present an analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect on WASP-85A, and determine a spin-orbit angle ${\lambda = -16.155^{\circ}}^{+2.916}_{-2.879}$, suggesting that the planet is in an almost aligned orbit. Combining the transmission spectra of three nights, we tentatively detected H$\alpha$ and Ca II absorption with $\gtrapprox 3\sigma$ via direct visual inspection of the transmission spectra with the Center-to-Limb variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effects removed, which still remain visible after excluding the cores of these strong lines with a 0.1 A mask. These spectral signals seems likely to origin from the planetary atmosphere, but we can not fully exclude their stellar origins. Via the cross-correlation analysis of a set of atoms and molecules, Li I is marginally detected at $\sim4\sigma$ level, suggesting that Li might be present in the atmosphere of WASP-85Ab.
#### Carbonates and ices in the $z=0.89$ galaxy-absorber towards PKS 1830-211  and within star-forming regions of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 A pair of 6.0 and 6.9 $\mu$m absorption features are frequently observed in Milky-Way (MW) molecular-clouds and YSOs; they also occur in the $z=0.886$ rest-frame of a molecule-rich spiral galaxy obscuring blazar PKS 1830-211. I calibrate $\chi^2$-fitting methods which match observations with two or three laboratory spectra. The 6.0-$\mu$m component is dominated by H$_2$O ice, as expected. Included MW sources were selected using opacity criteria which limit the range of explored H$_2$O-ice column densities to 1.6--$2.4 \times 10^{18}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$, while the H$_2$O-ice density in the galaxy absorber is $(2.7\pm 0.5)\times 10^{18}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$. CH$_3$OH ice and / or small (< 0.1-$\mu$m-sized) Ca- and Mg-bearing carbonates contribute at 6.9 $\mu$m. The 41 % CH$_3$OH : H$_2$O molecular ratio in the PKS 1830-211 absorber is significantly higher than in the molecular cloud towards Taurus-Elias 16 (<7.5 %) and similar to the highest value in MW YSOs (35 % in AFGL 989). Fitted carbonate (-CO$_3$) : H$_2$O ratios in the galaxy absorber of 0.091 % are low in comparison to most of the ratios detected in the MW sample (0.2 - 0.4 %; $\sim 0$ % in AFGL 989). Inorganic carbonates could explain the increased oxygen depletion at the diffuse-medium-to-molecular-cloud transition which Jones \& Ysard associated with unobserved organic carbonates or materials with a C:O ratio of 1:3.
#### Modelling reflected polarised light from close-in giant exoplanet  WASP-96b using PolHEx (Polarisation of Hot Exoplanets)

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Polarisation of Hot Exoplanets (PolHEx) code, for modelling the polarised reflection spectra of close-in exoplanets which are assumed to be tidally locked. We use outputs from global climate models (GCMs) combined with kinetic cloud models of hot Jupiter WASP-96b as a base to investigate effects of longitudinal-latitudinal inhomogeneities in the atmosphere. We model flux (F) and degree of linear polarisation (P) as a function of wavelength and planet orbital phase for various model atmospheres. We find different materials and size of cloud particles to impact the reflected flux, particularly the polarisation state. A range of materials are used to form inhomogeneous mixed-material cloud particles (Al2O3, Fe2O3, Fe2SiO4, FeO, Fe, Mg2SiO4, MgO, MgSiO3, SiO2, SiO, TiO2), with Fe2O3, Fe, and FeO the most strongly absorbing species. We find that a smaller average particle size and narrower size distribution around the cooler morning terminator region leads to different scattering properties to at the warmer evening terminator region. We also find differences in F and P as a function of wavelength and orbital phase for irregularly shaped compared to spherical cloud particles. This work highlights the importance of including polarisation state in models and future observations of the reflection spectra of transiting exoplanet atmospheres.
#### Neutron star binaries produced by binary-driven hypernovae, their  mergers, and the link between long and short GRBs

 - **Abstract**
 The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model explains long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with supernovae (SNe) Ic through physical episodes that occur in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion in close orbit. The CO core collapse triggers the cataclysmic event, originating the SN and a newborn NS (hereafter $\nu$NS) at its center. The $\nu$NS and the NS accrete SN matter. BdHNe are classified based on the NS companion fate and the GRB energetics, mainly determined by the orbital period. In BdHNe I, the orbital period is of a few minutes, so the accretion causes the NS to collapse into a Kerr black hole (BH), explaining GRBs of energies $>10^{52}$ erg. BdHN II, with longer periods of tens of minutes, yields a more massive but stable NS, accounting for GRBs of $10^{50}$--$10^{52}$ erg. BdHNe III have still longer orbital periods (e.g., hours), so the NS companion has a negligible role, which explains GRBs with a lower energy release of $<10^{50}$ erg. BdHN I and II might remain bound after the SN, so they could form NS-BH and binary NS (BNS), respectively. In BdHN III, the SN likely disrupts the system. We perform numerical simulations of BdHN II to compute the characteristic parameters of the BNS left by them, their mergers, and the associated short GRBs. We obtain the mass of the central remnant, whether it is likely to be a massive NS or a BH, the conditions for disk formation and its mass, and the event's energy release. The role of the NS nuclear equation of state is outlined.
#### Periodic interstellar scintillation variations of PSRs~J0613$-$0200 and  J0636+5128 associated with the Local Bubble shell

 - **Abstract**
 Annual variations of interstellar scintillation can be modelled to constrain parameters of the ionized interstellar medium. If a pulsar is in a binary system, then investigating the orbital parameters is possible through analysis of the orbital variation of scintillation. In observations carried out from 2011 January to 2020 August by the European Pulsar Timing Array radio telescopes, PSRs~J0613$-$0200 and J0636+5128 show strong annual variations in their scintillation velocity, while the former additionally exhibits an orbital fluctuation. Bayesian theory and Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo methods are used to interpret these periodic variations. We assume a thin and anisotropic scattering screen model, and discuss the mildly and extremely anisotropic scattering cases. PSR~J0613$-$0200 is best described by mildly anisotropic scattering, while PSR~J0636+5128 exhibits extremely anisotropic scattering. We measure the distance, velocity and degree of anisotropy of the scattering screen for our two pulsars, finding that scattering screen distances from Earth for PSRs~J0613$-$0200 and J0636+5128 are 316$^{+28}_{-20}$\,pc and 262$^{+96}_{-38}$\,pc, respectively. The positions of these scattering screens are coincident with the shell of the Local Bubble towards both pulsars. These associations add to the growing evidence of the Local Bubble shell as a dominant region of scattering along many sightlines.
#### Origin of Life Molecules in the Atmosphere After Big Impacts on the  Early Earth

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of life on Earth would benefit from a prebiotic atmosphere that produced nitriles, like HCN, which enable ribonucleotide synthesis. However, geochemical evidence suggests that Hadean air was relatively oxidizing with negligible photochemical production of prebiotic molecules. These paradoxes are resolved by iron-rich asteroid impacts that transiently reduced the entire atmosphere, allowing nitriles to form in subsequent photochemistry. Here, we investigate impact-generated reducing atmospheres using new time-dependent, coupled atmospheric chemistry and climate models, which account for gas-phase reactions and surface-catalysis. The resulting H$_2$-, CH$_4$- and NH$_3$-rich atmospheres persist for millions of years, until hydrogen escapes to space. HCN and HCCCN production and rainout to the surface can reach $10^9$ molecules cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in hazy atmospheres with a mole ratio of $\mathrm{CH_4} / \mathrm{CO_2} > 0.1$. Smaller $\mathrm{CH_4} / \mathrm{CO_2}$ ratios produce HCN rainout rates $< 10^5$ molecules cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and negligible HCCCN. The minimum impactor mass that creates atmospheric $\mathrm{CH_4} / \mathrm{CO_2} > 0.1$ is $4 \times 10^{20}$ to $5 \times 10^{21}$ kg (570 to 1330 km diameter), depending on how efficiently iron reacts with a steam atmosphere, the extent of atmospheric equilibration with an impact-induced melt pond, and the surface area of nickel that catalyzes CH$_4$ production. Alternatively, if steam permeates and deeply oxidizes crust, impactors $\sim 10^{20}$ kg could be effective. Atmospheres with copious nitriles have $> 360$ K surface temperatures, perhaps posing a challenge for RNA longevity, although cloud albedo can produce cooler climates. Regardless, post-impact cyanide can be stockpiled and used in prebiotic schemes after hydrogen has escaped to space.
#### Numerical simulation of photospheric emission in long gamma-ray bursts:  prompt correlations, spectral shapes, and polarizations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10023
 - **Abstract**
 We explore the properties of photospheric emission in the context of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) using three numerical models that combine relativistic hydrodynamical simulations and Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculations in three dimensions. Our simulations confirm that the photospheric emission gives rise to correlations between the spectral peak energy and luminosity that agree with the observed Yonetoku, Amati, and Golenetskii correlations. It is also shown that the spectral peak energy and luminosity correlate with the bulk Lorentz factor, as indicated in the literature. On the other hand, synthetic spectral shapes tend to be narrower than those of the observations. The result indicates that an additional physical process that can provide non-thermal broadening is needed to reproduce the spectral features. Furthermore, the polarization analysis finds that, while the degree of polarization is low for the emission from the jet core ($\Pi < 4~\%$), it tends to increase with the viewing angle outside the core and can be as high as $\Pi \sim 20-40~\%$ in an extreme case. This suggests that the typical GRBs show systematically low polarization compared to softer, dimmer counterparts (X-ray-rich GRBs and X-ray flashes). Interestingly, our simulations indicate that photospheric emission exhibits large temporal variation in the polarization position angle ($\Delta \psi \sim 90^{\circ}$), which may be compatible with those inferred in observations. A notable energy dependence of the polarization property is another characteristic feature found in the current study. Particularly, the difference in the position angle among different energy bands can be as large as $\sim 90^{\circ}$.
#### Characterization of the ejecta from NASA/DART impact on Dimorphos:  observations and Monte Carlo models

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA/DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecraft successfully crashed on Dimorphos, the secondary component of the binary (65803) Didymos system. Following the impact, a large dust cloud was released, and a long-lasting dust tail was developed. We have extensively monitored the dust tail from the ground and from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We provide a characterization of the ejecta dust properties, i.e., particle size distribution and ejection speeds, ejection geometric parameters, and mass, by combining both observational data sets, and by using Monte Carlo models of the observed dust tail. The differential size distribution function that best fits the imaging data was a broken power-law, having a power index of --2.5 for particles of r$\le$ 3 mm, and of --3.7 for larger particles. The particles range in sizes from 1 $\mu$m up to 5 cm. The ejecta is characterized by two components, depending on velocity and ejection direction. The northern component of the double tail, observed since October 8th 2022, might be associated to a secondary ejection event from impacting debris on Didymos, although it is also possible that this feature results from the binary system dynamics alone. The lower limit to the total dust mass ejected is estimated at $\sim$6$\times$10$^6$ kg, half of this mass being ejected to interplanetary space.
