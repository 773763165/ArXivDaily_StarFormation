 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the imprints of accretion and dynamical friction on the gravitational-wave signals emitted by binary black holes embedded in a scalar dark matter cloud. As a key feature in this work, we focus on scalar fields with a repulsive self-interaction that balances against the self-gravity of the cloud. To a first approximation, the phase of the gravitational-wave signal receives extra correction terms at $-4$PN and $-5.5$PN orders, relative to the prediction of vacuum general relativity, due to accretion and dynamical friction, respectively. Future observations by LISA and B-DECIGO have the potential to detect these effects for a large range of scalar masses~$m_\mathrm{DM}$ and self-interaction couplings~$\lambda_4$; observations by ET and Advanced~LIGO could also detect these effects, albeit in a more limited region of parameter space. Crucially, we find that even if a dark matter cloud has a bulk density~$\rho_0$ that is too dilute to be detected via the effects of dynamical friction, the imprints of accretion could still be observable because it is controlled by the independent scale $\rho_a = 4 m_{\rm DM}^4 c^3/(3 \lambda_4 \hbar^3)$. In the models we consider, the infalling dark matter increases in density up to this characteristic scale $\rho_a$ near the Schwarzschild radius, which sets the accretion rate and its associated impact on the gravitational~waveform.
#### JWST/NIRSpec Observations of the Planetary Mass Companion TWA 27B

 - **Abstract**
 We present 1-5um spectroscopy of the young planetary mass companion TWA 27B (2M1207B) performed with NIRSpec on board the James Webb Space Telescope. In these data, the fundamental band of CH_4 is absent and the fundamental band of CO is weak. The nondetection of CH_4 reinforces a previously observed trend of weaker CH_4 with younger ages among L dwarfs, which has been attributed to enhanced non-equilibrium chemistry among young objects. The weakness of CO may reflect an additional atmospheric property that varies with age, such as the temperature gradient or cloud thickness. We are able to reproduce the broad shape of the spectrum with an ATMO cloudless model that has T=1300 K, non-equilibrium chemistry, and a temperature gradient reduction caused by fingering convection. However, the fundamental bands of CH_4 and CO are somewhat stronger in the model. In addition, the model temperature of 1300 K is higher than expected from evolutionary models given the luminosity and age of TWA 27B (T=1200 K). Previous models of young L-type objects suggest that the inclusion of clouds could potentially resolve these issues; it remains to be seen whether cloudy models can provide a good fit to the 1-5um data from NIRSpec. TWA 27B exhibits emission in Paschen transitions and the He I triplet at 1.083um, which are signatures of accretion that provide the first evidence of a circumstellar disk. We have used the NIRSpec data to estimate the bolometric luminosity of TWA 27B (log L/L_sun=-4.466+/-0.014), which implies a mass of 5-6 MJup according to evolutionary models.
#### FacetClumps: A Facet-based Molecular Clump Detection Algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive understanding of molecular clumps is essential for investigating star formation. We present an algorithm for molecular clump detection, called FacetClumps. This algorithm uses a morphological approach to extract signal regions from the original data. The Gaussian Facet model is employed to fit the signal regions, which enhances the resistance to noise and the stability of the algorithm in diverse overlapping areas. The introduction of the extremum determination theorem of multivariate functions offers theoretical guidance for automatically locating clump centers. To guarantee that each clump is continuous, the signal regions are segmented into local regions based on gradient, and then the local regions are clustered into the clump centers based on connectivity and minimum distance to identify the regional information of each clump. Experiments conducted with both simulated and synthetic data demonstrate that FacetClumps exhibits great recall and precision rates, small location error and flux loss, a high consistency between the region of detected clump and that of simulated clump, and is generally stable in various environments. Notably, the recall rate of FacetClumps in the synthetic data, which comprises $^{13}CO$ ($J = 1-0$) emission line of the MWISP within $11.7^{\circ} \leq l \leq 13.4^{\circ}$, $0.22^{\circ} \leq b \leq 1.05^{\circ}$ and 5 km s$^{-1}$ $\leq v \leq$ 35 km s$^{-1}$ and simulated clumps, reaches 90.2\%. Additionally, FacetClumps demonstrates satisfactory performance when applied to observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar amides have attracted significant attentions as they are potential precursors for a wide variety of organics essential to life. However, our current understanding of their formation in space is heavily based on observations in star-forming regions and hence the chemical networks lack the constraints on their early origin. In this work, unbiased sensitive spectral surveys with IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes are used to systematically study a number of amides towards a quiescent Galactic Centre molecular cloud, G+0.693-0.027. We report the first detection of acetamide (CH3C(O)NH2) and trans-N-methylformamide (CH3NHCHO) towards this cloud. In addition, with the wider frequency coverage of the survey, we revisited the detection of formamide (NH2CHO) and urea (carbamide; NH2C(O)NH2), which had been reported previously towards G+0.693-0.027. Our results are compared with those present in the literature including recent laboratory experiments and chemical models. We find constant abundance ratios independently of the evolutionary stages, suggesting that amides related chemistry is triggered in early evolutionary stages of molecular cloud and remain unaffected by the warm-up phase during the star formation process. Although a correlation between more complex amides and NH2CHO have been suggested, alternative formation routes involving other precursors such as acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO) and methylamine (CH3NH2) may also contribute to the production of amides. Observations of amides together with these species towards a larger sample of sources can help to constrain the amide chemistry in the interstellar medium.
#### GMCs and their Type classification in M74: Toward understanding star  formation and cloud evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in M74 (NGC 628) obtained by the PHANGS project. We applied the GMC Types according to the activity of star formation: Type I without star formation, Type II with H$\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{H\alpha}}$) smaller than $10^{37.5} \mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and Type III with $L_{\mathrm{H\alpha}}$ greater than $10^{37.5} \mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. In total, 432 GMCs were identified, where the individual GMC Types are 65, 203, and 164, for Type I, Type II, and Type III, respectively. The size and mass of the GMCs range from 23 - 237 pc and $10^{4.9}$ - $10^{7.1}$ M$_{\odot}$, showing a trend that mass and radius increase from Type I to II to III. Clusters younger than 4 Myr and HII regions are found to be concentrated within 150 pc of a GMC, indicating a tight association of these young objects with the GMCs. The virial ratio tends to decrease from Type I to III, indicating that Type III GMCs are most relaxed gravitationally among the three. We interpret that GMCs evolve from Type I to III, as previously found in the LMC. The evolutionary timescales of the three Types are estimated to be 2 Myr, 6 Myr, and 4 Myr, respectively, on a steady state assumption, where we assume the timescale of Type III is equal to the age of the associated clusters, indicating a GMC lifetime of 12 Myr or longer. Chevance et al. (2020) investigated GMCs using the same PHANGS dataset of M74, while these authors did not define a GMC, reaching an evolutionary picture with a 20 Myr duration of the non-star forming phase, five times longer than 4 Myr. We compare the present results with those by Chevance et al. (2020) and argue that defining individual GMCs is essential to understanding GMC evolution.
