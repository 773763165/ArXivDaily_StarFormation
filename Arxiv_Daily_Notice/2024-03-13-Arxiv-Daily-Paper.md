#### The Peak Frequency and Luminosity of Synchrotron Emitting Shocks: from  Non-Relativistic to Ultra-Relativistic Explosions

 - **Abstract**
 Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events -- it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well-observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical `equipartition' framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for trans-relativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to non-relativistic, trans-relativistic, and ultra-relativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and in particular -- that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional non-relativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model -- that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity -- and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).
#### On the survival of the long-lived inner disk of PDS 70

 - **Abstract**
 PDS 70 remains as the best laboratory to investigate the influence of giant planet formation on the structure of the parental disk. One of the most intriguing discoveries is the detection of a resolved inner disk from ALMA observations, extending up to the orbit of PDS 70b. This inner disk is challenging to explain because most of the dust particles are expected to be trapped at the outer edge of the gap open by PDS 70b and PDS 70c. By performing dust evolution models and radiative transfer simulations that match the gas disk masses obtained from recent thermochemical models of PDS 70, we find that when the minimum grain size in the models is larger than 0.1$\mu$m, there is an efficient filtration of dust particles, and the inner disk is depleted during the first million-year of dust evolution. Therefore, to maintain an inner disk, the minimum grain size in the models needs to be smaller than 0.1$\mu$m. Only when grains are that small, they are diffused and dragged along with the gas throughout the planets' gap. The small grains transported in the inner disk grow and drift therein, but the constant reservoir of dust particles that are trapped in the outer edge of the gap and that are continuously fragmenting allows refilling the inner disk on million-year timescales. Our flux predictions at millimetre wavelength of these models agree with ALMA observations. These models predict a spectral index of 3.2 in the outer disk and 3.6 in the inner disk. Our simple analytical calculations show what the inner disk water emission recently observed with JWST may originate from these ice-coated small grains that flow through the gap, grow and drift towards the innermost disk regions, reaching the water snowline. These models may mirror the history and evolution of our Solar System where Jupiter and Saturn played a crucial role shaping the architecture and properties of planets in our Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation during the early stages of high-mass star formation is crucial for understanding the formation of high-mass clusters. We investigated fragmentation within thirty-nine high-mass star-forming clumps as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Considering projection effects, we have estimated core separations for 839 cores identified from the continuum emission and found mean values between 0.08 and 0.32 pc within each clump. We find compatibility of the observed core separations and masses with the thermal Jeans length and mass, respectively. We also present sub-clump structures revealed by the 7 m-array continuum emission. Comparison of the Jeans parameters using clump and sub-clump densities with the separation and masses of gravitationally bound cores suggests that they can be explained by clump fragmentation, implying the simultaneous formation of sub-clumps and cores within rather than a step-by-step hierarchical fragmentation. The number of cores in each clump positively correlates with the clump surface density and the number expected from the thermal Jeans fragmentation. We also find that the higher the fraction of protostellar cores, the larger the dynamic range of the core mass, implying that the cores are growing in mass as the clump evolves. The ASHES sample exhibits various fragmentation patterns: aligned, scattered, clustered, and sub-clustered. Using the Q-parameter, which can help to distinguish between centrally condensed and subclustered spatial core distributions, we finally find that in the early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation, cores tend to follow a subclustered distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute in detail the absorption optical depth for astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons interacting with solar photons to produce electron positron pairs. This effect is greatest for $\gamma$-ray sources at small angular distances from the Sun, reaching optical depths as high as $\tau_{\gamma\gamma}\sim 10^{-2}$. We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in $\tau_{\gamma\gamma}$ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of $\gamma$-ray sources near the Sun at $\gtrsim20$ TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.

 - **Abstract**
 To provide constraints on the chemical processes responsible for the observed columns of organic species, we used NOEMA to observe the sight line toward NRAO150 in the 2mm spectral window. We targeted the low excitation lines of o-H2CO 2(1,1)-1(1,0) and p-H2CO 2(0,2)-1(0,1) as well as the nearby transitions of CS(3-2) and c-C3H2. We combined these data with previous observations to determine the excitation conditions, column densities, and abundances relative to H2 in the different velocity components. We performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations including collision cross sections with ortho and para H2 and with electrons. New collision cross sections with electrons were computed for ortho and para formaldehyde. The c-C3H2 line profiles are very similar to those of HCO+ and CCH, while the CS absorption features are narrower and mostly concentrated in two main velocity components at V = -17 and -10 km/s. H2CO absorption lines present an intermediate pattern with absorption in all velocity components but larger opacities in the two main velocity components. The ortho-to-para ratios of H2CO and c-C3H2 are consistent with the statistical value of 3. While the excitation temperature of all c-C3H2 velocity components is consistent with the CMB, the two strong components detected in CS show a clear excess over the CMB indicating that CS resides at higher densities than other species along this particular sightline, n(H2) ~ 2500 cm-3 while n(H2) < 500 cm-3 for the other velocity components. We detected faint absorption from o-H213CO and C34S allowing us to derive isotopic ratios: o-H2CO/o-H213CO = 61 and C32S/C34S = 24. The excitation of the 4.8GHz line of formaldehyde is sensitive to the electron fraction and its excitation temperature is predicted to be lower than the CMB at low and moderate electron fractions, x(e)< 6E-5, and to rise above the CMB at high electron fractions, > 1e-4.
#### HST Survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster in ACS/Visible and WFC3/IR Bands.  IV. A Bayesian multicolor study of stellar parameters in the ONC

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.
#### Shrinkage MMSE estimators of covariances beyond the zero-mean and  stationary variance assumptions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07104
 - **Abstract**
 We tackle covariance estimation in low-sample scenarios, employing a structured covariance matrix with shrinkage methods. These involve convexly combining a low-bias/high-variance empirical estimate with a biased regularization estimator, striking a bias-variance trade-off. Literature provides optimal settings of the regularization amount through risk minimization between the true covariance and its shrunk counterpart. Such estimators were derived for zero-mean statistics with i.i.d. diagonal regularization matrices accounting for the average sample variance solely. We extend these results to regularization matrices accounting for the sample variances both for centered and non-centered samples. In the latter case, the empirical estimate of the true mean is incorporated into our shrinkage estimators. Introducing confidence weights into the statistics also enhance estimator robustness against outliers. We compare our estimators to other shrinkage methods both on numerical simulations and on real data to solve a detection problem in astronomy.
#### To Be or not to Be: the role of rotation in modeling Galactic Be X-ray  Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are crucial in understanding high-mass X-ray binaries, featuring a rapidly rotating Be star and a neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from the Be star's decretion disk. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the POSYDON BPS code, employing pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling a detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a bimodal rotational distribution of Be-XRB-like systems, in excellent agreement with literature values. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we find that the majority of Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT (beta ~ 0.15). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study on the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system (with a modest initial planet semi-major axis ratio, $a_1/a_2=0.6-0.8$) experiences stellar flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving-planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs as a function of the pericenter separation of the flyby (in units of the initial planet semi-major axis), and use them to derive the analytical expressions that can be used to compute the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar, while the rate for CPs is a factor of a few smaller. The formation fraction of free-floating BPs depends strongly on $a_1/a_2$ of the initial systems and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than $1\%$ (for systems with $a_1/a_2=0.8$) and typically much smaller ($\lesssim 0.2\%$ for $a_1/a_2\lesssim 0.7$). The fraction remains less than $1\%$ when considering $4M_{\rm J}$ planets. Overall, when averaging over all possible flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than $0.1\%$ of that for FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions of SSPs, CPs and (rare) free-floating BPs. These results can find applications in future studies of exotic planets and planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.
#### Predicting the Scaling Relations between the Dark Matter Halo Mass and  Observables from Generalised Profiles I: Kinematic Tracers

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between a dark matter halo's mass profile and measures of the velocity dispersion of kinematic tracers within its gravitational potential. By predicting the scaling relation of the halo mass with the aperture velocity dispersion, $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$, we present the expected form and dependence of this halo mass tracer on physical parameters within our analytic halo model: parameterised by the halo's negative inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, its concentration parameter, $c$, and its velocity anisotropy parameter, $\beta$. For these idealised halos, we obtain a general solution to the Jeans equation, which is projected over the line of sight and averaged within an aperture to form the corresponding aperture velocity dispersion profile. Through dimensional analysis, the $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relation is devised explicitly in terms of analytical bounds for these aperture velocity dispersion profiles: allowing constraints to be placed on this relation for motivated parameter choices. We predict the $M_{200} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ and $M_{500} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relations, each with an uncertainty of $60.5\%$ and $56.2\%$, respectively. These halo mass estimates are found to be weakly sensitive to the halo's concentration and mass scale, and most sensitive to the size of the aperture radius in which the aperture velocity dispersion is measured, the maximum value for the halo's inner slope, and the minimum and maximum values of the velocity anisotropy. Our results show that a halo's structural and kinematic profiles impose only a minor uncertainty in estimating its mass. Consequently, spectroscopic surveys aimed at constraining the halo mass using kinematic tracers can focus on characterising other, more complex sources of uncertainty and observational systematics.

 - **Abstract**
 Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space mission to explore the Sun and solar atmosphere with seven multi-wavelength payloads, with Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) being the prime payload. It is an internally occulted coronagraph with four channels to image the Sun at 5000 \AA~ in the field of view 1.05 - 3 \rsun, and to pursue spectroscopy at 5303 \AA, 7892 \AA~ and 10747 \AA~ channels in the FOV (1.05 - 1.5 \rsun). In addition, spectropolarimetry is planned at 10747 \AA~ channel. Therefore, VELC has three sCMOS detectors and one InGaAs detector. In this article, we aim to describe the technical details and specifications of the detectors achieved by way of thermo-vacuum calibration at the CREST campus of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India. Furthermore, we report the estimated conversion gain, full-well capacity, and readout noise at different temperatures. Based on the numbers, it is thus concluded that it is essential to operate the sCMOS detectors and InGaAs detectors at $-5^{\circ}$ and $-17^{\circ}$ C, respectively, at the spacecraft level.
#### Predicting the Slowing of Stellar Differential Rotation by  Instability-Driven Turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 Differentially rotating stars and planets transport angular momentum internally due to turbulence at rates that have long been a challenge to predict reliably. We develop a self-consistent saturation theory, using a statistical closure approximation, for hydrodynamic turbulence driven by the axisymmetric Goldreich--Schubert--Fricke (GSF) instability at the stellar equator with radial differential rotation. This instability arises when fast thermal diffusion eliminates the stabilizing effects of buoyancy forces in a system where a stabilizing entropy gradient dominates over the destabilizing angular momentum gradient. Our turbulence closure invokes a dominant three-wave coupling between pairs of linearly unstable eigenmodes and a near-zero frequency, viscously damped eigenmode that features latitudinal jets. We derive turbulent transport rates of momentum and heat, and provide them in analytic forms. Such formulae, free of tunable model parameters, are tested against direct numerical simulations; the comparison shows good agreement. They improve upon prior quasi-linear or ``parasitic saturation" models containing a free parameter. Given model correspondences, we also extend this theory to heat and compositional transport for axisymmetric thermohaline instability-driven turbulence in certain regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Upflows and downflows at active region (AR) boundaries have been frequently observed with spectroscopic observations at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands. In this paper, we report the coexistence of upflows and downflows at the AR boundaries with imaging observations from the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). With their observations from 2022 September 21 to 2022 September 30, we find 17 persistent opposite flows occurring along the AR coronal loops. The upflows are prominent in the AIA 193 \AA images with a velocity of 50-200 km/s, while the downflows are best seen in the SUTRI 465 \AA and AIA 131 \AA images with a slower velocity of tens of kilometers per second (characteristic temperatures (log T(K)) for 193 \AA, 465 \AA and 131 \AA are 6.2, 5.7, 5.6, respectively). We also analyze the center-to-limb variation of the velocities for both upflows and downflows. The simultaneous observations of downflows and upflows can be explained by the chromosphere-corona mass-cycling process, in which the localized chromospheric plasma is impulsively heated to coronal temperature forming a upflow and then these upflows experience radiative cooling producing a downflow with the previously heated plasma returning to the lower atmosphere. In particular, the persistent downflows seen by SUTRI provide strong evidence of the cooling process in the mass cycle. For upflows associated with open loops, part of the plasma is able to escape outward and into the heliosphere as solar wind.

 The NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has returned petabytes of lunar high spatial resolution surface imagery over the past decade, impractical for humans to fully review manually. Here we develop an automated method using a deep generative visual model that rapidly retrieves scientifically interesting examples of LRO surface imagery representing the first planetary image anomaly detector. We give quantitative experimental evidence that our method preferentially retrieves anomalous samples such as notable geological features and known human landing and spacecraft crash sites. Our method addresses a major capability gap in planetary science and presents a novel way to unlock insights hidden in ever-increasing remote sensing data archives, with numerous applications to other science domains. We publish our code and data along with this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Although there is abundant and diverse observational evidence in support of white dwarf stars hosting planets or debris disks which form in the catastrophic destruction of various planetary bodies, the key processes that explain these observations are still being intensely investigated. The study of white dwarf planetary systems offers a unique perspective on exo-solar composition, that cannot be obtained by any other means. This chapter describes the various observational techniques that are used in order to find and characterize exo-planets and debris disks around white dwarfs. In turn, it discusses how to theoretically interpret these observations by surveying an array of various research tools and models currently employed in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce FLAME, a machine learning algorithm designed to fit Voigt profiles to HI Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption lines using deep convolutional neural networks. FLAME integrates two algorithms: the first determines the number of components required to fit Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, and the second calculates the Doppler parameter $b$, the HI column density N$_{\rm HI}$, and the velocity separation of individual components. For the current version of FLAME, we trained it on low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forests observed with the Far Ultraviolet gratings of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Drawing on this data, we trained FLAME on $\sim$ $10^6$ simulated Voigt profiles, forward-modeled to Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines observed with HST-COS, to classify lines as either single or double components and then determine Voigt profile fitting parameters. FLAME shows impressive accuracy on the simulated data by identifying more than 98% (90%) of single (double) component lines. It determines $b$ values within $\approx \pm{8}~(15)$ km s$^{-1}$ and log $N_{\rm HI}/ {\rm cm}^2$ values within $\approx \pm 0.3~(0.8)$ for 90% of the single (double) component lines. However, when applied to real data, FLAME's component classification accuracy drops by $\sim$ 10%. Despite this, there is a reasonable agreement between the $b$ and N$_{\rm HI}$ distributions obtained from traditional Voigt profile fitting methods and FLAME's predictions. Our mock HST-COS data analysis, designed to emulate real data parameters, demonstrated that FLAME could achieve consistent accuracy comparable to its performance with simulated data. This finding suggests that the drop in FLAME's accuracy when used on real data primarily arises from the difficulty of replicating the full complexity of real data in the training sample.

 - **Abstract**
 The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket payload flew for the second time on 2014 December 11. To enable direct Hard X-Ray (HXR) imaging spectroscopy, FOXSI makes use of grazing-incidence replicated focusing optics combined with fine-pitch solid-state detectors. FOXSI's first flight provided the first HXR focused images of the Sun. For FOXSI's second flight several updates were made to the instrument including updating the optics and detectors as well as adding a new Solar Aspect and Alignment System (SAAS). This paper provides an overview of these updates as well as a discussion of their measured performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A compatible with shaping by at least two, and more likely more than four, pairs of opposite jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae. Using an old X-ray map of argon, we identify seven pairs of opposite morphological features that we connect with lines that cross each other at the same point on the plane of the sky. The opposite morphological features include protrusions, clumps, filaments, and funnels in the main SNR shell. In addition to these seven symmetry axes, we find two tentative symmetry axes (lines). These lines form a point-symmetric wind-rose. We place this point-symmetric wind-rose on a new JWST and X-ray images of Cassiopeia A. We find other morphological features and one more symmetry axis that strengthen the identified point-symmetric morphology. Not all symmetry axes correspond to jets; e.g., some clumps are formed by the compression of ejecta between two jet-inflated lobes (bubbles). The robust point-symmetric morphology in the iconic Cassiopeia A SNR strongly supports the JJEM and poses a severe challenge to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 AstroSat observed transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 for a total duration of 135 ks during its 2022 outburst. The source traced a complete 'Z' shaped structure in the hardness intensity diagram (HID) during the observation. The source exhibited an extended horizontal branch and a short-dipping flaring branch in the HID. We find that most suitable spectral model comprises emission from a standard multi-color accretion disk and Comptonized radiation from a hot central corona. The observed disk component is cool having temperature in the range of 0.3-0.4 keV and truncated far ( ~100 - 520 km) from the compact object. The Compton corona has optical depth in the range of 3.3-5 and temperature in the range of 3.3-4.9 keV. The disk and corona flux as well as truncation radius varies significantly along the HID. We discuss the possible scenarios to explain the relationship between spectral evolution and motion of the source along the HID. The timing analysis revealed horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) in the frequency range 34-60 Hz. The frequency and rms strength of HBO vary systematically as the source moves along the horizontal branch (HB). The observed correlation of HBO properties with the position on the HB is similar to that reported previously in this source using \textit{RXTE} data during the 2006 outburst of the source. The source also showed NBOs with frequency $\sim$ 6.7 Hz in the middle and lower normal branch. The energy dependent study of the HBO properties suggests that the HBO is stronger in the higher energy band. We also observed very-low frequency noise (VLFN) and band limited noise (BLN) components in the power-density spectra. The break frequency of BLN component was found to be tightly correlated with the HBO frequency. We discuss possible models to explain the origin and nature of the observed features in the PDS.

 - **Abstract**
 Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of $\sim$100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of ten new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than $\sim$1300$\,$d. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4 per cent for SC and 12 per cent for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two datasets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component's mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which dataset is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent preprint, Fernando et al. (2024) used public data from infrasound stations to constrain the localization of the fireball of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 (IM1) bolide. The analysis inferred a 90-percent-confidence ellipse with semi-minor and semi-major axes of 186 and 388 km, respectively. This large error ellipse includes the much better localization box derived by sensors aboard U.S. Government satellites which detected the fireball light. At the fireball's peak brightness, the CNEOS localization box documented by NASA/JPL measures 11.112km on a side and is centered on a latitude of 1.3S and a longitude of 147.6E. Here, we point out that the recent expedition to retrieve materials from IM1's site (Loeb et al. 2024a,b,c) surveyed a region of tens of km around the CNEOS box center, and was not dictated by the data studied by Fernando et al. (2024) because of its larger uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.

 - **Abstract**
 The easiest exoplanets to detect are those that orbit very close to their hoststars. As a result, even though these planets are quite rare, they represent amajor fraction of the current exoplanet population. A side-effect of theproximity between the planet and the star is that the two have strong mutualinteractions through a number of physical processes. One of the most importantof these processes is tides. Tides are thought to shape the orbits of close-inexoplanets, heat the planet making its radius expand, and even drive someplanets to spiral into their host stars. This chapter briefly introduces thebasics of tidal physics and describes the various fingerprints tides leavewithin the observed exoplanet population.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal dissipation in a celestial body can be used to probe its internal structure. Tides govern the orbital evolution of binary systems and therefore constraints on the interior of binary system members can be derived by knowing the age and tidal state of the binary system. For asteroids, age estimates are challenging due to a lack of direct observation of their surface. However, the age of asteroid pairs formed by rotational fission of a parent body can be derived from dynamical modeling, and as such can be used to constrain the age of binary systems existing within asteroid pairs.We study 13 binary asteroid systems existing in asteroid pairs by modeling their tidal locking and eccentricity damping timescales from tidal dissipation in the primaries and secondaries. We consider the impact of thermal torques on these timescales from the YORP and BYORP effects. The resulting constraints on the tidal dissipation ratio Q/k2 are compared to monolithic and rubble pile asteroid theories, showing that all secondaries are consistent with rubble piles with regolith layers greater than 3m and suggest that Q/k2 for rubble piles increases with radius. A particular case is the first bound secondary of asteroid (3749) Balam, whose Q/k2 is constrained to be between 2.7x10^4 and 1.4x10^6, consistent with a rubble-pile with a regolith thickness between 30m and 100m.
#### Gapless neutron superfluidity can explain the late time cooling of  transiently accreting neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 The current interpretation of the observed late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries during quiescence requires the suppression of neutron superfluidity in their crust at variance with recent ab initio many-body calculations of dense matter. Focusing on the two emblematic sources KS~1731$-$260 and MXB~1659$-$29, we show that their thermal evolution can be naturally explained by considering the existence of a neutron superflow driven by the pinning of quantized vortices. Under such circumstances, we find that the neutron superfluid can be in a gapless state in which the specific heat is dramatically increased compared to that in the classical BCS state assumed so far, thus delaying the thermal relaxation of the crust. We have performed neutron-star cooling simulations taking into account gapless superfluidity and we have obtained excellent fits to the data thus reconciling astrophysical observations with microscopic theories. The imprint of gapless superfluidity on other observable phenomena is briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 iCOMs are species commonly found in the interstellar medium. They are believed to be crucial seed species for the build-up of chemical complexity in star forming regions as well as our own Solar System. Thus, understanding how their abundances evolve during the star formation process and whether it enriches the emerging planetary system is of paramount importance. We use data from the ALMA Large Program FAUST to study the compact line emission towards the [BHB2007] 11 proto-binary system (sources A and B), where a complex structure of filaments connecting the two sources with a larger circumbinary disk has previously been detected. More than 45 CH3OCHO lines are clearly detected, as well as 8 CH3OCH3 transitions , 1 H2CCO transition and 4 t-HCOOH transitions. We compute the abundance ratios with respect to CH3OH for CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, H2CCO, t-HCOOH (as well as an upper limit for CH3CHO) through a radiative transfer analysis. We also report the upper limits on the column densities of nitrogen bearing iCOMs, N(C2H5CN) and N(C2H3CN). The emission from the detected iCOMs and their precursors is compact and encompasses both protostars, which are separated by only 0.2" (~ 28 au). The integrated intensities tend to align with the Southern filament, revealed by the high spatial resolution observations of the dust emission at 1.3 mm. A PV and 2D analysis are performed on the strongest and uncontaminated CH3OCH3 transition and show three different spatial and velocity regions, two of them being close to 11B (Southern filament) and the third one near 11A. All our observations suggest that the detected methanol, as well as the other iCOMs, are generated by the shocked gas from the incoming filaments streaming towards [BHB2007] 11A and 11B, respectively, making this source one of the few where chemical enrichment of the gas caused by the streaming material is observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet transmission spectra provide rich information about the chemical composition, clouds and temperature structure of exoplanet atmospheres. Most exoplanet transmission spectra only span infrared wavelengths ($\gtrsim$ 1 $\rm{\mu m}$), which can preclude crucial atmospheric information from shorter wavelengths. Here, we explore how retrieved atmospheric parameters from exoplanet transmission spectra change with the addition of optical data. From a sample of 14 giant planets with transit spectra from 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, primarily from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, we apply a free chemistry retrieval to planetary spectra for wavelength ranges of 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, 0.6-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, and 1.1-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$. We analyse the posterior distributions of these retrievals and perform an information content analysis, finding wavelengths below 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$ are necessary to constrain cloud scattering slope parameters ($\log{a}$ and $\gamma$) and alkali species Na and K. There is limited improvement in the constraints on the remaining atmospheric parameters. Across the population, we find limb temperatures are retrieved colder than planetary equilibrium temperatures but have an overall good agreement with Global Circulation Models. As JWST extends to a minimum wavelength of 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$, we demonstrate that exploration into complementing JWST observations with optical HST data is important to further our understanding of aerosol properties and alkali abundances in exoplanet atmospheres.
