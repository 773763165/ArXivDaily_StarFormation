 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the search for astrometric accelerations of stars in $\omega$ Centauri using 13 years of regularly-scheduled {\it Hubble Space Telescope} WFC3/UVIS calibration observations in the cluster core. The high-precision astrometry of $\sim$160\,000 sources was searched for significant deviations from linear proper motion. This led to the discovery of four cluster members and one foreground field star with compelling acceleration patterns. We interpret them as the result of the gravitational pull by an invisible companion and determined preliminary Keplerian orbit parameters, including the companion's mass. {For the cluster members} our analysis suggests periods ranging from 8.8 to 19+ years and dark companions in the mass range of $\sim$0.7 to $\sim$1.4$M_\mathrm{sun}$. At least one companion could exceed the upper mass-boundary of white dwarfs and can be classified as a neutron-star candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Episodic accretion plays an important role during the early phases of star-formation. The main processes responsible for the episodic accretion events remain, however, unclear. Aims: Our main objective is to investigate the properties of FUors and EXors by analysing observational data, along with numerical hydrodynamics simulations of protostellar disks, stellar evolution models of outbursting stars and thermo-chemical models of star-disk systems in the outburst state. Our goal is to get a better understanding of the outburst processes and their respective origin. Methods: We used the radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) to match the dust emission and gas emission lines originating from the environment surrounding the FUor star Re 50 N IRS 1. Our model focusses on the observational data obtained by Herschel and Spitzer while we use archival photometry to complete the spectral energy distribution. Results: The modelling shows that the object is composed of a complex combination of several heating sources with different spatial distribution. Our model uses a massive envelope with an mass infall rate of 1.35 $\times 10^{-5}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ to explain the continuum emission in the (sub-)mm regime. At the same time we fit the CO and $^{13}$CO ladders from 60 \textmu m to 650 \textmu m along with the two [\ion{O}{i}] lines centered at 63.18 and 145.53 \textmu m. To explain the strong CO emission at shorter wavelengths and the oxygen lines, we require a very warm disk due to a high disk accretion rate reaching 6 $\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ and an additional UV field of 3\% of the overall emission to heat the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present microscopic Molecular Dynamics simulations including the efficient Ewald sum procedure to study warm and dense stellar plasmas consisting of finite-size ion charges immerse in a relativistic neutralizing electron gas. For densities typical of Supernova matter and crust in a proto-neutron star, we select a representative single ion composition and obtain the virialized equation of state (vEoS). We scrutinize the finite-size and screening corrections to the Coulomb potential appearing in the virial coefficients $B_2, B_3$ and $B_4$ as a function of temperature. In addition, we study the thermal heat capacity at constant volume, $C_V$, and the generalized Mayer's relation i.e. the difference $C_P-C_V$ with $C_P$ being the heat capacity at constant pressure, obtaining clear features signaling the onset of the liquid-gas phase transition. Our findings show that microscopic simulations reproduce the discontinuity in $C_V$, whose value lies between that of idealized gas and crystallized configurations. We study the pressure isotherms marking the boundary of the metastable region before the gaseous transition takes place. The resulting vEoS displays a behaviour where effective virial coefficients include extra density dependence showing a generalized density-temperature form. As an application we parametrize pressure as a function of density and temperature under the form of an artificial neural network showing the potential of machine learning for future regression analysis in more refined multicomponent approaches. This is of interest to size the importance of these corrections in the liquid-gas phase transition in warm and dense plasma phases contributing to the cooling behaviour of early Supernova phases and proto-neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are catastrophic astrophysical phenomena that occur during the last evolutionary stages of massive stars having initial masses of around 8 M$_{\odot}$ or more. These calamitous events play a pivotal role in enriching our Universe with heavy elements and are also responsible for the birth of Neutron stars and stellar mass Black holes. Knowledge of the possible progenitors of CCSNe is fundamental to understanding these transient events. Additionally, the underlying circumstellar environment around possible progenitors and the physical mechanism powering the light curves of these catastrophic CCSN events also require careful investigations to unveil their nature. The research work within the context of the present thesis is an attempt to investigate the possible progenitors, ambient media around the progenitors, and powering mechanisms behind the light curve of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics, which is primarily designed to incorporate effects of collective neutrino oscillations into neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae and mergers of compact objects. We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\sim 20 \%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatial variations in survey properties due to selection effects generate substantial systematic errors in large-scale structure measurements in optical galaxy surveys on very large scales. On such scales, the statistical sensitivity of optical surveys is also limited by their finite sky coverage. By contrast, gravitational wave (GW) sources appear to be relatively free of these issues, provided the angular sensitivity of GW experiments can be accurately characterized. We quantify the expected cosmological information gain from combining the forecast LSST 3$\times$2pt analysis (combination of three 2-point correlations of galaxy density and weak lensing shear fields) with the large-scale auto-correlation of GW sources from proposed next-generation GW experiments. We find that in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM models, there is no significant improvement in cosmological constraints from combining GW with LSST 3$\times$2pt over LSST alone, due to the large shot noise for the former; however, this combination does enable a $\sim6\%$ constraint on the linear galaxy bias of GW sources. More interestingly, the optical-GW data combination provides tight constraints on models with primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), due to the predicted scale-dependent bias in PNG models on large scales. Assuming that the largest angular scales that LSST will probe are comparable to those in Stage III surveys ($\ell_{\rm min}\sim50$), the inclusion of next-generation GW measurements could improve constraints on the PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ by up to a factor of $\simeq6.6$ compared to LSST alone, yielding $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})=8.5$. These results assume the expected capability of a network of Einstein Telescope-like GW observatories, with a detection rate of $10^6$ events/year. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to different assumptions about future GW detectors as well as different LSST analysis choices.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar detection has become an active research topic in radio astronomy recently. One of the essential procedures for pulsar detection is pulsar candidate sifting (PCS), a procedure of finding out the potential pulsar signals in a survey. However, pulsar candidates are always class-imbalanced, as most candidates are non-pulsars such as RFI and only a tiny part of them are from real pulsars. Class imbalance has greatly damaged the performance of machine learning (ML) models, resulting in a heavy cost as some real pulsars are misjudged. To deal with the problem, techniques of choosing relevant features to discriminate pulsars from non-pulsars are focused on, which is known as {\itshape feature selection}. Feature selection is a process of selecting a subset of the most relevant features from a feature pool. The distinguishing features between pulsars and non-pulsars can significantly improve the performance of the classifier even if the data are highly imbalanced.In this work, an algorithm of feature selection called {\itshape K-fold Relief-Greedy} algorithm (KFRG) is designed. KFRG is a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it filters out some irrelevant features according to their K-fold Relief scores, while in the second stage, it removes the redundant features and selects the most relevant features by a forward greedy search strategy. Experiments on the dataset of the High Time Resolution Universe survey verified that ML models based on KFRG are capable for PCS, correctly separating pulsars from non-pulsars even if the candidates are highly class-imbalanced.
#### NICER views moderate, strong, and extreme photospheric expansion bursts  from the ultracompact X-ray binary 4U 1820$-$30

 - **Abstract**
 Type I X-ray bursts in the ultracompact X-ray binary 4U 1820$-$30 are powered by the unstable thermonuclear burning of hydrogen-deficient material. We report the detection of 15 type I X-ray bursts from 4U 1820$-$30 observed by NICER in between 2017 and 2023. All these bursts occurred in the low state for the persistent flux in the range of $2.5-8\times10^{-9}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$ in 0.1$-$250 keV. The burst spectra during the tail can be well explained by blackbody model. However, for the first $\sim$5 s after the burst onset, the time-resolved spectra showed strong deviations from the blackbody model. The significant improvement of the fit can be obtained by taking into account of the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting-Robterson drag, the extra emission modelled by another blackbody component or by the reflection from the surrounding accretion disk. The reflection model provides a self-consistent and physically motivated explanation. We find that the accretion disk density changed with 0.5 s delay as response to the burst radiation, which indicates the distortion of the accretion disk during X-ray bursts. From the time-resolved spectroscopy, all bursts showed the characteristic of photospheric radius expansion (PRE). We find one superexpansion burst with the extreme photospheric radius $r_{\rm ph}>10^3$ km and blackbody temperature of $\sim 0.2$ keV, thirteen strong PRE bursts for $r_{\rm ph}>10^2$ km, and one moderate PRE burst for $r_{\rm ph}\sim55$ km.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight bosons are attractive dark-matter candidates and appear in various scenarios beyond standard model. They can induce superradiant instabilities around spinning black holes (BHs), extracting the energy and angular momentum from BHs, and then dissipated through monochromatic gravitational radiation, which become promising sources of gravitational wave detectors. In this letter, we focus on massive tensor fields coupled to BHs and compute the stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds emitted by these sources. We then undertake a search for this background within the data from LIGO/Virgo O1$\sim$ O3 runs. Our analysis reveals no discernible evidence of such signals, allowing us to impose stringent limits on the mass range of tensor bosons. Specifically, we exclude the existence of tensor bosons with masses ranging from $4.0\times10^{-14}$ to $2.0\times10^{-12}$ eV at $95\%$ confidence level.
#### AM CVn -- System Parameters and Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 System parameters are re-determined: $M_1=0.86\pm0.18M\odot$, $M_2=0.103\pm0.022M\odot$, $A=1.508\pm 0.100\times 10^{10}$cm, and $i=69\pm3^{\circ}$. The secondary component is a semi-degenerate helium star loosing mass at a rate $\dot M=4.93\pm 1.65\times10^{-9}M\odot/yr$. The accretion disk is sufficiently hot to avoid thermal instability. The orbital light curve recovered from observations made in 1962 shows minimum shifted to phase $\phi=0.50$, corresponding to $O-C=0.0060$d. Together with mimima observed in 1992-99 this implies that the orbital period is increasing at a rate $dP/dt\approx 8.5 \times 10^{-13}$ consistent with predictions involving the emission of gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation flow through an inhomogeneous medium is critical in a wide range of physics and astronomy applications from transport across cloud layers on the earth to the propagation of supernova blast-waves producing UV and X-ray emission in supernovae. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the modeling of inhomogeneous radiation transport, subgrid models developed to capture this often-unresolved physics, and the experiments designed to improve our understanding of these models. We present a series of detailed simulations (both single-clump and multi-clump conditions) probing the dependence on the physical properties of the radiation front (e.g. radiation energy) and material characteristics (specific heat, opacity, clump densities). Unless the radiation pressure is high, the clumps will heat and then expand, effectively cutting off the radiation flow. The expanding winds can also produce shocks that generates high energy emission. We compare our detailed simulations with some of the current subgrid prescriptions, identifying some of the limitations of these current models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Far Ultraviolet (FUV: hereafter 900-1150 A) is a spectral range which contains many of the ground state transitions of common elements but has had limited observational capabilities due to the unique technological requirements to operate in this waveband. Conceptual designs are presented, for high resolution (R > 50,000) echelle spectrographs for CubeSat, SMEX and MIDEX missions, along with comparisons of their performance to past instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the commencement of the first SETI observation in 2019, China's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence program has garnered momentum through domestic support and international collaborations. Several observations targeting exoplanets and nearby stars have been conducted with the FAST. In 2023, the introduction of the Far Neighbour Project(FNP) marks a substantial leap forward, driven by the remarkable sensitivity of the FAST telescope and some of the novel observational techniques. The FNP seeks to methodically detect technosignatures from celestial bodies, including nearby stars, exoplanetary systems, Milky Way globular clusters, and more. This paper provides an overview of the progress achieved by SETI in China and offers insights into the distinct phases comprising the FNP. Additionally, it underscores the significance of this project's advancement and its potential contributions to the field.
#### Accretion flows around spinning compact objects in the post-Newtonian  regime

 - **Abstract**
 We present the structure of a low angular momentum accretion flows around rotating compact objects incorporating relativistic corrections up to the leading post-Newtonian order. To begin with, we formulate the governing post-Newtonian hydrodynamic equations for the mass and energy-momentum flux without imposing any symmetries. However, for the sake of simplicity, we consider the flow to be stationary, axisymmetric, and inviscid. Toward this, we adapt the polytropic equation of state (EoS) and analyze the geometrically thin accretion flow confined to the equatorial plane. The spin-orbit effects manifest themselves in the disk structure. This is a relativistic interaction between the body's spin and the motion of fluid elements inside the gravitational potential of the body. In the present analysis, we focus on global transonic accretion solutions, where a subsonic flow enters far away from the compact object and gradually gains radial velocity as it moves inwards. Thus, the flow becomes supersonic after reaching a certain radius, known as the critical point. For a better understanding of the transonic solutions, we classify the post-Newtonian equations into semi-relativistic (SR), semi-Newtonian (SN), and non-relativistic (NR) limits and compare the accretion solutions and their corresponding flow variables. With these, we find that SR and SN flow are in good agreement all throughout, although they deviate largely from the NR ones. Interestingly, the density profile seems to follow the profile $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$ in the post-Newtonian regime. The present study has the potential to connect Newtonian and GR descriptions of accretion disks.

 We present three-dimensional (3D) maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation at cloud-top level from Doppler-imaging data obtained in the visible domain with JIVE, the second node of the JOVIAL network, which is mounted on the Dunn Solar Telescope at Sunspot, New Mexico. We report on 12 nights of observations between May 4 and May 30, 2018, representing a total of about 80 hours. Firstly, the average zonal wind profile derived from our data is compatible with that derived from cloud-tracking measurements performed on Hubble Space Telescope images obtained in April 2018 from the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program. Secondly, we present the first ever two-dimensional maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation from Doppler measurements. The zonal velocity map highlights well-known atmospheric features, such as the equatorial hot spots and the Great Red Spot (GRS). In addition to zonal winds, we derive meridional and vertical velocity fields from the Doppler data. The motions attributed to vertical flows are mainly located at the boundary between the equatorial belts and tropical zones, which could indicate active motion in theses regions. Qualitatively, these results compare well to recent Juno data that have unveiled the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's wind field. To the contrary, the motions attributed to meridional circulation are very different from what is obtained by cloud tracking, except at the GRS. Because of limitations with data resolution and processing techniques, we acknowledge that our measurement of vertical or meridional flows of Jupiter are still to be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 Novae, explosive events in binary star systems involving a white dwarf and a companion star, offer profound insights into extreme astrophysical conditions. During the eruption of a nova, material accreted onto the white dwarf's surface undergoes a thermonuclear runaway reaction resulting in the ejection of matter into space and the formation of a luminous shell. The classical V5668 Sgr (Nova Sagittarii) was the second and brighter of the two novae in the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It was discovered by John Seach of Chatsworth Island, Australia, on March 15, 2015. In this paper, drawing on data from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the US-based radio astronomy observatory, on V5668 Sgr as well as from research that aggregates data from a range of sources including telescope archives, this study used the Uniform Slab Model and statistical techniques to plot the nova's light and frequency curves and estimate its ejected shell mass and the brightness temperature. These characteristics help us better understand the nova's formation and eruption. The paper presents the light curves in a machine-readable format and provides insight into the behaviour of ionised gas clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Young transiting exoplanets offer a unique opportunity to characterize the atmospheres of fresh and evolving products of planet formation. We present the transmission spectrum of V1298 Tau b; a 23 Myr old warm Jovian sized planet orbiting a pre-main sequence star. We detect a primordial atmosphere with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height and a water vapour absorption at 5$\sigma$ level of significance. We estimate a mass and density upper limit (24$\pm$5$M_{\oplus}$, 0.12gm/$cm^{3}$ respectively). V1298 Tau b is one of the lowest density planets discovered till date. We retrieve a low atmospheric metallicity (logZ=$-0.1^{+0.66}_{-0.72}$ solar), consistent with solar/sub-solar values. Our findings challenge the expected mass-metallicity from core-accretion theory. Our observations can be explained by in-situ formation via pebble accretion together with ongoing evolutionary mechanisms. We do not detect methane, which hints towards a hotter than expected interior from just the formation entropy of this planet. Our observations suggest that V1298 Tau b is likely to evolve into a Neptune/sub-Neptune type of planet.

 - **Abstract**
 We report timing and spectral studies of the high mass X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 using Insight-HXMT observations carried out in 2020 during its out-of-eclipse state. We found significant variations in flux on a time-scale of kilo-seconds, while the hardness (count rate ratio between 10-30 keV and 2-10 keV) remains relatively stable. No evident pulsations were found over a frequency range of $10^{-3}$-2000 Hz. During the spectral analysis, for the first time we took the configuration of different Insight-HXMT detectors' orientations into account, which allows us obtaining reliable results even if a stable contamination exists in the field-of-view. We found that the spectrum could be well described by some phenomenological models that commonly used in accreting pulsars (e.g., a power law with a high energy cutoff) in the energy range of 2-100 keV. We found hints of cyclotron absorption features around ~ 16 keV or/and ~ 50 keV.

 X-ray binary systems consist of a companion star and a compact object in close orbit. Thanks to their copious X-ray emission, these objects have been studied in detail using X-ray spectroscopy and timing. The inclination of these systems is a major uncertainty in the determination of the mass of the compact object using optical spectroscopic methods. In this paper, we present a new method to constrain the inclination of X-ray binaries, which is based on the modeling of the polarization of X-rays photons produced by a compact source and scattered off the companion star. We describe our method and explore the potential of this technique in the specific case of the low mass X-ray binary GS 1826-238 observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) play an important role in galaxy evolution. Binary and triple SMBHs can form after galaxy mergers. A third SMBH may accelerate the SMBH merging process, possibly through the Kozai mechanism. We use N -body simulations to analyze oscillations in the orbital elements of hierarchical triple SMBHs with surrounding star clusters in galaxy centers. We find that SMBH triples spend only a small fraction of time in the hierarchical merger phase (i.e., a binary SMBH with a distant third SMBH perturber). Most of the time, the enclosed stellar mass within the orbits of the innermost or the outermost SMBH is comparable to the SMBH masses, indicating that the influence of the surrounding stellar population cannot be ignored. We search for Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations for which (i) the eccentricity of the inner binary and inclination are both oscillate and are anti-phase or in-phase and (ii) the oscillation period is consistent with EKL timescale. We find that EKL oscillations are short-lived and rare: the triple SMBH spends around 3% of its time in this phase over the ensemble of simulations, reaching around 8% in the best-case scenario. This suggests that the role of the EKL mechanism in accelerating the SMBH merger process may have been overestimated in previous studies. We follow-up with three-body simulations, using initial conditions extracted from the simulation, and the result can to some extent repeat the observed EKL-like oscillations. This comparison provides clues about why those EKL oscillations with perturbing stars are short-lived.

 - **Abstract**
 Modal noise appears due to the non-uniform and unstable distribution of light intensity among the finite number of modes in multimode fibres. It is an important limiting factor in measuring radial velocity precisely by fibre-fed high-resolution spectrographs. The problem can become particularly severe as the fibre's core become smaller and the number of modes that can propagate reduces. Thus, mitigating modal noise in relatively small core fibres still remains a challenge. We present here a novel technique to suppress modal noise. Two movable mirrors in the form of a galvanometer reimage the mode-pattern of an input fibre to an output fibre. The mixing of modes coupled to the output fibre can be controlled by the movement of mirrors applying two sinusoidal signals through a voltage generator. We test the technique for four multimode circular fibres: 10 and 50 micron step-index, 50 micron graded-index, and a combination of 50 micron graded-index and 5:1 tapered fibres (GI50t). We present the results of mode suppression both in terms of the direct image of the output fibre and spectrum of white light obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph. We found that the galvanometer mitigated modal noise in all the tested fibres, but was most useful for smaller core fibres. However, there is a trade-off between the modal noise reduction and light-loss. The GI50t provides the best result with about 60% mitigation of modal noise at a cost of about 5% output light-loss. Our solution is easy to use and can be implemented in fibre-fed spectrographs.

 - **Abstract**
 I review the use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the 1998 discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, as well as the subsequent use of SNe Ia to study the expansion history in more detail, determine the equation-of-state parameter w, and measure the current value of the Hubble constant. This is the lightly edited transcript of a lecture given at the Standard Model at 50 Symposium held at Case Western University, June 1-4, 2018, and thus corresponds to the state of the field in mid-2018; however, a few post-symposium updates were included in 2019. Also, this version includes at the end a brief update (December 2023) on the early-time vs. late-time Hubble tension, which has now reached a level of 5 sigma based on SNe Ia alone and is supported by several other low-redshift determinations of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Planets are surrounded by fractal surfaces (traditionally called Hill spheres), separating the inner zones of long-term stable orbital motion of their satellites from the outer space where the gravitational pull from the Sun takes over. Through this surface, external minor bodies in trajectories loosely co-orbital to a planet can be stochastically captured by the planet without any assistance from external perturbative forces, and can become moons chaotically orbiting the planet for extended periods of time. Using state-of-the-art orbital integrators, we simulate such capture events for Venus, resulting in long-term attachment phases by reversing the forward integration of a moon initially attached to the planet and escaping it after an extended period of time. Although the probability of a long-term chaotic capture from a single encounter is generally low, the high density of co-orbital bodies in the primordial protoplanetary disk makes this outcome possible, if not probable. The early Venus was surrounded by a dusty gaseous disk of its own, which, coupled with the tidal dissipation of the kinetic energy in the moon and the planet, could shrink the initial orbit and stabilize the captured body within the Hill surface. The tidal torque from the moon, for which we use the historical name Neith, gradually brakes the prograde rotation of Venus, and then reverses it, while the orbit continues to decay. Neith eventually reaches the Roche radius and disintegrates, probably depositing most of its material on Venus' surface. Our calculations show that surface density values of about 0.06 kg m$^{-2}$ for the debris disk may be sufficient to stabilize the initial chaotic orbit of Neith and to bring it down within several radii of Venus, where tidal dissipation becomes more efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 The Multipurpose Interferometer Array Pathfinder (MIA), developed from the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR), is a radio astronomical instrument based on interferometry techniques, designed for the detection of radio emission from astronomical sources. Phase one consists of 16 antennas of 5 meters in diameter, with the possibility of increasing their number. In addition, it is equipped with a dual polarization receiver with a bandwidth of 250 MHz, centered at 1325 MHz, and a digitizer and processor for the correlation functions. For the development of this instrument, a three antenna pathfinder is currently being built with its positioning control, radio frequency systems, acquisition and processing stages. This paper will describe the concept design and their current progress for each stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution spectra and spectroastrometric (SA) measurements of fundamental rovibrational CO emission from nine nearby ($\lesssim$300 pc) protoplanetary disks where large inner dust cavities have been observed. The emission line profiles and SA signals are fit with a slab disk model that allows the eccentricity of the disk and intensity of the emission to vary as power laws. Six of the sources are well fit with our model, and three of these sources show asymmetric line profiles that can be fit by adopting a non-zero eccentricity. The three other sources have components in either their line profile or SA signal that are not captured by our disk model. Two of these sources (V892 Tau, CQ Tau) have multi-epoch observations that reveal significant variability. CQ Tau and AB Aur have CO line profiles with centrally-peaked components that are similar to line profiles that have been interpreted as evidence of molecular gas arising from a wide-angle disk wind. Alternatively, emission from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) could also account for this component. The interpretations of these results can be clarified in the future with additional epochs that will test the variability timescale of these SA signals. We discuss the utility of using high-resolution spectroscopy for probing the dynamics of gas in the disk and the scenarios that can give rise to profiles that are not fit with a simple disk model.
