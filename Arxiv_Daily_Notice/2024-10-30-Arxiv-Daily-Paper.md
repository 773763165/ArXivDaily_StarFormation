 - **Abstract**
 The stellar halo of the Milky Way comprises an abundance of chemical signatures from accretion events and \textit{in-situ} evolution, that form an interweaving tapestry in kinematic space. To untangle this, we consider the mixtures of chemical information, in a given region of integral of motion space, as a variant of the blind source separation problem and utilise non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). Specifically, we examine the variation in [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe] distributions of APOGEE DR17 stars across the $(E,L_z)$ plane of the halo. When 2 components are prescribed, the NMF algorithm splits stellar halo into low- and high-energy components in the $(E,L_z)$ plane which approximately correspond to the accreted and \textit{in-situ} halo respectively. We use these two components to define a new boundary between the \textit{in-situ} and the accreted stellar halo. Moreover, we calculate the components fractional contribution to the stellar halo as a function of energy, galactocentric spherical radius, height, and galactocentric cylindrical radius. Using a stellar halo defined by kinematic cuts, we find that the halo transitions from \textit{in-situ} dominated to accretion dominated at $E \approx -1.67 \times 10^5$ (km/s)$^2$ (using the potential in McMillan 2017), and at $(r,z,R) \approx (8.7, 3.0, 8.1)$ kpc. The low-energy component is found to span a range of [Al/Fe] that falls beyond the typically accepted \textit{in-situ} floor of [Al/Fe] $=0$. Upon prescribing more components to the NMF model, we find hints of the existence of overlapping chemical evolution sequences that other techniques struggle to find. We also examine features within these components that resemble known substructures in the halo, such as \textit{Eos} and \textit{Aurora}. This work provides insight into their origin and the part they play in the Milky Way's formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Descriptions of the Galactic Center using Fermi gamma-ray data have so far modeled the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) as a template with fixed spatial morphology or as a linear combination of such templates. Although these templates are informed by various physical expectations, the morphology of the excess is a priori unknown. For the first time, we describe the GCE using a flexible, non-parametric machine learning model -- the Gaussian process (GP). We assess our model's performance on synthetic data, demonstrating that the model can recover the templates used to generate the data. We then fit the \Fermi data with our model in a single energy bin from 2-20 GeV (leaving a spectral GP analysis of the GCE for future work) using a variety of template models of diffuse gamma-ray emission to quantify our fits' systematic uncertainties associated with diffuse emission modeling. We interpret our best-fit GP in terms of GCE templates consisting of an NFW squared template and a bulge component to determine which bulge models can best describe the fitted GP and to what extent the best-fit GP is described better by an NFW squared template versus a bulge template. The best-fit GP contains morphological features that are typically not associated with traditional GCE studies. These include a localized bright source at around $(\ell,b) = (20^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ and a diagonal arm extending Northwest from the Galactic Center. In spite of these novel features, the fitted GP is explained best by a template-based model consisting of the bulge presented in Coleman et al. (2020) and a squared NFW component. Our results suggest that the physical interpretation of the GCE in terms of stellar bulge and NFW-like components is highly sensitive to the assumed morphologies, background models, and the region of the sky used for inference.

          Giant exoplanet composition: Why do the hydrogen-helium equation of state and interior structure matter?

 - **Abstract**
 Revealing the internal composition and structure of giant planets is fundamental for understanding planetary formation. However, the bulk composition can only be inferred through interior models. As a result, advancements in modelling aspects are essential to better characterise the interiors of giant planets. We investigate the effects of model assumptions such as the interior structure and the hydrogen-helium (H-He) equation of state (EOS) on the inferred interiors of giant exoplanets. We first assess these effects on a few test cases and compare H-He EOSs. We then calculate evolution models and infer the planetary bulk metallicity of 45 warm exoplanets, ranging from 0.1 to 10~$M_{\rm J}$. Planets with masses between about 0.2 and 0.6~$M_{\rm J}$ are most sensitive to the H-He EOS. Updating the H-He EOS reduces the inferred heavy-element mass, with an absolute difference in bulk metallicity of up to 13\%. Concentrating heavy elements in a core, rather than distributing them uniformly (and scaling opacities with metallicity), reduces the inferred metallicity (up to 17\%). The assumed internal structure, along with its effect on the envelope opacity, has the greatest effect on the inferred composition of massive planets ($M_{\rm p}>4~M_{\rm J}$). For $M_{\rm p}>0.6~M_{\rm J}$, the observational uncertainties on radii and ages lead to uncertainties in the inferred metallicity (up to 31\%) which are larger than the ones associated with the used H-He EOS and the assumed interior structure. However, for planets with $0.2<M_{\rm p}<0.6~M_{\rm J}$, the theoretical uncertainties are larger. Advancements in equations of state and our understanding of giant planet interior structures combined with accurate measurements of the planetary radius and age are crucial for characterising giant exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium of the Milky Way contains turbulent plasma with structures driven by energetic processes that fuel star formation and shape the evolution of our Galaxy. Radio waves from pulsars are scattered off the small (au-scale and below) structures, resulting in frequency-dependent interference patterns that are modulated in time because of the relative motions of the pulsar, Earth, and plasma. Power spectral analyses of these patterns show parabolic arcs with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of individual structures. Here we report the discovery of at least 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437$-$4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient insterstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 Melnick 34 (Mk 34) is one of the most massive binary systems known and is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the 30 Doradus region. We investigated the impact of this massive system on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) using the optical spectroscopic capabilities of the narrow-field mode (NFM) of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). MUSE-NFM spatially resolved the ISM in the vicinity of Mk 34 with a resolution comparable to that of the HST. The analysis of the [NII]$\lambda$6583 and [SII]$\lambda$6717 emission lines reveals a cone-like structure apparently originating from Mk 34 and extending southeast. Electron density maps and radial velocity measurements of the ISM lines further support an outflow scenario traced by these emissions. While no clear northwestern counterpart to this outflow was observed, we note increased extinction in that direction, towards the R136 cluster. The ISM material along the projected diagonal of the outflow on both sides of Mk 34 shows similar properties in terms of the emission line ratios seen in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram. These results are consistent across two observational epochs. Additionally, we examined the residual maps within a 0.5" radius of Mk 34 after modeling and subtracting the point spread function. The observed variations in the residuals could potentially be linked to Mk 34's known periodic behavior. However, further observations with appropriate cadence are needed to fully monitor the 155 day periodicity of Mk 34's X-ray emissions.

          Modeling contact binaries, III. Population of massive binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Among massive stars, binary interaction is the rule rather than the exception. The closest binaries, those with periods of less than about 10 days, undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, with many of them experiencing a nuclear-timescale contact phase. Current binary population synthesis models predict the mass-ratio distribution of contact binaries to be heavily skewed toward a mass ratio of unity, which is inconsistent with observations. It has been shown that effects of tidal deformation due to the Roche potential, as well as energy transfer in the common layers of a contact binary, alter the internal structure of close binary components. However, previous population studies neglected these effects. We model a population of massive binary stars that undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, while consistently considering the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer in contact phases. We use the MESA binary-evolution code to compute large grids of models with primary star masses of $8\,M_\odot$ to $70\,M_\odot$ at Solar metallicity. We then perform a population synthesis study to predict distribution functions of the observational properties of close binary systems, focusing in particular on the mass and luminosity ratio distribution. We find that the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer have a limited effect on the predicted mass-ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Only a small fraction of the population has their mass ratio significantly shifted toward a more unequal configuration. However, we suggest that orbital hardening could affect the evolution of contact binaries and their progenitors, and we advocate for a homogeneous set of observed contact binary parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Prime-Cam, one of the primary instruments for the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) developed by the CCAT Collaboration, will house up to seven instrument modules, with the first operating at 280 GHz. Each module will include three arrays of superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The first KID array fabricated for the 280 GHz module uses titanium-nitride (TiN) as the superconducting material and has 3,456 individual detectors, while the other two arrays use aluminum. This paper presents the design and laboratory characterization of the 280 GHz TiN array, which is cooled below its critical temperature to ~0.1 K and read out over six RF feedlines. LED mapping, a technique for matching the measured resonant frequency of a detector to its physical position, was performed on the array so that the results can be used to lithographically trim the KID capacitors and increase the yield of the array by reducing frequency collisions. We present the methods and results of LED mapping the 280 GHz TiN KID array before deployment on FYST.

 - **Abstract**
 Correctly modelling the absorptive properties of dust and haze particles is of great importance for determining the abundance of solid matter within protoplanetary disks and planetary atmospheres. Rigorous analyses such as the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) can be used to obtain accurate absorption cross-sections, but these require significant computing time and are often impractical to use in models. A simple analytical equation exists for spherical particles in the long-wavelength limit (where the wavelength is much larger than the size of the dust particle), but we demonstrate that this can significantly underestimate the absorption. This effect is found to depend strongly on refractive index, with values of m = 1 + 11i corresponding to an underestimate in absorption by a factor of 1,000. Here we present MANTA-Ray (Modified Absorption of Non-spherical Tiny Aggregates in the RAYleigh regime): a simple model that can calculate absorption efficiencies within 10-20% of the values predicted by DDA, but 10^(13) times faster. MANTA-Ray is very versatile and works for any wavelength and particle size in the long wavelength regime. It is also very flexible with regards to particle shape, and can correctly model structures ranging from long linear chains to tight compact clusters, composed of any material with refractive index 1+0.01i < m < 11+11i. The packaged model is provided as publicly-available code for use by the astrophysical community.

          Constraining core-to-envelope differential rotation in gamma-doradus stars from inertial dips properties

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dips in the gravito-inertial modes period-spacing pattern of gamma-Dor stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic studies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main sequence stars with pure inertial modes that propagate in their convective core. We aim to investigate the signature of a differential rotation between the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma-Dor stars from the inertial dip properties. We first describe the bi-layer rotation profile we use and the approximations we adopt to maintain the analyticity of our study. We then describe our results on the inertial dip formation, location, and shape. We derive a modified Lorentzian profile and we compare it to the previously obtained results in the solid-body rotation case. This work highlights the inertial dips' probing power of the convective core rotation, an important observable in the context of the understanding of the angular momentum transport and chemicals mixing inside stars.

          Influence of Modeling Assumptions on the Inferred Dynamical State of Resonant Systems: A Case Study of the HD 45364 System

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems exhibiting mean-motion resonances (MMRs) offer unique opportunities to study the imprint of disk-induced migration on the orbital architectures of planetary systems. The HD 45364 system, discovered via the radial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been the subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system's orbital migration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Li et al. (2022) called into question the system's residence in the 3:2 MMR based on a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations that extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade. However, we show that inferences about the planets' dynamical state with respect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions adopted in the orbital modeling. Using $N$-body dynamical models, we show that orbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data with a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the RV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced by smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent orbital migration can reproduce the system's present-day orbital configuration provided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, $K$, was in the range $10\lesssim K \lesssim 175$. We also find that dynamical interactions in the system can break the usual mass-inclination degeneracy inherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets' absolute masses to within a factor of $\sim2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present conditions for which X-ray spectra can be ``unfolded'' to present accurate representation of the true source spectra. The method we use to unfold the data is implemented in the \textit{Interactive Spectral Interpretation Software} \citep{Houck2000} and distinguishes itself as being model-independent. We find that this method of unfolding makes accurate representations of the true source spectra (1) The detector is high-resolution and (2) The spectrum is not steeply sloped. These criteria are not simple conditions that give concrete determinations; each detector and spectrum must be judged individually. We find that both grating and imaging detectors can be unfolded with minimal distortions as compared to both continuum and local spectral features; the latter CCD detectors being much more energy dependent. We also provide example use cases for unfolding in the context of current generation X-ray observatories and important caveats.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong stellar winds are an important feature in wind-accreting high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems, providing insights into stellar evolution and their impact on surrounding environments. However, the long-term evolution and temporal variability of these winds are not fully understood. This work probes the archetypal wind-accreting HMXB Vela X-1 using MAXI observations over 14 years, focusing on orbit-to-orbit absorption variability in the 2-10 keV band. Additionally, the relation between hardness ratio trends in binary orbits and neutron star spin states is investigated. We calculate hardness ratios to track absorption variability, comparing flux changes across energy bands, as the effect of absorption on the flux is energy-dependent. Variability is analyzed by comparing hardness ratio trends across binary orbits to the MAXI long-term averaged evolution. The long-term averaged hardness ratio evolution displays a stable pattern. Yet, individual binary orbits reveal different hardness ratio evolutions between consecutive orbits with no evident periodicity. Less than half of the binary orbits align with the long-term evolution. Moreover, neutron star spin-up episodes exhibit harder-than-average hardness trends compared to spin-down episodes, although their distributions overlap considerably. The long-term averaged hardness ratio dispersion is consistent with absorption column densities reported in literature from shorter observations, suggesting that heterogeneous wind structures, including accretion wakes and wind clumps, drive observed variations. The orbit-to-orbit variability indicates that pointed X-ray observations provide limited insight into wind structure. The link between neutron star spin states and hardness trends underscores the influence of accretion on absorption, with variability tied to stellar wind density fluctuations.

          A revisited Correction to the Halo Mass Function for local-type Primordial non-Gaussianity

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of primordial non-Gaussianities on halo number counts using N-body simulations with different values of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We show how current theoretical models fail to adequately describe the non-Gaussian mass function of halos identified with different overdensity thresholds, $\Delta_{\rm b}$. We explain how these discrepancies are related to a variation in the density profile of dark matter halos, finding that the internal steepness (i.e. the compactness) of halos depends on the value of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We then parametrize these deviations in halo number counts with a factor $\kappa(\Delta_{\rm b})$ that modifies the linear density threshold for collapse according to the halo identification threshold used, defined with respect to the Universe background density. We rely on a second-degree polynomial to describe $\kappa$ and employ a Bayesian analysis to determine the coefficients of this polynomial. In addition, we verify the independence of the latter on the sign and absolute value of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. Finally, we show how this re-parametrization prevents the extraction of biased constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, correcting for large systematic errors especially in the case of halos identified with high density thresholds. This improvement is crucial in the perspective of deriving cosmological constraints with the non-Gaussian mass function from real data, as different mass definitions can be employed depending on the properties of the survey.

          Towards alleviating the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with Early Dark Energy - Dark Matter drag

 - **Abstract**
 Early dark energy, an additional component of dark energy active in the decade of redshift before recombination, has emerged as one of the most effective models at reducing the $H_0$ tension between direct measurement of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ in the late-universe and the $\Lambda$CDM prediction when calibrated on Planck. However, it requires a slight increase in the dark matter density $\omega_{\rm cdm}$ and primordial tilt $n_s$ that worsens the $S_8$ tension between measurements of weak gravitational lensing at low redshifts and the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM prediction. Using a phenomenological fluid model, we investigate whether the inclusion of a drag term between dark matter and early dark energy can compensate for the effect of the increase in power at small-scales, such that both $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are simultaneously alleviated. We find that this works if the drag term is dynamically relevant in the post-recombination universe. However, a drag term active before or just around the time at which the early dark energy contribution to the energy density is maximum is significantly constrained due to its impact on the matter perturbations before recombination, and the subsequent modifications to the cosmic microwave background power spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Inferring atmospheric properties of exoplanets from observed spectra is key to understanding their formation, evolution, and habitability. Since traditional Bayesian approaches to atmospheric retrieval (e.g., nested sampling) are computationally expensive, a growing number of machine learning (ML) methods such as neural posterior estimation (NPE) have been proposed. We seek to make ML-based atmospheric retrieval (1) more reliable and accurate with verified results, and (2) more flexible with respect to the underlying neural networks and the choice of the assumed noise models. First, we adopt flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) as a new ML approach to atmospheric retrieval. FMPE maintains many advantages of NPE, but provides greater architectural flexibility and scalability. Second, we use importance sampling (IS) to verify and correct ML results, and to compute an estimate of the Bayesian evidence. Third, we condition our ML models on the assumed noise level of a spectrum (i.e., error bars), thus making them adaptable to different noise models. Both our noise level-conditional FMPE and NPE models perform on par with nested sampling across a range of noise levels when tested on simulated data. FMPE trains about 3 times faster than NPE and yields higher IS efficiencies. IS successfully corrects inaccurate ML results, identifies model failures via low efficiencies, and provides accurate estimates of the Bayesian evidence. FMPE is a powerful alternative to NPE for fast, amortized, and parallelizable atmospheric retrieval. IS can verify results, thus helping to build confidence in ML-based approaches, while also facilitating model comparison via the evidence ratio. Noise level conditioning allows design studies for future instruments to be scaled up, for example, in terms of the range of signal-to-noise ratios.

          PEPSI's non-detection of escaping hydrogen and metal lines adds to the enigma of WASP-12 b

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-12 b is an ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) of special interest for atmospheric studies since it is on an inspiraling orbit in an extreme environment of intense radiation and circumstellar gas. Previously claimed detections of active mass loss from this planet are controversial across the literature. To address this controversy, we obtain two new transit observations of WASP-12 b with the optical high-resolution PEPSI spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. Contrary to previous work, we do not observe planetary H$\alpha$ absorption and rule out the amplitude of previously reported detections. Our non-detection may be limited by the sensitivity of our data or could indicate weaker mass loss than suggested by previous studies. We conduct injection-recovery experiments to place constraints on the radial extent of WASP-12 b's escaping atmosphere as probed by Balmer lines, but find that our data do not have the sensitivity to probe down to the planet's Roche Lobe. Using physically motivated models of atmospheric escape, we explore upper limit constraints on the planet's mass-loss rate and deem the data quality in the wavelength regime of Balmer lines insufficient to determine a physically meaningful constraint. We also conduct a spectral survey of other optical absorbers to trace atmospheric circulation but detect no additional absorption. We conclude that previous claims of H$\alpha$ absorption from the atmosphere of WASP-12 b should be reevaluated. Given the anticipated line strength of Balmer/optical features, observing the atmosphere of this faint target will require stacking more observations even with the largest telescope facilities available.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. With the increasing number of discoveries of globular clusters in the inner Milky Way, the need for spectroscopic confirmation and further investigation of their stellar populations and chemodynamical properties has become crucial. Aims. Gran 5 is a newly reported low-mass globular cluster located close to the Galactic center, and it is thought to be an accreted object associated with the Gaia-Enceladus structure. This study aims to investigate the stellar populations of Gran 5 and their detailed chemical properties. Methods. We performed high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy on seven stars in the field of Gran 5 using IGRINS on the Gemini-South telescope. Results. We identified six stars as cluster members and reveal that they are divided into two stellar populations with different metallicities, with mean [Fe/H] values of -0.76 dex and -0.55 dex, respectively. In addition, the chemodynamical properties of Gran 5 agree with those of in situ globular clusters. Conclusions. Our findings represent the first detection of two stellar populations with different metallicities in a low-mass globular cluster. This suggests that the metallicity variation in Gran 5 may have arisen from processes different from those in other globular clusters with metallicity variation, or that it may have lost a substantial amount of its initial mass during its evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We examined the double red clump (RC) observed in the Galactic bulge, interpreted as a difference in distance ("X-shaped bulge scenario") or in chemical composition ("multiple population scenario"). To verify chemical differences between the RC groups, we performed low-resolution spectroscopy for RC and red giant branch (RGB) stars using Gemini-South/GMOS in three fields of the bulge, and collected diverse data from literature. We divided our sample stars not only into bright and faint RC groups, but also into bluer ([Fe/H] < -0.1) and redder ([Fe/H] > -0.1) groups following the recent u-band photometric studies. For the metal-poor stars, no statistically significant difference in CN index was detected between the bright and faint RC groups for all observed fields. However, we found, from cross-matching with high-resolution spectroscopic data, a sign of Na enhancement in the "metal-poor and bright" RC group compared to the "metal-poor and faint" group at (l,b)=(-1 deg,-8.5 deg). When the contributions of the RGB stars on the RC regimes are taken into account, the Na abundance difference between genuine RCs would correspond to approximately 0.23 dex, similar to globular cluster (GCs) with multiple populations. In contrast, the metal-rich stars do not show chemical differences between the bright and faint RCs. It implies that the double RC observed in the metal-poor component of the bulge might be linked to the multiple populations originated from GC-like subsystem, whereas that of the metal-rich component would have produced by the X-shaped structure. Our results support the previous studies suggesting composite nature of the Milky Way bulge.

          Reassessing Sub-Neptune Structure, Radii, and Thermal Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel python-based 1D sub-Neptune evolution model that emphasizes the thermal evolution and potential solidification of the rock/iron core and the structure of the radiative atmosphere. This model explores planetary structure from the molten center to nbar pressure levels. Treating the radiative atmosphere is crucial for sub-Neptunes, due to the large scale height and low gravity, which contributes up to 40\% of their observed radius, especially for low-mass, highly irradiated planets. Consequently, we generically find that lower H/He mass fractions are needed to match a given planetary radius, compared to previous work. While the presence of metal-enrichment in the H/He layers (here modeled as 50$\times$ solar) does not substantially influence the size of the convective envelope, it notably reduces the transit radius by shrinking the radiative atmospheric scale height. Sub-Neptunes cool differently from terrestrial planets, with the rock/iron core's cooling rate limited by the envelope, leading to longer solidification timescales. Complete solidification of the silicate mantle by 10 Gyr is found only for planets with very low masses ($\leq 1M_\oplus$) and small H/He envelopes ($\leq$ 0.1\%). Dynamo action in sub-Neptune iron cores persists as long as the mantle surface remains molten, often exceeding 10 Gyr, and becomes sensitive to core thermal conductivity after solidification. We examine aspects of ''boil-off,'' which sets the maximum allowed H/He mass and planetary radius for subsequent evolution. The rock/iron's cooling energy moderately decreases the post-boil-off H/He mass fraction in planets with large atmospheric scale heights only.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a peculiar X-ray transient, EP240408a, by Einstein Probe (EP) and follow-up studies made with EP, Swift, NICER, GROND, ATCA and other ground-based multi-wavelength telescopes. The new transient was first detected with Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board EP on April 8th, 2024, manifested in an intense yet brief X-ray flare lasting for 12 seconds. The flare reached a peak flux of 3.9x10^(-9) erg/cm2/s in 0.5-4 keV, about 300 times brighter than the underlying X-ray emission detected throughout the observation. Rapid and more precise follow-up observations by EP/FXT, Swift and NICER confirmed the finding of this new transient. Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal in 0.5-10 keV, with a power-law photon index varying within 1.8-2.5. The X-ray light curve shows a plateau lasting for about 4 days, followed by a steep decay till becoming undetectable about 10 days after the initial detection. Based on its temporal property and constraints from previous EP observations, an unusual timescale in the range of 7-23 days is found for EP240408a, which is intermediate between the commonly found fast and long-term transients. No counterparts have been found in optical and near-infrared, with the earliest observation at 17 hours after the initial X-ray detection, suggestive of intrinsically weak emission in these bands. We demonstrate that the remarkable properties of EP240408a are inconsistent with any of the transient types known so far, by comparison with, in particular, jetted tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, X-ray binaries and fast blue optical transients. The nature of EP240408a thus remains an enigma. We suggest that EP240408a may represent a new type of transients with intermediate timescales of the order of about 10 days. The detection and follow-ups of more of such objects are essential for revealing their origin.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our multi-wavelength (X-ray to radio) follow-up campaign of the Einstein Probe transient EP240408a. The initial 10 s trigger displayed bright soft X-ray (0.5-4 keV) radiation with peak luminosity $L_\textrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{49}$ ($10^{50}$) erg s$^{-1}$ for an assumed redshift z>0.5 (2.0). The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR discovered a fading X-ray counterpart lasting for $\sim$5 d (observer frame), which showed a long-lived (~4 d) plateau-like emission ($t^{-0.5}$) before a sharp powerlaw decline ($t^{-7}$). The plateau emission was in excess of $L_\textrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{46}$ ($10^{47}$) erg s$^{-1}$ at z>0.5 (2.0). Deep optical and radio observations resulted in non-detections of the transient. Our observations with Gemini South revealed a faint potential host galaxy ($r \approx 24$ AB mag) near the edge of the X-ray localization. The faint candidate host, and lack of other potential hosts ($r \gtrsim 26$ AB mag; $J \gtrsim 23$ AB mag), implies a higher redshift origin (z>0.5), which produces extreme X-ray properties that are inconsistent with many known extragalactic transient classes. In particular, the lack of a bright gamma-ray counterpart, with the isotropic-equivalent energy ($10 - 10,000$ keV) constrained by GECam and Konus-Wind to $E_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}} \lesssim 4\times10^{51}$ ($6\times10^{52}$) erg at z>0.5 (2.0), conflicts with known gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of similar X-ray luminosities. We therefore favor a jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) as the progenitor of EP240408a at z>1.0, possibly caused by the disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole. The alternative is that EP240408a may represent a new, previously unknown class of transient.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a 34-year timing solution of the redback pulsar system Terzan 5A (Ter5A). Ter5A, also known as B1744$-$24A or J1748$-$2446A, has a 11.56 ms pulse period, a $\sim$0.1 solar mass dwarf companion star, and an orbital period of 1.82 hours. Ter5A displays highly variable eclipses and orbital perturbations. Using new timing techniques, we have determined a phase-connected timing solution for this system over 34 years. This is the longest ever published for a redback pulsar. We find that the pulsar's spin variability is much larger than most globular cluster pulsars. In fact, of the nine redback pulsars with published or in preparation long-term timing solutions, Ter5A is by far the noisiest. We see no evidence of strong correlations between orbital and spin variability of the pulsar. We also find that long-term astrometric timing measurements are likely too contaminated by this variability to be usable, and therefore require careful short-term timing to determine reasonable positions. Finally, we measure an orbital period contraction of $-2.5(3) \times 10^{-13}$, which is likely dominated by the general relativistic orbital decay of the system. The effects of the orbital variability due to the redback nature of the pulsar are not needed to explain the observed orbital period derivative, but they are constrained to less than $\sim$30% of the observed value.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, dedicated at time-domain high-energy astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy, was recently launched and successfully put into operation. The wide-field X-ray telescope (WXT, 0.5-4 keV) onboard has identified multiple gamma-ray burst (GRB) events, with an average duration of approximately 100 seconds. This duration is several times longer than the average duration of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which typically stands at around 20 seconds. Additionally, EP has detected some unknown X-ray transients whose connection to GRBs is uncertain, due to the absence of gamma-ray counterparts and efficient follow-up observation at multi-wavelengths. It is urgent to understand the physical origin of the intriguing EP GRBs. Inspired by studies of GRB 170817A, we suggest that EP GRBs may primarily consist of off-axis viewed bursts, forming a unique population among the GRB zoo. Based on LGRBs' statistical properties during the prompt phase, we explore observable properties of on-axis and off-axis LGRBs in the soft X-ray band. We predict the characteristics of several observables for these GRBs, including the duration, energy fluence, low-energy spectral index, and the slopes of Amati and Yonetoku relations, which could be tested with a larger sample of GRB events detected by EP in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 High precision ephemerides not only support space missions, but can also be used to study the origin and future of celestial bodies. In this paper, a coupled orbit rotation dynamics model that fully takes into account the rotation of the Martian moons is developed. Phobos and Deimos rotation are firstly described by Eulerian rotational equations, and integrated simultaneously with the orbital motion equations. Orbital and orientational parameters of Mars satellites were simultaneously obtained by numerical integration for the first time. In order to compare the differences between our newly developed model and the one now used in the ephemerides, we first reproduced and simulated the current model using our own parameters, and then fit it to the IMCCE ephemerides using least square procedures. The adjustment test simulations show Phobos and Deimos orbital differences between the refined model and the current model is no more than 300 meters and 125 meters, respectively. The orientation parameters are confirmed and the results are in good agreement with the IAU results. Moreover, we simulated two perturbations (main asteroids and mutual torques) which were not included in our refined model, and find that their effects on the orbits are completely negligible. As for the effect on rotation, we propose to take care of the role of mutual attraction in future models.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the data from the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories, we investigate the relationships of the tilt angle of sunspot group (SG), including the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter, during the declining phase with the parameters of the next solar cycle (SC). The main findings are summarized in the following three points. (1) During the declining phase, the correlation between the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter is statistically insignificant. (2) Six quantities measured during the declining phase show significant anti-correlations with the strength and amplitude of the next SC, and positive correlations with the duration of the ascending phase of the next SC: the standard deviation of tilt angles, the root-mean-square tilt angle, the mean absolute value of tilt angles, the area-weighted absolute value of tilt angles, the latitude-weighted absolute value of tilt angles, and the area- and latitude-weighted absolute value of tilt angles. (3) The correlations of the mean tilt angle, the area-weighted tilt angle, the latitude-weighted tilt angle, and the area- and latitude- weighted tilt angle during the declining phase with the strength, amplitude, and duration of the ascending phase of the next SC are statistically insignificant. These findings demonstrate that the modulation of parameters of the next SC by the tilt-angle scatter during the declining phase plays a vital role in regulating SC variability.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the impact of covariance within uncertainties on the inference of cosmological and astrophysical parameters, specifically focusing on galaxy stellar mass functions derived from the CAMELS simulation suite. Utilizing both Fisher analysis and Implicit Likelihood Inference (ILI), we explore how different covariance structures, including simple toy models and physics-motivated uncertainties, affect posterior distributions and parameter variances. Our methodology utilizes forward modeling via emulators that are trained on CAMELS simulations to produce stellar mass functions based on input parameters, subsequently incorporating Gaussian noise as defined by covariance matrices. We examine both toy model covariance matrices and physically motivated covariance matrices derived from observational factors like the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and photometric aperture size. Our results demonstrate that covariance terms significantly influence parameter inference, often leading to tighter constraints or revealing complex, multimodal posterior distributions. These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for covariance when interpreting astrophysical observations, especially in fields where accurate parameter estimation is critical for model validation and hypothesis testing.

 - **Abstract**
 The traditional approach to analyzing mean motion resonances is through canonical perturbation theory. While this is a powerful method, its generality leads to complicated combinations of variables that are challenging to interpret and require looking up numerical coefficients particular to every different resonance. In this paper we develop simpler scaling relations in the limit where orbits are closely spaced (period ratios $\lesssim 2$) and interplanetary interactions can be approximated by only considering the close-approaches each time the inner planet overtakes the outer at conjunction. We develop geometric arguments for several powerful results: (i) that $p$:$p-q$ MMRs of the same order $q$ are all rescaled versions of one another (ii) that the general case of two massive planets on closely spaced, eccentric, co-planar orbits can be approximately mapped onto the much simpler case of an eccentric test particle perturbed by a massive planet on a co-planar circular orbit and (iii) that while the effects of consecutive conjunctions add up coherently for first-order ($p$:$p-1$) MMRs, they partially cancel for $p$:$p-q$ MMRs with order $q>1$, providing a physical explanation for why these higher order MMRs are weaker and can often be ignored. Finally, we provide simple expressions for the widths of MMRs and their associated oscillation frequencies that are universal to all closely spaced MMRs of a given order $q$, in the pendulum approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 Very-high-energy (0.1-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission was observed in HAWC data from the lobes of the microquasar SS 433, making them the first set of astrophysical jets that were resolved at TeV energies. In this work, we update the analysis of SS 433 using 2,565 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. Our analysis reports the detection of a point-like source in the east lobe at a significance of $6.6\,\sigma$ and in the west lobe at a significance of $8.2\,\sigma$. For each jet lobe, we localize the gamma-ray emission and identify a best-fit position. The locations are close to the X-ray emission sites "e1" and "w1" for the east and west lobes, respectively. We analyze the spectral energy distributions and find that the energy spectra of the lobes are consistent with a simple power-law $\text{d}N/\text{d}E\propto E^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = -2.44^{+0.13+0.04}_{-0.12-0.04}$ and $\alpha = -2.35^{+0.12+0.03}_{-0.11-0.03}$ for the east and west lobes, respectively. The maximum energy of photons from the east and west lobes reaches 56 TeV and 123 TeV, respectively. We compare our observations to various models and conclude that the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission can be produced by a population of electrons that were efficiently accelerated.

 - **Abstract**
 Calvera (1RXS J141256.0+792204) is a pulsar of characteristic age 285 kyr at a high Galactic latitude of b=+37°, detected only in soft thermal X-rays. We measure a new and precise proper motion for Calvera using Chandra HRC-I observations obtained 10 years apart. We also derive a new phase-connected ephemeris using 6 years of NICER data, including the astrometric position and proper motion as fixed parameters in the timing solution. Calvera is located near the center of a faint, circular radio ring that was recently discovered by LOFAR and confirmed as a supernova remnant (SNR) by the detection of gamma-ray emission with Fermi/LAT. The proper motion of $78.5 \pm 2.9$ mas/yr at position angle $241°.3 \pm 2°.2$ (in Galactic coordinates) points away from the center of the ring, a result which differs markedly from a previous low-significance measurement, and greatly simplifies the interpretation of the SNR/pulsar association. It argues that the supernova indeed birthed Calvera <10 kyr ago, with an initial spin period close to its present value of 59 ms. The tangential velocity of the pulsar depends on its uncertain distance, $v_t=(372 \pm 14) d_{1 kpc}$ km/s, but is probably dominated by the supernova kick, while its progenitor could have been a runaway O or B star from the Galactic disk.

          Causality for first-order phase transition and its implication to neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Causality is an important factor determining the maximum mass of a neutron star. Previous works studies causality for smooth equation of state. The density at the core of neutron stars can be few times nuclear saturation density, where the occurrence of first-order phase transition has not been ruled out. The causality condition for first-order phase transition is characteristically different from the causality condition of smooth equation of state which can be evident in the mass-radius expression. In this letter we examine the causality condition for first-order phase transition and its observational significance in the mass-radius sequence. We find that equation of state having first-order phase transition, the causality line deviates considerably from the that of smooth equation of state. Depending on the strength of the discontinuity and the onset density of phase transition there is a narrow band in the mass-radius plot which is available only to the stars having smooth equation of state. This can have significant consequence in the sense that if some pulsars are to lie in this band one can rule out equation of state having first-order phase transition occurring at that particular onset density.

          Neutrino detection rates from lepto-hadronic model simulations of bright blazar flares

 - **Abstract**
 There is mounting evidence that blazars are the sources of part of the very-high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube. In particular, there have been several spatial and temporal coincidences of individual IceCube neutrino events with flaring blazars, the most prominent of them being IceCube-170922A, coincident with a multi-wavelength flare of TXS~0506+056. Motivated by this, we used the time-dependent lepto-hadronic code OneHaLe to model the spectral energy distributions and light curves of a sample of bright $\gamma$-ray flares of blazars detected by Fermi-LAT, for which Kreter et al. (2020) provided calorimetric estimates of the expected neutrino detection rates. Flares were modelled with temporal changes of the proton injection spectra. Our analysis shows that the calorimetric approach overestimates the increase in neutrino production by a factor of typically $\sim 10$ if the $\gamma$-ray emission is dominated by proton-synchrotron radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 High precision differential astrometry assesses the positions, distances, and motions of celestial objects in relation to the stars. The focal plane of such space telescope must be calibrated with a precision down to the level of 1e-5 pixel in order to be able to detect Earth-like planets in the close vicinity of the Sun. The presented characterization bench is designed to improve the technology readiness level for the following key points: calibration of new detectors with a high number of pixels and correcting the field distortion using stars in the field of view. The first aim of the project concentrates on the characterization of a 46 megapixels sensor from PYXALIS, to assess its typical parameters using an integrating sphere. The next objective intends to map the intra and extra pixel quantum yield of the detector with a precision of 1e-5 pixels and investigate the evolution of the pixel geometry in response to environment fluctuations. To conduct these tests, an optical bench is designed with an LCD screen and a doublet, used as a source that allows directing light to specific groups of pixels. Interferometric calibration of the detector pixel centroid position will be achieved using fibers that illuminate the detector with Young's fringes. To characterize the distortion of the detector, a diaphragm will produce adjustable optical aberrations to be corrected and therefore change the source sensor positional relationship. The final step involves the simulation of a star's field, which will be imaged on the detector to assess optical quality.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) observations. An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's equatorial eastward zonal flows reach wind velocities of ~100 m/s, while on Saturn they are three times as strong and extend about twice as wide in latitude, despite the two planets being overall dynamically similar. Recent gravity measurements obtained by the Juno and Cassini spacecraft uncovered that the depth of zonal flows on Saturn is about three times greater than on Jupiter. Here we show, using 3D deep convection simulations, that the atmospheric depth is the determining factor controlling both the strength and latitudinal extent of the equatorial zonal flows, consistent with the measurements for both planets. We show that the atmospheric depth is proportional to the convectively driven eddy momentum flux, which controls the strength of the zonal flows. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed differences in the equatorial regions of Jupiter and Saturn, and offer new understandings about the dynamics of gas giants beyond the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is speculated to arise from an enhanced neutrino emission caused by the onset of $^3P_2$-wave neutron superfluidity in the core. However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior. The good agreement between our theoretical results and recent observational cooling data points to the pivotal role played by superfluid quantum criticality in neutron stars.

          Structural and Nucleosynthetic Evolution of Metal-poor & Metal-free Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars

 - **Abstract**
 In this PhD thesis we investigate stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis in the low- and extremely-low metallicity regime - including models of stars with a pure Big Bang composition (i.e. $\rm{Z} = 0$). The metallicity range of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) models calculated is $-6.5 < \rm{[Fe/H]} < -3.0$, with a mass range $0.85 < \rm{M} < 3.0~\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We have also calculated a series of models with a metallicity of $\rm{[Fe/H]} = -1.4$, to compare with observations of abundance patterns in Galactic globular cluster stars. Many of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) and $\rm{Z} = 0$ models experience violent evolutionary episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these events as `Dual Flashes' (DF) since they are characterised by peaks in the hydrogen and helium burning luminosities occurring at the same time. Some of the material processed by these events is later dredged up by the convective envelope, causing very significant surface pollution. We have calculated the entire evolution of the $\rm{Z} = 0$ and EMP models, including detailed nucleosynthesis and yields. Although subject to many uncertainties these are, as far as we are aware, the only yields available in this mass and metallicity range. We find that our models predict an increased number of carbon-rich stars at the lowest metallicities. This is mainly due to the extra pollution provided by the DF events - which do not occur in higher metallicity models. This concurs well with the observations that show the proportion of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic Halo to be higher at lower metallicities. We also compare the chemical pollution arising from our models with the detailed abundance patterns available for some of the most metal-poor CEMP stars, and find mixed results. Fluid dynamics calculations are likely needed to model the violent DF episodes. [Abridged]

          Characterization and classification of $\gamma$-ray bursts from blazars

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are the most common sources of $\gamma$-ray photons in the extra-galactic sky. Their $\gamma$-ray light-curves are characterized by bright flaring episodes, similarly to what is observed at longer wavelengths. These Gamma-Ray Bursts from Blazars (GRBBLs) have been extensively studied individually, but never in terms of a population. The goal of this work is to provide a global characterization of GRBBLs, to investigate the parameter space of the population, and ultimately to classify GRBBLs. Their global properties could give insights on the physical mechanisms responsible for the $\gamma$-ray radiation and on the origin of the observed variability. I analyze a sample of publicly available Fermi-LAT light-curves, utilizing only blazars with certain redshift measurements. The redshift-corrected light-curves are then automatically scanned to identify GRBBLs. A simple flare profile, with exponential rise and decay, is then fitted to all events. The fit parameters, together with global properties from the LAT catalog, are then used as input for unsupervised machine learning classification. The analysis shows that the GRBBL population is remarkably homogeneous. When using only the properties of the integral light-curves, the classifier converges into a single population. When adding information on the evolution of the photon index, the classifier splits the population into achromatic (the large majority) and chromatic (the outliers) GRBBLs. As by product of this study, I identify a correlation between the rising/decay time-scales of the GRBBLs and their peak luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exploration of the Milky Way's structural parameters using an all-sky sample of RC giants to map the stellar density from the inner to the outer parts of the Galactic disc. These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence \rc{}-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE $W1$ photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both \gaia{} and \allwise{} photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (\hz{}), scale-length (\rd{}), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of \rc{} stars. We find that the \rc{} population is best described by a flared thin disc with scale length \rd{}=$3.56\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of \hzsun{}=$0.17\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with \rd{}=$2.59\pm0.11$ kpc, \hzsun{}=$0.45\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 64\% of the \rc{} stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the thin disk shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared interferometry has seen a revolution over the last few years. The advent of GRAVITY+ is about to enable high-contrast observations, all-sky coverage and faint science up to K=21, with the implementation on 8m-class telescope of extreme adaptive optics, wide-field observations, and soon laser guide stars, following a long-term vision of technological and infrastructure development at VLTI. This major progress in sensitivity lift a fundamental limitation of infrared interferometry, namely the brightness temperature achievable with this technique down to milli-arcsecond resolution imaging. This change of paradigm is a crucial element for the expansion of current arrays to a facility up to one to ten kilometer baselines. Micro-arcsecond scales imaging in the infrared on thermal objects, reaching the highest angular resolution possible even compared to VLBI, could offer a unique window in observational astronomy for the next generation instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first LOFAR image of the centre of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits the historical SN 1885A which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz. From analytical modelling we find that SN 1885A will stay in its free-expansion phase for at least another couple of centuries. We find an upper limit of $n_{\rm H}~\lesssim 0.04$ cm$^{-3}$ for the interstellar medium of SN 1885A, and that the SN ejecta density is not shallower than $\propto r^{-9}$ (on average). From the $2.6\sigma$ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that non-thermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission. Comparing our results with those on G1.9+0.3, we find that it is likely that the asymmetries in G1.9+0.3 make it a more efficient radio and X-ray emitter than SN 1885A. For Braun 80, 95 and 101, the other remnants in this region, we estimate ages of 5200, 8100, and 13,100 years, and shock speeds of 1150, 880, and 660 km s$^{-1}$}, respectively. Based on this, the supernova rate in the central 0.5 kpc $\times$ 0.6 kpc of M31 is at least one per $\sim 3000~{\rm yr}$. We estimate radio spectral indices of $-0.66\pm0.05$, $-0.37\pm0.03$ and $-0.50\pm0.03$ for the remnants, respectively, which match fairly well with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) where flux variations due to tidal deformation of the primary star (ellipsoidal variations, EVs) are detected, the binary mass can be determined by combining EVs with the primary's radial velocity (RV) variations from orbital motion and information about the primary's radius. This method has been used for mass estimation in close binaries including X-ray systems, but it has been pointed out that contaminating light from sources other than the primary star could introduce systematic errors in the mass and inclination estimates. Here, we focus on the apparent RV variations caused by asymmetric distortion of the absorption lines of the tidally deformed primary star (tidal RV). Because this signal contains information equivalent to that from photometric EVs, it enables mass estimation of the binary system using only the primary star's absorption lines from high-resolution spectroscopic data, providing a potentially more robust approach against contaminating light. We apply the method to the binary system V723 Monocerotis, where both photometric EV and tidal RV signals are detected, and successfully determine the component masses using only the primary star's RVs and projected rotational velocity, without relying on absolute flux measurements or on stellar evolutionary models. The masses derived from the tidal RV model show a reasonable agreement with those obtained from EVs after carefully modeling the flux contamination from the secondary. This result demonstrates that tidal RVs provide a useful alternative means for mass estimation in SB1s.

 - **Abstract**
 The Local Universe (D < 120 Mpc) has been intensely studied for decades, with highly complete galaxy redshift surveys now publicly available. These data have driven density reconstructions of the underlying matter density field, as well as constrained simulations that aim to reproduce the observed structures. In this paper, we introduce a dispersion measure (DM) model that makes use of this detailed knowledge of our Local Universe within D < 120 Mpc. The model comprises three key components: (i) the DM from the Milky Way halo and the intra-group medium (up to 3.4 Mpc), derived from the HESTIA simulations, a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations designed to reproduce our Local Group; (ii) the DM contribution from the large-scale intergalactic medium beyond the Local Group (3.4 Mpc < D < 120 Mpc), calculated using the HAMLET reconstructed matter density field; and (iii) the individual DM contributions from Local Universe galaxy halos and clusters based on data from the 2MASS Galaxy Group Catalog and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. This comprehensive model will be made available as a Python package. As the most realistic model to date for DM in the local volume, it promises to improve the constraints of DM contributions from the Intergalactic Medium and Circumgalactic Medium of FRBs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of cosmic baryon distribution calculations based on DM analysis of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Many nucleosynthetic channels create the elements, but two-parameter models characterized by $\alpha$ and Fe nonetheless predict stellar abundances in the Galactic disk to accuracies of 0.02 to 0.05 dex for most measured elements, near the level of current abundance uncertainties. It is difficult to make individual measurements more precise than this to investigate lower-amplitude nucleosynthetic effects, but population studies of mean abundance patterns can reveal more subtle abundance differences. Here we look at the detailed abundances for 67315 stars from APOGEE DR17, but in the form of abundance residuals away from a best-fit two-parameter, data-driven nucleosynthetic model. We find that these residuals show complex structures with respect to age, guiding radius, and vertical action that are not random and are also not strongly correlated with sources of systematic error such as surface gravity, effective temperature, and radial velocity. The residual patterns, especially in Na, C+N, Ni, Mn, and Ce, trace kinematic structures in the Milky Way, such as the inner disk, thick disk, and flared outer disk. A principal component analysis suggests that most of the observed structure is low-dimensional and can be explained by a few eigenvectors. We find that some, but not all, of the effects in the low-$\alpha$ disk can be explained by dilution with fresh gas, so that abundance ratios resemble those of stars with higher metallicity. The patterns and maps we provide could be combined with accurate forward models of nucleosynthesis, star formation, and gas infall to provide a more detailed picture of star and element formation in different Milky Way components.

 We present the photometric performance of SPIRIT, a ground-based near-infrared InGaAs CMOS-based instrument (1280 by 1024 pixels, 12 micron pitch), using on-sky results from the SPECULOOS-Southern Observatory during 2022 - 2023. SPIRIT was specifically designed to optimise time-series photometric precision for observing late M and L type stars. To achieve this, a custom wide-pass filter (0.81 - 1.33 microns, zYJ ) was used, which was also designed to minimise the effects of atmospheric precipitable water vapour (PWV) variability on differential photometry. Additionally, SPIRIT was designed to be maintenance-free by eliminating the need for liquid nitrogen for cooling. We compared SPIRIT's performance with a deeply-depleted (2048 by 2048 pixels, 13.5 micron pitch) CCD-based instrument (using an I+z' filter, 0.7 - 1.1 microns) through simultaneous observations. For L type stars and cooler, SPIRIT exhibited better photometric noise performance compared to the CCD-based instrument. The custom filter also significantly minimised red noise in the observed light curves typically introduced by atmospheric PWV variability. In SPIRIT observations, the detector's read noise was the dominant limitation, although in some cases, we were limited by the lack of comparison stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Sudden phase transitions during inflation can give rise to strongly enhanced primordial density perturbations on scales much smaller than those directly probed by cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this paper, we study the effect of the incoming quantum state on the steepest growth found in the primordial power spectrum using a simple model of an instantaneous transition during single-field inflation. We consider the case of a general de Sitter-invariant initial state for the inflaton field (the $\alpha$-vacuum), and also an incoming state perturbed by a preceding transition. For the $\alpha$-vacua we find that $k^6$ growth is possible for $\alpha>0$, while $k^4$ growth is seen for $\alpha\leq0$, including the standard case of an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The features of an enhanced primordial power spectrum on small scales are thus sensitive to the initial quantum state during inflation. We calculate the scalar-induced gravitational wave power spectrum for each case.

 - **Abstract**
 Statistical studies show that stars of GK spectral types, with masses below 1.1 Sun mass, are depleted in hot Jupiters. This finding is evidence of tidal orbital decay during the main-sequence lifetime. Theoretical considerations show that in some configurations, the tidal energy dissipation can be boosted by non-linear effects in dynamical tides, which are wave-like responses to tidal forcing. To probe the regime of these dynamical tides in GK stars, we searched for orbital period shortening for 6 selected hot Jupiters in systems with 0.8-1 Sun mass host stars: HATS-18, HIP 65A, TrES-3, WASP-19, WASP-43, and WASP-173A. For the hot Jupiters of our sample, we analysed transit timing data sets based on mid-transit points homogeneously determined from observations performed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and high-quality data available in the literature. For the TrES-3 system, we also used new transit light curves we acquired with ground-based telescopes. The mid-transit times were searched for shortening of orbital periods through statistical testing of quadratic transit ephemerides. Theoretical predictions on the dissipation rate for dynamical tides were calculated under the regimes of internal gravity waves (IGWs) undergoing wave breaking (WB) in stellar centres and weak non-linear (WNL) wave-wave interactions in radiative layers. Stellar parameters of the host stars, such as mass and age, which were used in those computations, were homogeneously redetermined using evolutionary models with the Bayesian inference. We found that transit times follow the refined linear ephemerides for all ultra-hot Jupiters of our sample. Non-detection of orbital decay allowed us to place lower constraints on the tidal dissipation rates in those planet-star systems. In three systems, HATS-18, WASP-19, and WASP-43, we reject a scenario with total dissipation of IGWs. We conclude that...

 - **Abstract**
 Radio pulsars allow the study of the ionised interstellar medium and its dispersive effects, a major noise source in gravitational wave searches using pulsars. In this paper, we compare the functionality and reliability of three commonly used schemes to measure temporal variations in interstellar propagation effects in pulsar-timing data. We carry out extensive simulations at low observing frequencies (100-200 MHz) by injecting long-term correlated noise processes with power-law spectra and white noise, to evaluate the robustness, accuracy and precision of the following three mitigation methods: epoch-wise (EW) measurements of interstellar dispersion; the DMX method of simultaneous, piece-wise fits to interstellar dispersion; and DMGP, which models dispersion variations through Gaussian processes using a Bayesian analysis method. We then evaluate how reliably the input signals are reconstructed and how the various methods react to the presence of achromatic long-period noise. All the methods perform well, provided the achromatic long-period noise is modeled for DMX and DMGP. The most precise method is DMGP, followed by DMX and EW, while the most accurate is EW, followed by DMX and DMGP. We also test different scenarios including simulations of L-band ToAs and realistic DM injection, with no significant variation in the obtained results. Given the nature of our simulations and our scope, we deem that EW is the most reliable method to study the Galactic ionized media. Future works should be conducted to confirm this result via more realistic simulations. We note that DM GP and DMX seem to be the most performing techniques in removing long-term correlated noise, and hence for gravitational wave studies. However, full simulations of pulsar timing array experiments are needed to support this interpretation.

          Discrete element simulations of self-gravitating rubble pile collisions: the effects of non-uniform particle size and rotation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel implementation of a soft sphere, discrete elements code to simulate the dynamics of self-gravitating granular materials. The code is used to study the outcome of sub-sonic collisions between self-gravitating rubble piles with masses ranging from $\sim6\times10^{21}$ to $\sim6\times10^{22}$ g. These masses are representative of asteroids and planetesimals in the $\sim100$~km range. We simulate rubble piles composed of a range of particle sizes and analyze the collisions outcome focusing on the properties of the largest surviving fragment. We successfully test and validate the code against previous results. The results of our study show that rubble piles formed by collision of two parent rubble piles do not maintain the same particle size distribution as their parents. Rubble piles formed in low velocity collisions are characterized by a larger fraction of large particles, while the largest fragments of high-velocity collisions show a significant decrease in their mean particle size. We ascribe this effect to the fact that large particles transmit most of the forces during the collisions. In addition, we find that the mass of the largest post-collision fragment does depend on the rotation of the colliding rubble piles. This effect is especially noticeable when the pre-collision spin axes are parallel with each other and perpendicular to the relative velocity. This finding can be particularly relevant for meter to kilometer sized bodies embedded in protostellar accretion disks, where viscous stresses can efficiently align the target and projectile spin axes.

          Confinement of relativistic particles in the vicinity of accelerators: a key for understanding the anomalies in secondary cosmic rays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmic ray (CR) measurements have revealed unexpected anomalies in secondary CRs, namely deviations from the predictions of the so-called standard Galactic CR paradigm regarding the composition and energy spectra of the products of interactions of primary (accelerated) CRs with interstellar gas: (i) antiparticles (positrons and antiprotons), (ii) light elements of the (Li, Be, B) group, and (iii) diffuse gamma rays. We argue that the new measurements can still be explained within the standard CR paradigm but with an additional assumption that CRs spend a significant part of their lifetime near their formation sites. The latter can be realized if CRs propagate more slowly in these localized regions than in the interstellar medium (ISM). Postulating that CRs accumulate on average energy-independent "grammage" of $0.7 \ \rm g/cm^2$ near the major contributors to galactic CRs, one can explain self-consistently the new measurements of the B/C ratio by DAMPE and the diffuse ultra-high-energy gamma-rays by LHAASO, involving a minimal number of model parameters: the energy-dependent "grammage" in the interstellar medium $\rm \lambda \approx 8 (E/10 \ GeV)^{-0.55}~\rm g/cm^{2}$ and the average CR acceleration (sourcee) spectrum, $\rm Q(E) \propto E^{-2.3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a time-resolved analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 using observations carried out by NuSTAR, which cover approximately two binary orbits in different intensity states. The pulse profile is relatively stable over the orbital phase and shows energy dependence. It has an obvious double-peaked shape in the energy band below 15 keV -- with the second pulse peak decreasing as energy increases -- and is gradually dominated by a single peak in higher energy bands. We find that the pulse profile in the energy band of 3-5 keV at high-intensity states shows a subtle triple-peaked shape, with the main peak divided into two subpeaks. We also find a positive correlation between the pulse fraction and both energy and flux. Our spectral analysis reveals that the spectra can be well described by the continuum of Fermi-Dirac cutoff and NPEX models, and the cyclotron line is detected with the centroid energies varying from 26 keV to 29 keV, along with the iron emission line around 6.4 keV. We investigated the dependence between the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy and luminosity and discuss the theoretical critical luminosity. Although the variation of $E_{\rm cyc}- L_X$ is not distinct, there is a possibility that the critical luminosity lies within the range of $\sim (0.5-4)\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the band of $4-78$ keV. The photon index shows a strong positive correlation with luminosity. Our orbital-phase analysis reveals that the spectral parameters show orbital variability, and the highly variable photoelectric absorption may indicate the existence of clumpy stellar winds.

 - **Abstract**
 As a new generation of large-sky spectroscopic surveys comes online, the enormous data volume poses unprecedented challenges in classifying spectra. Modern unsupervised techniques have the power to group spectra based on their dominant features, circumventing the complete reliance on training data suffered by supervised methods. We outline the use of dimensionality reduction to generate a 2D map of the structure of an intermediate-resolution spectroscopic dataset. This technique efficiently separates white dwarfs of different spectral classes in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Early Data Release (DESI EDR), identifying spectral features that had been missed even by visual classification. By focusing the method on particular spectral regions, we identify white dwarfs with helium features at 90 per cent recall, and cataclysmic variables at 100 per cent recall, illustrating rapid selection of low-contamination samples from spectroscopic surveys. We also demonstrate the use of dimensionality reduction in a supervised manner, outlining a procedure to classify any white dwarf spectrum in comparison with those in the DESI EDR. With upcoming surveys promising tens of millions of spectra, our work highlights the potential for semi-supervised techniques as an efficient means of classification and dataset visualisation.

 - **Abstract**
 The innermost portions of the Milky Way's stellar halo have avoided scrutiny until recently. The lack of wide-area survey data, made it difficult to reconstruct an uninterrupted view of the density distribution of the metal-poor stars inside the Solar radius. In this study, we utilize red giant branch (RGB) stars from Gaia, with metallicities estimated using spectro-photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. Accounting for Gaia's selection function, we examine the spatial distribution of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1.3) RGB stars, from the Galactic centre (r~1 kpc) out to beyond the Solar radius (r~18 kpc). Our best-fitting single-component cored power-law model shows a vertical flattening of ~0.5 and a slope -3.4, consistent with previous studies. Motivated by the mounting evidence for two distinct stellar populations in the inner halo, we additionally test a range of two-component models. One of the components models the tidal debris from the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger, while the other captures the Aurora population -- stars that predate the Galactic disk formation. Our best-fit two-component model suggests that both populations contribute equally around the Solar radius, but Aurora dominates the inner halo with a steeper power-law index of -4.5, in agreement with the nitrogen-rich star distribution measured by Horta et al. (2021).

 - **Abstract**
 Many promising explosion models for the elusive origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ultimately fail to completely reproduce a number of observed properties of these events. One limiting factor for many of these models is the use of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption in the calculation of their synthetic observables, which has been shown to prevent the accurate prediction of a number of fundamental features of SNe Ia. The inclusion of high-accuracy non-LTE physics, however, increases computational cost and complexity such that multidimensional non-LTE calculations are often unfeasible, which can be problematic for models that are inherently multidimensional. In this work, we conduct radiative transfer calculations using 1D profiles that each correspond with a line of sight from an asymmetric, 2D SN Ia model. We find, in LTE, that the synthetic observables from these calculations efficiently reproduce those from the 2D calculation when an equivalence of bolometric luminosities between the 1D and 2D treatments is enforced. This allows for the accurate calculation of synthetic observables in 1D while still preserving multidimensional effects associated with the model. We leverage this to produce high accuracy observables from 1D non-LTE calculations, showing significantly improved agreement with observation, including a roughly 50% reduction of $B$-band decline rate into congruence with the observed Phillips relation. Additionally, our non-LTE observables show Si II $\lambda$5972 pEWs that are much more similar to observation, while spanning multiple Branch classes, suggesting that some spectral classifications of SNe Ia arise from line of sight effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are beamed active galactic nuclei known for their strong multi-wavelength variability on timescales from years down to minutes. We aim to investigate the suitability of the twisting jet model presented in previous works to explain the multi-wavelength behaviour of BL Lacertae, the prototype of one of the blazar classes. According to this model, the jet is inhomogeneous, curved, and twisting, and the long-term variability is due to changes in the Doppler factor due to variations in the orientation of the jet-emitting regions. We analysed optical data of the source obtained during monitoring campaigns organised by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) in 2019-2022, together with radio data from the WEBT and other teams, and gamma-ray data from the Fermi satellite. In this period, BL Lacertae underwent an extraordinary activity phase, reaching its historical optical and gamma-ray brightness maxima. The application of the twisting jet model to the source light curves allows us to infer the wiggling motion of the optical, radio, and gamma-ray jet-emitting regions. The optical-radio correlation shows that the changes in the radio viewing angle follow those in the optical viewing angle by about 120 days, and it suggests that the jet is composed of plasma filaments, which is in agreement with some radio high-resolution observations of other sources. The gamma-ray emitting region is found to be co-spatial with the optical one, and the analysis of the gamma-optical correlation is consistent with both the geometric interpretation and a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) origin of the high-energy photons. We propose a geometric scenario where the jet is made up of a pair of emitting plasma filaments in a sort of double-helix curved rotating structure, whose wiggling motion produces changes in the Doppler beaming and can thus explain the observed multi-wavelength long-term variability.

 - **Abstract**
 We report high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring and long-baseline interferometric observations with the PTI of the 215-day binary system HD 174881 (K1 II-III), composed of two giant stars. The system is spatially resolved with the PTI, as well as in archival measurements with the CHARA Array. Our analysis of these observations, along with an analysis of the spectral energy distribution, have allowed us to infer accurate values for the absolute masses ($3.367^{+0.045}_{-0.041} M_{\odot}$ and $3.476^{+0.043}_{-0.043} M_{\odot}$), radii ($34.0 \pm 1.3 R_{\odot}$ and $22.7 \pm 1.8 R_{\odot}$), effective temperatures ($4620 \pm 100$ K and $4880 \pm 150$ K), and bolometric luminosities of both components, as well as other properties including the orbital parallax (distance). These provide valuable tests of stellar evolution models for evolved stars, which are still relatively uncommon compared to the situation for main-sequence stars. We find generally good agreement of all of these properties of HD 174881 with two sets of recent models (MIST, and PARSEC) at compositions near solar, for ages of 255-273 Myr. We also find evidence of an infrared excess, based largely on the flux measurements from IRAS at 60 and 100 microns.
