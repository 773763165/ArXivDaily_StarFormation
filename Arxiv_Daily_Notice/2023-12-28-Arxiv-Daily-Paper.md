#### The Role of Giant Impacts in Planet Formation

 - **Abstract**
 Planets are expected to conclude their growth through a series of giant impacts: energetic, global events that significantly alter planetary composition and evolution. Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret collision conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon, a widely suspected giant-impact product for which we have the most information, is still debated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probability theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for advancing giant-impact theory in the future. $\bullet$ Giant impacts exhibit diverse possible outcomes leading to changes in planetary mass, composition, and thermal history depending on the conditions. $\bullet$ Improvements to computer simulation methodologies and new laboratory experiments provide critical insights into the detailed outcomes of giant impacts. $\bullet$ When colliding planets are similar in size, they can merge or escape one another with roughly equal probability, but with different effects on their resulting masses, densities, and orbits. $\bullet$ Different sequences of giant impacts can produce similar planets, encouraging the use of probability theory to evaluate distinct formation hypotheses.
#### Constraining general multi-field inflation using the SPHEREx all-sky  survey
 - **Authors:** Charuhas Shiveshwarkar, Thejs Brinckmann, Marilena Loverde

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how well the SPHEREx all-sky survey can constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ using the galaxy power spectrum. We forecast joint constraints on the parameters $f_{\text{NL}}$, $g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$ obtained assuming a simple two-field curvaton model of inflation. The parameters $f_{\text{NL}}$ and $g_{\text{NL}}$ characterise the squeezed limits of the primordial bispectrum and trispectrum respectively, and lead to a characteristic scale-dependence of the galaxy bias that increases out to arbitrarily large scales. Values of the parameter $\tau_{\text{NL}}> (\frac{6}{5}f_{\text{NL}})^{2}$ cause the galaxy power spectrum to have a stochastic component which also increases out to arbitrarily large scales. Our MCMC forecasts indicate that SPHEREx can provide joint constraints on any two of the three parameters $f_{\text{NL}}, \ g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$. Due to strong degeneracies among these parameters, measurements of the galaxy power spectra alone may not be sufficient to jointly constrain all three. Constraints on $f_{\text{NL}}, \ g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$ obtained from galaxy power spectrum observations depend on the modelling of underlying nuisance parameters. We study the robustness of our forecast constraints to modelling choices and note that even with relatively weak assumptions, SPHEREx galaxy power spectra can provide strong evidence of local non-Gaussianity, even if the particular values of $f_{\text{NL}}$ and $g_{\text{NL}}$ cannot be measured precisely.
#### Large planets may not form fractionally large moons
 - **Authors:** Miki Nakajima, Hidenori Genda, Erik Asphaug, Shigeru Ida

 - **Abstract**
 One of the unique aspects of Earth is that it has a fractionally large Moon, which is thought to have formed from a Moon-forming disk generated by a giant impact. The Moon stabilizes the Earth's spin axis at least by several degrees and contributes to Earth's stable climate. Given that impacts are common during planet formation, exomoons, which are moons around planets in extrasolar systems, should be common as well, but no exomoon has been confirmed. Here we propose that an initially vapor-rich moon-forming disk is not capable of forming a large moon because growing moonlets, which are building blocks of a moon, experience strong gas drag and quickly fall toward the planet. Our impact simulations show that terrestrial and icy planets that are larger than $\sim 1.3-1.6 R_\oplus$ produce entirely vapor disks, which fail to form a large moon. This indicates that (1) our model supports the Moon-formation models that produce vapor-poor disks and (2) rocky and icy exoplanets whose radii are smaller than $\sim 1.6 R_\oplus$ are ideal candidates for hosting fractionally large exomoons.
#### Feeding plankton to whales: high-redshift supermassive black holes from  tiny black hole explosions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15062
 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the high-redshift universe have uncovered a significant number of active galactic nuclei, implying that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) would have to have been formed at much earlier times than expected. Direct collapse of metal-free gas clouds to SMBHs after recombination could help explain the early formation of SMBHs, but this scenario is stymied by the fragmentation of the clouds due to efficient molecular hydrogen cooling. We show that a subdominant population of tiny, evaporating primordial black holes, with significant clustering in some gas clouds, can heat the gas sufficiently so that molecular hydrogen is not formed, and direct collapse to to black holes is possible even at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 The far-infrared (IR) region is rich with information needed to characterize interstellar dust and to investigate the cold outer planets of the solar system and their icy moons. The proposed sub-orbital observatory the Balloon Experiment for Galactic INfrared Science (BEGINS) will utilize cryogenic instruments to map spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of interstellar dust in the Cygnus molecular cloud complex. A future high priority flagship mission Uranus Orbiter and Probe carrying a net flux radiometer (NFR) will study the in situ heat flux of the icy giants atmosphere to 10 bar pressure. These instruments require far-IR filters to define the instrument spectral bandwidths. Our ultimate goal is to define the instrument bands of BEGINS and the NFR with linear-variable filters (LVFs) and discrete-variable filters (DVFs). The LVFs and DVFs will be made of metal mesh band-pass filters (MMBF) comprised of a 100 nm thick gold film with cross-shaped slots of varying sizes along a silicon (Si) substrate with cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) anti-reflection (AR) coatings. We present our progress towards LVFs and DVFs with simulated and measured transmission of a room temperature, non-AR coated, single-band 44 $\mu$m MMBF filter. We have successfully fabricated, measured, and modeled a non-AR coated, room temperature 44 $\mu$m MMBF. The transmission at room temperature and non-AR coated was measured to be 27\% with a resolving power of 11. When COC-AR coated on both sides the transmission is expected to increase to 69\% with a resolving power of 10.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new approach for identifying neutrino flares. Using the unsupervised machine learning algorithm expectation maximization, we reduce computing times compared to conventional approaches by a factor of $10^5$ on a single CPU. Expectation maximization is also easily expandable to multiple flares. We explain the application of the algorithm and fit the neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056 as an example.
#### Surveying the ice condensation period at southern polar Mars using a CNN

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15260
 - **Abstract**
 Before the seasonal polar ice cap starts to expand towards lower latitudes on Mars, small frost patches may condensate out during the cold night and they may remain on the surface even during the day in shady areas. If ice in these areas can persist before the arrival of the contiguous ice cap, they may remain after the recession of it too, until the irradiation increases and the ice is met with direct sunlight. In case these small patches form periodically at the same location, slow chemical changes might occur as well. To see the spatial and temporal occurrence of such ice patches, large number of optical images should be searched for and checked. The aim of this study is to survey the ice condensation period on the surface with an automatized method using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imagery from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. The CNN trained to recognise small ice patches is automatizing the search, making it feasible to analyse large datasets. Previously a manual image analysis was conducted on 110 images from the southern hemisphere, captured by the HiRISE camera. Out of these, 37 images were identified with smaller ice patches, which were used to train the CNN. This approach is applied now to find further images with potential water ice patches in the latitude band between -40{\deg} and -60{\deg}, but contrarily to the training dataset recorded between 140-200{\deg} solar longitude, the images were taken from the condensation period between Ls = 0{\deg} to 90{\deg}. The model was ran on 171 new HiRISE images randomly picked from the given period between -40{\deg} and -60{\deg} latitude band, creating 73155 small image chunks. The model classified 2 images that show small, probably recently condensed frost patches and 327 chunks were predicted to show ice with more than 60% probability.
#### Impact of discontinuous grain size distributions on the spectral energy  distribution of debris disks
 - **Authors:** Minjae Kim, Sebastian Wolf
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15283
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15283
 - **Abstract**
 The collisional evolution of debris disks is expected to result in a characteristic wavy pattern of the grain size distributions, i.e., an under/overabundance of particles of specific sizes. This perturbed grain size distribution potentially leaves characteristic patterns in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the disk system. We aim to quantify and understand the specific influence of discontinuous particle size distributions on the appearance of debris disks. For this purpose, we consider dust emission models based on two different grain size distributions, i.e., once with a single and once with a broken power law. We compare the spectral index $\alpha$ ($F_{\nu}\,\propto \nu^{\rm{\,\alpha}}$) in the case of a continuous grain size distribution with that of a discontinuous grain size distribution. We perform this comparison for central stars with different spectral types and two different disk structures (e.g., slim and broad debris dust rings). Within the considered parameter space, we find a characteristic difference between the spectral slopes of the SED in the different scenarios. More specifically, the overabundance of small grains leads to a steeper slope in the far-infrared/submillimeter regime, while the spectral index in the mm regime is hardly affected. On the other hand, the underabundance of medium-sized grains results in a slight steepening of the far-infrared slope of SED, while its primary effect is on the mm slope of SED, causing it to become shallower. We also find that the impact of an overabundance of small dust particles is more pronounced than that of an underabundance of medium-sized dust particles. Furthermore, we find that the difference between the spectral indices for the two different grain size distributions is largest for debris disks around brighter central stars and broader disks.
#### A resolution study on corrugation mode wavelengths of vertical shear  instability

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15414
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15414
 - **Abstract**
 The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to drive turbulence in protoplanetary disks. Numerical simulations in literature demonstrate that the VSI non-linear saturation is predominated by the linear corrugation modes. These modes possess vertical wavelengths significantly longer than radial wavelengths. This paper aims to investigate the natural radial wavelengths of corrugation modes upon saturation, by a series of numerical simulations conducted in Athena++ at different grid resolutions, disk aspect ratios, and viscosity. We find a continuous reduction of radial wavelengths with grid resolution and a sign of convergence at 64 cells per scale height for fiducial models. Synthetic ALMA molecular line observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) are performed to inspect the observability of corrugation modes feature, where it is washed out at above 32 cells per scale height. Flared and viscous disks that exhibit longer saturation wavelengths may mitigate the observation difficulty.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15483
 - **Abstract**
 We confront massive Proca-Nuevo gravity with cosmological observations. The former is a non-linear theory involving a massive spin-1 field, that can be extended incorporating operators of the Generalized Proca class, and when coupled to gravity it can be covariantized in a way that exhibits consistent and ghost-free cosmological solutions, without experiencing instabilities and superluminalities at the perturbative level. When applied at a cosmological framework it induces extra terms in the Friedmann equations, however due to the special non-linear construction the field is eliminated in favor of the Hubble function. Thus, the resulting effective dark energy sector is dynamical, but with just one model parameter, namely the energy scale that controls the strength of the vector self-interactions. We use data from Supernovae Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) observations and we construct the corresponding likelihood-contours for the free parameters. Interestingly enough, application of various information criteria, such as AIC, BIC and DIC, shows that the scenario of massive Proca-Nuevo gravity, although having exactly the same number of free parameters with {\Lambda}CDM concordance model, is more efficient in fitting the data. Finally, the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter shows statistical compatibility with the model-independent, data-driven reconstructed one.
#### shock_cooling_curve: A Python-Based Package for Extensive and Efficient  Modeling of Shock Cooling Emission in Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The light-curve evolution of a supernova contains information of the exploding star. Early-time photometry of a variety of explosive transients, including Calcium-rich transients and type IIb/Ibc and IIP supernovae shows evidence for an early light curve peak as a result of the explosion's shock wave passing through extended material (i.e., shock cooling emission (SCE)). Analytic modeling of the shock cooling emission allows us to estimate progenitor properties such as the radius and mass of extended material (e.g., the stellar envelope) as well as the shock velocity. In this work, we present a Python-based modular package that implements four analytic models originally developed in Piro 2015, Piro 2020 and Sapir & Waxman (2017) applied to photometric data to obtain progenitor parameter properties via different modeling techniques (including non-linear optimization, MCMC sampling). Our software is easily extendable to other analytic models for SCE and different methods of parameter estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectroscopic performance of x-ray instruments can be affected at high count rates. The effects and mitigation in the optical chain, such as x-ray attenuation filters or de-focusing mirrors, are widely discussed, but those in the signal chain are not. Using the Resolve x-ray microcalorimeter onboard the XRISM satellite, we discuss the effects observed during high count rate measurements and how these can be modeled. We focus on three instrumental effects that impact performance at high count rate: CPU limit, pile up, and electrical cross talk. High count rate data were obtained during ground testing using the flight model instrument and a calibration x-ray source. A simulated observation of GX 13+1 is presented to illustrate how to estimate these effects based on these models for observation planning. The impact of these effects on high count rate observations is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Higher order clustering statistics of Ly$\alpha$ forest provide a unique probe to study non-gaussianity in Intergalactic matter distribution up to high redshifts and from large to small scales. The author presents a brief review of his work studying the spatial clustering properties of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers, with emphasis on 3-point statistics. The observational side of this involves redshift-space clustering of low-$z$ ($z<0.48$) and high-$z$ ($1.7<z<3.5$) Ly$\alpha$ absorbers. This is complemented with astrophysical inferences drawn from N-body hydrodynamical simulations. We also use simulations to study 2-point and 3-point clustering statistics in the transverse direction using projected QSO triplet sightlines. Such studies will become possible observationally with upcoming surveys.
#### Probing Gauss-Bonnet-Corrected Inflation with Gravitational Waves

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15766
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15766
 - **Abstract**
 The low energy effective action of quantum gravity may include the higher curvature terms such as the Gauss-Bonnet term. The inflaton dynamics may be affected by the Gauss-Bonnet term if there is an inflaton-Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We show that an inflation model with a simple power law potential is made viable if it is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term since the prediction on the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are modified. We further point out that such a model predicts huge amount of gravitational waves at the high frequency range around 100GHz--100THz through the perturbative inflaton decay into gravitons induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Thus the spectrum of high frequency gravitational background is a unique feature of the inflation models with a Gauss-Bonnet correction.
#### Number of Scatterings in Random Walks

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the number of scatterings a photon undergoes in random walks before escaping from a medium. The number of scatterings in random walk processes is commonly approximated as $\tau+\tau^2$ in the literature, where $\tau$ is the optical thickness measured from the center of the medium. However, it is found that this formula is not accurate. In this study, analytical solutions in sphere and slab geometries are derived for both optically thin and optically thick limits, assuming isotropic scattering. These solutions are verified using Monte Carlo simulations. In the optically thick limit, the number of scatterings is found to be $0.5\tau^2$ and $1.5\tau^2$ in a sphere and slab, respectively. In the optically thin limit, the number of scatterings is $\approx\tau$ in a sphere and $\approx\tau(1-\gamma-\ln\tau+\tau)$ in a slab, where $\gamma\simeq 0.57722$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Additionally, we present approximate formulas that reasonably reproduce the simulation results well in intermediate optical depths. These results are applicable to scattering processes that exhibit forward and backward symmetry, including both isotropic and Thomson scattering.
#### Parameter Estimation of LAMOST Medium-resolution Stellar Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the problem of estimating three stellar atmospheric physical parameters and thirteen elemental abundances for medium-resolution spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Typical characteristics of these spectra are their huge scale, wide range of spectral signal-to-noise ratios, and uneven distribution in parameter space.These characteristics lead to unsatisfactory results on the spectra with low temperature, high temperature or low metallicity.To this end, this paper proposes a Stellar Parameter Estimation method based on Multiple Regions (SPEMR) that effectively improves parameter estimation accuracy. On the spectra with {S/N $\geq 10$}, the precisions are 47 K, 0.08 dex, 0.03 dex respectively for the estimations of ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log \,g$ and $\rm [Fe/H]$), 0.03 dex to 0.06 dex for elements C, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Mn and Ni, 0.07 dex to 0.13 dex for N, O, S, K and Ti, while that of Cr is 0.16 dex.For the reference of astronomical science researchers and algorithm researchers, we released a catalog for 4.19 million medium-resolution spectra from the LAMOST DR8, experimental code, trained model, training data, and test data.
#### The Galaxy Bispectrum in the Spherical Fourier-Bessel Basis

 - **Abstract**
 The bispectrum, the three-point correlation in Fourier space, is a crucial statistic for studying many effects targeted by the next-generation galaxy surveys, such as primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) and general relativistic (GR) effects on large scales. In this work we develop a formalism for the bispectrum in the Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis - a natural basis for computing correlation functions on the curved sky, as it diagonalizes the Laplacian operator in spherical coordinates. Working in the SFB basis allows for line-of-sight effects such as redshift space distortions (RSD) and GR to be accounted for exactly, i.e without having to resort to perturbative expansions to go beyond the plane-parallel approximation. Only analytic results for the SFB bispectrum exist in the literature given the intensive computations needed. We numerically calculate the SFB bispectrum for the first time, enabled by a few techniques: We implement a template decomposition of the redshift-space kernel $Z_2$ into Legendre polynomials, and separately treat the PNG and velocity-divergence terms. We derive an identity to integrate a product of three spherical harmonics connected by a Dirac delta function as a simple sum, and use it to investigate the limit of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe. Moreover, we present a formalism for convolving the signal with separable window functions, and use a toy spherically symmetric window to demonstrate the computation and give insights into the properties of the observed bispectrum signal. While our implementation remains computationally challenging, it is a step toward a feasible full extraction of information on large scales via a SFB bispectrum analysis.
#### The globular cluster VVV CL002 falling down to the hazardous Galactic  centre

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Galactic centre is hazardous for stellar clusters because of the strong tidal force. Supposedly, many clusters were destroyed and contributed stars to the crowded stellar field of the bulge and the nuclear stellar cluster. However, it is hard to develop a realistic model to predict the long-term evolution of the complex inner Galaxy, and observing surviving clusters in the central region would provide crucial insights into destruction processes. Aims. Among hitherto-known Galactic globular clusters, VVV CL002 is the closest to the centre, 0.4 kpc, but has a very high transverse velocity, 400 km s$^{-1}$. The nature of this cluster and its impact on Galactic astronomy need to be addressed with spectroscopic follow-up. Methods. Here we report the first measurements of its radial velocity and chemical abundance based on near-infrared high-resolution spectroscopy. Results. We found that this cluster has a counterrotating orbit constrained within 1.0\,kpc of the centre, as close as 0.2 kpc at the perigalacticon, confirming that the cluster is not a passerby from the halo but a genuine survivor enduring the harsh conditions of the Galactic mill's tidal forces. In addition, its metallicity and $\alpha$ abundance ([$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq +0.4$ and [Fe/H]$=-0.54$) are similar to some globular clusters in the bulge. Recent studies suggest that stars with such $\alpha$-enhanced stars were more common at 3 - 6 kpc from the centre around 10 Gyrs ago. Conclusions. We infer that VVV CL002 was formed outside but is currently falling down to the centre, exhibiting a real-time event that must have occurred to many clusters a long time ago.
#### Accretion-induced flickering variability among symbiotic stars from  space photometry with NASA TESS
 - **Authors:** J. Merc, P. G. Beck, S. Mathur, R. A. García

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic binaries exhibit a wide range of photometric variability spanning different timescales attributed to orbital motion, intrinsic variability of individual components, or the interaction between the two stars. In the range from minutes to hours, variability induced by accretion processes, likely originating from the accretion disks, denoted as flickering, is detected. This variability could mimic solar-like oscillations exhibited by luminous red giants. We aim to investigate whether it is possible to utilize the precise observations of the NASA TESS mission to detect flickering in symbiotic stars despite such studies being usually performed at shorter wavelengths. Additionally, our goal is to develop a quantitative method for the detection of accretion-induced flickering that does not rely solely on subjective assessment of the light curves. We obtain the light curves of known symbiotic stars and a comprehensive control sample of assumed single red giants from the TESS FFIs. From the processed light curves and their PSD, we measure the amplitudes of the variability and other parameters. We introduce a method that enables the differentiation between flickering sources and stars that do not exhibit this variability. We detect flickering-like variability in 20 symbiotic stars utilizing TESS data, with 13 of them being previously unidentified as flickering sources. Moreover, the TESS observations facilitate the detection of related variations occurring over timescales of a few days, as well as changes in the flickering behavior across multiple sectors. The flickering has now been likely detected in a total of 35 known symbiotic stars. When focusing solely on accreting-only symbiotic stars where the detection of flickering is presumably more straightforward, the fraction could reach as high as ~80%. This suggests that accretion disks may be rather prevalent in these binaries.
#### A Hamiltonian for 1:1 Rotational Secondary Resonances, and Application  to Small Satellites of Saturn and Jupiter

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the dynamics of rotation of the small satellites Methone and Aegaeon and revisit previous works on the rotation of Prometheus, Metis, and Amalthea. In all cases, the surfaces of section computed with the standard spin-orbit model reveal that the synchronous regime shares another large domain in the rotation phase space. We reproduce and apply the hamiltonian theory given in Wisdom (2004) to analytically characterize the detected structure as being a secondary resonance where the period of oscillations around the synchronism is similar to the orbital period. Being that the current rotational states of this sort of satellite should be synchronous (Thomas and Helfenstein 2020), our results can be taken into account in evolutionary studies of their rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Causal relationships in conformal geometry are used to analyze angular boundaries of cosmic microwave background (CMB) correlations. It is shown that curvature correlations limited to timelike intervals on world lines that have connected causal diamonds during inflation generate an angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of gravitationally-induced CMB anisotropy that vanishes in a range of angular separation from $\Theta= \pi/2 - \arcsin(1/4)$ to as far as $\Theta=3\pi/4$. This model-independent symmetry is shown to agree remarkably well with even-parity and dipole-corrected CMB correlations measured in all-sky maps from the WMAP and Planck satellites. Realizations of the standard quantum field theory cosmological model are shown to produce comparably small correlation with probabilities ranging from $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-1.5}$, depending on the map and range of angular separation. These measurements are interpreted as evidence for a causal symmetry based on a basic physical principle not included in the effective field theory approximation to cosmological quantum gravity: quantum fluctuations only generate physical correlations of spacetime curvature within regions bounded by causal diamonds. Theoretical implications and further cosmological tests of this interpretation are briefly discussed.
