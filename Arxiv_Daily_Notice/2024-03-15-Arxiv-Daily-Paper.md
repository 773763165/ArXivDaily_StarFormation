 - **Abstract**
 A major focus of the planetary science and astrobiology community is the understanding of planetary habitability, including the myriad factors that control the evolution and sustainability of temperate surface environments such as that of Earth. The few substantial terrestrial planetary atmospheres within the Solar System serve as a critical resource in studying these habitability factors, from which models can be constructed for application to extrasolar planets. The recent Astronomy and Astrophysics and Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Surveys both emphasise the need for an improved understanding of planetary habitability as an essential goal within the context of astrobiology. The divergence in climate evolution of Venus and Earth provides a major, accessible basis for understanding how the habitability of large rocky worlds evolves with time and what conditions limit the boundaries of habitability. Here, we argue that Venus can be considered an "anchor point" for understanding planetary habitability within the context of terrestrial planet evolution. We discuss the major factors that have influenced the respective evolutionary pathways of Venus and Earth, how these factors might be weighted in their overall influence, and the measurements that will shed further light on their impacts of these worlds' histories. We further discuss the importance of Venus with respect to both of the recent decadal surveys, and how these community consensus reports can help shape the exploration of Venus in the coming decades.

 - **Abstract**
 JAX is widely used in machine learning and scientific computing, the latter of which often relies on existing high-performance code that we would ideally like to incorporate into JAX. Reimplementing the existing code in JAX is often impractical and the existing interface in JAX for binding custom code requires deep knowledge of JAX and its C++ backend. The goal of JAXbind is to drastically reduce the effort required to bind custom functions implemented in other programming languages to JAX. Specifically, JAXbind provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining custom so-called JAX primitives that support arbitrary JAX transformations.

 - **Abstract**
 This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $\alpha$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $\alpha$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $\alpha$, as $\alpha$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $\alpha$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $\alpha$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.
#### PAPERCLIP: Associating Astronomical Observations and Natural Language  with Multi-Modal Models

 - **Abstract**
 We present PAPERCLIP (Proposal Abstracts Provide an Effective Representation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), a method which associates astronomical observations imaged by telescopes with natural language using a neural network model. The model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model using successful observing proposal abstracts and corresponding downstream observations, with the abstracts optionally summarized via guided generation using large language models (LLMs). Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as an example, we show that the fine-tuned model embodies a meaningful joint representation between observations and natural language through tests targeting image retrieval (i.e., finding the most relevant observations using natural language queries) and description retrieval (i.e., querying for astrophysical object classes and use cases most relevant to a given observation). Our study demonstrates the potential for using generalist foundation models rather than task-specific models for interacting with astronomical data by leveraging text as an interface.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite a burgeoning set of ultracool dwarf ($\leq$M7) radio detections, their radio emissions remain enigmatic. Open questions include the plasma source and acceleration mechanisms for the non-auroral "quiescent" component of these objects' radio emissions, which can trace Jovian synchrotron radiation belt analogs. Ultracool dwarf binary systems can provide test beds for examining the underlying physics for these plasma processes. We extend a recently developed occurrence rate calculation framework to compare the quiescent radio occurrence rate of binary systems to single objects. This generalized and semi-analytical framework can be applied to any set of astrophysical objects conceptualized as unresolved binary systems with approximately steady-state emission or absorption. We combine data available in the literature to create samples of 179 single ultracool dwarfs (82 M dwarfs, 74 L dwarfs, and 23 T/Y dwarfs) and 27 binary ultracool dwarf systems. Using these samples, we show that quiescent radio emissions occur in $54^{+11}_{-11}$ - $65^{+11}_{-12}$ per cent of binaries where both components are ultracool dwarfs, depending on priors. We also show that binarity enhances the ultracool dwarf quiescent radio occurrence rate relative to their single counterparts. Finally, we discuss potential implications for the underlying drivers of ultracool dwarf quiescent radio emissions, including possible plasma sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets in the ultra-hot Jupiter regime provide an excellent laboratory for testing the impact of stellar irradiation on the dynamics and chemical composition of gas giant atmospheres. In this study, we observed two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b with MAROON-X/Gemini-North to probe its high-altitude atmospheric layers, using strong absorption lines. We derived posterior probability distributions for the planetary and stellar parameters by calculating the stellar spectrum behind the planet at every orbital phase during the transit. This was used to correct the Rossiter-McLaughlin imprint on the transmission spectra. Using differential transmission spectroscopy, we detect strong absorption lines of Ca+, Ba+, Na, H$\alpha$, Mg, Fe, and Fe+, providing an unprecedented and detailed view of the atmospheric chemical composition. Ca+ absorption is particularly well suited for analysis through time-resolved narrow-band spectroscopy, owing to its transition lines formed in high-altitude layers. The spectral absorption lines show no significant blueshifts that would indicate high-altitude day-to-night winds, and further analysis is needed to investigate the implications for atmospheric dynamics. These high signal-to-noise observations provide a benchmark data set for testing high-resolution retrievals and the assumptions of atmospheric models. We also simulate observations of WASP-189 b with ANDES/ELT, and show that ANDES will be highly sensitive to the individual absorption lines of a myriad of elements and molecules, including TiO and CO.

 - **Abstract**
 Located at less than 2pc away, Luhman16AB (WISE.J104915.57-531906.1) is the closest pair of brown dwarfs and third closest `stellar' system to Earth. An exoplanet candidate in the Luhman16 binary system was reported in 2017 based on a weak astrometric signature in the analysis of 12 HST epochs. An additional epoch collected in 2018 and re-analysis of the data with more advanced methods further increased the significance level of the candidate, consistent with a Neptune-mass exoplanet orbiting one of the Luhman16 brown dwarf components. We report the joint analysis of these previous data together with two new astrometric HST epochs we obtained to confirm or disprove this astrometric signature. Our new analysis rules out presence of a planet orbiting one component of the Luhman16AB system for masses M > 1.5 M_Nep (Neptune masses) and periods between 400 and 5000 days. However, the presence of third bodies with masses M < 3 M_Nep and periods between 2 and 400 days (~1.1yrs) can not be excluded. Our measurements make significant improvements to the characterization of this sub-stellar binary, including its mass-ratio 0.8305+/-0.0006, individual component masses 35.4+/-0.2 M_Jup and 29.4+/-0.2 M_Jup (Jupiter masses), and parallax distance 1.9960pc +/- 50AU. Comparison of the masses and luminosities of Luhman16AB to several evolutionary models shows persistent discrepancies in the ages of the two components, but strengthens the case that this system is a member of the 510+/-95 Myr Oceanus Moving Group.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion of tidally disrupted planetary bodies is the current consensus model for the presence of photospheric metals commonly detected in white dwarfs. While most dynamical studies have considered a single star and associated planetary instabilities, several investigations have instead considered the influence of widely-bound stellar companions as potential drivers of white dwarf pollution. This study examines the prevalence of wide binaries among polluted white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 astrometry, where three samples are investigated: 71 DAZ stars with metals detected in the ultraviolet using Hubble, and two groups of DZ stars identified via SDSS spectroscopy, comprised of 116 warmer and 101 cooler sources. Each sample was searched for spatially-resolved, co-moving companions, and compared to the same analysis of thousands of field white dwarfs within overlapping regions of the Gaia HR diagram. The wide binary fraction of the DAZ sample is $10.6_{-3.2}^{+3.9}$ per cent, and within $1 \sigma$ of the corresponding field. However, the search yields wide binary fractions of less than 1.8 per cent for the two independent DZ star catalogues, which are each distinct from their fields by more than $3 \sigma$. Both sets of results support that pollution in white dwarfs is not the result of stellar companions, and the delivery of metals to white dwarf surfaces is caused by major planets. The discrepancy between the DAZ and DZ star wide binary fractions cannot be caused by white dwarf spectral evolution, suggesting these two populations may have distinct planetary architectures.
#### Friends not Foes: Strong Correlation between Inner Super-Earths and  Outer Gas Giants

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between outer gas giants and inner super-Earths reflects their formation and evolutionary histories. Past work exploring this link has suggested a tentative positive correlation between these two populations, but these studies have been limited by small sample sizes and in some cases sample biases. Here we take a new look at this connection with a sample of 184 super-Earth systems with publicly available radial velocity data and fully resolved outer gas giants. We calculate the frequency of outer gas giants (GG) in super-Earth (SE) systems, dividing our sample into metal-rich ([Fe/H] $>$ 0) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq$0) hosts. We find P(GG$|$SE, [Fe/H]$>$0) = 28.0$^{+4.9}_{-4.6}\%$ and P(GG$|$SE, [Fe/H]$\leq$0) = 4.5$^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\%$. Comparing these conditional occurrence rates to field giant occurrence rates from Wittenmyer et al. 2020, we show that there is a distinct positive correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants for metal-rich host stars at the 2.5$\sigma$ level, but this correlation disappears for metal-poor systems. We further find that, around metal-rich stars, the GG/SE correlation enhances for systems with giants that are more distant (beyond 3 AU) and/or more eccentric ($e > 0.2$), while gas giant multiplicity does not appear to affect the level of correlation. Such trends again disappear around metal-poor stars with the exception of systems of multiple giants in which we observe an anti-correlation. Our findings highlight the critical role metallicity (disk solid budget) plays in shaping the overall planetary architecture.
#### White Dwarf Merger Remnants: The DAQ Subclass

 - **Abstract**
 Four years after the discovery of a unique DAQ white dwarf with a hydrogen-dominated and carbon-rich atmosphere, we report the discovery of four new DAQ white dwarfs, including two that were not recognized properly in the literature. We find all five DAQs in a relatively narrow mass and temperature range of $M=1.14-1.19~M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\rm eff}=13,000-17,000$ K. In addition, at least two show photometric variations due to rapid rotation with $\approx10$ min periods. All five are also kinematically old, but appear photometrically young with estimated cooling ages of about 1 Gyr based on standard cooling tracks, and their masses are roughly twice the mass of the most common white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. These characteristics are smoking gun signatures of white dwarf merger remnants. Comparing the DAQ sample with warm DQ white dwarfs, we demonstrate that there is a range of hydrogen abundances among the warm DQ population, and the distinction between DAQ and warm DQ white dwarfs is superficial. We discuss the potential evolutionary channels for the emergence of the DAQ subclass, and suggest that DAQ white dwarfs are trapped on the crystallization sequence, and may remain there for a significant fraction of the Hubble time.
#### ALMA Observations of Molecular Line Emission from High-excitation  Bipolar Planetary Nebulae

 - **Abstract**
 We present early results from our program of ALMA Band 6 (1.3mm) molecular line mapping of a sample of nearby, well-studied examples of high-excitation, bipolar/pinched-waist and molecule-rich planetary nebulae (Hubble 5 and NGC 2440, 2818, 2899, 6302, and 6445). We have mapped these planetary nebulae (PNe) in isotopologues of CO as well as various molecular line tracers of high-energy irradiation, such as HCN, CN, HNC, and HCO+, with the complementary goals of establishing nebular kinematics as well as the zones of UV-heated and X-ray-ionized molecular gas within each nebula. The resulting high-resolution ALMA molecular emission-line maps reveal the regions of high-excitation bipolar PNe in which molecular gas, presumably ejected during asymptotic giant branch stages of the PN progenitor stars, survives and evolves chemically. We present a summary of molecular species detected to date in the sample nebulae, and we use example results for one PN (NGC 6455) to demonstrate the power of the ALMA data in revealing the structures, kinematics, and compositions of the equatorial molecular tori that are a common feature of the sample objects.
#### Timing the Milky Way bar formation and the accompanying radial migration  episode

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08963
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08963
 - **Abstract**
 We derive the metallicity profile of the Milky Way low-$\alpha$ disc population from 2 to 20 kpc from the Galactic centre in 1 Gyr age bins using the astroNN catalogue, and show that it is highly structured, with a plateau between 4 and 7 kpc and a break at 10-12 kpc. We argue that these features result from the two main bar resonances, the corotation and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR), respectively. We show that the break in the metallicity profile is most visible in stars having 7-8 Gyr, reaching an amplitude of about 0.4 dex, and is the signpost of the position of the bar OLR. The bar formation was accompanied by an episode of radial migration triggered by its slowing down and is responsible for spreading old metal-rich stars up to the OLR. The data show that the slowdown of the bar ended 6-7 Gyr ago. Based on numerical simulations that reproduce well the break observed in the metallicity profile, we argue that this implies that the bar formed in our Galaxy 8-10 Gyr ago. Analysis of the metallicity distribution as a function of radius shows no evidence of significant systematic outward radial migration after this first episode. We argue that the variation of the metallicity dispersion as a function of the guiding radius is dominated by the migration triggered by the bar, but also that the libration of orbits around the bar resonances induces a mixing that may have a significant impact on the observed metallicity dispersion. In contrast, the absence of a break in the metallicity profile of populations younger than about $\sim$6 Gyr and the flattening of the gradient at younger ages is interpreted as evidence that the strength of the bar has decreased, loosening its barrier effect and allowing the gas and metals on both sides of the OLR to mix, erasing the break. Beyond the OLR, stars younger than 7 Gyr show very small metallicity dispersion, suggesting no or limited mixing.
#### Constraining Self-interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter From the Black  Hole Shadow of the Event Horizon Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 An exciting possibility to constrain dark matter (DM) scenarios is to search for their gravitational imprints on Black Hole (BH) observations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of self-interacting scalar field DM on the shadow radius of a Schwarzschild BH. We implement a self-consistent formulation, paying attention to the enhancement of the DM density due to the BH gravitational influence and the accretion flow onto the BH. First, we calculate the first-order correction to the shadow radius caused by a general DM environment. Then, we apply this perturbative method to the case of self-interacting scalar field DM and derive analytical expressions for the critical impact parameter. We find that self-consistency requirements, involving the lifetime and the mass of the central DM soliton, or the mass and the size of the extended virialized DM halo, ensure that the impact of the DM environment on the shadow radius is below the observational upper bound. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account the self-consistency constraints of the underlying DM scenario, which can strongly limit the range of possible DM density profiles and their impact on the shadow radius.
#### Uncovering the Invisible: A Study of Gaia18ajz, a Candidate Black Hole  Revealed by Microlensing

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, we applied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe DarkLensCode, an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $t_\mathrm{E}=316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $t_\mathrm{E}=299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $M_L = 5.6^{+7.5}_{-2.5} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.05^{+0.78}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$ or $M_L = 12.0^{+14.9}_{-5.4} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.18^{+0.82}_{-0.63}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.

 - **Abstract**
 Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic characteristics of solar flares can be used as a benchmark for the detection and analyses of stellar flares. Here, we study the Sun-as-a-star properties of an X1.0 solar flare using high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained by the Chinese $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). A noise reduction algorithm based on discrete Fourier transformation is first employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the space-integral $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ spectrum with a focus on its typical characteristics. For the flare of interest, we find that the average $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profile displays a strong emission at the line center and an obvious line broadening. It also presents a clear red asymmetry, corresponding to a redshift velocity of around $50 \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ that slightly decreases with time, consistent with previous results. Furthermore, we study how the size of the space-integral region affects the characteristics of the flare Sun-as-a-star $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profile. It is found that although the redshift velocity calculated from the $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profile remains unchanged, the detectability of the characteristics weakens as the space-integral region becomes large. An upper limit for the size of the target region where the red asymmetry is detectable is estimated. It is also found that the intensity in $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profiles, measured by the equivalent widths of the spectra, are significantly underestimated if the $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ spectra are further averaged in the time domain.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically simulate the motion of a black hole as it plunges radially through an ultralight dark matter soliton. We investigate the timescale in which dynamical friction reduces the kinetic energy of the black hole to a minimum, and consider the sensitivity of this timescale to changes in the ULDM particle mass, the total soliton mass, and the mass of the black hole. We contrast our numerical results with a semi-analytic treatment of dynamical friction, and find that the latter is poorly suited to this scenario. In particular, we find that the back-reaction of the soliton to the presence of the black hole is significant, resulting in oscillations in the coefficient of dynamical friction which cannot be described in the simple semi-analytical framework. Furthermore, we observe a late-time reheating effect, in which a significant amount of kinetic energy is transferred back to the black hole after an initial damping phase. This complicates the discussion of ULDM dynamical friction on the scales relevant to the final parsec problem.

 - **Abstract**
 From the mid-19th century to the end of the 20th century, photographic plates served as the primary detectors for astronomical observations. Astronomical photographic observations in China began in 1901, and over a century, a total of approximately 30,000 astronomical photographic plates have been captured. These historical plates play an irreplaceable role in conducting long-term, time-domain astronomical research. To preserve and explore these valuable original astronomical observational data, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory has organized the transportation of plates taken at night from various stations across the country to the Sheshan Plate Archive for centralized preservation. For the first time, plate information statistics was performed. On this basis, the plates were cleaned and digitally scanned, and finally digitized images were acquired for 29,314 plates. In this study, using Gaia DR2 as the reference star catalog, astrometric processing has been carried out successfully on 15,696 single-exposure plates, including object extraction, stellar identification, and plate model computation. As a result, for long focal length telescopes, such as the 40cm double-tube refractor telescope and the 1.56m reflector telescope at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the 1m reflector telescope at the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, the astrometric accuracy obtained for their plates is approximately 0.1" to 0.3". The distribution of astrometric accuracy for medium and short focal length telescopes ranges from 0.3" to 1.0". The relevant data of this batch of plates, including digitized images and stellar catalog of the plates are archived and released by the National Astronomical Data Center. Users can access and download plate data based on keywords such as station, telescope, observation year, and observed celestial coordinates.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of protoplanetary disks has become increasingly important with the Kepler satellite finding that exoplanets are ubiquitous around stars in our galaxy and the discovery of enormous diversity in planetary system architectures and planet properties. High-resolution near-IR and ALMA images show strong evidence for ongoing planet formation in young disks. The JWST MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) aims to (1) investigate the chemical inventory in the terrestrial planet-forming zone across stellar spectral type, (2) follow the gas evolution into the disk dispersal stage, and (3) study the structure of protoplanetary and debris disks in the thermal mid-IR. The MINDS survey will thus build a bridge between the chemical inventory of disks and the properties of exoplanets. The survey comprises 52 targets (Herbig Ae stars, T Tauri stars, very low-mass stars and young debris disks). We primarily obtain MIRI/MRS spectra with high S/N (~100-500) covering the complete wavelength range from 4.9 to 27.9 {\mu}m. For a handful of selected targets we also obtain NIRSpec IFU high resolution spectroscopy (2.87-5.27 {\mu}m). We will search for signposts of planet formation in thermal emission of micron-sized dust - information complementary to near-IR scattered light emission from small dust grains and emission from large dust in the submillimeter wavelength domain. We will also study the spatial structure of disks in three key systems that have shown signposts for planet formation, TW Hya and HD 169142 using the MIRI coronagraph at 15.5 {\mu}m and 10.65 {\mu}m respectively and PDS70 using NIRCam imaging in the 1.87 {\mu}m narrow and the 4.8 {\mu}m medium band filter. ...

 - **Abstract**
 The question of the global topology of the Universe (cosmic topology) is still open. In the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model it is assumed that the space of the Universe possesses the trivial topology of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and thus that the Universe has an infinite volume. As an alternative, we study in this paper one of the simplest non-trivial topologies given by a cubic 3-torus describing a universe with a finite volume. To probe cosmic topology, we analyse certain structure properties in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using Betti Functionals and the Euler Characteristic evaluated on excursions sets, which possess a simple geometrical interpretation. Since the CMB temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ are observed on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ surrounding the observer, there are only three Betti functionals $\beta_k(\nu)$, $k=1,2,3$. Here $\nu=\delta T/\sigma_0$ denotes the temperature threshold normalized by the standard deviation $\sigma_0$ of $\delta T$. Analytic approximations of the Gaussian expectations for the Betti functionals and an exact formula for the Euler characteristic are given. It is shown that the amplitudes of $\beta_0(\nu)$ and $\beta_1(\nu)$ decrease with increasing volume $V=L^3$ of the cubic 3-torus universe. Since the computation of the $\beta_k$'s from observational sky maps is hindered due to the presence of masks, we suggest a method yielding lower and upper bounds for them and apply it to four Planck 2018 sky maps. It is found that the $\beta_k$'s of the Planck maps lie between those of the torus universes with side-lengths $L=2.0$ and $L=3.0$ in units of the Hubble length and above the infinite $\Lambda$CDM case. These results give a further hint that the Universe has a non-trivial topology.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the metallicity distribution and evolution in the Galactic disk based on the largest sample of open star clusters in the Galaxy. From the catalogue of 1879 open clusters in the range of Galactocentric distance (R_GC) from 4 to 20 kpc, we investigate the variation of metallicity in the Galactic disk as functions of R_GC, vertical distance (Z), and ages of the clusters. In the direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane, variation in metallicity is found to follow a stepped linear relation. We estimate a vertical metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/dZ of -0.545+/-0.046 dex/kpc for |Z| < 0.487 kpc, and -0.075+/-0.093 dex/kpc for 0.487 < |Z| < 1.8 kpc. On average, metallicity variations above and below the Galactic plane are found to change at similar rates. The change in metallicity in the radial direction is also found to follow a two-function linear relation. We obtain a radial metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/d[R_GC] of -0.070+/-0.002 dex/kpc for 4.0<R_GC<12.8 kpc, and -0.005+/-0.018 dex/kpc for 12.8< R_GC < 20.5 kpc which clearly shows a strong variation in the metallicity gradient when moving from the inner to the outer Galactic disk. Age-metallicity relation (AMR) is found to follow a steeper negative slope of -0.031+/-0.006 dex/Gyr for clusters older than 240 Myr, however, there is some hint of positive metallicity age gradient for younger clusters.
#### A secular solar system resonance that disrupts the dominant cycle in  Earth's orbital eccentricity (g2-g5): Implications for astrochronology

 - **Abstract**
 The planets' gravitational interaction causes rhythmic changes in Earth's orbital parameters (also called Milankovi\'c cycles), which have powerful applications in geology and astrochronology. For instance, the primary astronomical eccentricity cycle due to the secular frequency term (g2-g5) (~405 kyr in the recent past) utilized in deep-time analyses is dominated by Venus' and Jupiter's orbits, aka long eccentricity cycle. The widely accepted and long-held view is that (g2-g5) was practically stable in the past and may hence be used as a "metronome" to reconstruct accurate ages and chronologies. However, using state-of-the-art integrations of the solar system, we show here that (g2-g5) can become unstable over long time scales, without major changes in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. The (g2-g5) disruption is due to the secular resonance $\sigma_{12}$ = (g1 - g2) + (s1 - s2), a major contributor to solar system chaos. We demonstrate that entering/exiting the $\sigma_{12}$ resonance is a common phenomenon on long time scales, occurring in ~40% of our solutions. During $\sigma_{12}$-resonance episodes, (g2-g5) is very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. Our results have fundamental implications for geology and astrochronology, as well as climate forcing because the paradigm that the longest Milankovi\'c cycle dominates Earth's astronomical forcing, is stable, and has a period of ~405 kyr requires revision.

 - **Abstract**
 Expanding X-ray halo or rings appear when short pulses of X-ray radiation from a background source are scattered by clouds of dust in the Milky Way. We study the X-ray rings of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, detected by the {\it Swift} X-Ray Telescope. The rings center on the GRB position and their angular radii increase with time. We identify five major expanding rings, and our modeling of their expansion history suggests that they are scattered off, respectively, from five dusty clouds at distances of 0.4-13 kpc from the observer. Given an assumed prompt X-ray fluence of this GRB, the fluxes of those rings suggest that these clouds have dust grain column densities of $10^{7\sim8}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. More interestingly, our time-dependent spectral analysis of these rings show that they all experience spectral softening, i.e., getting softer as they expand, with spectral indices ranging from 2.2 to 5, consistent with what the dust scattering model predicts.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmosphere of Triton was probed directly by observing a ground-based stellar occultation on 6 October 2022. This rare event yielded 23 positive light curves collected from 13 separate observation stations contributing to our campaign. The significance of this event lies in its potential to directly validate the modest pressure fluctuation on Triton, a phenomenon not definitively verified by previous observations, including only five stellar occultations, and the Voyager 2 radio occultation in 1989. Using an approach consistent with a comparable study, we precisely determined a surface pressure of $14.07_{-0.13}^{+0.21}~\mathrm{\mu bar}$ in 2022. This new pressure rules out any significant monotonic variation in pressure between 2017 and 2022 through direct observations, as it is in alignment with the 2017 value. Additionally, both the pressures in 2017 and 2022 align with the 1989 value. This provides further support for the conclusion drawn from the previous volatile transport model simulation, which is consistent with the observed alignment between the pressures in 1989 and 2017; that is to say, the pressure fluctuation is modest. Moreover, this conclusion suggests the existence of a northern polar cap extended down to at least $45^\circ$N$-60^\circ$N and the presence of nitrogen between $30^\circ$S and $0^\circ$.

 - **Abstract**
 Redbacks are millisecond pulsar binaries with low mass, irradiated companions. These systems have a rich phenomenology that can be used to probe binary evolution models, pulsar wind physics, and the neutron star mass distribution. A number of high-confidence redback candidates have been identified through searches for variable optical and X-ray sources within the localisation regions of unidentified but pulsar-like Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sources. However, these candidates remain unconfirmed until pulsations are detected. As part of the TRAPUM project, we searched for radio pulsations from six of these redback candidates with MeerKAT. We discovered three new radio millisecond pulsars, PSRs J0838$-$2527, J0955$-$3947 and J2333$-$5526, confirming their redback nature. PSR J0838$-$2827 remained undetected for two years after our discovery despite repeated observations, likely due to evaporated material absorbing the radio emission for long periods of time. While, to our knowledge, this system has not undergone a transition to an accreting state, the disappearance, likely caused by extreme eclipses, illustrates the transient nature of spider pulsars and the heavy selection bias in uncovering their radio population. Radio timing enabled the detection of gamma-ray pulsations from all three pulsars, from which we obtained 15-year timing solutions. All of these sources exhibit complex orbital period variations consistent with gravitational quadrupole moment variations in the companion stars. These timing solutions also constrain the binary mass ratios, allowing us to narrow down the pulsar masses. We find that PSR J2333$-$5526 may have a neutron star mass in excess of 2 M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar-system test of MOND that probes the sub-critical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of $10^2$-$10^5$ au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion > 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.
#### Determining stellar accretion rates from $Pa_α$ and $Br_β$  emission lines with JWST NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter we present the first systematic spectroscopic measurements of the Near-InfraRed (NIR) hydrogen recombination lines $Pa_{\alpha}$ ($\lambda = 1.875 \mu m$) and $Br_{\beta}$ ($\lambda = 2.626 \mu m$), produced by pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. These stars, consisting of T Tauri and Herbig AeBe stars are located in the massive Galactic star-formation region NGC 3603. The measurements were obtained from JWST NIRSpec, using multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode. Utilising existing empirical relations between $L_{acc}$ and $L_{Br_{\gamma}}$, we have used our new measurements to formulate, for the first time, an empirical relationship between the accretion luminosity $L_{acc}$ of the stars, and the line luminosities $L_{line}$ of both $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$. These relationships are: $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.42 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Pa_{\alpha}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 3.33 (\pm 0.42)$ and $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.47 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Br_{\beta}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 4.60 (\pm 0.57)$. These new relationships are key for roughly estimating the accretion rates for large samples of PMS stars with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the effects of stellar feedback on the gravitational state of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we study $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ALMA maps of nine GMCs distributed throughout the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the nearest star-forming galaxy to our own. We perform noise and resolution matching on the sample, working at a common resolution of 3.5 arcseconds (0.85 pc at the LMC distance of 50 kpc), and use the \textit{SCIMES} clustering algorithm to identify discrete substructure, or "clumps." We supplement these data with three tracers of recent star formation: $8\mu$m surface brightness, continuum-subtracted H$\alpha$ flux, and interstellar radiation field energy density inferred from dust emission. The $^{12}$CO clumps identified cover a range of 3.6 dex in luminosity-based mass and 2.4 dex in average $8\mu$m surface brightness, representative of the wide range of conditions of the interstellar medium in the LMC. Our observations suggest evidence for increased turbulence in these clouds. While the turbulent linewidths are correlated with clump surface density, in agreement with previous observations, we find even better correlation with the three star formation activity tracers considered, suggesting stellar energy injection plays a significant role in the dynamical state of the clumps. The excess linewidths we measure do not appear to result from opacity broadening. $^{12}$CO clumps are found to be typically less gravitationally bound than $^{13}$CO clumps, with some evidence of the kinetic-to-gravitational potential energy ratio increasing with star-formation tracers. Further multi-line analysis may better constrain the assumptions made in these calculations.
#### A comprehensive study of orbital evolution of LMC X-4: Existence of a  second derivative of the orbital period

 - **Abstract**
 We report here results from pulse arrival time delay analysis of the eclipsing high mass X-ray binary pulsar LMC X-4 using observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and AstroSat. Combining the orbital parameters determined from these observations with the historical measurements dating back to 1998, we have extended the $T_{\pi/2}$ epoch history of LMC X-4 by about 4600 binary orbits spanning about 18 years. We also report mid-eclipse time measurements ($T_{ecl}$) using data obtained from wide-field X-ray monitors of MAXI-GSC and Swift-BAT. Combining the new $T_{\pi/2}$ and $T_{ecl}$ estimates with all the previously reported values, we have significantly improved the orbital evolution measurement, which indicates that the orbital period is evolving at a time scale ($P_{\rm orb}/\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ ) of about 0.8 Myr. For the first time in an accreting X-ray pulsar system, we confirm the existence of a second derivative of the orbital period, having an evolution time scale ($\dot{P}_{orb}/\ddot{P}_{orb}$) of about 55 yr. Detection of a second derivative of the orbital period in LMC X-4 makes its orbital evolution timescale more uncertain, which may also be true for other HMXBs. Independent solutions for the orbital evolution measurement using the mid-eclipse data and the pulse timing data are consistent with each other, and help us put an upper limit of 0.009 on the eccentricity of the binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models (SAMs) for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our SAMs can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.
