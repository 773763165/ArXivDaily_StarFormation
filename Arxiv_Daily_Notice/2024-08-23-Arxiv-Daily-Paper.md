 - **Abstract**
 Stars with initial masses larger than 8 solar masses undergo substantial mass loss through mechanisms that remain elusive. Unraveling the origins of this mass loss is important for comprehending the evolutionary path of these stars, the type of supernova explosion and whether they become neutron stars or black hole remnants. In 2022 December, RW Cep experienced the Great Dimming in its visible brightness, presenting a unique opportunity to understand mass loss mechanisms. Our previous observations of RW Cep from the CHARA Array, taken during the dimming phase, show a compelling asymmetry in the star images, with a darker zone on the west side of the star indicating presence of dust in front of the star in our line of sight. Here, we present multi-epoch observations from CHARA while the star re-brightened in 2023. We created images using three image reconstruction methods and an analytical model fit. Comparisons of images acquired during the dimming and re-brightening phases reveal remarkable differences. Specifically, the west side of RW Cep, initially obscured during the dimming phase, reappeared during the subsequent re-brightening phase and the measured angular diameter became larger by 8%. We also observed image changes from epoch to epoch while the star is brightening indicating the time evolution of dust in front of the star. We suggest that the dimming of RW Cep was a result from a recent surface mass ejection event, generating a dust cloud that partially obstructed the stellar photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The progenitor system(s) as well as the explosion mechanism(s) of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae are long-standing issues in astrophysics. Here we present ejecta masses and other physical parameters for 28 recent Type Ia supernovae inferred from multiband photometric and optical spectroscopic data. Our results confirm that the majority of SNe Ia show {\it observable} ejecta masses below the Chandrasekhar-limit (having a mean $M_{\rm ej} \approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$), consistent with the predictions of recent sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ explosion models. They are compatible with models assuming either single- or double-degenerate progenitor configurations. We also recover a sub-sample of supernovae within $1.2 $ M$_\odot$ $< M_{\rm {ej}} < 1.5$ M$_\odot$ that are consistent with near-Chandrasekhar explosions. Taking into account the uncertainties of the inferred ejecta masses, about half of our SNe are compatible with both explosion models. We compare our results with those in previous studies, and discuss the caveats and concerns regarding the applied methodology.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the amount of publicly available astronomical data has increased exponentially, with a remarkable example being large scale multiepoch photometric surveys. This wealth of data poses challenges to the classical methodologies commonly employed in the study of variable objects. As a response, deep learning techniques are increasingly being explored to effectively classify, analyze, and interpret these large datasets. In this paper we use two-dimensional histograms to represent Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) phasefolded light curves as images. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify variable objects within eight different categories (from now on labels): Classical Cepheid (CEP), RR Lyrae (RR), Long Period Variable (LPV), Miras (M), Ellipsoidal Binary (ELL), Delta Scuti (DST), Eclipsing Binary (E), and spurious class with Incorrect Periods (Rndm). We set up different training sets to train the same CNN architecture in order to characterize the impact of the training. The training sets were built from the same source of labels but different filters and balancing techniques were applied. Namely: Undersampling (U), Data Augmentation (DA), and Batch Balancing (BB). The best performance was achieved with the BB approach and a training sample size of $\sim$370000 stars. Regarding computational performance, the image representation production rate is of $\sim$76 images per core per second, and the time to predict is $\sim$ 60$\, \mu\text{s}$ per star. The accuracy of the classification improves from $\sim$ 92%, when based only on the CNN, to $\sim$ 98% when the results of the CNN are combined with the period and amplitude features in a two step approach. This methodology achieves comparable results with previous studies but with two main advantages: the identification of miscalculated periods and the improvement in computational time cost.

 - **Abstract**
 The accumulation of accreted matter onto the neutron star surface triggers exothermic reactions in the crust. The heat released as a result influences the luminosity exhibited by the X-ray transient. The most common approach to the kinetics of exothermic reactions in the crust of accreting neutron stars is to consider an infinite reaction rate. Here, we investigate accretion-related heat release in the accreted outer crust of a neutron star by including a time-dependent accretion cycle and experimentally based reaction rates in the kinetics of electron captures above the reaction threshold. A simple model was used to compute the zero temperature equation of state of a crust in which two nuclei can coexist. We solved the abundance of parent nuclei as a function of the depth in the star and the time variable using astrophysically motivated features of the accreting system. We calculated the heat release and neutrino loss associated to reactions in the outer crust. We report the existence of layers in the outer crust, which contain both parent and grand-daughter nuclei of electron captures. The reactions can occur deeper in the shell than the reaction threshold, thus releasing more heat per accreted baryon for a given accretion rate. The electron capture layers continue to exist even when the accretion has stopped. The heat sources are time- and pressure-dependent in accreting crusts of neutron stars. The total heat released is a function of astrophysical (active and quiescent time) and microscopic (reaction rate) parameters Therefore, we conclude these parameters should be considered individually and carefully for a range of different sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we consider a dark matter candidate described by an ultralight vector field, whose mass is in principle in the range $H_{\rm{eq}}\sim 10^{-28}\rm{eV}\ll m< \rm{eV}$. The homogeneous background vector field is assumed to point in a given direction. We present a numerical implementation of cosmological perturbations in a Bianchi type I geometry with vector field dark matter in a modified version of the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS). We study the evolution of large-scale cosmological perturbations in the linear regime. We compute the matter power spectrums defined for Fourier modes pointing in a given direction. We obtain interesting features in the power spectrums whose observational significance depends on the field mass. We compare the results with the standard $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ and with the corresponding well-studied ultralight scalar field dark matter case. As for the scalar case we obtain a suppression in the power spectrums at small scales characterized by the same scale, namely the Jeans scale. The main characteristic feature of the vector field model we notice here for first time is that the amplitude of the suppression effect depends on the direction of the Fourier modes with respect to the background vector field, leaving eventually a possible anisotropic imprint in structure formation at small scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium or radiation fields within our Galaxy, where the production of neutrinos is also anticipated. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from sub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using publicly available 7 years of IceCube track data with the full detector, we conduct a template search using the $\gamma$-ray flux map observed by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan search of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of neutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial significance of $1.9\sigma$. The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is $4.73^{+2.53}_{-2.51}\times10^{-14}\,{\rm TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$, consistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic plane scan search, the most significant location is found at $l=63.57^{\circ}$ and $b=0.93^{\circ}$ with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of $4.6\sigma$ ($1.8\sigma$).

 - **Abstract**
 During the emergence of sunspot groups the footpoints of their leading and following parts move apart. This diverging motion results in the stretching of the active regions, which continues during the decay phase. The aim of the present work is to study the separation distance variations during the active region evolution on a large statistical sample. Altogether more than 2000 individual sunspot groups were taken into account. The investigation is mainly based on data of the SoHO/MDI - Debrecen Sunspot Data (SDD) catalog which covers the time span 1996-2010, practically the whole solar cycle 23. For check of the possible cyclical variation the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) is used which contains data for solar cycles 20-24. The separation distance is calculated between the leading and following centers of mass and starts to increase after the emergence and shows a plateau around the peak flux. The polarity separation reaches its maximum in the decay phase and then starts to decrease in the cases of the largest and medium size groups, but continues its increase in the case of the smallest groups. This decrease is caused by the eastward motion of the leading part, while the following part continues its backward motion. The separation distance is size dependent, i. e., the larger the sunspot group the greater its extent. Cycle and cycle phase dependencies as well as hemispheric connection can also be observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets grow and acquire their gas envelope during the disk phase. At the time of the discovery of giant planets in their host disk, it is important to understand the interplay between the host disk and the envelope and circum-planetary disk properties of the planet. Our aim is to investigate the dynamical and physical structure of the gas in the vicinity of a Jupiter-mass planet and study how protoplanetary disk propertiesy, determine the planetary system as well as the accretion rate inside the planet's Hill sphere.We ran global 3D simulations with the grid-based code fargOCA, using a fully radiative equation of state and a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01. We explored three models. The nominal one features a disk with surface density, Sigma, corresponding to the MMSN at the planet's location, characterised by an alpha viscosity value of 0.004. The second model has a surface density ten times smaller than the nominal one and the same viscosity. In the third model, we also reduced the viscosity value by a factor of 10. During gap formation gas is heated by compression and cools according to opacity, density, and temperature values. In the analysis of our disks, we find that the gas flowing into the Hill sphere is approximately scaled as the product Sigma nu , as expected from viscous transport while The accretion rate is scaled as sqrt(Sigma nu ).Previous studies have shown that pressure or rotationally supported structures are formed around giant planets, depending on the equation of state (EoS) or on the opacity. In the case of a fully radiative EoS and a constant dust to gas ratio of 0.01, we find that low-mass and low-viscosity circum-stellar disks favour the formation of a rotationally supported circum-planetary disk. Gas accretion leading to the doubling time of the planetary system >10^5 years has only been found in the case of a low-viscosity disk.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present paper we consider the full nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiation transfer problem. This formalism allows us to account for deviation from equilibrium distribution of both the radiation field and the massive particles. In the present study two-level atoms with broadened upper level represent the massive particles. In the absence of velocity-changing collisions, we demonstrate the analytic equivalence of the full non-LTE source function with the corresponding standard non-LTE partial frequency redistribution (PFR) model. We present an iterative method based on operator splitting techniques to numerically solve the problem at hand. We benchmark it against the standard non-LTE transfer problem for a two-level atom with PFR. We illustrate the deviation of the velocity distribution function of excited atoms from the equilibrium distribution. We also discuss the dependence of the emission profile and the velocity distribution function on elastic collisions and velocity-changing collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of Earth-like planets is a major focus of current planetology research and faces a significant technological challenge. Indeed, when it comes to detecting planets as small and cold as the Earth, the cost of observation time is massive. Understanding in what type of systems Earth-like planets (ELPs) form and how to identify them is crucial for preparing future missions such as PLATO, LIFE, or others. Theoretical models suggest that ELPs predominantly form within a certain type of system architecture. Therefore, the presence or absence of ELPs could be inferred from the arrangement of other planets within the same system. This study aims to identify the profile of a typical system that harbours an ELP by investigating the architecture of systems and the properties of their innermost detectable planets. Here, we introduce a novel method for determining the architecture of planetary systems and categorising them into four distinct classes. Using three populations of synthetic planetary systems generated using the Bern model around three different types of stars, we studied the `theoretical' architecture (the architecture of a complete planetary system) and the `biased' architecture (the architecture of a system in which only detectable planets are taken into account) of the synthetic systems. The biased architecture of a system, studied in conjunction with the mass, radius, and period of the innermost detectable planet, appears to correlate with the presence or absence of an ELP in the same system. We conclude that the detections of ELPs can be predicted thanks to the already known properties of their systems, and we present a list of the properties of the systems most likely to host such a planet.

          Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids

 - **Abstract**
 In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.

 - **Abstract**
 Beta Pictoris (Beta Pic)'s well-studied debris disk and two known giant planets, in combination with the stability of HST/STIS (and now also JWST), offers a unique opportunity to test planet-disk interaction models and to observe recent planetesimal collisions. We present HST/STIS coronagraphic imaging from two new epochs of data taken between 2021 and 2023, complementing earlier data taken in 1997 and 2012. This dataset enables the longest baseline and highest precision temporal comparison of any debris disk to date, with sensitivity to temporal surface brightness variations of sub-percentage levels in the midplane of the disk. While no localized surface brightness changes are detected, which would be indicative of a recent planetesimal collision, there is a tentative brightening of the SE side of the disk over the past decade. We link the constraints on surface brightness variations to dynamical models of the planetary system's evolution and to the collisional history of planetesimals. Using a coupled collisional model and injection/recovery framework, we estimate sensitivity to expanding collisional debris down to a Ceres-mass per progenitor in the most sensitive regions of the disk midplane. These results demonstrate the capabilities of long-baseline, temporal studies with HST (and also soon with JWST) for constraining the physical processes occurring within debris disks.

          Orbits of Binary Stars: from Visual Measures to Speckle Interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the orbits of visual binary stars has always been one of the fundamentals of astronomy. Based historically on the visual measures, nowadays the orbits rely more (or exclusively) on the accurate speckle data. This prompts reconsideration of the methods of orbit calculation, undertaken here and illustrated by 20 examples, from accurate to drastically revised and tentative orbits. Good understanding and critical assessment of the input data is a key requirement, especially concerning visual measures. Combination of visual and speckle data is still needed for long-period binaries, but the relative weights must match their respective errors. When the orbit can be fully constrained only by accurate speckle data, the old measures should be ignored. Orbits can be classified into three grades: A - fully constrained, B - semi-constrained, and C - preliminary or tentative. Typical use cases of visual orbits are listed. Accurate parallaxes from Gaia, together with the orbits, will greatly expand the data on stellar masses. Continued speckle monitoring will be an essential complement to Gaia, but the vast amount of new pairs will restrict future work on orbits to the most interesting or relevant objects.

          Quantifying $S_8$ tension and evidence for interacting dark energy from redshift-space distortion measurements

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, Weak Lensing surveys, and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ measurements from Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD) have revealed a significant ($\sim$3$-$5$\sigma$) discrepancy in the inferred value of the matter clustering parameter $S_8$. In this work, we investigate the implications of RSD for a cosmological framework postulating an interaction between Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM). We explore scenarios where DM can transfer energy-momentum to DE or vice versa. The energy-momentum flow is characterized by the strength and the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. Our baseline analysis combines RSD measurements with the latest data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observed by DESI, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus sample, and CMB data from Planck. We demonstrate that RSD measurements provide significant additional information. When energy-momentum flows from DM to DE (i.e., $\xi < 0$), these measurements set stringent new bounds on the interaction strength. Conversely, when energy-momentum flows from DE to DM ($\xi > 0$), they favor interactions at more than the $2\sigma$ confidence level. Models with $\xi > 0$ can effectively resolve the tension in $S_8$, presenting them as compelling alternatives.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical and physical structures of bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) in a nearby HII region. We focused on carbon- and oxygen-bearing species that trace photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and warm molecular cloud surfaces in order to understand the effect of UV radiation from the exciting stars on the cloud structure. We mapped four regions around the most prominent BRCs at scales of 4--10 arcmin in the HII region IC 1396 in [CII] 158 micron with (up)GREAT on board SOFIA. IC 1396 is predominantly excited by an O6.5V star. Toward IC 1396A, we also observed [OI] 63 micron and 145 micron. We combined these observations with JCMT archive data, which provide the low-J transitions of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. All spectra are velocity-resolved. The line profiles show a variety of velocity structures, which we investigated in detail for all observed emission lines. We find no clear sign of photoevaporating flows in the [CII] spectra, although the uncertainty in the location of the BRCs along the line of sight makes this interpretation inconclusive. Our analysis of the [$^{13}$CII] emission in IC 1396A suggests that the [CII] is likely mostly optically thin. The heating efficiency, measured by the ([CII]+[OI] 63 micron)/far-infrared intensity ratio, is higher in the northern part of IC 1396A than in the southern part, which may indicate a difference in the dust properties of the two areas. The complex velocity structures identified in the BRCs of IC 1396, which is apparently a relatively simple HII region, highlight the importance of velocity-resolved data for disentangling different components along the line of sight and thus facilitating a detailed study of the dynamics of the cloud. We also demonstrate that the optically thin [$^{13}$CII] and [OI] 145 micron emission lines are essential for a conclusive interpretation of the [CII] 158 micron and [OI] 63 micron line profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) display complex morphologies and asymmetries, reflecting anisotropies from the explosion and early interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Spectral analysis of these remnants can provide critical insights into supernova (SN) engine dynamics, the nature of progenitor stars, and the final stages of stellar evolution, including mass-loss mechanisms in the millennia leading up to the SN. This white paper evaluates the potential of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), an advanced X-ray probe concept proposed in response to NASA 2023 APEX call, to deliver high-resolution spectra of SNRs. Such capabilities would allow detailed analysis of parent SNe and progenitor stars, currently beyond our possibilities. We employed a hydrodynamic model that simulates the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from core-collapse to a 2000-year-old mature remnant. This model successfully replicates the large-scale properties of Cassiopeia A at an age of about 350 years. Using this model, we synthesized mock LEM spectra from different regions of the SNR, considering factors like line shifts and broadening due to plasma bulk motion and thermal ion motion, deviations from ionization and temperature equilibrium, and interstellar medium absorption. Analyzing these mock spectra with standard tools revealed LEM impressive capabilities. We demonstrated that fitting these spectra with plasma models accurately recovers the line-of-sight velocity of the ejecta, enabling 3D structure exploration of shocked ejecta, similar to optical methods. LEM also distinguishes between Doppler and thermal broadening of ion lines and measures ion temperatures near the limb of SNRs, providing insights into ion heating at shock fronts and cooling in post-shock flows. This study highlights LEM potential to advance our understanding of core-collapse SN dynamics and related processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Many modern astronomical instruments rely on the optimal coupling of starlight into single-mode fibers (SMFs). For ground-based telescopes, this coupling is limited by atmospheric turbulence. We propose an integrated wavefront corrector based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonics, which samples the aberrated wavefront via a microlens array (MLA). The MLA focuses the sampled wavefront onto an array of grating couplers that inject the beamlets into the single-mode waveguides of the corrector. The beams in each waveguide are then shifted in phase using thermo-optic phase shifters before combining the co-phased beams into one single-mode waveguide. In this work, we analyze the external factors that we anticipate will impact the performance of the corrector. Specifically, we study the effects of the telescope pupil function with obscuration, determine whether the corrector requires tip/tilt pre-correction, and analyze the impact of scintillation on the correction quality.

 - **Abstract**
 We parameterize the Hubble function by adding Hermitian wavelets to the Hubble radius of $\Lambda$CDM. This allows us to build Hubble functions that oscillate around $\Lambda$CDM at late times without modifying its angular diameter distance to last scattering. We perform parameter inference and model selection procedures on these new Hubble functions at the background level. In our analyses consisting of a wide variety of cosmological observations, we find that baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data play a crucial role in determining the constraints on the wavelet parameters. In particular, we focus on the differences between SDSS- and DESI-BAO datasets and find that wavelets provide a better fit to the data when either of the BAO datasets is present. However, DESI-BAO has a preference for the center of the wavelets to be around $z \sim 0.7$, while SDSS-BAO prefers higher redshifts of $z > 1$. This difference appears to be driven by the discrepancies between these two datasets in their $D_H / r_{\rm d}$ measurements at $z = 0.51$ and $z \sim 2.3$. Finally, we also derive the consequences of the wavelets on a dark energy component. We find that the dark energy density oscillates by construction and also attains negative values at large redshifts ($z\gtrsim2$) as a consequence of the SDSS-BAO data. We conclude that while the early universe and the constraints on the matter density and the Hubble constant remain unchanged, wavelets are favored in the late universe by the BAO data. Specifically, there is a significant improvement at more than $3\sigma$ in the fit when new DESI-BAO data are included in the analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the climate dynamics at the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) is crucial for predicting the habitability of rocky exoplanets. Previous studies using Global Climate Models (GCMs) have indicated that planets receiving high stellar flux can exhibit climate bifurcations, leading to bistability between a cold (temperate) and a hot (runaway) climate. However, the mechanism causing this bistability has not been fully explained, in part due to the difficulty associated with inferring mechanisms from small numbers of expensive numerical simulations in GCMs. In this study, we employ a two-column (dayside and nightside), two-layer climate model to investigate the physical mechanisms driving this bistability. Through mechanism-denial experiments, we demonstrate that the runaway greenhouse effect, coupled with a cloud feedback on either the dayside or nightside, leads to climate bistability. We also map out the parameters that control the location of the bifurcations and size of the bistability. This work identifies which mechanisms and GCM parameters control the stellar flux at which rocky planets are likely to retain a hot, thick atmosphere if they experience a hot start. This is critical for the prioritization of targets and interpretation of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Furthermore, our modeling framework can be extended to planets with different condensable species and cloud types.

 - **Abstract**
 FRB 20121102A was the first fast radio burst to be observed to repeat. Since then, thousands of bursts have been detected by multiple radio telescopes around the world. Previous work has shown an indication of a cyclic activity level with a periodicity around 160 days. Knowing when the source repeats is essential for planning multi-wavelength monitoring to constrain their emission extend and progenitor source. We report the monitoring of FRB 20121102A using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope at L-band and update the periodicity of the cyclic activity-level. We use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram on a sample of 272 observing epochs where 41% correspond to detections and 59% to non-detections. Our dataset is composed of the 7 epochs of our monitoring plus publicly available data. We investigate two methods, i) binary model, describing the observing epochs with 1 if there are detections and with 0 for non-detections. ii) normalised rates model: which considers the inferred detections rates. We report no detections in 12.5-hour observations down to a fluence of 0.29 Jy ms. The best period found for the cyclic activity window is $159.3 \pm 0.8$ days for the binary model and $159.3 \pm 0.3$ days for the normalised rates model. The activity phase is shown to be 53%. The normalised rates shows a clear Gaussian-like behaviour for the activity level, where the number of detections peak at the centre of the activity window. The periodicity found through both methods is consistent for the L and S-band datasets implying it is intrinsic to the source. The activity phase in S-band however shows an indication of it ending before the L-band activity phase, supporting the idea of chromatic dependence of the activity window. The sample at C-band however is not large enough to further confirm this result.

          Reconstructing the Inflaton Potential: Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in Slow Roll and Ultra Slow Roll Single Field Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We present new single field inflationary scenarios that produce the critical abundance of primordial black holes as dark matter reconstructing the inflaton potential from an input power spectrum. The method is exact in the slow roll approximation but remains effective even when the slow roll conditions are temporarily violated such as in ultra slow roll models. With this method we construct new ultra slow roll scenarios and also models that reproduce the DM abundance within the slow roll regime. As a second application we consider a scalar power spectrum that generates a secondary gravitational wave background compatible with the one recently observed in Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments. These scenarios could be tested by future observations of $\mu-$distortions of the CMB.

          Very Extended Ionized Gas Discovered around NGC 1068 with the Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed wide-field, ultra-low surface brightness H$\alpha$ emission line mapping around NGC 1068 with the newly commissioned Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph (\chas). NGC 1068 is notable for its active galactic nucleus, which globally ionizes gas in the disk and halo. Line-emitting diffuse ionized gas is distributed throughout the galactic disk and large-scale ionized filaments are found well beyond the disk, aligned with the cone angle of the central jet. We report the discovery of a new Ribbon of ionized gas around NGC 1068 beyond even the known outer filamentary structure, located 20 kpc from the galaxy. The H$\alpha$ surface brightness of this Ribbon is on the order of the bright Telluric lines, ranging from $[4-16]$ R with fainter regions on the order of the sky background continuum. Unlike previous extended emission, the Ribbon is not as well aligned with the current axis of the central jet. It is not associated with any galactic structure or known tidal features in the halo of NGC 1068, though it may originate from a larger distribution of unmapped neutral atomic or molecular gas in the halo. The morphology of the Ribbon emission in H$\alpha$ is correlated with extended UV emission around NGC 1068. H$\alpha$ to UV flux ratios in the Ribbon are comparable to extended emission line ratios in the halos of NGC 5128, NGC 253, and M82. The H$\alpha$ excess in the Ribbon gas suggests ionization by slow-shocks or a mixture of in-situ star formation and photoionization and collisional ionization processes.
