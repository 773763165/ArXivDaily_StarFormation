#### Quokka-based Understanding of Outflows (QED) I. Metal loading, phase  structure, and convergence testing for Solar neighbourhood conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase galactic outflows, generated by supernova feedback, are likely to be more metal-rich than the interstellar media from which they are driven due to incomplete mixing between supernova ejecta and the ambient ISM. This enrichment is important for shaping galactic metallicities and metallicity gradients, but measuring it quantitatively from simulations requires resolution high enough to resolve mass, momentum and energy exchanges between the different phases of the outflows. In this context, we present simulations of outflows, driven by SN feedback, conducted using \textsc{Quokka}, a new GPU-optimised AMR radiation-hydrodynamics code. This code allows us to reach combinations of resolution, simulation volume, and simulation duration larger than those that have previously been possible, and to resolve all gas phases from cold neutral medium, $T \sim 100$ K, to hot ionised gas, $T \gtrsim 10^7$ K. In this, a first of a series of papers exploring generation and evolution of multiphase outflows from a wide range of galactic environments and star formation rates, we quantify the extent of selective metal loading in Solar neighbourhood-like environments. We explain the selective metal loading we find as a result of the transport of metals within and between phases, a phenomenon we can study owing to the parsec-scale resolution that our simulations achieve. We also quantify the sensitivity of metal loading studies to numerical resolution, and present convergence criteria for future studies.
#### The FLAMINGO project: revisiting the $S_8$ tension and the role of  baryonic physics

 - **Abstract**
 A number of recent studies have found evidence for a tension between observations of large-scale structure (LSS) and the predictions of the standard model of cosmology with the cosmological parameters fit to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The origin of this '$S_8$ tension' remains unclear, but possibilities include new physics beyond the standard model, unaccounted for systematic errors in the observational measurements and/or uncertainties in the role that baryons play. Here we carefully examine the latter possibility using the new FLAMINGO suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We project the simulations onto observable harmonic space and compare with observational measurements of the power and cross-power spectra of cosmic shear, CMB lensing, and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We explore the dependence of the predictions on box size and resolution, cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass, and the efficiency and nature of baryonic 'feedback'. Despite the wide range of astrophysical behaviours simulated, we find that baryonic effects are not sufficiently large to remove the $S_8$ tension. Consistent with recent studies, we find the CMB lensing power spectrum is in excellent agreement with the standard model, whilst the cosmic shear power spectrum, tSZ effect power spectrum, and the cross-spectra between shear, CMB lensing, and the tSZ effect are all in varying degrees of tension with the CMB-specified standard model. These results suggest that some mechanism is required to slow the growth of fluctuations at late times and/or on non-linear scales, but that it is unlikely that baryon physics is driving this modification.
#### Dark I-Love-Q

 - **Abstract**
 For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also applies to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to a higher range of the variables, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit.
#### Asteroseismology of double-mode radial $δ$ Scuti stars: AE Ursae  Majoris and RV Arietis

 - **Abstract**
 We construct complex seismic models of two high-amplitude delta Sct stars, AE UMa and RV Ari, each pulsating in two radial modes: fundamental and first overtone. The models reproduce, besides the frequencies of two radial modes, also the amplitude of bolometric flux variations (the parameter f) for the dominant mode. Applying the Monte Carlo-based Bayesian analysis, we derive strong constraints, on the parameters of the model as well as on the free parameters of the theory. A vast majority of seismic models of the two stars are just at the beginning of hydrogen-shell burning and a small fraction is at the very end of an overall contraction. The stars have a similar age of about 1.6 Gyr for the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Both stars have unusual low overshooting from the convective core; about 0.02 and 0.004 of the pressure scale height for AE UMa and RV Ari, respectively. This result presumably indicates that overshooting should vary with time and scale with a decreasing convective core. The efficiency of convection in the envelope of both stars is rather low and described by the mixing length parameter alphaMLT of about 0.3-0.6. The third frequency of RV Ari, confirmed by us in the TESS photometry, can only be associated with mixed nonradial modes l=1, g4-g8 or l=2, g10-g12. We include the dipole mode into our Bayesian modelling and demonstrate its huge asteroseismic potential.

 - **Abstract**
 The absence of a breakthrough in directly observing dark matter (DM) through prominent large-scale detectors motivates the development of novel tabletop experiments probing more exotic regions of the parameter space. If DM contains ultralight bosonic particles, they would behave as a classical wave and could manifest through an oscillating force on baryonic matter that is coherent over $\sim 10^6$ periods. Our Helium ultraLIght dark matter Optomechanical Sensor (HeLIOS) uses the high-$Q$ acoustic modes of superfluid helium-4 to resonantly amplify this signal. A superconducting re-entrant microwave cavity enables sensitive optomechanical readout ultimately limited by thermal motion at millikelvin temperatures. Pressurizing the helium allows for the unique possibility of tuning the mechanical frequency to effectively broaden the DM detection bandwidth. We demonstrate the working principle of our prototype HeLIOS detector and show that future generations of HeLIOS could explore unconstrained parameter space for both scalar and vector ultralight DM after just an hour of integration time.

 - **Abstract**
 A new generation of radio telescopes with excellent sensitivity, instantaneous {\it uv} coverage, and large fields of view, are providing unprecedented opportunities for performing commensal transient searches. Here we present such a commensal search in deep observations of short gamma-ray burst fields carried out with the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa at 1.3 GHz. These four hour observations of eight different fields span survey lengths of weeks to months. We also carry out transient searches in time slices of the full observations, at timescales of 15 minutes, and 8 seconds. We find 122 variable sources on the long timescales, of which 52 are likely active galactic nuclei, but there are likely also some radio flaring stars. While the variability is intrinsic in at least two cases, most of it is consistent with interstellar scintillation. In this study, we also place constraints on transient rates based on state-of-the-art transient simulations codes. We place an upper limit of $2\times10^{-4}$ transients per day per square degree for transients with peak flux of 5 mJy, and an upper limit of $2.5\times10^{-2}$ transients per day per square degree for transients with a fluence of 10 Jy ms, the minimum detectable fluence of our survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We intend to study a modified version of the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP) by incorporating several perturbing parameters. We consider the bigger primary as an oblate spheroid and emitting radiation while the small primary has an elongated body. We also consider the perturbation from a disk-like structure encompassing this three-body system. First, we develop a mathematical model of this modified CRTBP. We have found there exist five equilibrium points in this modified CRTBP model, where three of them are collinear and the other two are non-collinear. Second, we apply our modified CRTBP model to the Sun-Haumea system by considering several values of each perturbing parameter. Through our numerical investigation, we have discovered that the incorporation of perturbing parameters has resulted in a shift in the equilibrium point positions of the Sun-Haumea system compared to their positions in the classical CRTBP. The stability of equilibrium points is investigated. We have shown that the collinear equilibrium points are unstable and the stability of non-collinear equilibrium points depends on the mass parameter $\mu$ of the system. Unlike the classical case, non-collinear equilibrium points have both a maximum and minimum limit of $\mu$ for achieving stability. We remark that the stability range of $\mu$ in non-collinear equilibrium points depends on the perturbing parameters. In context of the Sun-Haumea system, we have found that the non-collinear equilibrium points are stable.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extension of the Coronal Reconstruction Onto B-Aligned Regions (CROBAR) method to Linear Force Free Field (LFFF) extrapolations, and apply it to the reconstruction of a set of AIA, MDI, and STEREO EUVI data. The results demonstrate that CROBAR can not only reconstruct coronal emission structures, but also that it can help constrain the coronal field extrapolations via the LFFF's helicity $\alpha$ parameter. They also provide a real-world example of how CROBAR can easily incorporate information from multiple perspectives to improve its reconstructions, and we also use the additional perspectives to help validate the reconstructions. We furthermore touch on the use of real-world emission passbands rather than idealized power-law type ones using DEMs. We conclude with a comparison of CROBAR generated emission to observed emission and those produced with idealized DEM based power-laws. These results further illustrate the promise of CROBAR for real-world applications, and we make available a preliminary release of the software available for download.

 - **Abstract**
 As the maximum RF input and output frequencies of the integrated data converters in RFSoC increase, it becomes practical to digitize and synthesize RF signals in the majority of C band directly without analogue up and down mixing circuits. The elimination of the mixer circuits can significantly simplify the architecture of the receivers or readouts for radio astronomy telescopes. For the systems with large bandwidth or high channel counts, direct sampling can dramatically reduce the size and cost of overall system. This paper with focus on summarising part of the preliminary characterization results for direct sampling with RFSoC data converters in higher order Nyquist zones.
#### An Attractive Proposal for Resolving the Hubble Tension: Dynamical  Attractors that Unify Early and Late Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Early dark energy is a promising potential resolution of the Hubble tension. Unfortunately, many models suffer from the need to fine-tune their initial conditions to ensure that the epoch of early dark energy coincides with matter-radiation equality. We propose a class of attractive early dark energy models where this coincidence arises naturally as a saddle point of a dynamical system that attracts a large volume of phase-space trajectories regardless of the initial conditions. The system approaches a global dark energy attractor at late-times. Our framework therefore unifies early and late dark energy using a single scalar degree of freedom. We analyze a fiducial attractive early dark energy model and find that it is disfavored by cosmological data due to the presence of a long-lived saddle point in the matter era where the scalar plays the role of an additional component of (non-clustering) dark matter. Our investigations provide lessons for future model-building efforts aimed at constructing viable attractive early dark energy models.
#### KIC 9845907: A $δ$ Scuti star with the first overtone as the  dominant frequency and with many equidistant structures in its spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present an analysis of the pulsating behavior of Kepler target KIC 9845907. Using the data from Kepler, we detected 85 significant frequencies, including the first overtone $f_{1}$ = 17.597 day$^{-1}$ as the dominant frequency, the non-radial independent frequency $f_{3}$ = 31.428 day$^{-1}$ ($\ell$=1), as well as two modulation terms $f_{m1}$ = 0.065 day$^{-1}$ and $f_{m2}$ = 1.693 day$^{-1}$. We found fourteen pairs of triplet structures with $f_{m1}$ or $f_{m2}$, four pairs of which can further form quintuplet structures. We note these are the most intriguing features discovered in this study and they were recognized for the first time in $\delta$ Scuti stars. We discussed several possible explanations, i.e., beating, the Blazhko effect, combination mode hypothesis, nonlinear mode coupling, large separation, and stellar rotational splitting for these equidistant structures. Our asteroseismic models indicate this modulation with $f_{m1}$ might be related to the rotational splitting. The study of more $\delta$ Scuti stars with triplet and/or quintuplet structures using high-precision space photometry would be helpful to further explore its origin.
#### Constrained NILC method for CMB B mode observations

 - **Abstract**
 The Internal Linear Combination (ILC) method is commonly employed to extract the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal from multi-frequency observation maps. However, the performance of the ILC method tends to degrade when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is relatively low, especially when measuring the primordial $B$-modes for detecting the primordial gravitational waves. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced version of needlet ILC (NILC) method on $B$ map called constrained NILC which is more suitable for situations with low SNR by adding additional prior foreground information. We illustrate our methods using mock data generated from the combination of WMAP, Planck and a ground-based experiment in the northern hemisphere, and the chosen noise level for the ground-based experiment are very conservative which can be easily achieved in the very near future. The results show that the level of foreground residual can be well controlled. In comparison to the standard NILC method, which introduces a bias to the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) of approximately $0.05$, the constrained NILC method exhibits a significantly reduced bias of only $5\times10^{-3}$ towards $r$ which is much smaller than the statistical error.

#### Spatially-resolved spectroscopic investigation of the born-again  planetary nebula A 78

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08242
 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations of the born-again planetary nebula (PN) A 78 that are used to investigate the chemistry and physical properties of its three main morphological components, namely the inner knots, its eye-like structure, and the low surface-brightness outer nebula. The H-poor chemical abundances of the inner knots confirm the born-again nature of A 78, with a N/O abundances ratio consistent with the predictions of very late thermal pulses (VLTP). On the other hand, the high Ne/O is not expected in VLTP events, which prompts a possible different evolutionary path may be involving a binary system. The low N/O ratio and He/H abundances of the outer shell are indicative of a low-mass progenitor, whereas the chemical abundances of the eye-like structure, which results from the interaction between the H-poor born-again material and the outer nebula, evidence their mixture. Unlike previous works, the extinction is found to be inhomogeneous, being much higher towards the H-poor inner knots, where the presence of large amounts of C-rich dust has been previously reported. Dust-rich material seems to diffuse into outer nebular regions, resulting in zones of enhanced extinction.
#### The Dispersion Measure Contributions of the Cosmic Web

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale distribution of baryons is sensitive to gravitational collapse, mergers, and galactic feedback. Known as the Cosmic Web, its large-scale structure (LSS) can be classified as halos, filaments, and voids. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic sources that undergo dispersion along their propagation paths. They provide insight into ionised matter along their sightlines via their dispersion measures (DMs), and have been investigated as probes of the LSS baryon fraction, the diffuse baryon distribution, and of cosmological parameters. We use the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG to study FRB DMs accumulated while traversing different types of LSS. We combine methods for deriving electron density, classifying LSS, and tracing FRB sightlines. We identify halos, filaments, voids, and collapsed structures along random sightlines and calculate their DM contributions. We analyse the redshift-evolving cosmological DM components of the Cosmic Web. We find that the filamentary contribution dominates, increasing from ~71% to ~80% on average for FRBs originating at z=0.1 vs z=5, while the halo contribution falls, and the void contribution remains consistent to within ~1%. The majority of DM variance originates from halos and filaments, potentially making void-only sightlines more precise probes of cosmological parameters. We find that, on average, an FRB originating at z=1 will intersect ~1.8 foreground collapsed structures, increasing to ~12.4 structures for a z=5 FRB. The impact parameters between our sightlines and TNG structures of any mass appear consistent with those reported for likely galaxy-intersecting FRBs. However, we measure lower average accumulated DMs from these structures than the $\sim90\;{\rm pc\;cm^{-3}}$ DM excesses reported for these literature FRBs, indicating some DM may arise beyond the structures themselves.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of phosphorus chemistry in the interstellar medium has become a topic of growing interest in astrobiology, because it is plausible that a wide range of P-bearing molecules were introduced in the early Earth by the impact of asteroids and comets on its surface, enriching prebiotic chemistry. Thanks to extensive searches in recent years, it has become clear that P mainly appears in the form of PO and PN in molecular clouds and star-forming regions. Interestingly, PO is systematically more abundant than PN by factors typically of $\sim1.4-3$, independently of the physical properties of the observed source. In order to unveil the formation routes of PO and PN, in this work we introduce a mathematical model for the time evolution of the chemistry of P in an interstellar molecular cloud and analyze its associated chemical network as a complex dynamical system. By making reasonable assumptions, we reduce the network to obtain explicit mathematical expressions that describe the abundance evolution of P-bearing species and study the dependences of the abundance of PO and PN on the system's kinetic parameters with much faster computation times than available numerical methods. As a result, our model reveals that the formation of PO and PN is governed by just a few critical reactions, and fully explains the relationship between PO and PN abundances throughout the evolution of molecular clouds. Finally, the application of Bayesian methods constrains the real values of the most influential reaction rate coefficients making use of available observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system with a radio pulsar orbiting an O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, with a period of ~3.4 yr. Close to the periastron the system is detected at all wavelengths, from radio to the TeV energies. The emission in this time period is believed to originate from the interaction of LS 2883 and pulsar's outflows. The observations of 4 periastra passages taken in 2010-2021 show strong correlation of the radio and X-ray lightcurves with two peaks just before and after the periastron. The observations of the latest 2021 periastron passage reveal the presence of the 3rd X-ray peak and subsequent disappearance of radio/X-ray flux correlation. In this paper we present the results of our optical, radio and X-ray observational campaigns on PSR B1259-63 performed in 2021 accompanied with the analysis of the publicly available GeV FERMI/LAT data. We compare the properties of different periastron passages, discuss the obtained results and show that they can be explained in terms of the 2-zone emission cone model proposed by us previously.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the propagation of spherically symmetric shocks in relativistic homologously expanding media with density distributions following a power-law profile in their Lorentz factor. That is, $\rho_{ej} \propto t^{-3}\gamma_{e}(R,t)^{-\alpha}$, where $\rho_{ej}$ is the medium proper density, $\gamma_{e}$ is its Lorentz factor, $\alpha>0$ is constant and $t$, $R$ are the time and radius from the center. We find that the shocks behavior can be characterized by their proper velocity, $U'=\Gamma_s'\beta_s'$, where $\Gamma_s'$ is the shock Lorentz factor as measured in the immediate upstream frame and $\beta_s'$ is the corresponding 3-velocity. While generally, we do not expect the shock evolution to be self-similar, for every $\alpha>0$ we find a critical value $U'_c$ for which a self-similar solution with constant $U'$ exists. We then use numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of general shocks. We find that shocks with $U'>U'_c$ have a monotonously growing $U'$, while those with $U'<U'_c$ have a decreasing $U'$ and will eventually die out. Finally, we present an analytic approximation, based on our numerical results, for the evolution of general shocks in the regime where $U'$ is ultra-relativistic.

 - **Abstract**
 We present chemical composition and fundamental parameters (the effective temperature, surface gravity and radius) for four sharp-lined A-type stars ${\gamma}$ Gem (HD 41705), o Peg (HD 214994), ${\theta}$ Vir (HD 114330) and ${\nu}$ Cap (HD 193432). Our analysis is based on a self-consistent model fitting of high-resolution spectra and spectrophotometric observations over a wide wavelength range. We refined the fundamental parameters of the stars with the SME package and verified their accuracy by comparing with the spectral energy distribution and hydrogen line profiles. We found Teff/log g = 9190+/-130 K/3.56+/-0.08, 9600+/-50 K/3.81+/-0.04, 9600+/-140 K/3.61+/-0.12, and 10200+/-220 K/3.88+/-0.08 for ${\gamma}$ Gem, o Peg, ${\theta}$ Vir and ${\nu}$ Cap, respectively. Our detailed abundance analysis employs a hybrid technique for spectrum synthesis based on classical model atmospheres calculated in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption together with the non-LTE (NLTE) line formation for 18 of 26 investigated species. Comparison of the abundance patterns observed in A stars of different types (normal A, Am, Ap) with similar fundamental parameters reveals significant abundance diversity that cannot be explained by the current mechanisms of abundance peculiarity formation in stellar atmospheres. We found a rise of the heavy element (Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba) abundance excess up to +1 dex with Teff increasing from 7200 to 10000 K, with a further decrease down to solar value at Teff = 13000 K, indicating that stars with solar element abundances can be found among late B-type stars.

 We present the results of new photometric and spectroscopic observations of WN5+O6 binary V444 Cyg and a detailed analysis of extant spectroscopy and photometry. Using elements of the spectroscopic orbit and assuming e = 0, i = 78{\deg} we determined the masses and orbit sizes of the components of V444 Cyg M_O6 = 26.4 M_Sun, M_WN5 = 10.7 M_Sun, a_O6 = 10.6 R_Sun, a_WN5 = 26.1 R_Sun. Based on new and archival light curves and by applying the Hertzsprung method, we improved the photometrical estimate of secular increase rate of the orbital period in V444 Cyg dP/dt_ph = 0.119+-0.003 s/yr. From the comparison of the new and archival radial velocity curves of V444 Cyg we independently derived the secular orbital period change rate dP/dt_sp = 0.147+-0.032 s/yr, in agreement with the photometrical dP/dt_ph. The obtained secular increase rate of the binary orbital period dP/dt and the mean radii of the components enabled us to estimate the stellar wind mass-loss rate from WR star dM/dt_WN5 = -(6.0+-0.4)*10^-6 M_Sun/yr.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply state-of-the-art, likelihood-free statistical inference (machine-learning-based) techniques for reconstructing the spectral shape of a gravitational wave background (GWB). We focus on the reconstruction of an arbitrarily shaped signal by the LISA detector, but the method can be easily extended to either template-dependent signals, or to other detectors, as long as a characterisation of the instrumental noise is available. As proof of the technique, we quantify the ability of LISA to reconstruct signals of arbitrary spectral shape (blind reconstruction), considering a diversity of frequency profiles, and including astrophysical backgrounds in some cases. As a teaser of how the method can reconstruct signals characterised by a parameter-dependent template (template reconstruction), we present a dedicated study for power-law signals. While our technique has several advantages with respect to traditional MCMC methods, we validate it with the latter for concrete cases. This work opens the door for both fast and accurate Bayesian parameter estimation of GWBs, with essentially no computational overhead during the inference step. Our set of tools will be integrated into the package GWBackFinder, which will be made publicly available in due time.

 - **Abstract**
 Correlations between intrinsic properties of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves provide clues to the nature of the central engine, the jet, and a possible means to standardise GRBs for cosmological use. Here we report on the discovery of a correlation between the intrinsic early time luminosity, $L_{G,\rm 10s}$, measured at rest frame 10s, and the average decay rate measured from rest frame 10s onward, $\alpha_{G,\rm avg>10s}$, in a sample of 13 Fermi Large Array Telescope (LAT) long GRB light curves. We note that our selection criteria, in particular the requirement for a redshift to construct luminosity light curves, naturally limits our sample to energetic GRBs. A Spearman's rank correlation gives a coefficient of -0.74, corresponding to a confidence level of 99.6%, indicating that brighter afterglows decay faster than less luminous ones. Assuming a linear relation with $\log(L_{G,\rm 10s})$, we find $\alpha_{G,\rm avg>10s} = -0.31_{-0.09}^{+0.12}\log(L_{G,\rm 10s}) + 14.43_{-5.97}^{+4.55}$. The slope of -0.31 is consistent at $1\sigma$ with previously identified correlations in the optical/UV and X-ray light curves. We speculate that differences in the rate at which energy is released by the central engine or differences in observer viewing angle may be responsible for the correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in short-period binaries typically have spins that are aligned and synchronized with the orbit of their companion. In triple systems, however, the combination of spin and orbital precession can cause the star's rotation to evolve to a highly misaligned and sub-synchronous equilibrium known as a Cassini state. We identify a population of recently discovered stars that exhibit these characteristics and which are already known to have tertiary companions. These third bodies have a suitable orbital period to allow the inner binary to evolve into the sub-synchronous Cassini state, which we confirm with orbital evolution models. We also compute the expected stellar obliquity and spin period, showing that the observed rotation rates are often slower than expected from equilibrium tidal models. However, we show that tidal dissipation via inertial waves can alter the expected spin-orbit misalignment angle and rotation rate, potentially creating the very slow rotation rates in some systems. Finally, we show how additional discoveries of such systems can be used to constrain the tidal physics and orbital evolution histories of stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of a stochastic Gravitational Wave (GW) background sourced by a cosmological phase transition would allow us to see the early Universe from a completely new perspective, illuminating aspects of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics and inflationary cosmology. In this study, we investigate whether the evolution of the scalar potential of a minimal SM extension after inflation can lead to a strong first-order phase transition. In particular, we focus on a BSM spectator scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity and has a dynamical double-well potential. As inflation ends, the potential barrier diminishes due to the evolution of the curvature scalar. Therefore, a phase transition can proceed through the nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles that collide as they fill the Universe and produce GWs. We consider high and low scales of inflation, while also taking into account a kination period between inflation and the onset of radiation domination. With this prescription, we showcase a proof-of-concept study of a new triggering mechanism for BSM phase transitions in the early Universe, whose GW signatures could potentially be probed with future detectors.
#### Non-equilibrium effects on stability of hybrid stars with first-order  phase transitions

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions as determined by calculating fundamental radial oscillation modes is known to differ from the predictions of the widely-used Bardeen--Thorne--Meltzer criterion. We consider the effects of out-of-chemical-equilibrium physics on the radial modes and hence stability of these objects. For a barotropic equation of state, this is done by allowing the adiabatic sound speed to differ from the equilibrium sound speed. We show that doing so extends the stable branches of stellar models, allowing stars with rapid phase transitions to support stable higher-order stellar multiplets similarly to stars with multiple slow phase transitions. We also derive a new junction condition to impose on the oscillation modes at the phase transition. Termed the reactive condition, it is physically motivated, consistent with the generalized junction conditions between two phases, and has the common rapid and slow conditions as limiting cases. Unlike the two common cases, it can only be applied to nonbarotropic stars. We apply this junction condition to hybrid stellar models generated using a two-phase equation of state consisting of nuclear matter with unpaired quark matter at high densities joined by a first-order phase transition and show that like in the slow limiting case, stars that are classically unstable are stabilized by a finite chemical reaction speed.
#### A roadmap to cosmological parameter analysis with third-order shear  statistics III: Efficient estimation of third-order shear correlation  functions and an application to the KiDS-1000 data

 - **Abstract**
 Third-order lensing statistics contain a wealth of cosmological information that is not captured by second-order statistics. However, the computational effort for estimating such statistics on forthcoming stage IV surveys is prohibitively expensive. We derive and validate an efficient estimation procedure for the three-point correlation function (3PCF) of polar fields such as weak lensing shear. We then use our approach to measure the shear 3PCF and the third-order aperture mass statistics on the KiDS-1000 survey. We construct an efficient estimator for third-order shear statistics which builds on the multipole decomposition of the 3PCF. We then validate our estimator on mock ellipticity catalogs obtained from $N$-body simulations. Finally, we apply our estimator to the KiDS-1000 data and present a measurement of the third-order aperture statistics in a tomographic setup. Our estimator provides a speedup of a factor of $\sim$ 100-1000 compared to the state-of-the-art estimation procedures. It is also able to provide accurate measurements for squeezed and folded triangle configurations without additional computational effort. We report a significant detection of the tomographic third-order aperture mass statistics in the KiDS-1000 data $(\mathrm{S/N}=6.69)$. Our estimator will make it computationally feasible to measure third-order shear statistics in forthcoming stage IV surveys. Furthermore, it can be used to construct empirical covariance matrices for such statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper performs the first cosmological parameter analysis of the KiDS-1000 data with second- and third-order shear statistics. This work builds on a series of papers that describe the roadmap to third-order shear statistics. We derive and test a combined model of the second-order shear statistic, namely the COSEBIs and the third-order aperture mass statistics $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$ in a tomographic set-up. We validate our pipeline with $N$-body simulations that mock the fourth Kilo Degree survey data release. To model the second- and third-order statistics, we use the latest version of \textsc{HMcode2020} for the power spectrum and \textsc{BiHalofit} for the bispectrum. Furthermore, we use an analytic description to model intrinsic alignments and hydro-dynamical simulations to model the effect of baryonic feedback processes. Lastly, we decreased the dimension of the data vector significantly by considering for the $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$ part of the data vector only equal smoothing radii, making a data analysis of the fourth Kilo Degree survey data release using a combined analysis of COSEBIs third-order shear statistic possible. We first validate the accuracy of our modelling by analysing a noise-free mock data vector assuming the KiDS-1000 error budget, finding a shift in the maximum-a-posterior of the matter density parameter $\Delta \Omega_m< 0.02\, \sigma_{\Omega_m}$ and of the structure growth parameter $\Delta S_8 < 0.05\, \sigma_{S_8}$. Lastly, we performed the first KiDS-1000 cosmological analysis using a combined analysis of second- and third-order shear statistics, where we constrained $\Omega_m=0.248^{+0.062}_{-0.055}$ and $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.772\pm0.022$. The geometric average on the errors of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $S_8$ of the combined statistics increased compared to the second-order statistic by 2.2.

 We summarize common notations and concepts in the field of Intrinsic Alignments (IA). IA refers to physical correlations involving galaxy shapes, galaxy spins, and the underlying cosmic web. Its characterization is an important aspect of modern cosmology, particularly in weak lensing analyses. This resource is both a reference for those already familiar with IA and designed to introduce someone to the field by drawing from various studies and presenting a collection of IA formalisms, estimators, modeling approaches, alternative notations, and useful references.
