 - **Abstract**
 An open or hyperbolic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime dominated by tachyonic dark matter can exhibit an ``inflected'' expansion -- initially decelerating, later accelerating -- similar but not identical to that of now-standard $\Lambda$CDM models dominated by dark energy. The features of the tachyonic model can be extracted by fitting the redshift-distance relation of the model to data obtained by treating Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. Here such a model is fitted to samples of 186 and 1048 Type Ia supernovae from the literature. The fits yield values of $H_0=(66.6\pm1.5)~\hbox{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_0=(69.6\pm0.4)~\hbox{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively, for the current-time Hubble parameter, and $t_0=(8.35\pm0.68)~\hbox{Gyr}$ and $t_0=(8.15\pm0.36)~\hbox{Gyr}$, respectively, for the comoving-time age of the Universe. Tests of the model against other observations will be undertaken in subsequent works.
#### The DEHVILS in the Details: Type Ia Supernova Hubble Residual  Comparisons and Mass Step Analysis in the Near-Infrared

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) have been used both as an alternate path to cosmology compared to optical measurements and as a method of constraining key systematics for the larger optical studies. With the DEHVILS sample, the largest published NIR sample with consistent NIR coverage of maximum light across three NIR bands ($Y$, $J$, and $H$), we check three key systematics: (i) the reduction in Hubble residual scatter as compared to the optical, (ii) the measurement of a "mass step" or lack thereof and its implications, and (iii) the ability to distinguish between various dust models by analyzing correlations between Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical. We produce accurate simulations of the DEHVILS sample and find, contrary to assumptions in the literature, it is $\textit{harder}$ to differentiate between various dust models than previously understood. Additionally, we find that fitting with the current SALT3 model does not yield accurate wavelength-dependent stretch-luminosity correlations, and we propose a limited solution for this problem. From the data, we see that (i) the standard deviation of Hubble residual values from NIR bands treated as standard candles are 0.007-0.042 mag smaller than those in the optical, (ii) the NIR mass step is not constrainable with the current sample size from DEHVILS, and (iii) Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical are correlated in both the simulations and the data. We test a few variations on the number and combinations of filters and data samples, and we observe that none of our findings or conclusions are significantly impacted by these modifications.

 - **Abstract**
 In the absence of a parallax distance to a pulsar or a surviving binary in a supernova remnant (SNR), distances to Galactic SNRs are generally very uncertain. However, by combining Gaia data with wide field, multi-fiber echelle spectroscopy, it is now possible to obtain accurate distances to many SNRs with limited extinction by searching for the appearance of high velocity CaII or NaI absorption lines in hot stars as a function of distance. We demonstrate this for the SNR S147 using the spectra of 259 luminous, blue stars. We obtain a median distance of 1.37 kpc (1.30 to 1.47 kpc at 90% confidence) that is consistent with the median parallax distance to the pulsar of 1.46 kpc (1.12 to 2.10 kpc at 90% confidence), but with significantly smaller uncertainties. Our distance is also consistent with the distance to the candidate unbound binary companion in this SNR, HD37424. The presence of high velocity absorption lines is correlated with the emission line flux of the SNR but not with the radio flux.
#### PINNferring the Hubble Function with Uncertainties

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble function characterizes a given Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and can be related to the densities of the cosmological fluids and their equations of state. We show how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emulate this dynamical system and provide fast predictions of the luminosity distance for a given choice of densities and equations of state, as needed for the analysis of supernova data. We use this emulator to perform a model-independent and parameter-free reconstruction of the Hubble function on the basis of supernova data. As part of this study, we develop and validate an uncertainty treatment for PINNs using a heteroscedastic loss and repulsive ensembles.
#### Large Impact Features on Ganymede and Callisto as Revealed by Geological  Mapping and Morphometry

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed topographic and geological mapping of 19 large impact features on Ganymede and Callisto in order to gather morphometric and crater age data that allow us to quantify how the diverse morphologies of these features transition with size and age. The impact features are divided into two main morphological groups, craters and penepalimpsests/palimpsests. The morphologies of pit and dome craters are independent of age or geologic context, indicating that the impacts that formed them were small enough to only ever penetrate into a cold, rigid ice layer, with evolution of a pocket of impact melt contributing to the development of their central pits and surrounding raised annuli, while the domes formed mainly via viscous relaxation of the pit topography. The subdued rims of anomalous dome craters indicate the increasing effect of a warm subsurface ice layer on impact feature morphology with increasing size. The low topographic relief of penepalimpsests and palimpsests indicates that these impacts penetrated the ice shell to liberate large volumes of underlying, pre-existing liquid. Penepalimpsests show a higher frequency of concentric ridges within their interiors, indicating a more robust subsurface state that could support the rotation and uplift of solid material during impact. The size and age overlap of anomalous dome craters, penepalimpsests, and palimpsests, with a few impact features appearing to be transitional between anomalous dome craters and penepalimpsests, indicates that impactor size, time of impact, and variation in temperature gradient across the satellite are all factors in determining which of these morphologies emerges.
#### Joint Deconvolution of Astronomical Images in the Presence of Poisson  Noise

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for joint likelihood deconvolution (Jolideco) of a set of astronomical observations of the same sky region in the presence of Poisson noise. The observations may be obtained from different instruments with different resolution, and different point spread functions. Jolideco reconstructs a single flux image by optimizing the posterior distribution based on the joint Poisson likelihood of all observations under a patch-based image prior. The patch prior is parameterised via a Gaussian Mixture model which we train on high-signal-to-noise astronomical images, including data from the James Webb Telescope and the GLEAM radio survey. This prior favors correlation structures among the reconstructed pixel intensities that are characteristic of those observed in the training images. It is, however, not informative for the mean or scale of the reconstruction. By applying the method to simulated data we show that the combination of multiple observations and the patch-based prior leads to much improved reconstruction quality in many different source scenarios and signal to noise regimes. We demonstrate that with the patch prior Jolideco yields superior reconstruction quality relative to alternative standard methods such as the Richardson-Lucy method. We illustrate the results of Jolideco applied to example data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By comparing the measured width of a counts based and the corresponding Jolideco flux profile of an X-ray filament in SNR 1E 0102.2-721} we find the deconvolved width of 0.58+- 0.02 arcsec to be consistent with the theoretical expectation derived from the known width of the PSF.
#### Characterization of starspots on a young M-dwarf K2-25: multi-band  observations of stellar photometric variability and planetary transits

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed atmospheric characterization of exoplanets by transmission spectroscopy requires careful consideration of stellar surface inhomogeneities induced by starspots. This effect is particularly problematic for planetary systems around M-dwarfs, and their spot properties are not fully understood. We investigated the stellar activity of the young M-dwarf K2-25 and its effect on transit observations of the sub-Neptune K2-25b. From multi-band monitoring observations of stellar brightness variability using ground-based telescopes and TESS, we found that the temperature difference between the spots and photosphere is <190 K and the spot covering fraction is <61% (2$\sigma$). We also investigated the effect of starspot activity using multi-epoch, multi-band transit observations. We rule out cases with extremely low spot temperatures and large spot covering fractions. The results suggest that spots could distort the transmission spectrum of K2-25b by as much as $\sim$100 ppm amplitude, corresponding to the precision of JWST/NIRSPEC of the target. Our study demonstrates that simultaneous multi-band observations with current instruments can constrain the spot properties of M-dwarfs with good enough precision to support atmospheric studies of young M-dwarf planets via transmission spectroscopy.
#### Eta Carinae left a curious ladder to climb

 - **Abstract**
 Eta Carinae underwent the Great Eruption in the 1840s and a Lesser Eruption in the 1890s. Its apparent spectrum, modified by intervening ejecta, the Homunculus and Little Homunculus, continues to evolve but contains information pertaining to events in the 19th century. The LOS spectrum contains narrow absorption velocities, from -122 to -1665 km/s: rungs of a broken ladder caused by shells formed by the interacting winds. Estimated shell origin dates correlate with origin dates of expanding emission structures preceding the Great Eruption. The LOS absorption velocities extend the record post Great Eruption to the Lesser Eruption. We suggest that these shells originated from a binary merger within a triple system. Shells formed not only from periastron passages of the current secondary, but also from ear-like extensions preceding and following the periastron event. Additional models need to be considered.

 - **Abstract**
 Young early-type HAeBe stars are still embedded in the molecular clouds in which they formed. They illuminate reflection nebulae, which shape the surrounding molecular cloud and may trigger star formation. They are therefore ideal places to search for ongoing star formation activity. NGC2023 is illuminated by the Herbig Be star HD37903. It is the most massive member of a small young cluster with about 30 PMS stars, several of which are Class I objects that still heavily accrete. It might therefore be expected that they might drive molecular outflows. We examined the whole region for outflows. We analyzed previously published APEX data to search for and characterize the outflows in the NGC2023 region. This is the first systematic search for molecular outflows in this region. Since the outflows were mapped in several CO transitions, we can determine their properties quite well. We have discovered four molecular outflows in the vicinity of NGC2023, three of which are associated with Class I objects. MIR-63, a bright mid-infrared and submillimeter Class I source, is a binary with a separation of 2.4" and drives two bipolar outflows orthogonal to each other. The large southeast-northwest outflow excites the Herbig-Haro flow HH247. MIR-73, a Class I object, which is also a far-infrared source, drives a pole-on outflow. MIR-62 is a Class II object with strong infrared excess and a luminosity of 7 Lsun. It is not detected in the far-infrared. The Class I sources have bolometric luminosities of about 20 Lsun or lower, that is, they are all low-mass stars. One other far-infrared source, MIR-75, may have powered an outflow in the past because it now illuminates an egg-shaped cavity. The four outflow sources are at a similar evolutionary stage, which suggests that their formation may have been triggered by the expanding C II region.

 - **Abstract**
 Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.
#### Is the RSGC4 (Alicante 8) cluster a real star cluster?: Peculiar radial  velocities of red supergiant stars

 - **Abstract**
 Young massive star clusters, like the six red supergiant clusters in the Scutum complex, provide valuable insights into star-formation and galaxy structures. We investigated the high-resolution near-infrared spectra of 60 RSG candidates in these clusters using the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph. Among the candidates in RSGC4, we found significant scattering in radial velocity ($-64$ km/s to $115$ km/s), unlike other clusters with velocities of $\sim$100 km/s. Most candidates in RSGC4 have $Q_{GK_s}$ values larger than 1.7, suggesting that they could be early AGB stars. Four candidates in RSGC4 exhibit infrared excess and distinct absorption features absent in other candidates. Two of these stars exhibit absorption lines resembling those of D-type symbiotic stars, showing radial velocity changes in multi-epoch observations. Analysis of relative proper motions revealed no runaway/walkaway stars in RSGC4. The dynamic properties of RSGC4 and RSGC1 differ from the disk-like motions of other clusters: RSGC4 has low normalized horizontal action $J_\mathrm{hor}=J_\mathrm{\phi}/J_\mathrm{tot}$ and vertical action $J_\mathrm{ver}=(J_\mathrm{z}-J_\mathrm{R})/J_\mathrm{tot}$ values and high eccentricities, while RSGC1 has vertical motions with high $J_\mathrm{ver}$ values and inclinations. We propose that RSGC4 may not be a genuine star cluster but rather a composite of RSGs and AGBs distributed along the line of sight at similar distances, possibly originating from various environments. Our results suggest a complex and hierarchical secular evolution of star clusters in the Scutum complex, emphasizing the importance of considering factors beyond density crowding when identifying star clusters in the bulge regions.
#### Stationary neutron star envelopes at high accretion rates

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we model stationary neutron star envelopes at high accretion rates and describe our new code for such studies. As a first step we put special emphasis on the rp-process which results in the synthesis of heavy elements and study in detail how this synthesis depends on the mass accretion rate and the chemical composition of the accreted matter. We show that at very low accretion rate, $\dot{M} \sim 0.01 \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$, mostly low mass ($A\leq$ 24) elements are synthesized with a few heavier ones below the $^{40}$Ca bottleneck. However, once $\dot{M}$ is above ${\buildrel \sim \over >} 0.1 \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$ this bottleneck is surpassed and nuclei in the iron peak region ($A\sim$ 56) are abundantly produced. At higher mass accretion rates progressively heavier nuclei are generated, reaching $A \sim 70$ at $\dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$ and $A \sim 90$ at $5 \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$. We find that when the rp-process is efficient, the nucleosynthesis it generates is independent of the accreted abundance of CNO elements as these are directly and copiously generated once the $3\alpha$-reaction is operating. We also explore the efficiency of the rp-process under variations of the relative abundances of H and He. Simultaneously, we put special emphasis on the density profiles of the energy generation rate particularly at high density beyond the hydrogen exhaustion point. Our results are of importance for the study of neutron stars in systems in which X-ray bursts are absent but are also of relevance for other systems in describing the low density region, mostly below $10^6$ g cm\mmm, inbetween bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 The up-coming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) opens a new opportunity to rapidly survey the southern Sky at optical wavelenghts (\ie ugrizy bands). In this study, we aim to test the possibility of using LSST observations to constrain the mass and velocity of different KN ejecta components from the observation of a combined set of light curves from GRB afterglows and KN\ae. We used a sample of simulated light curves from the aforementioned events as they would have been seen during the LSST survey to study how observing strategies' choice impacts the parameters' estimation. We found that the observing strategy design to be the best compromise between light curves coverage, observed filters and fit reliability involves a high number of visits with long gap pairs of about 4 hours every 2 nights in the same or different filters. The features of the observing strategy will allow us to recognize the different stages of the light curve evolution and gather observations in at least 3 filters.
#### Non-evolutionary effects on Period change in Magellanic Cepheids I. New  binary systems revealed from Light Travel Time Effect

 - **Abstract**
 Period change studies give a window to probe into the evolution and dynamics of Cepheids. While evolutionary period changes have been well studied both observationally and theoretically, non-evolutionary period changes lack a systematic and quantitative description. The overall objective is to have a quantitative understanding of the full picture of non-evolutionary period changes in Cepheids, to develop a formalism to disentangle it from the secular evolutionary period change. In the first part of the series of works, we aim to conduct a systematic search for non-evolutionary period changes to search for Cepheids in likely binary configuration and quantify their incidence rates in the Magellanic Clouds. We collect more than decade-long time-series photometry from the publically available survey, Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), with more than 7200 Cepheids collectively from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample contains both fundamental-mode and first overtone-mode Cepheids. Then we calculate observed minus calculated ($O-C$) diagrams to reveal the light-travel time effect (LTTE). In our search, out of an overall sample of more than 7200 Cepheids, we found 52 candidate Cepheid binary systems in the LMC (30 fundamental and 22 first overtone-mode) and 145 in the SMC (85 fundamental and 60 first overtone-mode). The majority of the sample is characterized by orbital periods of 2000-4000\,d and eccentricities of 0.2-0.5. Moreover, we report two candidates in each galaxy with the Cepheid likely existing with a giant companion. The incidence rate ratio for SMC to LMC calculated from our sample is in agreement with binary Cepheid population synthesis predictions.
#### Bulk properties of PSR J0030+0451 inferred with the compactness  measurement of NICER

 - **Abstract**
 In 2019, Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) mission released its findings on the mass and radius of the isolated neutron star (INS) PSR J0030+0451, revealing a mass of approximately 1.4 solar masses ($M_{\odot}$) and a radius near 13 kilometers. However, the recent re-analysis by the NICER collaboration \citep{vinciguerra2024updated} suggests that the available data primarily yields a precise inference of the compactness for this source while the resulting mass and radius are strongly model-dependent and diverse (the 68.3\% confidence counters just overlap slightly for the ST+PDT and PDT-U models). By integrating this compactness data with the equation of state (EoS) refined by our latest investigations, we have deduced the mass and radius for PSR J0030+0451, delivering estimates of $M=1.48^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~M_\odot$ and $R=12.39_{-0.70}^{+0.50}~{\rm km}$ for the compactness found in ST+PDT model, alongside $M=1.47^{+0.14}_{-0.20}~M_\odot$ and $R=12.37_{-0.70}^{+0.50}~{\rm km}$ for the compactness in PDT-U model. These two groups of results are well consistent with each other and the direct X-ray data inference within the ST+PDT model seems to be favored. Additionally, we have calculated the tidal deformability, moment of inertia, and gravitational binding energy for this NS. Furthermore, employing these refined EoS models, we have updated mass-radius estimates for three INSs with established gravitational redshifts.
#### The disappearance of the blue and luminous progenitor of the Type IIn SN  2010jl

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T_{\rm eff}/{\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L_{\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 Young protostellar binary systems, with expected ages less than $\sim$10$^5$ years, are little modified since birth, providing key clues to binary formation and evolution. We present a first look at the young, Class 0 binary protostellar system R CrA IRAS 32 from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA large program, which observed the system in the 1.3 mm continuum emission, $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and nine other molecular lines that trace disk, envelope, shocks, and outflows. With a continuum resolution of $\sim$0.03$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$5 au, at a distance of 150 pc), we characterize the newly discovered binary system with a separation of 207 au, their circumstellar disks, and a circumbinary disk-like structure. The circumstellar disk radii are 26.9$\pm$0.3 and 22.8$\pm$0.3 au for sources A and B, respectively, and their circumstellar disk dust masses are estimated as 22.5$\pm$1.1 and 12.4$\pm$0.6 M$_{\Earth}$. The circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure have well aligned position angles and inclinations, indicating formation in a smooth, ordered process such as disk fragmentation. In addition, the circumstellar disks have a near/far-side asymmetry in the continuum emission suggesting that the dust has yet to settle into a thin layer near the midplane. Spectral analysis of CO isotopologues reveals outflows that originate from both of the sources and possibly from the circumbinary disk-like structure. Furthermore, we detect Keplerian rotation in the $^{13}$CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and likely Keplerian rotation in the circumbinary structure; the latter suggests that it is probably a circumbinary disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a study on the X-ray polarization properties of MGC-5-23-16 by analyzing long-term monitoring data from {\it NuSTAR} jointly with {\it IXPE} observations in May and November 2022. The re-analysis of {\it IXPE} data gives model-dependent polarization degree, PD (\%) = $1.55\pm0.99$ and $1.31\pm0.95$ in the energy band $2-8$ keV, agrees with previous studies within error bars. The model-independent analysis of PD poses an upper limit of $\leq3.8$ ($1\sigma$ level) for the same energy band. The observed upper limit of PD, along with broadband spectral analysis ($3-79$ keV), allowed us to derive corona geometry (i.e. length and height) and the accretion disk inclination ($\sim 33^\circ$). Additional {\it NuSTAR} observations were also analyzed to gain insights into the accretion flow properties of the source and to estimate the expected polarization during those epochs with PD $\sim 4.3\%$. The radius and height of the corona exhibited to vary between $28.2\pm3.1 - 39.8\pm4.6$ r$_s$ and $14.3\pm1.7-21.4\pm1.9$ r$_s$, with a mass outflow rate from the corona measuring $0.14\pm0.03-0.2\pm0.03$ Eddington rate ($\dot M_{\rm Edd}$). The estimated PD values were nearly constant up to a certain radial distance and height of the corona and then decreased for increasing corona geometry. The spectral analysis further provided an estimate for the mass of the central black hole $\sim 2\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$ and the velocity of the outflowing gas $\sim 0.16-0.19c$. Our modeling of the disk-corona-outflows and polarization connection can be extended and validated with data from recently launched India's first X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, offering potential applications to other sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an asteroseismological analysis on the non-Blazhko ab-type RR Lyrae star EPIC 248846335 employing the Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP) module of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) based on the set of stellar parameters. The atmospheric parameters as $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 6933$\pm$70 $K$, log $g$ = 3.35$\pm$ 0.50 and [Fe/H] = -1.18 $\pm$ 0.14 are estimated from the Low-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR9. The luminosity $L$ = 49.70$_{-1.80}^{+2.99}$ $L_\odot$ and mass M = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.07 $M_\odot$ are calculated, respectively, using the distance provided by Gaia and the metallicity estimated from the Low-Resolution Spectra. The Fourier parameters of the light curves observed by $K2$ and RV curves determined from the Medium-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR10 are also calculated in this work. The period of the fundamental mode of the star and the residuals $r$ of the Fourier parameters between the models and observations serve to select optimal model, whose stellar parameters are $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 6700 $\pm$ 220 K, log $g$ = 2.70, [Fe/H] = -1.20 $\pm$ 0.2, M = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$, and $L$ = 56.0 $\pm$ 4.2 $L_\odot$. The projection factors are constrained as 1.20 $\pm$ 0.02 and 1.59 $\pm$ 0.13 by the blue- and red-arm observed velocities with their corresponding RV curves derived from the best-fit model, respectively. The precise determination of stellar parameters in ab-type RR Lyrae stars is crucial for understanding the physical processes that occur during pulsation and for providing a deeper understanding of its Period-Luminosity relationship.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of the dark energy equation of the state parameter without tying ourselves to any specific cosmological model or parametrization except spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and flatness leading to a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Instead, we rely on actual observational data to guide our analysis. This is the first study in which we combine the cosmological background and the growth observations to reconstruct the equation of the state parameter of dark energy independent of the present values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. We use information about the Hubble parameter from cosmic chronometer data and the growth rate from observations related to growth rates. Our method involves a posterior approach of Gaussian process regression analysis to figure out the Hubble parameter and growth rate, plus their changes with redshift. The significant shift of paradigm in this study lies in the independence of the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state from any prior knowledge of the present Hubble parameter and matter energy density parameter. We find a slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom behavior. Intriguingly, we observe that the $\Lambda$CDM model nearly touches the lower boundary of the 1$\sigma$ confidence region for the reconstructed dark energy equation of state parameter in the redshift range $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$. However, it comfortably resides within the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the redshift range under investigation, $0\leq z \leq 1.5$. Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Blazar flares provide a window into the extreme physical processes occurring in relativistic outflows. Most numerical codes used for modeling blazar emission during flares utilize a simplified continuous-loss description of particle cooling due to the inverse Compton (IC) process, neglecting non-continuous (discrete) effects that arise in the Klein-Nishina (KN) regime. The significance of such effects has not been explored in detail yet. Aims. In this study, we investigate the importance of non-continuous Compton cooling losses and their impact on the electron spectrum and spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars during high flux states (flares), as well as in the low state. Methods. We solve numerically the full transport equation accounting for large relative jumps in energy, by extending our existing blazar flare modeling code EMBLEM. We perform a detailed physical modeling of the brightest gamma-ray flare of the archetypal Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) 3C 279 detected in June 2015. We then compare results obtained using the full cooling term and using the continuous-loss approximation. Results. We show that during flaring states of FSRQs characterized by high Compton dominance, the non-continuous cooling can lead to a significant modification of the electron spectrum, introducing a range of distinct features, such as low-energy tails, hardening/softening, narrow and extended particle excesses, and shifts in the cooling break position. Such distortion translates to differences in the associated SED up to 50%. This highlights the importance of non-continuous effects and the need to consider them in blazar emission models, particularly applied to extreme gamma-ray flares.

 - **Abstract**
 The poorly studied variable star V390 Sco, previously classified as a Mira pulsator, was detected in a brightening event by the ESA Gaia satellite in September 2023. This work presents an analysis of available archival multifrequency photometric data of this target, along with our spectroscopic observations. Our findings lead to the conclusion that V390 Sco is a new symbiotic star identified by Gaia, currently undergoing a classical symbiotic outburst. Additionally, we uncovered three prior outbursts of this system through archival photometry. The outbursts recur approximately every 2330 - 2400 days, and we hypothesize the periastron passage in an eccentric orbit may trigger them, similarly to the case of BX Mon, DD Mic, or MWC 560. A detailed investigation into the nature of the donor star suggested that V390 Sco is an S-type symbiotic star, likely hosting a less evolved, semiregularly pulsating giant donor, but not a Mira variable.
#### Instabilities in the Yellow Hypergiant domain

 - **Abstract**
 Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) are massive stars that are commonly interpreted to be in a post-red supergiant evolutionary state. These objects can undergo outbursts on timescales of decades, which are suspected to be due to instabilities in the envelope. To test this conjecture, the stability of envelope models for YHGs with respect to infinitesimal, radial perturbations is investigated. Violent strange mode instabilities with growth rates in the dynamical regime are identified if the luminosity to mass ratio exceeds $\approx 10^4$ in solar units. For the observed parameters of YHGs we thus predict instability. The strange mode instabilities persist over the entire range of effective temperatures from red to blue supergiants. Due to short thermal timescales and dominant radiation pressure in the envelopes of YHGs, a nonadiabatic stability analysis is mandatory and an adiabatic analysis being the basis of the common perception is irrelevant. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, the models considered here do not exhibit any adiabatic instability.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young supernova remnant (SNR). We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11 000 AA. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ~8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ~11000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well-mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg II resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly-ionized emission near the remnant's center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O III] HST image. The non-detection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si - S - Ar rich zone and/or that the observed [O III] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.
#### Resonant Ion Radiation Scattering and the Integrated Atomic  Cross-Section as applied to Binary Star Shock Fronts

 - **Abstract**
 The current literature is rather vague regarding how to calculate the exact numerical value of the resonant ion scattering cross-section that should be used for a specific bandpass of finite width. Such a value was needed in order to calculate the ion and mass densities in the shock fronts of hot, close binary star systems. This was done based on a modeling of ultraviolet wind-line profiles, using IUE spectra. Therefore, a numerical integration has been carried out, in wavelength-space, of the exact expression for the cross-section over two band-passes of astrophysical interest. The exact expression employed was that derived from a solution of the Abraham-Lorentz equation. The numerical results depend on the resonant wavelength, which is taken to be at the center of the bandpass. Most texts on the subject derive an expression for the scattering cross-section in frequency-space, based on the assumption that the radiation reaction term in the Abraham-Lorentz equation may be approximated by a resistive term. The integral of this cross-section over the entire spectrum is independent of the resonant frequency, except for the transition probability. This has limited practical use when dealing with fluxes measured in a bandpass of finite width expressed in wavelength units and scattering is the only mechanism for producing the observed fluxes. Such is the case when dealing with the low densities encountered in stellar winds and shock fronts. Integrated cross-sections that depend on the resonant wavelength are used to determine the number and mass densities of C IV and N V ions in the shock fronts found in some hot, eclipsing binary star systems, for which several IUE spectra have been obtained over a Keplerian orbital period. This then leans to a determination of the mass density and total mass in the shock once the volume of the shock is determined.

 - **Abstract**
 The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations, and we provide diagrammatic rules to systematically classify all possible contributions. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation [...]. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and outflows are the early signposts of stellar birth. Using the UKIRT Wide Field Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2) at 2.12 micron, 127 outflows are identified in molecular cloud complexes Vulpecula OB1 and IRDC G53.2 covering 12 square degrees of the Galactic plane. Using multi-wavelength datasets, from 1.2 to 70 micron, 79 young stellar objects (YSOs) are proposed as potential driving sources, where, $\sim$ 79% are likely Class 0/I protostars, 17% are Class II YSOs and the remaining 4% are Class III YSOs. The outflows are characterized in terms of their length, flux, luminosity and knot-spacing. The identified outflows have a median lobe length of 0.22 pc and 0.17 pc for outflows in Vulpecula OB1 and IRDC G53.2, respectively. Our analysis, from the knot spacing, reveals a typical ejection frequency of $\sim$ 1.2 kyr suggesting an intermediate type between the FU-Ori and EX-Ori type of eruptions in both cloud complexes. Furthermore, the physical parameters of the driving sources are obtained by performing radiative transfer modelling to the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which suggest that the outflows are driven by intermediate mass stars. Various observed trends between the outflow properties and the corresponding driving sources, and various interesting outflows and star forming sites, including sites of triggered star formation and protocluster forming clump with clusters of jets, are discussed. The obtained results and the identified jet-bearing protostellar sample will pave the way to understand many aspects of outflows with future high-resolution observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization carries invaluable information about the cosmology and astrophysics of the early Universe. Analyzing the data from a sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment typically involves navigating through an intricate parameter space to accurately address various factors such as foregrounds, beam uncertainties, ionospheric distortions, and receiver noise for the search of the cosmological 21-cm signal. The traditional likelihood-based sampling methods for modeling these effects could become computationally demanding for such highly complex models, which makes it infeasible to include physically motivated 21-cm signal models in the analysis. Moreover, the inference with these traditional methods is driven by the assumed functional form of the likelihood function. This work demonstrates how Simulation-Based Inference through Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) can naturally handle these issues at a significantly reduced computational cost than the likelihood-based methods. We estimate the posterior distribution on our model parameters with TMNRE for simulated mock observations, composed of beam-weighted foregrounds, physically motivated 21-cm signal, and radiometric noise. We find that maximizing the information content by simultaneously analyzing the data from multiple time slices and antennas significantly improves the parameter constraints and leads to a better exploration of the cosmological signal. We discuss the application of TMNRE for the current configuration of the REACH experiment and demonstrate how it can be utilized to explore potential avenues for REACH. The method presented here can be easily generalized for any sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment.
