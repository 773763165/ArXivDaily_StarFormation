 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this work is to supplement the "Stars with solar-type activity" catalog with information about confirmed exoplanets and exoplanet candidates. To do this, cross-identification of the catalog stars with data from the NASA exoplanet archive was carried out. This article presents the distribution of the number of suspected stars with exoplanets by brightness, spectral type, amplitude of variability, as well as other statistical analysis data. Particular attention has been paid to the comparison of the periods of rotation of stars and the orbital periods of revolution of exoplanets around them. Analysis of the data suggests the need to change the previously determined types of variability in some stars.

 We present a collection of $\sim10,000$ X-ray sources from the 4th XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13) with literature-verified classifications and multi-wavelength (MW) counterparts. We describe the process by which MW properties are obtained and an interactive online visualization tool we developed.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST measured the infrared spectra of Saturn's rings and several of its small moons (Epimetheus, Pandora, Telesto and Pallene) as part of Guaranteed Time Observation program 1247. The NIRSpec instrument obtained near-infrared spectra of the small moons between 0.6 and 5.3 microns, which are all dominated by water-ice absorption bands. The shapes of the water-ice bands for these moons suggests that their surfaces contain variable mixes of crystalline and amorphous ice or variable amounts of contaminants and/or sub-micron ice grains. The near-infrared spectrum of Saturn's A ring has exceptionally high signal-to-noise between 2.7 and 5 microns and is dominated by features due to highly crystalline water ice. The ring spectrum also confirms that the rings possess a 2-3% deep absorption at 4.13 microns due to deuterated water-ice previously seen by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft. This spectrum also constrains the fundamental absorption bands of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and may contain evidence for a weak aliphatic hydrocarbon band. Meanwhile, the MIRI instrument obtained mid-infrared spectra of the rings between 4.9 and 27.9 microns, where the observed signal is a combination of reflected sunlight and thermal emission. This region shows a strong reflectance peak centered around 9.3 microns that can be attributed to crystalline water ice. Since both the near and mid-infrared spectra are dominated by highly crystalline water ice, they should provide a useful baseline for interpreting the spectra of other objects in the outer solar system with more complex compositions.

 - **Abstract**
 In the regime of cosmology and large-scale structure formation, filaments are vital components of the cosmic web. This study employs statistical methods to examine the formation, evolution, and cosmological constraints of filaments identified by DisPerSe. We run large-sample of N-body simulations to study the filament length and mass functions and their evolution. In general, the filament length function can be fitted by a power law with both the normalization and power index dependent on redshift and cosmological parameters. It is discovered that filament properties are influenced by various cosmological parameters, with $\sigma_8$ and $n_s$ exhibiting slightly stronger dependence than $\Omega_m$. We also uncover a three-stage filament formation process from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 1$: rapid formation of long and short filaments from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 2$, persistence of long filaments from $z \sim 2$ to $z \sim 1$, followed by fragmentation and increased prevalence of shorter filaments below $z \sim 1$. Additionally, both large and small-scale perturbations in power spectrum influence filament growth, with a characteristic scale around $k \sim 0.265$, wherein changes in matter fluctuations larger than this scale result in the formation of long filaments, while changes smaller than this scale have the opposite effect. These insights enhance our understanding of filament evolution and their cosmological relevance and also highlight their potential cosmological applications in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (CCs) are excellent tracers for understanding the structure of the Milky Way disk. The latest Gaia Data Release 3 provides a large number of line-of-sight velocity information for Galactic CCs, offering an opportunity for studying the kinematics of the Milky Way. We determine the three-dimensional velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center. From the projections of the 3D velocities onto the XY plane of the Galactic disk, we find that $V_{R}$ and $V_{\phi}$ velocities of the northern and southern warp (directions with highest amplitude) are different. This phenomenon may be related to the warp precession or the asymmetry of the warp structure. By investigating the kinematic warp model, we find that the vertical velocity of CCs is more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate than the line of nodes angles. Our results suggest that CCs at $12-14$ kpc are the best sample for determining the Galactic warp precession rate. Based on the spatial structure parameters of Cepheid warp from Chen et al (arXiv:1902.00998), we determine a warp precession rate of $\omega = 4.9\pm1.6$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ at 13 kpc, which supports a low precession rate in the warp model. In the future, more kinematic information on CCs will help to better constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.
#### Comparing transit spectroscopy pipelines at the catalogue level:  evidence for systematic differences

 - **Abstract**
 The challenge of inconsistent results from different data pipelines, even when starting from identical data, is a recognized concern in exoplanetary science. As we transition into the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era and prepare for the ARIEL space mission, addressing this issue becomes paramount because of its implications on our understanding of exoplanets. Although comparing pipeline results for individual exoplanets has become more common, this study is the first to compare pipeline results at the catalogue level. We present a comprehensive framework to statistically compare the outcomes of data analysis reduction on a population of exoplanets and we leverage the large number of observations conducted using the same instrument configured with HST-WFC3. We employ three independent pipelines: Iraclis, EXCALIBUR, and CASCADe. Our combined findings reveal that these pipelines, despite starting from the same data and planet system parameters, yield substantially different spectra in some cases. However, the most significant manifestations of pipeline differences are observed in the compositional trends of the resulting exoplanet catalogues. We conclude that pipeline-induced differences lead to biases in the retrieved information, which are not reflected in the retrieved uncertainties. Our findings underscore the critical need to confront these pipeline differences to ensure the reproducibility, accuracy, and reliability of results in exoplanetary research. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for population-level bias that pipelines may inject, which could compromise our understanding of exoplanets as a class of objects.
#### New stairways to the stars. Birth and evolution of two pioneering Usenet  newsgroups in astrophysics (1983-1994)
 - **Authors:** Monica Marra

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15845
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15845
 - **Abstract**
 The foundation of two pioneering Usenet newsgroups in astrophysics - still existent today - and some of the main milestones in their history have been tracked from the origins at Princeton University in 1983 to 1994. To this aim, in line with authoritative recommendations from the discipline of web history, different kinds of sources have been retrieved and combined: mainly, online archives of Usenet newsgroups and human sources. The latter have included on one side the kind contribution provided by four astrophysicists, two of which had a role in the maintaining of these newsgroups, through individual interviews; on the other side that from the sixty-seven researchers who answered a purpose-built questionnaire submitted within the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in May 2023.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15874
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15874
 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of various classification algorithms used for the detection of exoplanets using labeled time series data from the Kepler mission. The study investigates the performance of six commonly employed algorithms, namely Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The evaluation process involves analyzing a dataset that consists of time series measurements of star brightness, accompanied by labels indicating the presence or absence of exoplanets. To assess the effectiveness of each algorithm in accurately identifying exoplanets, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are employed. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 94.2\%, followed closely by the Support Vector Machine with 93.8 percent accuracy. The Logistic Regression algorithm achieves an accuracy of 91.5 percent, while the K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree algorithms achieve accuracies of 89.6\%, 87.3\%, and 85.9\% respectively. Furthermore, the precision, recall, and F1 score metrics provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier. The Random Forest algorithm exhibits a precision of 0.92, recall of 0.95, and F1 score of 0.93, indicating a balanced performance in correctly identifying both positive and negative instances. The Support Vector Machine also demonstrates strong performance with precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.91, 0.94, and 0.92 respectively. The evaluation demonstrates that Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms are well-suited for exoplanet detection using Kepler time series data. These findings enhance our understanding of the detection process and assist in selecting suitable algorithms for future studies.
#### The statistics of Rayleigh-Levy flight extrema

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15915
 - **Abstract**
 Rayleigh-Levy flights have played a significant role in cosmology as simplified models for understanding how matter distributes itself under gravitational influence. These models also exhibit numerous remarkable properties that enable the prediction of a wide range of characteristics. Here, we derive the one and two point statistics of extreme points within Rayleigh-Levy flights spanning one to three dimensions, stemming directly from fundamental principles. In the context of the mean field limit, we provide straightforward closed-form expressions for Euler counts and their correlations, particularly in relation to their clustering behaviour over long distances. Additionally, quadratures allow for the computation of extreme value number densities. A comparison between theoretical predictions in 1D and Monte Carlo measurements shows remarkable agreement. Given the widespread use of Rayleigh-Levy processes, these comprehensive findings offer significant promise not only in astrophysics but also in broader applications beyond the field.
#### Gravitational Waves from Kinetic Preheating

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16152
 - **Abstract**
 We study gravitational wave production during kinetic preheating after inflation with a focus on scenarios that arise in $\alpha$-attractor models where a scalar dilaton-like inflaton is kinetically coupled to a second scalar field. We present high-resolution lattice simulations of three $\alpha$-attractor models for a range of parameters to probe regions where preheating is efficient. We find that preheating in these models can be extremely violent, resulting in gravitational wave energy densities that can be constrained by cosmic microwave background measurements of the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\rm eff}$
#### Phase-Space Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16234
 - **Abstract**
 The reconstruction of density and velocity fields is of central importance to the interpretation of $N$-body simulations. We propose a phase-space extension of the Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE) that tracks the dark matter fluid in phase-space. The new reconstruction scheme removes several artifacts from the conventional DTFE in multi-stream regions, while preserving the adaptive resolution in high-density regions and yielding continuous fields. The estimator also removes tessellation artifacts of a previously proposed phase-space reconstruction scheme.
#### Discrete spectra in phase mixing

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16252
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16252
 - **Abstract**
 We study solutions of the collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) in a functional Koopman representation. This facilitates the use of linear spectral techniques characteristic of the analysis of Schr{\"o}dinger-type equations. For illustrative purposes, we consider the classical phase mixing of a non-interacting distribution function in a quartic potential. Solutions are determined perturbatively relative to a harmonic oscillator. We impose a form of coarse-graining by choosing a finite dimensional basis to represent the distribution function and time evolution operators, which sets a minimum length scale on phase space structure. We observe a relationship between the dimension of the representation and the multiplicity of the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues. The quartic potential splits the degenerate eigenvalues, which drives mixing in the CBE solution.
#### Red Asymmetry of H$_α$ Line Profiles during the flares on the  active RS CVn-type star II Pegasi

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have recently attracted much attention for their impacts on stellar evolution and surrounding exoplanets. RS CVn-type stars could produce large flares, and therefore may have frequent CMEs. Here we report the capture of a possible CME or chromospheric condensation on the RS CVn-type star II Pegasi (II Peg) using high-resolution spectroscopic observation. Two flares were detected during the observation, and the low limits of the flare energies are of the order of $10^{33}$ erg and $10^{34}$ erg, respectively. Using mean spectrum subtraction, the H$_{\alpha}$ residual shows red asymmetry during the flares, and the redshifted broad emission components are probably caused by chromospheric condensation or coronal rain. Moreover, a far redshifted extra emission component with a high bulk velocity of 429 km s$^{-1}$ was observed during the second flare and is probably due to a prominence eruption. The velocity greatly exceeds the star's escape velocity, which means that this eruption can develop into a CME. The CME mass is estimated to be 0.83-1.48 $\times 10^{20}$ g, which is slightly larger than the value expected from solar flare-CME extrapolation. The kinetic energy of CME, derived to be 0.76-1.15 $\times 10^{35}$ erg, is less than the kinetic energy extrapolated from solar events. Additionally, we could not completely rule out the possibility of chromospheric condensation resulting in the far redshifted extra emission. Finally, there is a blueshifted broad component in the subtracted H$_{\alpha}$ profile derived using synthesized spectral subtraction when no flare happened, and its behavior is associated with the H$_{\alpha}$ activity features.
#### The quadruple spectroheliograph of Meudon observatory (1909-1959)

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16436
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16436
 - **Abstract**
 The spectroheliograph was invented independently by Henri Deslandres (France) and George Hale (USA) in 1892, following the spectroscopic method suggested by Jules Janssen in 1869. This instrument is dedicated to the production of monochromatic images of the Sun in order to reveal the structures of the photosphere and the chromosphere at various altitudes. Sporadic observations started in Paris, but Deslandres moved soon to Meudon and designed, with Lucien d'Azambuja, an universal and powerful instrument, the quadruple spectroheliograph. It was devoted to systematic observations of the Sun (the long-term activity survey since 1908) and scientific research in solar physics. This paper describes the instrument and presents some original observations made with the high dispersion 7-metre spectrograph. It was dismantled in the sixties, but the solar patrol continued with the 3-metre chambers with H$\alpha$ and CaII K lines, and is still working today with the numerical version of the spectroheliograph.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy neutrinos could be produced in the interaction of charged cosmic rays with matter or radiation surrounding astrophysical sources. To look for transient sources associated with neutrino emission, a follow-up program of neutrino alerts has been operating within the ANTARES Collaboration since 2009. This program, named TAToO, has triggered robotic optical telescopes (MASTER, TAROT, ROTSE and the SVOM ground based telescopes) immediately after the detection of any relevant neutrino candidate and scheduled several observations in the weeks following the detection. A subset of ANTARES events with highest probabilities of being of cosmic origin has also been followed by the Swift and the INTEGRAL satellites, the Murchison Widefield Array radio telescope and the H.E.S.S. high-energy gamma-ray telescope. The results of twelve years of observations are reported. No optical counterpart has been significantly associated with an ANTARES candidate neutrino signal during image analysis. Constraints on transient neutrino emission have been set. In September 2015, ANTARES issued a neutrino alert and during the follow-up, a potential transient counterpart was identified by Swift and MASTER. A multi-wavelength follow-up campaign has allowed to identify the nature of this source and has proven its fortuitous association with the neutrino. The return of experience is particularly important for the design of the alert system of KM3NeT, the next generation neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea.
#### Multi-Messenger Windows on the Universe: detecting precursor emission to  compacts' mergers
 - **Authors:** Maxim Lyutikov (Purdue)
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16504
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16504
 - **Abstract**
 We provide an overview of various mechanisms, and corresponding powers, of precursor emission to compacts' mergers to be detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. Expected peak powers, $\leq 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are not sufficiently high to be detected by all-sky high-energy satellites (unless beamed). The best chance is the detection of possible coherent radio emission, producing observable signals up to $\sim$ Jansky of flux density. Low-frequency phased array telescopes like LOFAR, the MWA and DSA-2000 are best suited due to their large instantaneous sky coverage. Time-wise, in addition to LIGO early warning alerts up to a minute before the merger, the dispersive delay at lower frequencies of $\sim$ 300 MHz can be of the order of minutes. Optical detections are the most challenging.
#### Small-Scale Anisotropies of Cosmic Rays from Turbulent Flow

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16554
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16554
 - **Abstract**
 Within the classical convection--diffusion approximation, we show that the angular distribution of cosmic rays (CRs) in a highly turbulent flow may exhibit significant small-scale anisotropies. The CR intensity angular power spectrum $ C_\ell $ is then a direct reflection of interstellar turbulence, from which one expects $ C_\ell\propto\ell^{-\gamma -1} $ for $ \ell\gg 1 $, where $ \gamma $ is the power-law turbulence spectral index. Observations by IceCube and HAWC at TeV energies can be explained approximately with the Kolmogorov law $ \gamma =5/3 $ with a convection velocity dispersion of 20 km/s on the scale of 10 pc.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16626
 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modeling of the multi-messenger signatures connected to binary neutron star mergers requires proper knowledge on the final remnant's fate and the conditions under which black holes (BHs) can form in such mergers. In this article, we use a suite of 84 numerical-relativity simulations in 28 different physical setups to explore the impact of the individual stars' spin on the merger outcome and on the early postmerger dynamics. We find that for setups close to the prompt-collapse threshold, the stars' intrinsic spin significantly changes the lifespan of the remnant before collapse and that the mass of the debris disk surrounding the BH is also altered. To enable a better understanding of BH formation, we check if there is at least a theoretical chance of observing densities that are above the maximum density allowed in a stable isolated neutron star, and we investigate the importance of different pressure contributions on the evolution of the postmerger remnant and BH formation.
#### Pulsating hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs observed  with TESS VI. Asteroseismology of the GW Vir-type central star of the  Planetary Nebula NGC 246

 - **Abstract**
 Significant advances have been achieved through the latest improvements in the photometric observations accomplished by the recent space missions, substantially boosting the study of pulsating stars via asteroseismology. The TESS mission has already proven to be of relevance for pulsating white dwarf and pre-white dwarf stars. We report a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the pulsating PG 1159 star NGC 246 (TIC3905338), the central star of the planetary nebula NGC 246, based on high-precision photometric data gathered by the TESS space mission. We reduced TESS observations of NGC 246 and performed a detailed asteroseismic analysis using fully evolutionary PG 1159 models computed accounting for the complete prior evolution of their progenitors. We constrained the mass of this star by comparing the measured mean period spacing with the average of the computed period spacings of the models and also employed the observed individual periods to search for a seismic stellar model. We extracted 17 periodicities from the TESS light curves from the two sectors where NGC246 was observed. All the oscillation frequencies are associated with g-mode pulsations, with periods spanning from ~1460 to ~1823s. We found a constant period spacing of $\Delta\Pi= 12.9$s, allowing us to deduce that the stellar mass is larger than ~0.87 Mo if the period spacing is assumed to be associated with l= 1 modes, and ~ 0.568 Mo if it is associated with l= 2 modes. The less massive models are more consistent with the distance constraint from Gaia parallax. Although we were not able to find a unique asteroseismic model for this star, the period-to-period fit analyses suggest a high-stellar mass ($\gtrsim$0.74 Mo) when the observed periods are associated with modes with l= 1 only, and both a high ($\gtrsim$ 0.74 Mo) and intermediate (~0.57 Mo) stellar mass when the observed periods are associated with modes with l= 1 and 2.
#### TESS photometry and CAOS spectroscopy of six eclipsing binaries with Am  components

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive study of six eclipsing binaries whose components are confirmed or suspected Am stars. By combining long-term high-resolution CAOS spectroscopy and TESS photometry we have been able to accurately obtain the orbital parameters of each system as well as the atmospheric parameters of its components. We performed an in-depth chemical analysis and provided chemical abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. From the solution of the light and radial curves, we have determined masses, radii, and temperatures with good accuracy. We observe apsidal motion in the eccentric system HD216429, in which the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect is also noted. We inferred the age of our targets by fitting isochrones on the HR diagram and find that both components in each system are properly described with the same isochrone, which reinforce our results. Furthermore, dynamical and evolutionary masses, independently obtained, show an excellent agreement. According to the out-of-eclipse variability shown in their TESS light curves and their position on the HR diagram, we claim the pulsating nature of the stars HD42954 (as delta Sct type) and HD151604 (gamma Dor). Based on the chemical analysis we corroborate that four of the systems studied here are formed by Am stars, while in the remaining ones (HD126031 and HD216429) only the primary component exhibits a peculiar composition. Additionally, the age distribution found in Am stars supports their suitability as age tracers in stellar populations.

 Imaging is the process of transforming noisy, incomplete data into a space that humans can interpret. NIFTy is a Bayesian framework for imaging and has already successfully been applied to many fields in astrophysics. Previous design decisions held the performance and the development of methods in NIFTy back. We present a rewrite of NIFTy, coined NIFTy.re, which reworks the modeling principle, extends the inference strategies, and outsources much of the heavy lifting to JAX. The rewrite dramatically accelerates models written in NIFTy, lays the foundation for new types of inference machineries, improves maintainability, and enables interoperability between NIFTy and the JAX machine learning ecosystem.

 - **Abstract**
 Tropical cyclones occur over the Earth's tropical oceans, with characteristic genesis regions and tracks tied to the warm ocean surface that provides energy to sustain these storms. The study of tropical cyclogenesis and evolution on Earth has led to the development of environmental favorability metrics that predict the strength of potential storms from the local background climate state. Simulations of the gamut of transiting terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars may offer a test of this Earth-based understanding of tropical cyclogenesis. Previous work has demonstrated that tropical cyclones are likely to form on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with intermediate rotation periods of $\sim 8-10~\mathrm{days}$. In this study, we test these expectations using ExoCAM simulations with both a sufficient horizontal resolution of 0.47$^\circ$ x 0.63$^\circ$ required to permit tropical cyclogenesis along with a thermodynamically active slab ocean. We conduct simulations of tidally locked and ocean-covered Earth-sized planets orbiting late-type M dwarf stars with varying rotation periods from 4-16 days in order to cross the predicted maximum in tropical cyclogenesis. We track tropical cyclones that form in each simulation and assess their location of maximum wind, evolution, and maximum wind speeds. We compare the resulting tropical cyclone locations and strengths to predictions based on environmental favorability metrics, finding good agreement between the Earth-based metrics and our simulated storms with a local maximum in both tropical cyclone frequency and intensity at a rotation period of 8 days. Our results suggest that environmental favorability metrics used for tropical cyclones on Earth may also be applicable to temperate tidally locked Earth-sized rocky exoplanets with abundant surface liquid water.

 Context.Spatially-resoved cicrumstellar disk spectrum and composition can provide valuable insights into the bulk composition of forming planets, as well as the mineralogical signatures that emerge during and after planet formation. Aims. We aim to systemically extract the RX~J1604.3-213010 (J1604 hereafter) protoplanetary disk in high-contrast imaging observations, and obtain its multi-band reflectance in visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Methods. We obtained coronagraphic observations of J1604 from the Keck Observatory's NIRC2 instrument, and archival data from the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument. Using archival images to remove star light and speckles, we recovered the J1604 disk and obtained its surface brightness using forward modeling. Together with polarization data, we obtained the relative reflectance of the disk in $R$, $J$, $H$ ($H2$ and $H3$), $K$ ($K1$ and $K2$), and $L'$ bands spanning two years. Results. Relative to the J1604 star, the resolved disk has a reflectance of ${\sim}10^{-1}$~arcsec$^{-2}$ in $R$ through $H$ bands and ${\sim}10^{-2}$~arcsec$^{-2}$ in $K$ and $L'$ bands, showing a blue color. Together with other systems, we summarized the multi-band reflectance for 9 systems. We also identified varying disk geometry structure, and a shadow that vanished between June and August in 2015. Conclusions. Motivated by broad-band observations, the deployment of cutting-edge technologies could yield higher-resolution reflection spectra, thereby informing the dust composition of disks in scattered light in the future. With multi-epoch observations, variable shadows have the potential to deepen insights into the dynamic characteristics of inner disk regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric escape is crucial to understand the evolution of planets in and out of the Solar system and to interpret atmospheric observations. While hydrodynamic escape simulations have been actively developed incorporating detailed processes such as UV heating, chemical reactions, and radiative cooling, the radiative cooling by molecules has been treated as emission from selected lines or rotational/vibrational bands to reduce its numerical cost. However, ad hoc selections of radiative lines would risk estimating inaccurate cooling rates because important lines or wavelengths for atmospheric cooling depend on emitting conditions such as temperature and optical thickness. In this study, we apply the correlated-k distribution (CKD) method to cooling rate calculations for H$_2$-dominant transonic atmospheres containing H$_2$O or CO as radiative species, to investigate its numerical performance and the importance of considering all lines of the molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that the sum of weak lines, which provides only 1 % of the line emission energy in total at optically thin conditions, can become the primary source of radiative cooling in optically thick regions, especially for H$_2$O-containing atmospheres. Also, in our hydrodynamic simulations, the CKD method with a wavelength resolution of 1000 is found to be effective, allowing the calculation of escape rate and temperature profiles with acceptable numerical cost. Our results show the importance of treating all radiative lines and the usefulness of the CKD method in hydrodynamic escape simulations. It is particularly practical for heavy-element-enriched atmospheres considered in small exoplanets, including super-Earths, without any prior selections for effective lines.

 - **Abstract**
 A key strategy in defending against stray asteroids is deflection from a collision trajectory by a low-momentum impact. This is to avoid a potential rain of large hazardous fragments, which high-momentum blasts may generate. Using a proof-of-principle numerical model, we show that even low-momentum impacts on rubble pile asteroids (RPAs), which most asteroids are, may lead to their fracturing into large fragments because of their internal non-uniform chain-like stress distribution. Since stress chains occur in three- and two-dimensional (2D) loose aggregates, we study low-momentum impacts on gravity-aggregated clusters in 2D. We establish that stresses are indeed supported by chains and show that the post-impact dynamic shear stress and displacement rates are highest along the chains, increasing significantly the risk of fracturing there. Our simulations suggest that this phenomenon is independent of the cluster's particle size distribution. We conclude that future studies must be carried out to quantify the relations between the risk of fracturing and stress chain statistics in RPAs.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of primordial fluctuations is critical to our comprehension of the Universe's early stages. While these fluctuations are known to be nearly scale-invariant, quasi-adiabatic, and nearly Gaussian on large scales, their behavior at smaller scales remains less well-defined and may offer insights into new physics. Recent observations by the NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, and CPTA collaborations suggest the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background, which, while consistent with the contribution from supermassive black hole binaries, also opens the possibility of probing new physics. This paper explores whether this signal could stem from primordial isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations. We adopt parameterized spectra for both types of fluctuations to fit the observations from the latest NANOGrav data. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian analysis to assess the distinguishability of these models in light of current PTA sensitivities. Our findings indicate that with the capabilities, PTAs cannot conclusively differentiate between isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH), in the interstellar medium (ISM), has become a never-ending story for astrochemistry and astrophysics researchers because that molecule plays a possible connection between the Universe and the origin of life. In the last forty years, all searches for NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the ISM at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have failed. Since the detection of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the ISM was extremely difficult, we aimed to search for the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH. Earlier, many laboratory experiments have suggested that methylamine (CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$) plays an important role in the ISM as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH. After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The column density of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was estimated to be (1.10$\pm$0.31)$\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 180.8$\pm$25.5 K. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (8.80$\pm$2.60)$\times$10$^{-8}$. The column density ratio of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$CN towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (1.86$\pm$0.95)$\times$10$^{2}$. The estimated fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 agrees fairly well with the previous three-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$. We also discussed the possible formation mechanism of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$, and we find that CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ is most probably formed via the reactions of radical CH$_{3}$ and radical NH$_{2}$ on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to provide a detailed characterization of near-infrared spectra for young LT brown dwarfs, including robust spectral typing, calibrating spectral indices, identifying possible binaries, and selecting suitable spectral standards. We processed and analyzed archival spectra from VLT/X-shooter for a sample of 56 dwarfs with ages between 10 and 600 Myr and spectral types between late-M and mid-T. We re-determine spectral types by comparing them with a set of literature templates and assess a large range of spectral indices, calibrated using a specifically designed literature sample. We are able to identify 15 spectral indices that are useful for spectral typing for specific spectral ranges discussed here and provide the scaling relations with spectral types. Moreover, we also identify 6 spectral indices which can be used to separate young L dwarfs from the field ones. The equivalent-widths of the alkali lines show a correlation with age, increasing towards the objects with higher surface gravity. From our sample, we confirm 3 that are likely to be binaries by their anomalous spectra that appear to be better fitted by a combination of spectral types. Finally, we identify 12 objects as preliminary near-infrared spectral standards for young LT dwarfs. This paper presents a significant step toward understanding the spectral sequence and properties of young L and T dwarfs. The relations and standards provided here will be useful for future spectroscopic work on young brown dwarfs and giant planets.
