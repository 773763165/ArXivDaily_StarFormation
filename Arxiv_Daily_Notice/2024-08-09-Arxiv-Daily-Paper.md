          A Candidate Giant Planet Companion to the Massive, Young White Dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139 Informs the Occurrence of Giant Planets Orbiting B Stars

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that giant planet occurrence peaks for stars with $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ at a value a factor of four higher than observed for solar-mass stars. This population of giant planets predicted to frequently orbit main sequence B stars at $a~\approx~10$ AU is difficult to characterize observationally while fusion persists in their host stars. Fortunately, stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$ sustain fusion for only a few hundred million years. By the time those stars become massive, young white dwarfs, any giant planets present would still be luminous as a consequence of their recent formation. From an initial sample of 3268 Gaia-identified massive, young white dwarfs, we use homogeneous Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry to search for evidence of unresolved giant planets. For 30 systems, these IRAC data provide sensitivity to objects with $M~\lesssim~10~M_{\text{Jup}}$, and we identify one candidate with $M~\approx~4~M_{\text{Jup}}$ orbiting the white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139. Correcting for the possibility that some of the white dwarfs in our sample result from mergers, we find a giant planet occurrence $\eta_{\text{GP}}~=~0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.13}$ for stars with initial masses $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$. Our occurrence inference is consistent with both the Doppler-inferred occurrence of giant planets orbiting $M_{\ast}~\approx~2~M_{\odot}$ giant stars and the theoretically predicted factor-of-four enhancement in the occurrence of giant planets orbiting $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ stars relative to solar-mass stars. Future James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera observations of our sample would provide sensitivity to Saturn-mass planets and thereby a definitive estimate of the occurrence of giant planets orbiting stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.

          Formation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) via SH radicals in interstellar CO-rich ice under dense cloud conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is widely observed in the gas phase towards star-forming regions and was the first of the only two sulfur-bearing species detected in interstellar ices so far. However, the chemical network governing its formation is still not fully understood. While the sulfurization of CO and the oxidation of CS are often invoked to form OCS, other mechanisms could have a significant contribution. In particular, the multistep reaction involving CO and SH is a good candidate to forming OCS in dense cloud environments. We aim to constrain the viability of the CO + SH route to forming solid OCS in the interstellar medium, in a similar manner as CO + OH is known to produce CO2 ice. This is achieved by conducting a systematic laboratory investigation of the targeted reactions on interstellar ice analogues under dense cloud conditions. An ultrahigh vacuum chamber is utilized to simultaneously deposit CO, H2S, and atomic H at 10 K. SH radicals produced in situ via hydrogen abstraction from H2S react with CO to form OCS. OCS is efficiently formed through surface reactions involving CO, H2S, and H atoms. The suggested underlying mechanism behind OCS formation is CO + SH -> HSCO followed by HSCO + H -> OCS + H2. The OCS yield reduces slowly, but remains significant with increasing CO:H2S mixing ratios (CO:H2S = 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1). Our experiments provide unambiguous evidence that OCS can be formed from CO + SH in the presence of H atoms. This route remains efficient for large H2S dilutions (5% w.r.t CO), suggesting that it is a viable mechanism in interstellar ices. Given that SH radicals can be created in clouds throughout a wide evolutionary timescale, this mechanism could have a non-negligible contribution to forming interstellar OCS ice.

          Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum II: Octupole including Brown's Hamiltonian

 - **Abstract**
 The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a massive perturber is analyzed analytically in the high eccentricity regime. Perturbations on the time scale of the outer orbit can accumulate over long timescales and be comparable to the effect of the octupole term. These perturbations are described by Brown's Hamiltonian - having different forms in the literature. We show that at the high eccentricity regime - the effect of Brown's Hamiltonian is an azimuthal precesssion of the eccentricity vector and can be solved analytically. In fact, the dynamics are equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion.

 - **Abstract**
 Crush curves are of fundamental importance to numerical modeling of small and porous astrophysical bodies. The empirical literature often measures them for silica grains, and different studies have used various methods, sizes, textures, and pressure conditions. Here we review past studies and supplement further experiments in order to develop a full and overarching understanding of the silica crush curve behavior. We suggest a new power-law function that can be used in impact simulations of analog materials similar to micro-granular silica. We perform a benchmarking study to compare this new crush curve to the parametric quadratic crush curve often used in other studies, based on the study case of the DART impact onto the asteroid Dimorphos. We find that the typical quadratic crush curve parameters do not closely follow the silica crushing experiments, and as a consequence they under (over) estimate compression close (far) from the impact site. The new crush curve presented here, applicable to pressures between a few hundred Pa and up to 1.1 GPa, might therefore be more precise. Additionally, it is not calibrated by case-specific parameters, and can be used universally for comet- or asteroid-like bodies, given an assumed composition similar to micro-granular silica.

 - **Abstract**
 MIRC-X and MYSTIC are six-telescope near-infrared beam (1.08-2.38 ${\mu}$m) combiners at the CHARA Array on Mt Wilson CA, USA. Ever since the commissioning of MIRC-X (J and H bands) in 2018 and MYSTIC (K bands) in 2021, they have been the most popular and over-subscribed instruments at the array. Observers have been able to image stellar objects with sensitivity down to 8.1 mag in H and 7.8 mag in K-band under the very best conditions. In 2022 MYSTIC was upgraded with a new ABCD mode using the VLTI/GRAVITY 4-beam integrated optics chip, with the goal of improving the sensitivity and calibration. The ABCD mode has been used to observe more than 20 T Tauri stars; however, the data pipeline is still being developed. Alongside software upgrades, we detail planned upgrades to both instruments in this paper. The main upgrades are: 1) Adding a motorized filter wheel to MIRC-X along with new high spectral resolution modes 2) Updating MIRC-X optics to allow for simultaneous 6T J+H observations 3) Removing the warm window between the spectrograph and the warm optics in MYSTIC 4) Adding a 6T ABCD mode to MIRC-X in collaboration with CHARA/SPICA 5) Updating the MIRC-X CRED-ONE camera funded by Prof. Kraus from U. Exeter 6) Carrying out science verification of the MIRC-X polarization mode 7) Developing new software for ABCD-mode data reduction and more efficient calibration routines. We expect these upgrades to not only improve the observing experience, but also increase the sensitivity by 0.4 mag in J+H-bands, and 1 mag in K-band.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of protoplanetary disks in the millimeter continuum have shown a variety of radial gaps, cavities, and spiral features. These substructures may be signposts for ongoing planet formation, and therefore these systems are promising targets for direct imaging planet searches in the near-infrared. To this end, we present results from a deep imaging survey in the $L'$-band (3.8 $\mu$m) with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph to search for young planets in 43 disks with resolved features in the millimeter continuum or evidence for gaps/central cavities from their spectral energy distributions. Although we do not detect any new point sources, using the vortex coronagraph allows for high sensitivity to faint sources at small angular separations (down to ${\sim}$0$^{\prime\prime}$.1), allowing us to place strong upper limits on the masses of potential gas giant planets. We compare our mass sensitivities to the masses of planets derived using ALMA observations, and while we are sensitive to $\sim$1 M$_{Jup}$ planets in the gaps in some of our systems, we are generally not sensitive to planets of the masses expected from the ALMA observations. In addition to placing upper limits on the masses of gas giant planets that could be interacting with the dust in the disks to form the observed millimeter substructures, we are also able to map the micron-sized dust as seen in scattered light for 8 of these systems. Our large sample of systems also allows us to investigate limits on planetary accretion rates and disk viscosities.

          Are long gamma-ray bursts progenitors to merging binary black holes?

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the population of BBH progenitors. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by Ghirlanda & Salvaterra (2022) and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well-described by a power law with minimum delay time $10$ Myr and slope $\alpha ={-0.96}^{+0.64}_{-0.85}$ (90\% credibility). This matches theoretical predictions for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turns lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most $f = {0.04}^{+0.18}_{-0.03}$ of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBH. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff} > 0.2$). In this case, we find $f = {0.003}^{+0.011}_{-0.002}$ and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power law slopes we consider ($\alpha = -2$).

 - **Abstract**
 Deriving high quality lightcuves for asteroids and other periodic sources from survey data is challenging due to many factors, including the sparsely sampled observational record and diurnal aliasing which is a signature imparted into the periodic signal of a source that is a function of the observing schedule of ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining asteroid observational records from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) which are the ground- and space-based facilities, respectively, to determine to what degree the data from the space-based facility can suppress diurnal aliases. Furthermore, we examine several optimizations that are used to derive the rotation periods of asteroids which we then compare to the reported rotation periods in the literature. Through this analysis we find that we can reliably derive the rotation periods for ~85% of our sample of 222 objects that are also reported in the literature and that the remaining ~15% are difficult to reliably derive as many are asteroids that are insufficiently elongated which produces a lightcurve with an insufficient amplitude and consequently, an incorrect rotation period. We also investigate a binary classification method that biases against reporting incorrect rotation periods. We conclude the paper by assessing the utility of using other ground- or space-based facilities as companion telescopes to the forthcoming Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the possibility of accommodating both early and late-time tensions using a novel reinforcement learning technique. By applying this technique, we aim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the present epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the goodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and late time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.

 - **Abstract**
 Linear equations with periodic coefficients describe the behavior of various dynamical systems. This studying is devoted to their applications to the planetary restricted three-body problem (RTBP). Here we consider the Laplace method for determining perturbation in coordinates. We show that classical theory of perturbation leads to a linear equation with periodic coefficients. Than we present a modification of Laplace method. This modification allows us to study motion over a longer time interval.

          Expanding covariant cosmography of the local Universe: incorporating the snap and axial symmetry

 - **Abstract**
 Studies show that the model-independent, fully non-perturbative covariant cosmographic approach is suitable for analyzing the local Universe $(z\lesssim 0.1)$. However, accurately characterizing large and inhomogeneous mass distributions requires the fourth-order term in the redshift expansion of the covariant luminosity distance $d_L(z,\boldsymbol{n})$. We calculate the covariant snap parameter $\mathbb{S}$ and its spherical harmonic multipole moments using the matter expansion tensor and the evolution equations for lightray bundles. The fourth-order term adds 36 degrees of freedom, since the highest independent multipole of the snap is the 32-pole (dotriacontapole) $(\ell=5)$. Including this term helps to de-bias estimations of the covariant deceleration parameter. Given that observations suggest axially symmetric anisotropies in the Hubble diagram for $z \lesssim 0.1$ and theory shows that only a subset of multipoles contributes to the signal, we demonstrate that only 12 degrees of freedom are needed for a model-independent description of the local universe. We use an analytical axisymmetric model of the local Universe, with data that matches the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, in order to provide a numerical example of the amplitude of the snap multipoles and to forecast precision.

          On the Response of the Transition Region and the Corona to Rapid Excursions in the Chromosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Spicules are the thin hair/grass-like structures that are prominently observed at the chromospheric solar limb. It is believed that fibrils and rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs; collectively referred to as REs) correspond to on-disk counterparts of type I spicules and type II spicules, respectively. Our investigation focuses on observing the response of these REs alongside similar spectral features in the chromosphere, transition Region (TR), and corona, utilizing space-time plots derived from coordinated observations from Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope/H{\alpha}, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis reveals upflowing REs, promptly reaching temperatures characteristic of the TR and corona, indicating a multi-thermal nature. Similarly, downflowing features exhibiting similar spectral signatures over the disk display plasma motion from the corona to chromospheric temperatures, demonstrating a multithermal nature. In addition to distinct upflows and downflows, we observe sequential upflow and downflow along the same path, depicting a distinctive parabolic trajectory in space-time plots of observations sampling TR and various coronal passbands. Similar to isolated upflows and downflows, these REs also exhibit a multi-thermal nature throughout their trajectory. Furthermore, our results reveal a more intricate motion of the REs in which both upflow and downflow coexist at the same spatial location. On a different note, our analysis, utilizing coordinated IRIS spectral observations, shows spatio-temporal redshifts/downflows in both the TR and chromosphere, suggesting that at least subsets of the strong redshifts/downflows observed in TR temperature spectra result from the return from the upper atmosphere flow of plasma in the form of bundles of spicules or features exhibiting similar spectra.

          Exploring the Hubble tension with a late time Modified Gravity scenario

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a modified cosmological model aimed at addressing the Hubble tension, considering revised dynamics in the late Universe. The model introduces a parameter $c$ affecting the evolution equations, motivated by a modified Poisson algebra inspired by effective Loop Quantum Cosmology. Our analysis includes diverse background datasets such as Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae (with and without the SH0ES calibration), SDSS, DESY6 and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and background information of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find that the model alleviates the Hubble tension in most of the dataset combinations, with cases reducing discrepancies to below $1\sigma$ when including SH0ES. However, the model exhibits minimal improvement in the overall fit when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and Bayesian evidence generally favors the standard model. Theoretical foundations support this approach as a subtle adjustment to low-redshift dynamics, suggesting potential for further exploration into extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. Despite challenges in data fitting, our findings underscore the promise of small-scale modifications in reconciling cosmological tensions.

          Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) can capture dark matter (DM) particles because of their deep gravitational potential and high density. The accumulated DM can affect the properties of NSs. In this work we use a general relativistic two-fluid formalism to solve the structure of DM-admixed NSs (DANSs) and the surrounding spacetime. Specifically, we pay attention to the situation where those DANSs possess DM halos. Due to the gravitational effect of the DM halo, the pulse profile of an X-ray pulsar is changed. Our study finds a universal relation between the peak flux deviation of the pulse profile and $M_{\rm halo}/R_{\rm BM}$, which is the ratio of the DM halo mass, $M_{\rm halo}$, to the baryonic matter (BM) core radius, $R_{\rm BM}$. Our results show that, when $M_{\rm halo}/R_{\rm BM}=0.292$ and the DM particle mass $m_f = 0.3\,$GeV, the maximum deviation of the profile can be larger than 100$\%$, which has implication in X-ray pulsar observation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical light curves of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2023clx in the declining phase, observed with Mephisto. Combining our light curve with the ASAS-SN and ATLAS data in the rising phase, and fitting the composite multi-band light curves with MOSFiT, we estimate black hole mass of AT 2023clx is between $10^{5.67}$--$10^{5.82}~M_{\odot}$. This event may be caused by either a full disruption of a $0.1~M_{\odot}$ star, or a partial disruption of a $0.99~M_{\odot}$ star, depending on the data adopted for the rising phase. Based on those fit results and the non-detection of soft X-ray photons in the first 90 days, we propose that the observed optical radiation is powered by stream-stream collision. We speculate that the soft X-ray photons may gradually emerge in 100--600 days after the optical peak, when the debris is fully circularized into a compact accretion disk.

          Why artificial disruption is not a concern for current cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the most eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the brown dwarf desert, TOI02490b. The brown dwarf desert is the lack of brown dwarfs around main sequence stars within $\sim3$~AU and is thought to be caused by differences in formation mechanisms between a star and planet. To date, only $\sim40$ transiting brown dwarfs have been confirmed. \systemt is a $73.6\pm2.4$ \mjupnospace, $1.00\pm0.02$ \rjup brown dwarf orbiting a $1.004_{-0.022}^{+0.031}$ \msunnospace, $1.105_{-0.012}^{+0.012}$ \rsun sun-like star on a 60.33~d orbit with an eccentricity of $0.77989\pm0.00049$. The discovery was detected within \tess sectors 5 (30 minute cadence) and 32 (2 minute and 20 second cadence). It was then confirmed with 31 radial velocity measurements with \feros by the WINE collaboration and photometric observations with the Next Generation Transit Survey. Stellar modelling of the host star estimates an age of $\sim8$~Gyr, which is supported by estimations from kinematics likely placing the object within the thin disc. However, this is not consistent with model brown dwarf isochrones for the system age suggesting an inflated radius. Only one other transiting brown dwarf with an eccentricity higher than 0.6 is currently known in the brown dwarf desert. Demographic studies of brown dwarfs have suggested such high eccentricity is indicative of stellar formation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 The predictions of hadronic interaction models for cosmic-ray induced air showers contain inherent uncertainties due to limitations of available accelerator data. This leads to differences in shower simulations using each of those models. Many studies have been carried out to track those differences by investigating the shower development or the particle content. In this work, we propose a new approach to search for discrepancies and similarities between the models, via the IACT images resulting from the observations of hadronic air showers. We use simulations of H.E.S.S. as a show-case scenario and, by investigating variables of the camera images, we find potential indicators to highlight differences between models. Number of pixels, Hillas image size, and density showed the largest difference between the models. We then further explore the (in)compatibility of the models by combining all the variables and using Boosted Decision Trees. For protons, a significant difference in the classifier output is found for EPOS-LHC when compared to both QGSJET-II04 and Sybill 2.3d. For helium and nitrogen, QGSJET-II04 is shown to be the outlier case. No significant differences are found for silicon and iron. The distribution of (in)compatibility between the models in the phase space of shower parameters shows that a targeted search can be fruitful, with showers with energies of a few TeV and core closer to the large telescope presenting the largest power of separation.

          Spectra of fermions produced by a time-dependent axion in the radiation- and matter-dominated Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like degrees of freedom generally interact with fermions through a shift symmetric coupling. As a consequence, a time-dependent axion will lead to the generation of fermions by amplifying their vacuum fluctuations. We provide the formulae that allow one to determine the spectra of produced fermions in a generic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe with flat spatial slices. Then we derive simple approximate formulae for the spectra of the produced fermions, as a function of the model parameters, in the specific cases of a radiation- and a matter-dominated Universe, in the regime in which the backreaction of the produced fermions on the axionic background can be neglected.

 - **Abstract**
 The cadmium zinc TElluride Radiation Imager, or TERI, is an instrument to space qualify large-volume $4 \times 4 \times 1.5 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ pixelated CdZnTe (CZT) detector technology. The CZT's anode is composed of a $22 \times 22$ array of pixels while the cathode is planar. TERI will contain four of those crystals with each pixel having an energy range of $40 \ \mathrm{keV}$ up to $3 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ with a resolution of $1.3 \%$ full-width-at-half maximum at $662 \ \mathrm{keV}$. As the detectors are 3D position sensitive, TERI can Compton image events. TERI is fitted with a coded-aperture mask which permits imaging low energy photons in the photoelectric regime. TERI's primary mission is to space-qualify large-volume CZT and measure its degradation due to radiation damage in a space environment. Its secondary mission includes detecting and localizing astrophysical gamma-ray transients. TERI is manifested on DoD's STP-H10 mission for launch to the International Space Station in early 2025.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a computational tool, TweedleDEE, for empirically modeling diffuse gamma-ray background emission in a 1 degree region of the sky, using publicly available gamma-ray data slightly off-axis from this region. This background model allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous localized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. As an application, we use TweedleDEE and the MADHATv2 package to perform the first search for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of the annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.

          The threshold at which a meteor shower becomes hazardous to spacecraft

 - **Abstract**
 Although the risk posed to spacecraft due to meteoroid impacts is dominated by sporadic meteoroids, meteor showers can raise this risk for short periods of time. NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office issues meteor shower forecasts that describe these periods of elevated risk, primarily for the purpose of helping plan extravehicular activities. These forecasts are constructed using a list of meteor shower parameters that has evolved over time to include newly discovered showers and incorporate improved measurements of their characteristics. However, at this point in time, more than a thousand meteor showers have been reported by researchers, many of which are extremely minor, are unconfirmed, or lack measurements of critical parameters. Thus, a comprehensive approach is no longer feasible. In this report we present a quantitative criterion for a potentially hazardous meteor shower and apply this criterion to the list of established meteor showers in order to determine which showers should be included in our annual forecasts.
