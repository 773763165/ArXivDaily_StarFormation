 - **Abstract**
 We present timing solutions spanning nearly two decades for five redback (RB) systems found in globular clusters (GC), created using a novel technique that effectively "isolates" the pulsar. By accurately measuring the time of passage through periastron ($T_0$) at points over the timing baseline, we use a piecewise-continuous, binary model to get local solutions of the orbital variations that we pair with long-term orbital information to remove the orbital timing delays. The isolated pulse times of arrival can then be fit to describe the spin behavior of the millisecond pulsar (MSP). The results of our timing analyses via this method are consistent with those of conventional timing methods for binaries in GCs as demonstrated by analyses of NGC 6440D. We also investigate the observed orbital phase variations for these systems. Quasi-periodic oscillations in Terzan 5P's orbit may be the result of changes to the gravitational-quadruple moment of the companion as prescribed by the Applegate model. We find a striking correlation between the standard deviation of the phase variations as a fraction of a system's orbit ($\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$) and the MSP's spin frequency, as well as a potential correlation between $\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$ and the binary's projected semi-major axis. While long-term RB timing is fraught with large systematics, our work provides a needed alternative for studying systems with significant orbital variations, especially when high-cadence monitoring observations are unavailable.

 - **Abstract**
 Essential information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems can be found in their architectures -- in particular, in stellar obliquity ($\psi$) -- as they serve as a signature of their dynamical evolution. Here, we present ESPRESSO observations of the Rossiter-Mclaughlin (RM) effect of 8 warm gas giants, revealing that independent of the eccentricities, all of them have relatively aligned orbits. Our 5 warm Jupiters -- WASP-106 b, WASP-130 b, TOI-558 b, TOI-4515 b, and TOI-5027 b -- have sky-projected obliquities $|\lambda|\simeq0-10$ deg while the 2 less massive warm Saturns -- K2-139 b and K2-329 A b -- are slightly misaligned having $|\lambda|\simeq15-25$ deg. Furthermore, for K2-139 b, K2-329 A b, and TOI-4515 b, we also measure true 3D obliquities $\psi\simeq15-30$ deg. We also report a non-detection of the RM effect produced by TOI-2179 b. Through hierarchical Bayesian modeling of the true 3D obliquities of hot and warm Jupiters, we find that around single stars, warm Jupiters are statistically more aligned than hot Jupiters. Independent of eccentricities, 95\% of the warm Jupiters have $\psi\lesssim30$ deg with no misaligned planets, while hot Jupiters show an almost isotropic distribution of misaligned systems. This implies that around single stars, warm Jupiters form in primordially aligned protoplanetary disks and subsequently evolve in a more quiescent way than hot Jupiters. Finally, we find that Saturns may have slightly more misaligned orbits than warm Jupiters, but more obliquity measurements are necessary to be conclusive.

          The 3D morphology of open clusters in the solar neighborhood III: Fractal dimension

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the fractal dimension of open clusters using 3D spatial data from Gaia DR3 for 93 open clusters from Pang et al. (2024) and 127 open clusters from Hunt & Reffert (2024) within 500 pc. The box-counting method is adopted to calculate the fractal dimension of each cluster in three regions: the all-member region, $r \leq r_t$ (inside the tidal radius), and $r > r_t$ (outside the tidal radius). In both the Pang and Hunt catalogs, the fractal dimensions are smaller for the regions $r > r_t$ than those for $r \leq r_t$, indicating that the stellar distribution is more clumpy in the cluster outskirts. We classify cluster morphology based on the fractal dimension via the Gaussian Mixture Model. Our study shows that the fractal dimension can efficiently classify clusters in the Pang catalog into two groups. The fractal dimension of the clusters in the Pang catalog declines with age, which is attributed to the development of tidal tails. This is consistent with the expectations from the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We find strong evidence that the fractal dimension increases with cluster mass, which implies that higher-mass clusters are formed hierarchically from the mergers of lower-mass filamentary-type stellar groups. The transition of the fractal dimension for the spatial distribution of open clusters provides a useful tool to trace the Galactic star forming structures, from the location of the Local Bubble within the solar neighborhood to the spiral arms across the Galaxy.

          On the Use of Letters of Recommendation in Astronomy and Astrophysics Graduate Admissions

 - **Abstract**
 Letters of recommendation are a common tool used in graduate admissions. Most admissions systems require three letters for each applicant, burdening both letter writers and admissions committees with a heavy work load that may not be time well-spent. Most applicants do not have three research advisors who can comment meaningfully on research readiness, adding a large number of letters that are not useful. Ideally, letters of recommendation will showcase the students' promise for a research career, but in practice, the letters often do not fulfill this purpose. As a group of early and mid-career faculty who write dozens of letters every year for promising undergraduates, we are concerned and overburdened by the inefficiencies of the current system. In this open letter to the AAS Graduate Admissions Task Force, we offer an alternative to the current use of letters of recommendation: a portfolio submitted by the student, which highlights e.g., a paper, plot, or presentation that represents their past work and readiness for grad school, uploaded to a centralized system used by astronomy and astrophysics PhD programs. While we argue that we could eliminate letters in this new paradigm, it may instead be advisable to limit the number of letters of recommendation to one per applicant.

 - **Abstract**
 With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need to be fast as well as realistic. $\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package that generates simulated astronomical images with exceptional speed - taking approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly well-suited for simulation-based inference (SBI) methods where computational efficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy catalog and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add background noise, sample stars using the Besançon model of the Milky Way, and run $\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on $\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of $\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Bergé et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.

          What do we learn by mapping dark energy to a single value of $w$?

 - **Abstract**
 We examine several dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state parameter, $w(z)$, to determine what information can be derived by fitting the distance modulus in such models to a constant equation of state parameter, $w_*$. We derive $w_*$ as a function of the model parameters for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and for the Dutta-Scherrer approximation to hilltop quintessence models. We find that all of the models examined here can be well-described by a pivot-like redshift, $z_{pivot}$ at which the value of $w(z)$ in the model is equal to $w_*$. However, the exact value of $z_{pivot}$ is a model-dependent quantity; it varies from $z_{pivot} = 0.22-0.25$ for the CPL models to $z_{pivot} = 0.17-0.20$ for the hilltop quintessence models. Hence, for all of the models considered here, a constant-$w$ fit gives the value of $w$ for $z$ near 0.2. However, given the fairly wide variation in $z_{pivot}$ over even this restricted set of models, the information gained by fitting to a constant value of $w$ seems rather limited.

          Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: I. Free-floating MLPs

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Low-mass bodies, such as comets, asteroids, planetesimals, and free-floating planets, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems. These can be modeled as massless particles (MLPs, hereafter). The dynamics of large populations of MLPs, however, has yet received little attention in literature. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of MLP populations in star clusters, and characterize their kinematics and ejection rates. Methods. We present NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS, a modified version of the N-body simulation code NBODY6++GPU, that allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles (MLPs). NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS contains routines specifically directed at the dynamical evolution of low-mass bodies, such as planets. Results. Unlike stars, MLPs do not participate in the mass segregation process. Instead, MLPs mostly follow the gravitational potential of the star cluster, which gradually decreases over time due to stellar ejections and stellar evolution. The dynamical evolution of MLPs is primarily affected by the evolution of the core of the star cluster. This is most apparent in the outer regions for clusters with higher initial densities. High escape rates of MLPs are observed before the core-collapse, after which escape rates remain stable. Denser star clusters undergo a more intense core collapse, but this does not impact the dynamical evolution of MLPs. The speeds of escaping stars are similar to those of escaping MLPs, when disregarding the high-velocity ejections of neutron stars during the first 50 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the framework of General Relativity, it can be shown that gravitational waves are radiated with the merger of massive compact objects. Such gravitational wave signals are observed on Earth on various detectors, in particular, on Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo. During the operation of these detectors, many events have been detected. Those events are associated with the merger of massive compact objects, however, the nature of some merging objects has not yet been reliably established. This work considers non-topological solitons of dark matter -- Q-balls, as candidates for the role of massive compact objects. In this work one of the simplest models of Q-balls, the mechanism of their birth during a phase transition in the early Universe and the mechanism of their mass gaining during the evolution of the Universe, which is based on their mutual merger are considered. As a result, it is analyzed whether Q-balls of dark matter can be candidates for the role of massive compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 < V < 19.5$) alongside the three CALSPEC standards, from 912 Å to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters ($\log g$, $T_{\text{eff}}$, $A_V$, $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic HST/WFC3 UVIS and IR fluxes, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $<0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred SEDs from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

          Resolved and unresolved Galactic gamma-ray sources

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic gamma-ray flux can be described as the sum of two components: the first is due to the emission from an ensemble of discrete sources, and the second is formed by the photons produced by cosmic rays propagating in interstellar space and interacting with gas or radiation fields. The source component is partially resolved as the contributions from individual sources, but a fraction is unresolved and appears as a diffuse flux. Both the unresolved source flux and the interstellar emission flux encode information of great significance for high energy astrophysics, and therefore the separation of these two contributions is very important. In this work we use the distributions in celestial coordinates of the objects contained in the catalogs obtained by the Extensive Air Showers telescopes HAWC and LHAASO to estimate the total luminosity of the Galactic gamma--ray sources and the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse gamma--ray flux. This analysis suggests that while the flux from unresolved sources is measurable and important, the dominant contribution to the diffuse flux over most of the celestial sphere is interstellar emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the validation of multiple planets transiting the nearby ($d = 12.8$ pc) K5V dwarf HD 101581 (GJ 435, TOI-6276, TIC 397362481). The system consists of at least two Earth-size planets whose orbits are near a mutual 4:3 mean-motion resonance, HD 101581 b ($R_{p} = 0.956_{-0.061}^{+0.063}~R_{\oplus}$, $P = 4.47$ days) and HD 101581 c ($R_{p} = 0.990_{-0.070}^{+0.070}~R_{\oplus}$, $P = 6.21$ days). Both planets were discovered in Sectors 63 and 64 TESS observations and statistically validated with supporting ground-based follow-up. We also identify a signal that probably originates from a third transiting planet, TOI-6276.03 ($R_{p} = 0.982_{-0.098}^{+0.114}~R_{\oplus}$, $P = 7.87$ days). These planets are remarkably uniform in size and their orbits are evenly spaced, representing a prime example of the "peas-in-a-pod" architecture seen in other compact multi-planet systems. At $V = 7.77$, HD 101581 is the brightest star known to host multiple transiting planets smaller than $1.5~R_{\oplus}$. HD 101581 is a promising system for atmospheric characterization and comparative planetology of small planets.

 - **Abstract**
 EL CVn-type systems represent a rare evolutionary stage in binary star evolution, providing ideal laboratories for investigating stable mass transfer processes and the formation of extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs). The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has delivered an extensive collection of high-precision time-domain photometric data, which is invaluable for studying EL CVn binaries. In this study, we identified 29 EL CVn systems from the TESS eclipsing binary catalogs (sectors 1-65), 11 of which are newly discovered. These systems consist of smaller, hotter pre-He white dwarfs and A/F main-sequence stars. The orbital periods of these binaries range from 0.64 to 2.5 days. Utilizing TESS light curves, Gaia distances, and multi-band photometric data (e.g., GALEX, 2MASS, WISE, SkyMapper), we modeled the light curves and spectral energy distributions to derive system parameters, including effective temperatures, masses, and radii. These systems were then compared with the white dwarf mass-period relation and the evolutionary tracks of ELM WDs. The comparison reveals that these binaries are consistent with the expected mass-period relation for white dwarfs and align well with the evolutionary tracks on the Teff-logg diagram for ELM WDs. This result suggests that these EL CVn systems likely formed through stable mass transfer processes. We provide a catalog of complete parameters for 29 EL CVn systems identified from the TESS survey. This catalog will serve as an essential resource for studying binary mass transfer, white dwarf formation, and pulsation phenomena in EL CVn-type systems.

          Binary Evolution Pathways to Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators: Insights from HD 133729

 - **Abstract**
 Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) represent a recently identified class of pulsating stars distinguished by their short pulsation periods (22-40 minutes) and asymmetric light curves. This study investigates the evolutionary channel of HD 133729, the first confirmed BLAP in a binary system. Through binary evolution simulations with MESA, we explored various mass ratios and initial orbital periods, finding that a mass ratio of q = 0.30 coupled with non-conservative mass transfer ($\rm \beta$ = 0.15) successfully reproduces the observational characteristics (including luminosity, surface gravity, and effective temperature) of the binary system. Our models not only match the observed pulsational properties but also predict significant helium and nitrogen enhancements on the surface of the main-sequence companion. The system is expected to eventually undergo a common envelope phase leading to a stellar merger. Our findings provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism and evolutionary fate of BLAPs with main-sequence companions, while also placing constraints on the elemental abundances of their binary companions.

 - **Abstract**
 We applied machine learning to the entire data history of ESO's High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument. Our primary goal was to recover the physical properties of the observed objects, with a secondary emphasis on simulating spectra. We systematically investigated the impact of various factors on the accuracy and fidelity of the results, including the use of simulated data, the effect of varying amounts of real training data, network architectures, and learning paradigms. Our approach integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques within autoencoder frameworks. Our methodology leverages an existing simulation model that utilizes a library of existing stellar spectra in which the emerging flux is computed from first principles rooted in physics and a HARPS instrument model to generate simulated spectra comparable to observational data. We trained standard and variational autoencoders on HARPS data to predict spectral parameters and generate spectra. Our models excel at predicting spectral parameters and compressing real spectra, and they achieved a mean prediction error of approximately 50 K for effective temperatures, making them relevant for most astrophysical applications. Furthermore, the models predict metallicity ([M/H]) and surface gravity (log g) with an accuracy of approximately 0.03 dex and 0.04 dex, respectively, underscoring their broad applicability in astrophysical research. The models' computational efficiency, with processing times of 779.6 ms on CPU and 3.97 ms on GPU, makes them valuable for high-throughput applications like massive spectroscopic surveys and large archival studies. By achieving accuracy comparable to classical methods with significantly reduced computation time, our methodology enhances the scope and efficiency of spectroscopic analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on two linear interaction models between dark matter and dark energy, which are proposed as key factors in explaining cosmic history, specifically the latetime accelerating expansion of the universe. Both models are constrained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) using different sets of observational data. The analysis was composed using the Pantheon data set, consisting of 1048 points of SNIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon analysis and the Observed Hubble Parameter (OHD) data set using Baryon acoustic Oscillation (BAO), consisting of 57 data points using distance and expansion rate measurement. Both models showed promising results with the OHD data (BAO), with a interaction that results in a higher dark matter content of 56% and 44%, and a Hubble parameter of 65.7+-3km/ s/Mpc and 65.8+-3km/ s/Mpc for the interaction dependent on dark matter and dark energy respectively. The pantheon data set however predicted a reverse interaction for both models which does not follow initial assumptions that were made. The pantheon data measured a dark matter content of 18% and 20% with a Hubble parameter of 72.1 +- 0.003km/ s/Mpc and 72.3 +- 0.004km /s/Mpc. The constrained results are used to revisit the coincidence problem and other problems in standard cosmology. The analysis provided a discrepancy between the different data sets with one having a large error margin.

          Towards Galactic Archaeology with Inferred Ages of Giant Stars From Gaia Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of Gaia, the accurate determination of stellar ages is transforming Galactic archaeology. We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring stellar ages from Gaia's RVS spectra and the BP/RP (XP) spectrophotometric data, specifically for red giant branch and high-mass red clump stars. We successfully train two machine learning models, dubbed SIDRA: Stellar age Inference Derived from Gaia spectRA to predict the age. The SIDRA-RVS model uses the RVS spectra and SIDRA-XP the stellar parameters obtained from the XP spectra by Fallows and Sanders 2024. Both models use BINGO, an APOGEE-derived stellar age from Ciuca et al. 2021 as the training data. SIDRA-RVS estimates ages of stars whose age is around $\tau_\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr with a standard deviation of residuals of $\sim$ 0.12 dex in the unseen test dataset, while SIDRA-XP achieves higher precision with residuals $\sim$ 0.064 dex for stars around $\tau_\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr. Since SIDRA-XP outperforms SIDRA-RVS, we apply SIDRA-XP to analyse the ages for 2,218,154 stars. This allowed us to map the chronological and chemical properties of Galactic disc stars, revealing distinct features such as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger and a potential gas-rich interaction event linked to the first infall of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This study demonstrates that machine learning techniques applied to Gaia's spectra can provide valuable age information, particularly for giant stars, thereby enhancing our understanding of the Milky Way's formation and evolution.

          A comprehensive numerical study on four categories of holographic dark energy models

 - **Abstract**
 Holographic dark energy (HDE), which arises from a theoretical attempt of applying the holographic principle (HP) to the dark energy (DE) problem, has attracted significant attention over the past two decades. We perform a most comprehensive numerical study on HDE models that can be classified into four categories: 1) HDE models with other characteristic length scale, 2) HDE models with extended Hubble scale, 3) HDE models with dark sector interaction, 4) HDE models with modified black hole entropy. For theoretical models, we select seven representative models, including the original HDE (OHDE) model, Ricci HDE (RDE) model, generalized Ricci HDE (GRDE) model, interacting HDE (IHDE1 and IHDE2) models, Tsallis HDE (THDE) model, and Barrow HDE (BHDE) model. For cosmological data, we use the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors data from the Planck 2018, and the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus compilation. Using $\chi^2$ statistic and Bayesian evidence, we compare these HDE models with current observational data. It is found that: 1) The $\Lambda$CDM remains the most competitive model, while the RDE model is ruled out. 2) HDE models with dark sector interaction perform the worst across the four categories, indicating that the interaction term is not favored under the framework of HDE. 3) The other three categories show comparable performance. The OHDE model performs better in the BAO+CMB dataset, and the HDE models with modified black hole entropy perform better in the BAO+CMB+SN dataset. 4) HDE models with the future event horizon exhibit significant discrepancies in parameter space across datasets. The BAO+CMB dataset favors a phantom-like HDE, whereas the BAO+CMB+SN leads to an equation of state (EoS) much closer to the cosmological constant.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).

 - **Abstract**
 Many of the blazars observed by Fermi actually have the peak of their time-averaged gamma-ray emission outside the $\sim$ GeV Fermi energy range, at $\sim$ MeV energies. The detailed shape of the emission spectrum around the $\sim$ MeV peak places important constraints on acceleration and radiation mechanisms in the blazar jet and may not be the simple broken power law obtained by extrapolating from the observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray spectra. In particular, state-of-the-art simulations of particle acceleration by shocks show that a significant fraction (possibly up to $\approx 90\%$) of the available energy may go into bulk, quasi-thermal heating of the plasma crossing the shock rather than producing a non-thermal power law tail. Other ``gentler" but possibly more pervasive acceleration mechanisms such as shear acceleration at the jet boundary may result in a further build-up of the low-energy ($\gamma \lesssim 10^{2}$) electron/positron population in the jet. As already discussed for the case of gamma-ray bursts, the presence of a low-energy, Maxwellian-like ``bump'' in the jet particle energy distribution can strongly affect the spectrum of the emitted radiation, e.g., producing an excess over the emission expected from a power-law extrapolation of a blazar's GeV-TeV spectrum. We explore the potential detectability of the spectral component ascribable to a hot, quasi-thermal population of electrons in the high-energy emission of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ). We show that for typical FSRQ physical parameters, the expected spectral signature is located at $\sim$ MeV energies. For the brightest Fermi FSRQ sources, the presence of such a component will be constrained by the upcoming MeV Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) satellite.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are the bridge between low-mass stars and giant planets. One way of shedding light on their dominant formation mechanism is to study them at the earliest stages of their evolution, when they are deeply embedded in their parental clouds. Several works have identified pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates using different observational approaches. The aim of this work is to create a database with all the objects classified as very young substellar candidates in the litearature in order to study them in an homogeneous way. We have gathered all the information about very young substellar candidates available in the literature until 2020. We have retrieved their published photometry from the optical to the centimeter regime, and we have written our own codes to derive their bolometric temperatures and luminosities, and their internal luminosities. We have also populated the database with other parameters extracted from the literature, like e.g. the envelope masses, their detection in some molecular species, and presence of outflows. The result of our search is the SUCANES database, containing 174 objects classified as potential very young substellar candidates in the literature. We present an analysis of the main properties of the retrieved objects. Since we have updated the distances to several star forming regions, this has allowed us to reject some candidates based on their internal luminosities. We have also discussed the derived physical parameters and envelope masses for the best substellar candidates isolated in SUCANES. As an example of a scientific exploitation of this database, we present a feasibility study for the detection of radiojets with upcoming facilities: the ngVLA and the SKA interferometers. The SUCANES database is accessible through a Graphical User Interface and it is open to any potential user.

 - **Abstract**
 The young active flare star AU~Mic is the planet host star with the highest flare rate from TESS data. Therefore, it represents an ideal target for dedicated ground-based monitoring campaigns with the aim to characterize its numerous flares spectroscopically. We performed such spectroscopic monitoring with the ESO1.52m telescope of the PLATOSpec consortium. In more than 190 hours of observations, we find 24 flares suitable for detailed analysis. We compute their parameters (duration, peak flux, energy) in eight chromospheric lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, H$\delta$, Na I D1&D2, He I D3, He I 6678) and investigate their relationships. Furthermore, we obtained simultaneous photometric observations and low-resolution spectroscopy for part of the spectroscopic runs. We detect one flare in the g'-band photometry which is associated with a spectroscopic flare. Additionally, an extreme flare event occurred on 2023-09-16 of which only a time around its possible peak was observed, during which chromospheric line fluxes were raised by up to a factor of three compared to the following night. The estimated energy of this event is around $10^{33}$ erg in H$\alpha$ alone, i.e. a rare chromospheric line superflare.

 - **Abstract**
 Stasis is a unique cosmological phenomenon in which the abundances of different energy components in the universe (such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy) each remain fixed even though they scale differently under cosmological expansion. Moreover, extended epochs exhibiting stasis are generally cosmological attractors in many BSM settings and thus arise naturally and without fine-tuning. To date, stasis has been found within a number of very different BSM cosmologies. In some cases, stasis emerges from theories that contain large towers of decaying states (such as theories in extra dimensions or string theory). By contrast, in other cases, no towers of states are needed, and stasis instead emerges due to thermal effects involving particle annihilation rather than decay. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the energy flows in all of these theories during stasis, and find that these theories all share a common energy-flow structure which in some sense lies between particle decay and particle annihilation. This structure has been hidden until now but ultimately lies at the root of the stasis phenomenon, with all of the previous stases appearing as different manifestations of this common underlying structure. This insight not only allows us to understand the emergence of stasis in each of these different scenarios, but also provides an important guide for the potential future discovery of stasis in additional cosmological systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Sun-like stars are well represented in the solar neighbourhood but are currently under-utilised, with many studies of chemical and kinematic evolution focusing on red giants (which can be observed further away) or turn-off stars (which have well measured ages). Recent surveys (e.g. GALAH) provide spectra for large numbers of nearby Sun-like stars, which provides an opportunity to apply our newly developed method for measuring metallicities, temperatures, and surface gravities - the EPIC algorithm - which yields improved ages via isochrone fitting. We test this on moving groups, by applying it to the large GALAH DR3 sample. This defines a sample of 72,288 solar analogue targets for which the stellar parameter measurements are most precise and reliable. These stars are used to estimate, and test the accuracy and precision of, age measurements derived with the SAMD isochrone fitting algorithm. Using these ages, we recover the age-metallicity relationships for nearby (<= 1 kpc) moving groups, traced by solar analogues, and analyse them with respect to the stellar kinematics. In particular, we found that the age-metallicity relationships of all moving groups follows a particular trend of young (age < 6 Gyr) stars having constant metallicity and older (age >= 6 Gyr) stars decreasing in metallicity with increasing age. The Hercules stream carries the highest fraction of metal-rich young stars (~ 0.1 dex) in our sample, which is consistent with a migrating population of stars from the inner Galaxy, and we discuss the possible causes of this migration in the context of our results.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundances of elements such as barium and the lanthanides are essential to understand the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the early Universe as well as the contribution of different neutron capture processes (for example slow versus rapid) at different epochs. The Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) project aims to provide a homogeneous analysis of a sample of metal-poor stars ( [Fe/H]\<-1.5) to improve our understanding of the nucleosynthesis of neutron capture elements, in particular the r-process elements, in the early Galaxy. Our data consist of a sample of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio UVES spectra. The chemical abundances were derived through spectrum synthesis, using the same model atmospheres and stellar parameters as derived in the first paper of the CERES series. We measured chemical abundances or upper limits of seven heavy neutron capture elements (Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) for a sample of 52 metal-poor giant stars. We estimated through the mean shift clustering algorithm that at Ba/H =-2.4 and Fe/H =-2.4 a variation in the trend of X/Ba with X=La,Nd,Sm,Eu, versus Ba/H occurs. This result suggests that, for Ba/H $\<$$-2.4$, Ba nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way halo is primarily due to the $r$-process, while for Ba/H \<-2.4 the effect of the s-process contribution begins to be visible. In our sample, stars with Ba/Eu compatible with a Solar System pure r-process value (hereafter, r-pure) do not show any particular trend compared to other stars, suggesting r-pure stars may form in similar environments to stars with less pure r-process enrichments. Homogeneous investigations of high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra are crucial for studying the heavy elements formation, as they provide abundances that can be used to test nucleosynthesis models as well as Galactic chemical evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent research is revealing data-sonification as a promising complementary approach to vision, benefiting both data perception and interpretation. We present herakoi, a novel open-source software that uses machine learning to allow real-time image sonification, with a focus on astronomical data. By tracking hand movements via a webcam and mapping them to image coordinates, herakoi translates visual properties into sound, enabling users to "hear" images. Its swift responsiveness allows users to access information in astronomical images with short training, demonstrating high reliability and effectiveness. The software has shown promise in educational and outreach settings, making complex astronomical concepts more engaging and accessible to diverse audiences, including blind and visually impaired individuals. We also discuss future developments, such as the integration of large language and vision models to create a more interactive experience in interpreting astronomical data.

          Quantifying Roche Lobe Overflow in the Formation of Merging Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate a new methodology to model Roche lobe overflow (RLO) systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously-universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow ( f = 1.1) to exhibit entirely conservative unstable mass transfer (MT), with tidal stream density and deflected angle comparable to predictions. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating non-conservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The non-conservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semi-detached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize the parameter space of stability for the L1 flow. We also conducted a piecewise evolution of M33 X-7 across nearly the entirety of RLO phase from onset to runaway unstable MT. We present the first model of the efficiency of MT and its associated angular momentum across overfilling factor parameter space. We also present novel relations for binary separation, mass ratio, L1 mass transfer rate, and Roche timescale as they vary with respect to the overfilling factor. These provide constraints on the threshold for the onset of unstable MT which ultimately led in our system to exponentially faster MT evolution. Collectively these parameter constraints, relations, and explorations probe RLO dynamics in HMXBs and their role and distribution as progenitors of binary black holes and common envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high resolution images of the radio source 3C 84 at 43 GHz, from 121 observations conducted by the BEAM-ME monitoring program between 2010 and 2023. Imaging was performed using the recent forward modeling imaging method eht-imaging, which achieved a resolution of 80 $\mu$as, a factor of $\sim$2-3 better than traditional imaging methods such as CLEAN. The sequence of images depicts the growth and expansion of the parsec-scale relativistic jet in 3C 84, clearly resolving a complex internal structure, showing bending in the jet, and changes in its launching direction and expansion speed. We report measurements of the expansion speed in time, which show that the jet undergoes three regimes, marked by the beginning and ending of a hot spot frustration phase. The images' high resolution allows us also to measure the projected launching direction as a function of time, finding an irregular variation pattern. Our results confirm previous studies of the morphological transition underwent by 3C 84 and provide quantitative measurements of the jet's kinematic properties over a decade time-scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended main-sequence stars that are dim in the ultraviolet passbands of Hubble Space Telescope (UV-dim stars) are found in several young and intermediate-age Magellanic Cloud star clusters. The obscuring of the dust in the discs of stars expelled due to fast rotation have been suggested to be responsible for the appearance of UV-dim stars, and play an important role in the formation of extended main-sequences. In this paper, we report a population of A- and F-type stars who show H{\alpha} emission features in their spectra in a young (~ 340 Myr-old) Galactic neighboring star cluster NGC 3532. By fitting the observed absorption profiles, we found that most H{\alpha} emitters are fast rotating stars, indicating that they form decretion discs by fast rotation like Be stars. As A- and F-type stars dominate the extended main-sequence turn-off regions of intermediate-age clusters, their appearance provides observational evidence to support the dust extinction scenario for these clusters, and might be the counterparts of UV-dim stars that are detected in remote Magellanic Cloud star clusters like NGC 1783.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules serve as indicators of molecular diversity. Their detection on comets, planets, and moons has prompted inquiries into their origins, particularly the conditions conducive to their formation. One hypothesis suggests that the UV irradiation of icy grains in the protosolar nebula generates significant molecular complexity, a hypothesis supported by experiments on methanol ice irradiation. We investigated the irradiation of methanol ice particles as they migrate through the protosolar nebula. Our objective is to ascertain whether the encountered conditions facilitate the formation of complex organics molecules, and we leverage experimental data in our analysis. We developed a two-dimensional model that describes the transport of pebbles during the evolution of the protosolar nebula, employing a Lagrangian scheme. This model computes the interstellar UV flux received by the particles along their paths, which we compared with experimental values. On average, particles ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers in size, released at a local temperature of 20 K, undergo adequate irradiation to attain the same molecular diversity as methanol ice during the experiments within timescales of 25 kyr of protosolar nebula evolution. In contrast, 1 cm sized particles require 911 kyr of irradiation to reach similar molecular diversity, making comparable molecular complexity unlikely. Similarly, particles ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers in size, released at a local temperature of 80 K, receive sufficient irradiation after 141 and 359 kyr. The particles readily receive the irradiation dose necessary to generate the molecular diversity observed in the experiments within the outer regions of the disk. Our model, combined with future irradiation experiments, can provide additional insights into the specific regions where the building blocks of planets form.

 We present the first widefield extragalactic continuum catalogue with the MeerKAT S-band (2.5 GHz), of the radio-selected DEEP2 field. The combined image over the S1 (1.96 - 2.84 GHz) and S4 (2.62 - 3.50 GHz) sub-bands has an angular resolution of 6.8''$\times$3.6'' (4.0''$\times$2.4'') at a robust weighting of $R = 0.3$ ($R=-0.5$) and a sensitivity of 4.7 (7.5) $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with an on-source integration time of 70 minutes and a minimum of 52 of the 64 antennas, for respective observations. We present the differential source counts for this field, as well as a morphological comparison of resolved sources between S-band and archival MeerKAT L-band images. We find consistent source counts with the literature and provide spectral indices fitted over a combined frequency range of 1.8 GHz. These observations provide an important first demonstration of the capabilities of MeerKAT S-band imaging with relatively short integration times, as well as a comparison with existing S-band surveys, highlighting the rich scientific potential with future MeerKAT S-band surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical monitoring of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1858.6-0814 during its 2018-2020 outburst and subsequent quiescence. We find that there was strong optical variability present throughout the entire outburst period covered by our monitoring, while the average flux remained steady. The optical spectral energy distribution is blue on most dates, consistent with emission from an accretion disc, interspersed by occasional red flares, likely due to optically thin synchrotron emission. We find that the fractional rms variability has comparable amplitudes in the radio and optical bands. This implies that the long-term variability is likely to be due to accretion changes, seen at optical wavelengths, that propagate into the jet, seen at radio frequencies. We find that the optical flux varies asymmetrically about the orbital period peaking at phase ~0.7, with a modulation amplitude that is the same across all optical wavebands suggesting that reprocessing off of the disc, companion star and ablated material is driving the phase dependence. The evidence of ablation found in X-ray binaries is vital in understanding the long term evolution of neutron star X-ray binaries and how they evolve into (potentially isolated) millisecond pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature are compared to data from recent cosmological surveys. We use type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ sample and the recent 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data release along with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to constrain the modified model's parameters and to compare its fit quality to the Flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference of the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all dataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of matching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and late-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with respect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.

 We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\mu$m) spectra of the SN 2003fg-like/"super-Chandrasekhar" type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN 2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d relative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our sample have asymmetric, or "tilted", [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m profiles. We quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at peak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to deflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while the profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m features are widely varied between 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same SN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of the asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible that 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner regions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such as double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR observation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two explosion scenarios are encouraged.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of water molecules within the atmosphere of Jupiter, first by the Galileo Atmospheric Probe, and later by the Juno spacecraft, has given rise to the question of whether those molecules are sourced endogenously or exogenously. One hypothesis is that the ablation of meteoroids deposited the necessary oxygen into the atmosphere, which was subsequently used in chemical processes to form water. This paper aims to evaluate this hypothesis by simulating the ablation of carbonaceous objects entering the planet's atmosphere to determine the possible rates of oxygen delivery and the most likely altitude for such delivery within the Jovian atmosphere. We estimate that carbonaceous meteoroids have the potential to deliver $\sim 1.4 \times 10^7 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over a billion years. We further estimate that most of the ablation is expected to occur in the stratosphere, or 450-400 km above the region of 1 bar of atmospheric pressure. In comparison, Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) are estimated to deliver roughly $\sim 10^2 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over the same period.

 - **Abstract**
 As there is a long-standing controversy over the time delay between the two images of the gravitationally lensed quasar FBQ 0951+2635, we combined early and new optical light curves to robustly measure a delay of 13.5 +/- 1.6 d (1sigma interval). The new optical records covering the last 17 yr were also used to trace the long-timescale evolution of the microlensing variability. Additionally, the new time delay interval and a relatively rich set of further observational constraints allowed us to discuss the mass structure of the main lensing galaxy at redshift 0.26. This lens system is of particular interest because the external shear from secondary gravitational deflectors is relatively low, but the external convergence is one of the highest known. When modelling the galaxy as a singular power-law ellipsoid without hypotheses/priors on the power-law index, ellipticity and position angle, we demonstrated that its mass profile is close to isothermal, and there is good alignment between mass and near-IR light. We also recovered the true mass scale of the galaxy. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a constant mass-to-light ratio model also worked acceptably well.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 through high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve the star formation and feedback processes, avoiding the reliance on various assumed models as in previous works. We probe the effects of different stellar feedback mechanisms, the gas return from star-forming clouds and initial gas disc mass on the starburst and launch of outflow. Our simulations can generate a starburst that lasts 20-30 Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. However, the total stellar mass formed in the starburst in our simulations often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in two stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form numerous small bubbles, merging into a super bubble foam composed of low-density warm/hot gas and high-density cool filaments. After approximately 10 Myr of SN energy injection, the super bubble breakout the disc, marking the second stage, which takes 10-15 Myr to develop a multiphase, kpc-scale outflow. Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the turbulent ISM can survive from the feedback associated to the starburst, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched to hundreds pc in length due to interaction with the hot wind. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed outflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower, and its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $50\%-60\%$. Warm and hot gas are $20\%-30\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of the outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow properties. The initial mass of gas disc has a moderate effect, while stellar wind and radiation feedback have minor effect. To address the shortcomings in our results, enhanced SN feedback effect, due to clustered SNe, is likely necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) predicted by pre-big-bang (PBB) cosmology using data from the first three observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. PBB cosmology proposes an alternative to cosmic inflation where the Universe evolves from a weak-coupling, low-curvature state to the hot Big Bang through a high-curvature bounce phase, predicting a distinctive SGWB spectrum. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the cross-correlation data to constrain the model parameters characterizing the PBB spectrum. We find no evidence for a PBB-induced SGWB, with a Bayes factor of $0.03$ between the PBB and noise-only model, strongly favoring the noise-only hypothesis. Our analysis establishes a lower bound $\beta \gtrsim -0.19$ at $95\%$ confidence level, which is compatible with the theoretical requirement $\beta \geq 0$ for a smooth bounce transition. While we do not detect a signal, our constraints remain consistent with the basic theoretical framework of PBB cosmology, demonstrating the potential of gravitational-wave observations to test early Universe theories.

          SIRI-2 Detection of the Gamma-ray Burst 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 SIRI-2 is a collection of Strontium Iodide gamma-ray detectors sensitive at approximately 400 keV to 10 MeV, launched on the Department of Defense's STPSat-6 to geosynchronous orbit. SIRI-2 detected the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A and, unlike most GRB detectors, was not saturated and did not require any pulse pile-up corrections. The energetics of this burst as measured by SIRI-2 are consistent with those found by other instruments, and the Band function fits to the spectra are consistent with that from the unsaturated Insight and GECAM instruments, and similar to corrected spectra from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, but softer than those found by Konus-Wind when that instrument was saturated. The total fluence measured with SIRI-2 was measured to be 0.140 +/- 0.002 erg cm-2, lower than other instruments, likely due to the increasing background of SIRI-2 forcing the calculation to use a smaller time interval. An extrapolation of the distributions of fluences from GRBs to the fluence of 221009A measured with SIRI-2 indicates bursts brighter than this one should occur about once every 4,000 years.

 - **Abstract**
 A measurement of the redshift drift constitutes a model-independent probe of fundamental cosmology. Several approaches are being considered to make the necessary observations, using (i) the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), (ii) the Cosmic Accelerometer, and (iii) the differential redshift drift methodology. Our focus in this {\it Letter} is to assess how these upcoming measurements may be used to compare the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM with those of the alternative Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe, and several other models, including modified gravity scenarios. The ELT should be able to distinguish between $R_{\rm h}=ct$ and the other models at better than $3\sigma$ for $z\gtrsim 3.6$ after 20 years of monitoring, while the Cosmic Accelerometer may be able to achieve the same result with sources at $z\gtrsim 2.6$ after only 10 years.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is an upcoming radio interferometric telescope designed to constrain dark energy through the 21cm intensity mapping of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Instrumental systematics must be controlled and carefully characterized to measure the 21cm power spectrum with fidelity and achieve high-precision constraints on the cosmological parameters. The chromaticity of the primary beam is one such complicated systematic, which can leak the power of spectrally smooth foregrounds beyond the ideal horizon limits due to the complex spatial and spectral structures of the sidelobes and the mainlobe. This paper studies the chromaticity of the HIRAX Stokes I primary beam and its effects on accurate measurements of the 21cm power spectrum. To investigate the effect of chromaticity in the 21cm power spectrum, we present a physically motivated beam modeling technique, which uses a flexible basis derived from traditional optics that can account for higher-order radial and azimuthal structures in the primary beam. We investigate the impact of imperfect knowledge of the mainlobe and sidelobes chromaticity in the power spectrum space by subtracting a simple foreground model in simulated snapshot visibilities to recover the H$\textsc{i}$ power spectrum. Additionally, we find that modeling up to the octupolar azimuthal order feature (fourth-order angular variation) in the primary beam is sufficient to reduce the leakage outside the wedge with minimal bias.

          A new and flexible design method for Symmetric Quadrature Hybrid Couplers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

 - **Abstract**
 Quadrature Hybrid Couplers (QHDC) are critical components in RF, mm-wave, and sub-mm wave astronomical instrumentation, where wideband performance with minimal passband ripple is essential. Traditional designs have been limited to 5-sections at most due to computational limitations. In this work, we introduce a new analytical technique to design couplers with larger sections and improved performance. We do this by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based solver. By defining a likelihood function based on S-parameter equations and incorporating physical priors, we derive optimized impedance values that enhance bandwidth beyond what is reported in the literature. Our flexible pipeline allows efficient tuning of the coupler design. The results demonstrate fractional bandwidths that reach 1.0 for a 9-section coupler, substantially outperforming previous designs. Statistical analysis and convergence tests confirm the robustness of our approach.

          A universal and physically motivated threshold for Hessian-based cosmic web identification: V-Web case

 - **Abstract**
 The study of large-scale structure can benefit from accurate and robust identification of the cosmic web. Having such classification can facilitate a more complete extraction of cosmological information encoded therein. Classification methods like T-web and V-web, based on the Hessian matrix, are widely used to signal-out voids, sheets, filaments, and knots. However, these techniques depend on a threshold parameter which value is chosen without physical justification, usually relying on a user visual impression, thus limiting the universality of results. In this paper we focus on the V-web method. Our aim is to find a physical motivation for deriving an universal threshold that can be applied across different cosmic scales and epochs. V-web classify the large-scale structure using the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor. Using a set of gravity-only simulations we introduce a normalization that incorporates the standard deviation of the velocity divergence field, isolating the beyond Gaussian evolution of cosmic web elements. In the Zeldovich's approximation, the probability presence of each cosmic web element remains constant at a threshold equal to 0. For the first time, we reveal that this behavior also holds in the non-linear regime for a normalized positive 'constant volume threshold' that depends on both the redshift and the applied smoothing scale. The conservation of volume fractions is valid for the studied redshifts between 0 and 2, regardless of cosmic variance, and is most precise for intermediate smoothing scales around 3 Mpc/h. The properties of the cosmic web derived using this approach in the V-web align with expectations from other methods, including visual impressions. We provide a general fit formula to compute the constant volume threshold for any standard cosmological simulation, regardless of its specific properties.

          A glitch in gravity: cosmic Lorentz-violation from fiery Big Bang to glacial heat death

 - **Abstract**
 One regime where we might see departures from general relativity is at the largest accessible scales, with a natural choice in cosmology being the cosmological horizon (or Hubble) scale. We investigate a single-parameter extension to the standard cosmological model with a different strength of gravity above and below this scale -- a "cosmic glitch" in gravity. Cosmic microwave background observations, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (including the recent DESI Y1) favour weaker superhorizon gravity, at nearly a percent (or 2$\sigma$ level), easing both the Hubble and clustering tensions with other cosmological data. This compounds evidence for an even stronger glitch during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (from helium abundance observations), suggesting that symmetries of general relativity are maximally violated at the Big Bang, but gradually recovered as we approach the present-day cosmological de Sitter scale, associated with the observed dark energy.
